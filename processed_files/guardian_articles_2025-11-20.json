It will undo youLucy ManganThu 20 Nov 2025 16.50 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 17.03 ESTShareThe travelling salesman used to be a stock figure – a centrepiece for jokes about man’s priapism, the untameable wanderlust of the peen once free of its domestic shackles. The Death of Bunny Munro, adapted from Nick Cave’s 2009 book of the same name by Pete Jackson and keeping all its bleak tenderness and unforgiving brutality, gives us the tragedy that lies the other side of any comic character worth its salt.Cosmetics salesman Bunny (Matt Smith, a brilliant and still underrated actor, plus the best Doctor of modern times, please send an SAE for my monograph on this subject) is out on the road, sampling another young lady’s wares, when we meet him. His wife, Libby (Sarah Greene, perfectly cast as a fierce, loving woman broken by depression and her husband’s choices) calls him. He dismisses her and returns to his sampling. When he returns the next day he finds that she has killed herself. They have a nine-year-old son, Bunny Jr, played by Rafael Mathé, who gives an absolutely wonderful, heartbreaking performance, treading the thinnest of lines between knowing everything and nothing about his father and about his own likely future. At first, Bunny Sr tries to palm him off on Libby’s mother (Lindsay Duncan), who, in a harrowing post-funeral scene, refuses. But when social services arrive to take the boy into care, Bunny’s pride or conscience is pricked. The pair light out of the window and head off on a road trip along the south coast, and a father-son bonding experience. Traditionally, these are good things. But Cave is not a traditional writer and this is not a traditional tale.When Bunny can charm his customers into buying his unguents and his promises, life is good. A bit of money and a lot of sex are all he needs to get by. Junior watches in nervous awe. If nothing else, his father’s antics are a distraction for the motherless boy from his grief. “She must have wanted to die,” Junior says to one of the many strangers he meets while waiting for his father to finish – uh – charming a customer. “That’s why it’s not so sad.” And if the child is managing with sunglasses instead of the eye cream he needs for his chronic blepharitis, well, that’s all part of the adventure.View image in fullscreenA fierce, loving woman broken by depression … Sarah Greene with Matt Smith in The Death of Bunny Munro.Photograph: Benedict Stenning/Sky UK, Clerkenwell FilmsGradually, of course, things fall apart. Bunny’s centre cannot hold. His simple but unassuageable appetites lead him further and further into trouble, and guilt too relentlessly tries to catch up with him. Bunny’s journey is interspersed with flashbacks to his youth, watching his own father – another Bunny, lest the egotistic circle be broken – neglect him in favour of finding women (“Fucking cool as cool,” Sr insists) and to moments of happiness with Libby before her depression, surely unrelated to her longing for him to stay faithful, set in. Junior has comforting visions of his mother, though she disappears when he decides to mimic his father cheering a stripper’s show in the pub – a moment that almost undid me.The Death of Bunny Munro is only six episodes long, and their run times vary between around 30 and 50 minutes. This is generally a mark of quality and confidence and Bunny Munro is a perfect example of why – there is no padding here, no eking out, nor desperate compressions. Each act of the story is given the time it needs, and should stand as an example to others who are tempted to bloat or stymie their narratives instead of exploiting the great advantage modern broadcasting has given creators by uncuffing them from rigid time frames and forced ad breaks.As a study in masculinity, in men handing on misery to men, deepening like a south coastal shelf as Bunny and son drive towards doom, it is as timely – for all, alas, that the book was written over a decade ago – as it is illuminating. The script and Smith do a pitch-perfect job of conveying the latent violence lying just underneath his and his cohorts interactions with women and how little the latter need to do to spark it. And they don’t ask for sympathy, only understanding, as they show Bunny as trapped as any rabbit in a snare by the lack of substance beneath his style and by the lessons he learned from his father before he was old enough to pick and choose between them. Maybe infidelity is in the genes but nurture is supposed to teach you to work against your flaws, not with them. Which way Junior – a sensitive, clever boy with an interest in the wider world that might save him – will go now that there is no mother to shelter him pulls you on through the darkening tale. The only hope you can cling to is that it’s set at a time before smartphones, otherwise the question would surely be settled before they’ve even cleared the window.The Death of Bunny Munro aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK and Binge in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMatt SmithDramaNick CavereviewsShareReuse this content"

Its handling of the assisted dying bill on Friday of last week, continuing this week, is all but unconstitutional. A bill passed by the House of Commons after years of public debate is beingblocked by a small group of peersunder the pretence of scrutiny. Their purpose is to kill the bill by filibuster and impose their religious or moral views on the free will of others. They want to deny Britons a freedom now common in many liberal nations across the western world.When the bill came to the Lords, just seven peers were responsible for 617 of 1,034 amendments now attached to it. They included a requirement that no one should be helped to die if they have been abroad in the previous year, or unless five doctors have assessed the application, or if a doctor has discussed dying with the patient (a so-called gag clause). Many amendments flatly contradict ones considered and rejected by the Commons. They pay no deference to thesupport for the billof what is now a clear majority of public opinion. The intention is not to scrutinise the bill, but to kill it by exceeding the four days allotted to it. Since it is a private member’s bill, the government has declined to help. It should now adopt it and force it through.Meanwhile, the issue remains high profile. A woman wasquestioned by the policeand investigated for 10 months, before the CPS declined to prosecute her, all for accompanying her husband, terminally ill and in agony, to the Dignitas centre in more civilised Switzerland. For her dedication and compassion, the British state – aided by a group of peers – treats her like a suspected criminal. As for doctors who, for decades, have privately helped people through this most painful of family crises, they tell me they dare not do so, for fear also of police intervention in what some peers regard as conspiracy to murder.This should take us back to the conservative elements in the Lords that attempted to oppose reforming governments of the 1830s and the 1910s. As for social reform, a Labour government under Harold Wilson in the 1960s found the courage and time topartly decriminalise homosexualityin England and Wales,permit abortion,reform the divorce lawsandend state censorship of the theatre, most of it driven by Roy Jenkins in his brief two years at the Home Office. Today’s Labour party seems far removed from that era of what was dubbed “civilising Britain”.The House of Lords is the only governing assembly outside the Muslim worldin which clergy can sit ex officio. It must be one of the few in which membership can be bought and is therefore blatantly corrupt. It defends its existence on the grounds that a few of its number are bright and, as Peter Hennessy puts it,“good chaps”. This is undeniable, but hardly the point. The Lords’ composition is indefensible and its powers anti-democratic.Second chambers are a good idea. If suitably composed, they can contribute to public debate, advise on legislation and serve on parliamentary committees and consultative bodies. They should not be able, as in this case, to overturn clear decisions reached by a democratic chamber. Least of all should they be free to impose their own moral views on the lives of British citizens.Of course safeguards must be in place to avoid abuse under any programme of reform. In the case of assisted dying, they can be studied in any of the countries that have already gone down this route to some extent. This includes such European states as Germany, Spain and the Netherlands as well as Canada, most of Australia and New Zealand and several US states. In none of them is suspicious or enforced suicide a serious issue, nothing calling for the often absurd “safeguards” raised in theHouse of Lords. State regulation should be to dignify and respect the freedom of individual choice, not deny it. The decision to end your own life must be the most personal and intimate of acts, shared above all with your loved ones. For peers to seek to make it a legislative and bureaucratic bunfight is obscene.In an alarming number of areas of social reform – justice, prisons, narcotics – Britain now trails the liberal consensus among western nations. The government should not funk the issue or leave it to private members. The same applies in the case of political institutions. It took Westminster until 1999 to initiate anend to the hereditary rightto sit in its parliament, a right still awaiting its termination. Meanwhile, the upper house remains in essence a retirement home for senior politicians and party donors. As such, it has predictably rendered itself immune to change by generations of ageing public figures. Its membership has soared tomore than 820.In 2016, the House of Lords’ constitution unit boldly declared the house would reform itself,starting with reducing its size. In the subsequent decade, it did nothing. This comedy is surely over. If Britain needs a second chamber of parliament – and I think it does – an outside commission should be formed and report at once. Meanwhile, the government should legislate to permit assisted dying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up hereGeorge BassThu 20 Nov 2025 11.04 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 11.58 ESTShareAs someone who works in frontline security, standing outside bars, shops and night spots for up to 12 hours at a time – occasionally watching clubbers turn blue while waiting for a cab – I am well versed in the need to dress weather appropriately.With temperatureshitting freezingacross the UK this week, here are my tips, tricks and product recommendations to keep the frostbite at bay.It’s all about the baseView image in fullscreen‘Like Ready Brek for your lower end’ … merino 260 Tech thermal leggings.Photograph: IcebreakerA lot of emphasis is put on outerwear, but anyone who’s ever had to stand on a door for hours or cheer their kid on at footballwhile stuck on a touchline will appreciate that thought being given to the inner layers, too. Decent thermal underwear is a must. Made from merino wool, Icebreaker’s260 Tech thermal leggingswere invented 30 years ago at the company’s HQ in New Zealand – one of the last pit stops for travellers before they hit Antarctica. Icebreaker leg gear is like Ready Brek for your lower end – cosiness guaranteed in minutes.For your top half, Decathlon’s long-sleeveSimond MT500is also made from merino and is half the price.Swap jumpers for zipsIf you’re constantly moving between somewhere cold and somewhere sheltered, you might get tired of repeatedly diving through the head hole of your jumper. Zipped hoodies are what I get on with best. For chilliness indoors, theRab Nexusis slim-fitting without being constrictive. Designed for hiking, it is also suited for those walking around city streets. And when it’s feeling truly Arctic, there’s thePower Houdifrom Houdini, which is made from breathable Polartec fleece.Pick your coat wiselyView image in fullscreen‘Engineered to deliver warmth’ … Aritzia’s Super Puff coat.Photograph: AritziaThere are two approaches here. The first is to go for something ultra-thick. If you want to stay toasty with some added 90s rave nostalgia, Aritzia’sSuper Puff coat, which is apparently “engineered to deliver warmth to -30C”, will give you that immersion-heater look and the glow to go with it. It’s made from tear-resistant and high-tensile Japanese fabric, is waterproof, and is stuffed with down. Think the best duvet of your life, but with side pockets and a hood.The second approach is to choose a breathable shell. Designed by a snowboard manufacturer, theAK Cyclic Gore-Texfrom Burton–a brand born in the frosty depths of Vermont – might be thinner than the wrong end of an ice skate, but it features pit vents and pockets galore (including that all-important chest pocket for your device). Just be sure to wear both of your hoodies underneath.Go fingerlessView image in fullscreenA radiator, for your hands … Zippo’s 12-hour refillable hand warmer.Photograph: ZippoFingerless gloves have obvious downsides – no one likes snow getting under their nails – but remember that most of the finger still stays snug. Thesefingerless woollen glovesfrom Black Yak are extremely warm, and thankfully are available in more muted colours than so much outdoor adventure gear. You can choose from understated green, blue, brick red or charcoal, and be grateful that your exposed fingertips aren’t in mittens, meaning you can still check your messages.If you have bad circulation or another good reason to want to keep hands hyperbolically toasty this winter, theMarkhof Pro V3 photography glovesfrom Vallerret aren’t cheap, at almost €90 (£79), but they do cover all digits while allowing your thumb and index finger to be free to take pictures thanks to removable fingers. If that still feels too exposed, a mate of mine who rides for Deliveroo recommends Zippo’s12-Hour Refillable Hand Warmer, which he describes as the “smartphone version of a radiator”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I need to layer up, starting with something such as OMM’SCore Beanie; it’s thin, it won’t microwave your head if you’re moving around quicklyand it will sit happily under another thicker hat. And theFisherman Beaniefrom Finisterre is thick but naturally breathable. Combine both with a neck gaiter – thesnood scarffrom Ruffnek, for example – and you achieve something approaching the insulated look of polar pioneerMatthew Henson.A soldier’s bootsView image in fullscreenFor the rugged … Darn Tough heavyweight socks.Like jackets, you can either go padded or non-padded for your footwear, something that depends on time spent outside and what you expect your feet to be standing in. Yorkshire-based bootmaker Altberg covers both ends of the scale. ItsNorway Militaryboot is lined for arctic temperatures, while itsSF-MK3 tabbing bootis multi-season but light, which means decent socks are required. And for that,Darn Tough’s hiking socksare as reliable as the name suggests. Want something super-tough?

Claws (2020)Such was the extent of fan involvement in the How I’m Feeling Now album that the title of Claws was decided by online vote. The opposite of the album’s more fraught depictions of lockdown, it celebrates being trapped with someone you love, although the clanking rhythm track adds a vague sense of unease.19. Taxi (2016)According to one fan database, there are 260 unreleased Charli xcx tracks lurking around online.Taxi, from the scrapped album XCX World, remains the most celebrated for a reason: the funny, snotty saga of a midweek blind date gone wildly out of control, it’s a perfect example of Charli and producer Sophie’s skewed approach to pop.18. Apple (2024)View image in fullscreenPlaying Glastonbury earlier this year.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/ShutterstockThe poppiest track on Brat – nearly binned midway through recording sessions – Apple’s earworm bubblegum melody carries a lyric about strained parental relationships and intergenerational trauma. It also went on to both spawn a viral TikTok dance craze and earn a Grammy nomination. The remix, featuring the Japanese House, feels sweeter still – and equally fantastic.17. New Shapes (ft Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens) (2021)It’s easy to view Brat’s predecessor, Crash, as Charli xcx trying to fit in with standard ideas about mainstream pop, rather than forging her own distinctive path. But its highlights are pretty high: New Shapes deploys bothChristine and the Queensand Caroline Polachek over a fierce take on 80s electro.16. Roll With Me (2017)View image in fullscreenSophie (left) and Charli xcx on stage in 2016.Photograph: Daniel Boczarski/RedfernsThere used to be a rule of thumb thatCharli xcxperversely released her best tracks not on her albums but her mixtapes. Listening to Roll With Me, you can see how that idea blossomed: producer Sophie provides relentless kick-drum thwack and sparse, super-spiky electronics, while Charli brings fabulous attitude-laden pop smarts.15. Nuclear Seasons (2011)If you’re looking for early evidence that Charli xcx was different, then this track from her debut EP, later to become the opener for her debut album, is a good place to start. The lyrics mix up relationship trauma, post-apocalyptic imagery and the suggestion that pop culture is a state of decay; the music reboots doomy 80s synth pop. It’s also insanely catchy.14. 360 (2024)“I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference, baby … I don’t fucking care what you think”: 360 is both the sound of the Brat era swaggering (or perhaps staggering) into view and a superb pop song, whether you opt for the original or the Robyn and Yung Lean-assisted remix.13. I Got It (2017)The Pop 2 mixtape sounded like Charli xcx and her collaborators trying to will a more interesting, provocative pop landscape into being: on I Got It, extravagantly foul-mouthed rapper Cupcakke, Brazilian drag queen vocalist Pabllo Vittar and pansexual shape-shifting US singer Brooke Candy do their thing over a minimal, thrillingly futuristic musical backdrop.12. House (2025)However you might have expected Charli xcx to follow up Brat, it’s unlikely that you expectedthis, from the forthcoming soundtrack to Wuthering Heights: a warped electronic homage to the Velvet Underground, filled with drones, shards of noise and a guest appearance from John Cale, which bursts into furious distortion-laden industrial noise at its climax.11. Club Classics (2024)Pop has hardly wanted for songs about nightclubs, but few of them have captured the small hours dancefloor’s manic sense of euphoria like Club Classics. It feels chaotic, relentless and artificially accelerated, and celebrates complete abandon: “Sweat marks on all my clothes … I wanna be blinded by the lights.”10. Gone (ft Christine and the Queens) (2019)View image in fullscreenChristine and the Queens (left) and Charli xcx performing on The Tonight Show in 2019.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesAnother Christine and the Queens collaboration, Gone improbably transforms the lyrical topic of crushing social anxiety – “I feel so unstable / I fucking hate these people” – into anthemic pop. There’s a powerful sense of catharsis about the way it explodes from brooding verses into a banging, exhilarating chorus.9. Backseat (ft Carly Rae Jepsen) (2017)Charli xcx andCarly Rae Jepsenonce drunkenly plotted to make an album together; their solitary IRL collaboration is marvellous. Thematically, Backseat feels like two different songs – one about a breakup, the other about the alienating nature of celebrity – perfectly joined by the chorus (“I’m alone”) and shifting, inventive electronic backing.8. Boys (2017)By latter-day xcx standards, Boys is musically and lyrically straightforward – a giddy reverie of lust set to a suitably daydreamy backing – but it’s utterly charming and joyful. Extra points for the video, which featured the lead singer of Vampire Weekend lurking among its parade of heavily muscled objects of desire.7. Anthems (2020)Written and recorded as Covid raged, its lyrics crowdsourced with fans online, Anthems perfectly captures those lockdown moments when the urge to, as Charli put it, “go out, blow off some steam, get fucked up” became overwhelming. If its sound is intense to the point of seeming a bit nuts, well, that’s how it felt.Charli XCX: ‘Labels are desperate for artists to be liked, otherwise you’re bad, evil and wrong’Read more6. Boom Clap (2014)Originally intended for former Disney star Hilary Duff (she rejected it), the song’s author turned Boom Clap into the highlight of her second album, Sucker, and her first US Top 10 hit. No wonder: it’s hugely catchy and impressively classy, the hooky chorus set amid chugging, pulsing synths – though she hates it now.5. Next Level Charli (2019)A paean to her fans, packed with references to her past work, the brilliance of Next Level Charli lies in the gulf between the music, which lulls the listener into believing they’re going to get a dreamy, 80s-influenced ballad, and the gobby, playground-chant stridency of the vocal: “In the rave – go for ever and ever!”4. Von Dutch (2024)View image in fullscreenIn Los Angeles, California, 2024.Photograph: Étienne Laurent/AFP/Getty ImagesYou could call Von Dutch a diss track – it’s rumoured to be aimed at FKA twigs – but it feels more like an infectious expression of self-confidence: someone who knows she has hit her imperial phase, and has created an irresistible, epochal pop single almost entirely out of grinding, revving noise to prove it.3. Vroom Vroom (2015)A step into the leftfield that got decidedly mixed reviews on release, Vroom Vroom now feels like the birth of Charli xcx 2.0, harnessing her songwriting skills to the skeletal, avant-pop sound of PC Music affiliateSophie. A decade ago it felt completely removed from mainstream pop trends; today it sounds incredibly prescient.2. Girl, So Confusing (2024)A different class to the usual pop-star-writes-prickly-song-about-fellow-pop-star fare, Girl, So Confusing is both an amazing song and a heartwarming saga. The original version depicted a fraught relationship with Lorde, accompanied by a synthesiser that fizzes and growls;the remixfeatured Lorde herself answering the criticisms and movingly explaining her own issues.1. Track 10 (2017)On the face of it, Track 10, from her mixtape Pop 2, is an unlikely list-topper. It’s a remix of a demo – eventually reworked into theLizzo-featuring 2019 single Blame It on Your Love– with what looks like a placeholder title. But it’s also a masterpiece: an epic ballad that’s both wildly experimental and genuinely affecting. The lyrics sound like a drunken confession from someone who can’t stop her insecurities destroying a relationship. Anyone else might have been inclined to play a song like that straight, but somehow, the overload of theoretically alienating electronics – glitches and distortion, wilfully excessive AutoTune, icy maximalist rave synths – only amplifies its impact.Explore more on these topicsRankedCharli xcxPop and rockChristine and the QueensCaroline PolachekSophieCarly Rae JepsenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But with so many websites being shouty about their Black Friday offers, the best buys aren’t always easy to spot. So before you splash the cash, it might pay to do some research – and look closely at the specification.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I know this may not be welcome advice. After all, the thought of drawing up a spreadsheet of memory configurations and pricing history might put a slight dampener on the excitement that builds as Black Friday approaches. But buy the right laptop today and you can look forward to many years of joyful productivity. Pick a duff one, and every time you open the lid you’ll be cursing your past self’s impulsive nature. So don’t get caught out; be prepared with our useful tips – and a roundup of the Filter’s favourite laptop deals.Before you make the jump, also be sure you really need a new laptop withour guide to making the most out of your existing one.How to find a genuinely good Black Friday laptop dealView image in fullscreenFind out what a laptop is really like to use to ensure it’s right for you.Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty ImagesDon’t sweat the CPUMany people get hung up on processor power, but this is the one thing you rarely need to worry about these days. Although new processor models come out with alarming frequency, almost any AMD Ryzen, Intel Core or Apple M-series chip of the past few years will be fine for everyday web browsing and office tasks. High-end models are only really needed for particularly demanding workloads; a quick trip to Google (or your AI chatbot of choice) will help you see how different processor models measure up.Plan ahead with plenty of RAM and storageEvery laptop needs a decent amount of memory. If the system is starved of RAM, then performance will be sluggish, regardless of the CPU’s speed. While Windows 11 runs acceptably in 8GB, a minimum of 16GB will help ensure that future updates continue to run smoothly. Some models are upgradeable, so you can start with a basic allocation of RAM and add more as your needs grow, but this certainly isn’t something you can take for granted.Laptop storage is also rarely expandable, except by plugging in a USB flash drive or an external SSD. That might be fine if your device will spend much of its time on a desk, but if you want to carry it around with you – not an unreasonable ask for a computer of this type – it’s a drag. So while a base-level 256GB SSD might suffice for home-working, consider stepping up to 512GB or even 1TB of internal storage, especially if you want to edit videos or play big 3D games. Look into battery life, weight and overall dimensions, too, if portability is a priority.Find out what it’s really like to useSome important considerations – such as the quality of the screen and keyboard – don’t show up on the spec sheet, yet these things are arguably just as important as the processor and memory. If the display is dim and blocky, and typing emails feels like pressing Scrabble tiles into a flannel, it will make day-to-day working more difficult.Since online retail doesn’t give you an opportunity to try tapping out “the quick brown fox” for yourself, the next best thing is to read reviews of other people’s hands-on experience. Pay particular attention to the model number, though: laptops often come in a few variants, including a high-end version that will usually get great reviews – and a more cheaply made model that can be flogged for a knock-down price on Black Friday.Is this a genuine special offer?The final thing to check is whether the bargain that’s flashing up on your screen is actually a deal at all. You can look up past prices for a vast range of items by going toCamelCamelCamel– yes, really – and either typing in a laptop model number or pasting in the web address of an Amazon product page. You may find that the heavily promoted Black Friday price is identical to last month’s standard price on Amazon. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad deal, but it signals that you probably don’t need to race to grab a once-in-a-lifetime bargain (we’ve made sure to list this price history on all the laptop deals below).Indeed, with Cyber Monday, pre- and post-Christmas sales, Easter specials, Amazon Prime Day, back-to-school offers and so forth, you’re rarely more than a few weeks away from the next big discount event – so don’t let the excitement of Black Friday encourage you into making a hasty purchase.For more, read the Filter’s roundup of thebest early Black Friday dealsQ&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best Black Friday laptop deals in 2025A big-screen OLED Asus laptopView image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook S16 OLED£649 at CurrysThis Asus Vivobook S16 OLED nails the basics, if you’re after a big-screen laptop with a little something extra. Its Intel Core Ultra 5 225H processor delivers solid performance, while 32GB of RAM and a hefty capacity 1TB SSD provide enough headroom for intensive multitasking and installing of all sorts of apps.A larger 16in Full HD+ resolution OLED screen displays high-quality output with deeper blacks, stronger contrast, and more accurate colours than standard IPS screens found elsewhere at this price. Up to 20 hours of battery life is a boon if you’re going to be away from the mains, too.Price history:not available, but this is the lowest price ever at Currys.A rare MacBook dealView image in fullscreenApple MacBook Air M2 13-inch£699 at John Lewis£699 at CurrysApple’s M2 MacBook Air is a couple of years old now, but the Apple Silicon chip inside continues to deliver oodles of power for anything from productivity loads to editing high-res video on battery power. It’s sleek, portable and stylish, although it lacks ports, so you may need to pick up a cheap USB-C adapter to supplement. The 13.6in Liquid Retina screen is sharp and detailed, while 18 hours of battery life is sure to keep you up and running for a couple of working days away from the mains.Price history:this is the lowest ever price.A decent everyday laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Aspire 14 AI£399 at CurrysFor basic working needs, this Acer Aspire 14 AI has everything you need at a wallet-friendly price. The Snapdragon X chip inside provides more than enough power for day-to-day tasks, plus it enables this laptop to last for up to 28 hours on a charge, which means battery woes can be pushed to the back of your mind. A RAM allocation of 16GB is handy for multitasking, and a 512GB SSD is a decent amount of storage at this price. The 14in 1,920 x 1,200 IPS panel is perfectly serviceable for productivity tasks, plus its 120Hz refresh rate keeps onscreen action zippy.Price history:not available, but this is the lowest ever price at Currys.A lightweight Windows laptopView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook A14£649 at John LewisMade from an innovative blend of ceramic and aluminium, this Asus Zenbook A14 is one of the lightest Windows laptops you’ll find, weighing in at less than a kilo. Not only is it super light, but a Snapdragon X chip alongside 16GB of RAM ensures enough grunt for productivity and multitasking.A 1TB SSD is handy for storing documents, apps, and more besides, while the 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED screen is compact and sharp. Asus also rates this laptop to last for up to 32 hours on a charge – while my tests put it at about 21 hours, I’ll happily take nearly three days of use away from the mains.Price history:not available.A budget Samsung laptopView image in fullscreenSamsung Galaxy Book4£299 at AmazonThe Samsung Galaxy Book4 is an attractive Windows alternative to similarly priced Chromebooks, offering greater software flexibility for getting work done. It includes an impressive range of ports for the price, with USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, microSD and even wired Ethernet in the mix. The Intel Core 3 processor will happily cope with everyday productivity tasks, and is supported by 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for storage.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A stylish model from SamsungView image in fullscreenSamsung Galaxy Book4 Edge£449 at John LewisThe Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge is a modern, plate-glass laptop for the same price as lots of more basic, older models in this early Black Friday melee. It features the same eight-core Snapdragon X chip as Asus’s option, plus 16GB of RAM; a 256GB SSD is a little low, though. However, what the Book4 Edge has on its side is a larger Full HD IPS screen, a full-size keyboard, and that it arrives in a dashing light-blue colour.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A bargain ChromebookView image in fullscreenAcer Chromebook Plus 515£235.99 at AmazonChromebooks have always been deemed inferior to Windows laptops, but you can now easily find genuinely capable budget options with few compromises. Acer’s Chromebook Plus 515 features a modest Intel processor with six cores that should prove sufficiently speedy for basic tasks, while its 8GB of RAM will allow you to have multiple Chrome tabs open without the device grinding to a halt. You also get 256GB of SSD storage for apps and light games, plus room for any local documents that aren’t in Google’s online suite. There’s also a handy 15.6in Full HD screen and a decent set of ports for this bargain-basement price.If you feel like you need the extra performance, you can step up to a Core i5 processor with an extra four cores for anextra £102 at Amazon.Price history:it was £12.79 cheaper in a deal this summer.A bargain LenovoView image in fullscreenLenovo IdeaPad Slim 5£449.99 at John LewisThis Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 is on a “reduced to clear” discount at John Lewis, giving you the chance to grab a bit of a bargain. It has everything you could want from a modern laptop: a compact 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED screen for dazzling results; an eight-core Snapdragon X Plus chip for zippy performance; and excellent battery life – Lenovo says the laptop can last for up to 20 hours or so on a charge, providing all-day working and then some. For multitasking and intensive tasks, 16GB of RAM provides plenty of headroom, while a 512GB SSD is fine for storage at this price.Price history:this was briefly cheaper in the summer.A powerful and portable ultrabookView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook 14£999.99 at AmazonThis Asus Zenbook 14 is a very capable choice. The Intel Core Ultra 9 285H processor with its 16 cores means it will be able to handle any tasks you throw at it, and 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD provide lots of capacity for multitasking and dealing with heavier, creative workloads. Elsewhere, the 14in 3K OLED screen is bright and delivers good detail, and a weight of just 1.2kg makes the Asus super portable. There’s a decent selection of ports, too –and its dark-blue chassis oozes class.If you don’t necessarily need the power of the Core Ultra 9 285H, and you’re happy with a slightly lower-end Core Ultra 7 model (which performs quite similarly in some tests) with 16GB of RAM, then that model is £799 from John Lewis, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A Zenbook with a high-resolution displayView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook S 16 OLED£1,229.99 at AmazonThe Asus Zenbook S 16 OLED is one of the most complete ultrabooks you can buy today, making no real sacrifices anywhere. The star of the show is the gorgeous 16in, 3K-resolution screen, which delivers superb detail and general sharpness. On the inside sits a 12-core Ryzen AI R9 HX 370 processor, alongside 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. There’s a decent set of ports and the casing is made from the same innovative ceraluminum material as the Zenbook A14 above, meaning it’s durable and stylish, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price, and it’s cheaper than lower-spec deals on the same laptop.A high-spec touchscreen LenovoView image in fullscreenLenovo Yoga Slim 7x£799 at CurrysThis Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x option provides a very rich set of specs for the price. The 12-core Snapdragon X Elite processor delivers both in terms of performance and efficiency, with the laptop rated to last for up to 24 hours on a single charge. Add to this a decent 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.Its compact 3K-resolution OLED screen displays plenty of detail in a smaller space, and up to 500 nits of brightness means images are sharp and vibrant. The Yoga Slim is also a touchscreen, giving you the flexibility to use it for more creative or design-type tasks. Go for the blue colourway to add some style to your workspace.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A portable Asus laptopView image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook S 14£599.99 at AmazonThe Asus Vivobook S 14’s portable form factor houses an eight-core AMD Ryzen 9 270 processor, plus 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, and should prove ample for general work tasks, whether at home or on the move. The 14in 1,920 x 1,200-resolution IPS panel might not be an OLED, but it’s still perfectly capable for what this laptop is designed for. The port selection here is also pretty good, providing decent connectivity for most people’s needs.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The eight cores and 12 threads of the Intel Core i5-13420H processor here deliver solid productivity performance, with room to step up to more intense workloads if the need arises. Elsewhere, 16GB of RAM and a capacious 1TB SSD are excellent for the price, plus there’s a decent port selection that includes USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, a microSD reader and more besides.Price history:this matches its lowest ever price.A compact ChromebookView image in fullscreenAcer Chromebook Plus 514£279 at AO£279.99 at AmazonA more compact mid-range Chromebook than the ones above, the Acer Chromebook Plus 514 is one of my favourites. The six-core Intel Core i3-1315U processor means there’s plenty of power on tap for web browsing and everyday tasks, while 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD allow for multiple tabs to be open and fulfil any of your storage needs. Add to this a decent 14in 1,920 x 1,200-resolution display, plus up to 13 hours of battery life to get you through the day.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A slim ultrabook with an OLED displayView image in fullscreenAcer Swift X 14 AI£1,199.99 at AmazonThe Acer Swift X 14 AI is a slim and powerful ultrabook, featuring a dazzling 14in 2,880 x 1,800 OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth and responsive on-screen action. Its AMD Ryzen 7 AI 350 processor can handle anything from productivity tasks to more intensive work, with Nvidia’s RTX 5050 GPU stepping up where extra graphical horsepower is required. Elsewhere, the port count includes USB-C, USB-A, microSD and HDMI, all present in a chassis that’s less than 20mm thick and 1.57kg in weight.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A two-in-one ChromebookView image in fullscreenLenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Duet£159.99 at AmazonThe Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Duet is a unique proposition in this list, offering a proper 2-in-1 device for both tablet and laptop-style duets, with the convenient and lightweight nature of ChromeOS to boot. It has an 11in Full HD+ resolution display, plus 128GB of eMMC storage for apps and games. The 4GB of RAM is a bit meagre, so you’re best to stick to basic web browsing, while its MediaTek Kompanio 838 processor should cope fine with casual work. It also comes with a stylus and a folio keyboard and kickstand case, and weighs just 510g, so is very easy to take on the go.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A lightweight LG laptopView image in fullscreenLG Gram Pro 17Z90TR£1,669.99 at AmazonLG’s Gram laptops have long been lightweight and slender choices in their size classes, and this 17in model is no exception, weighing in at just 1.479kg. It’s also just 14.5mm thick, but maintains a decent port selection with Thunderbolt 4-capable USB-C ports, USB-A and HDMI options.The 17-inch 2.5K resolution screen with 144Hz refresh rate is zippy and responsive, thanks to an Nvidia RTX 5050 paired with a powerful Intel Core Ultra 7 255H processor. In spite of this power, LG says this laptop will last for up to 27 hours on a charge, giving you several days of work away from the mains.Price history:this is a match for its lowest ever price.A larger-screen Windows laptop for under £500View image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook 16 X1605VA£479.99 at AmazonFor a larger-screen Windows laptop for productivity tasks and the odd bit of more intensive work, this Asus Vivobook 16 is perfect. Performance is decent, thanks to a 10-core Intel Core 7-150U processor, plus 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for your storage needs. The 16-inch 1,920 x 1,200 IPS screen is pretty standard at this price, but a lay-flat hinge makes this laptop great for collaborative working. You also benefit here from a full-size keyboard, while USB-C, USB-A, HDMI and a headphone jack make up the port count.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An upgrade on the Acer aboveView image in fullscreenAcer Aspire 14 AI£699.99 at AmazonThe Acer Aspire 14 AI is different to the model above: it comes running an eight-core AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 chip, with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, rather than the Arm-based Snapdragon processor. Display-wise, you get a 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED panel that delivers deeper blacks and stronger contrast and colour accuracy, and a good selection of ports. This model is a little more expensive than the other version, but I’d argue the expense is justified.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.Lots of power for the priceView image in fullscreenMSI Prestige AI Evo£899 at AmazonMSI’s Prestige Evo is a very powerful ultrabook for its price, offering Intel’s potent Core Ultra 9 288V processor with its eight cores and eight threads, plus 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for solid performance and decent storage. The iGPU inside this modern Intel chip is also strong for creative tasks, while the 13.3in 2.8K-resolution OLED screen is sharp and delivers good detail across a smaller area. The thin chassis and compact form are great for portability, yet don’t sacrifice too much on ports.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A lightweight 16in laptopView image in fullscreenLG Gram Pro 16Z90TS£1,029.99 at Amazon£1,149 at CurrysIn keeping with the portable laptop theme, this LG Gram Pro 16Z90TS provides one of the lightest 16in laptops you’ll find, delivering a good selection of ports and solid performance, with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Intel’s Core Ultra 7 256V processor with eight cores and eight threads, plus its potent integrated graphics, provide enough oomph for both basic workloads and more intensive tasks. It’s a shame the 16in 2.5K 144Hz panel isn’t OLED; but it’s a decent IPS screen – it’s responsive and delivers good detail. Lasting for up to 25.5 hours on a charge, you’ll get a few days away from the mains.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The best gaming laptop dealsAn Asus ROG for lessView image in fullscreenAsus ROG Strix G16£1,599 at AO£1,599 at VeryAsus’s ROG gaming laptops typically carry a premium, but this Strix G16 is one of the cheapest RTX 5070 Ti-powered gaming machines available right now. Pairing it with a 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 7940HX processor will yield very capable gaming performance at this laptop’s native 1,920 x 1,200 resolution.The display also has a 165Hz refresh rate for more responsive onscreen action. Modern AAA games can be a storage hog, but the 1TB SSD means there’s enough headroom for a good few here, while 16GB of RAM is enough for gaming loads.Price history:not available, but cheaper than the closest equivalent on Amazon.A mid-range gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Nitro V16 AI£1,089.99 at Amazon£1,099 at VeryAcer’s Nitro V16 is a strong mid-range gaming laptop, especially in this spec, which pairs an RTX 5070 graphics card with AMD’s eight-core Ryzen AI 7 350 processor. The setup delivers solid performance at 1080p and the laptop’s native 2,560 x 1,600 resolution – although the higher resolution may benefit from reduced settings and some upscaling. A 180Hz refresh rate makes for a smooth and responsive panel, and the laptop comes with a well-rounded port selection, too. Acer rounds off the package with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A sub-£1,000 gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAsus V16£799 at AmazonAt £799, the Asus V16 is quite a feature-rich gaming laptop, as long as you don’t mind its modest 1080p display. The 10-core, 16-thread Intel Core 7 240H processor paired with an RTX 5060 laptop GPU brings solid performance to the table, alongside the powers of Nvidia’s DLSS4 upscaler and the multi-frame-gen tech, if you want it. The 16GB of RAM will be good to run most modern games, with the 1TB SSD generous for storage. All of this helps to drive a large, 16in, 1,920 x 1,200-resolution, 144Hz-refresh-rate screen for a solid blend of detail and responsiveness. An array of USB-C, USB-A, HDMI ports and more deliver decent connectivity, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A high-performance gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAlienware 18 Area-51£2,899 at Amazon£2,998.99 at DellIf it’s averycapable gaming laptop you’re after, this Alienware 18 Area-51 is one of the strongest options you’ll find. A 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and Nvidia’s second-in-command RTX 5080 laptop GPU deliver the goods for gaming on its huge 18in QHD+ resolution screen. The IPS panel here is strong, too, with its super-high 300Hz refresh rate bringing impeccable motion handling. There’s 32GB of DDR5 RAM and a generous 2TB SSD. Sporting Alienware’s classic space-age looks, you’ll need some muscle if you plan to use it on the move – this laptop is big and bulky; but the extra room also means it arrives with an enviable set of ports.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An attractive Acer laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Predator Helios Neo 16 AI£1,599.99 at AmazonThe Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 AI is one of the best value gaming laptops in its price class – but it’s become an even stronger proposition with a £300 price cut. On the inside beats an RTX 5070 Ti GPU alongside the same beefy Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor as the Alienware option above to handle the most demanding of games on its 16-inch, 2,560 x 1,600-resolution screen. The panel’s 240Hz refresh rate delivers smooth motion, plus you also get 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Those looking for style as well as substance won’t be disappointed, as the Acer is quite a looker compared to other gaming behemoths out there. If price-to-performance is the name of the game, this is a candidate for the best we’ve seen this Black Friday so far.Price history:this is its lowest ever price, although it was only 1p more for a period in September.For more:How to shop smart this Black FridayHow to avoid bad Black Friday TV dealsThe best early Black Friday dealsExplore more on these topicsLaptopsThe FilterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Who covers the pitch but sees the penalty area as their kryptonite? Which defender loves one-v-one battles? Who prefers to shoot without taking a touch to settle themselves?Bruno FernandesMost shots from outside the box without scoringBruno Fernandes hasn’t had much luck from shooting outside the box this season. He has attempted 12 shots from range without success, coming closest in the draw at Nottingham Forest, with his low shot striking the foot of a post.The fact that only Kevin De Bruyne (15) has scored more goals from outside the box in the Premier League than Fernandes (14) since the Manchester United captain’s debut in February 2020 suggests his luck will change. Maybe it’s time for him to come off free-kick though; h has scored only three of his 60 shot attempts from free-kicks in the Premier League (5%), including two unsuccessful efforts this season.View image in fullscreenMichael KayodeLong throws into the opposition’s boxLong throws are back in fashion. That makes Michael Kayode even more important than usual, with the Brentford defender chucking more of them into the opposition’s box than any other player in the Premier League this season.Kayode has launched 54 long throws into the opposition’s box, eight more than second-placed Nordi Mukiele and 25 more than Chris Richards in third. More importantly, six of his long throws into the penalty area have led to a shot – four more than any other player – and two have led to goals.Igor JesusHighest xG without scoringIgor Jesus hasn’t had a problem scoring for Nottingham Forest in cup competitions this season. The 24-year-old Brazilian has scored five goals from 13 shots across the League Cup and Europa League, but the Premier League has been a more difficult proposition for him.He’s yet to score in 10 league games since joining Forest from Botafogo in the summer, despite having 13 shots. He is the player to have the highest expected goals figure this season without scoring (1.86). At least he isn’t the player with the most shots without scoring – that is Bournemouth’s David Brooks (16 shots, no goals).View image in fullscreenFlorian WirtzMost shot involvements without a goal or assistIt’s been a tricky start for Florian Wirtz. In 11 appearances, none of the 16 chances he has created have become assists, which is hardly on him, but he’s also recorded 12 shots without success. That’s 28 chances and no goals.Thierry Henry struggled at the start of his Premier League career – when he was also 22 and arriving from a different country – with only one goal and no assists in his first 12 appearances. But then things started to click and we know the rest.Jack GrealishExpected assists from open playJack Grealish tops the open-play assist charts with four, but sometimes assists can be misleading. In order to assess the true creative quality of a player’s passes, expected assists (xA) offers a deeper understanding of how likely a pass is to become an assist.xA is measured on a scale between zero and one, where zero represents a pass that will never result in an assist, and one represents a pass that the receiver would be expected to score from every single time. Grealish’s passes in open play this season have totalled 2.47 xA, higher than any other player in the division. Interestingly for Everton fans, another of their players ranks second in this metric: Iliman Ndiaye (2.40), just above Jérémy Doku (2.14) and Bukayo Saka (1.94).Erling HaalandFirst-time shots from open playErling Haaland has been in electric form, scoring 14 goals in the opening 11 games. What is more surprising is how often he takes first-time shots in open play. Of his 44 open-play shots this season, 26 have come without any prior touch (59.1%) and eight of his 14 goals have come with a first-time finish.That is more than any other player in the league, but only just. Jean-Philippe Mateta has had 30 shots in open play and 25 of those have been first-time attempts (83.3%).Carlos BalebaMost touches without one being in opposition’s boxEleven players have scored for Brighton this season, but don’t expect the midfielder Carlos Baleba to join that group soon. Despite having 371 touches in 11 appearances this season, none of them has come inside the opposition’s penalty area.That’s the most touches by an outfielder without any coming in the opposition’s box this season, 79 more than Axel Tuanzebe (292). During his time in the Premier League, Baleba had 3,230 touches, with only 19 of them in the opposition’s box (0.006%).View image in fullscreenOptaRyan SessegnonMost fouls without receiving a cardRyan Sessegnon could be considered the most fortunate player to not have entered the referee’s notebook as he has committed 20 fouls without receiving a single card, four more than Pape Matar Sarr (16) and five more than his Fulham teammate Raúl Jiménez (15). Going back to last season, none of Sessegnon’s past 25 fouls have seen him booked.At the other end of the scale, three players have committed fewer than 10 fouls but still been given four yellow cards this season: Álex Jiménez (five fouls), Tim Iroegbunam (six) and James Garner (eight).Jérémy DokuMost carries ending in opposition’s boxJérémy Doku has shown how dangerous he is when running with the ball at his feet, leading the rankings for chances created following a ball carry (11). There aren’t many players who can wriggle their way through tight spaces to create chances for teammates as well as the Belgian winger, and his ball-carrying ability has taken him into the opposition’s penalty area more often than anyone else.Doku leads the rankings for ball carries ending in the opposition’s box (72), with his tally 19 more than the next highest players, Jack Grealish and Cody Gakpo (53).View image in fullscreenJérémy Doku was sensational in City’s 3-0 win against Liverpool.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesMaxence LacroixBest one-v-one defender against dribblersOf players to have faced at least 20 dribbles, the Crystal Palace defender Maxence Lacroix has won the highest percentage of his tackles (87%), just above his central defensive partner Marc Guéhi (81.5%).Of defenders, Kieran Trippier has the worst success rate in stopping dribblers. The Newcastle full-back has won just 32.3% of his one-v-one battles, committing 10 fouls and seeing his opponent dribble past him on another 11 occasions.Granit XhakaDistance runSunderland have started the season brilliantly and few players have stood out more than Granit Xhaka. The 33-year-old has covered more ground than any other player in the Premier League this season, running 124.06km. Elliot Anderson is second (122.44km), with Xhaka’s teammate Noah Sadiki in third (122.33km).Igor ThiagoHigh pressures applied in the final thirdIgor Thiago endured a frustrating first season at Brentford. Hindered by injury, the forward played only 168 minutes across eight appearances in the league. Now fit, the Brazilian has become an integral part of Keith Andrews’s side. Only Erling Haaland (14) has scored more goals than he has (eight).He works incredibly hard off the ball too. He leads the rankings for high pressures applied across the whole pitch (609) but, more importantly for Brentford, he also leads the way when it comes to high pressures applied in the final third of the pitch (270).View image in fullscreenOptaEmiliano BuendíaMinutes played as a substituteEmiliano Buendía has been a handy option for Aston Villa off the bench. The Argentinian has played more minutes as a substitute than any other player (200), and his impact has made a difference. No player has been involved in more goals as a sub than he has (three: two goals and one assist). He also leads the rankings for shot involvements as a sub (11: six shots, five chances created) alongside Omari Hutchinson and Estêvão. In fact, he’s been involved in more goals as a sub (three in 200 minutes) than he has as a starter (two in 229 minutes) this season for Villa.This is an article byOpta AnalystExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueGuardian Sport NetworkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not having one would have caused loss of life “on a scale that was unconscionable and unacceptable”.‘Chaotic and indecisive’: key findings of report on UK’s Covid response under ToriesRead moreDetailed in more than 750 pages across two volumes, the findings of the second part of the Covid inquiry’s hearings on how the government handled the pandemic paint a consistent picture of delay, inaction and an apparent inability to learn lessons.The account of the start of the pandemic in early 2020 is particularly brutal, describing February as “a lost month”. It questions why Johnson did not chair a single meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, noting also that the response to Covid essentially halted during the half-term holiday week.If a lockdown had been imposed on 16 March, a week earlier than took place, modelling suggests this could have cut the number of deaths in England in the first wave of the virus by almost half, equating to 23,000 lives saved, the inquiry authors say.View image in fullscreenIf lockdown had been imposed a week earlier up to 23,000 lives could have been saved, the report says.Photograph: GarethWilley/ShutterstockThe Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group said the report showed Johnson had repeatedly delayed, ignored advice and “put his political reputation ahead of public safety”.The group said: “While it is vindicating to see Boris Johnson blamed in black and white for the catastrophic mishandling of the pandemic, it is devastating to think of the lives that could have been saved under a different prime minister.”Perhaps the most trenchant criticism is directed at Johnson and his team, notably his then adviser Dominic Cummings, who isdescribed as central to a “culture of fear” inside No 10. The report also targets the three devolved governments, and others central to the process, such as scientific advisers.“The inquiry finds that the response of the four governments repeatedly amounted to a case of ‘too little, too late’,” it reads. “The failure to appreciate the scale of the threat, or the urgency of response it demanded, meant that by the time the possibility of a mandatory lockdown was first considered it was already too late and a lockdown had become unavoidable.”Many of the same mistakes – reacting too slowly and underestimating the speed and impact of Covid’s spread – were then repeated later in 2020, as restrictions were lifted and then belatedly reimposed in the face of infectious new strains, the report adds, calling this “inexcusable”.Other findings include:Strong criticism of Chris Wormald, who was the head civil servant at the health department and is now Keir Starmer’s cabinet secretary. The report said he had failed to correct the “over-enthusiastic impression” of the department’s work given byMatt Hancock, the then health secretary, and had failed to properly look into widespread doubts about Hancock’s effectiveness.That while lockdowns were needed, they left “lasting scars” on society, particularly for children.If ministers had acted swiftly with other measures to curb the spread of the virus, a complete lockdown might have been avoided, or at least have been shorter.Communication with the devolved nations was poor, and the leaders of all the UK countries made errors.View image in fullscreenThe actions of the devolved governments, including in Scotland, were also criticised.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe first volume of the report gives a chronology of the crisis, from the start of 2020 to the final lifting of restrictions, pointing to a consistent picture of inaction despite ever-mounting evidence about a new virus that was spreading around the globe and could be transmitted between people.Events such as the early Covid crisis in Italy “should have prompted urgent planning across the four nations”, the report said, adding: “Instead, the governments did not take the pandemic seriously enough until it was too late. February 2020 was a lost month.”While there is nothing to mandate that Cobra is always chaired by a PM, it was “surprising” that Johnson did not do this before March, the authors say, with some understatement.“Mr Johnson should have appreciated sooner that this was an emergency that required prime ministerial leadership to inject urgency into the response,” concludes the inquiry, chaired by the retired judge and cross-bench peer Heather Hallett.This was explained in part by the PM “acting in accordance with his own optimistic disposition” and accepting assurances that everything necessary was being done.During the February half-term, Johnson spent the whole week at the government’s Chevening country retreat, the report says, adding: “It does not appear that he was briefed, at all or to any significant extent, on Covid-19 and he received no daily updates.”By the second week of March, the report says, the situation was “little short of calamitous”, with no proper plan, no testing taking place and thus no understanding about how far the virus had spread.But a lockdown was still delayed, in part because of warnings from the medical and scientific advisers for England, Chris Whitty andPatrick Vallance, about the likelihood of “behavioural fatigue”, meaning people would comply only for a period. This concept, the report said, “had no grounding in behavioural science and proved damaging, given the imperative to act more decisively and sooner”.View image in fullscreenA government billboard on Borough High Street, south London, during the third set of lockdown restrictions.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianEven after a lockdown was imposed on 23 March, the report says, mistakes were repeated, including what it calls an “unwise” exit from restrictions that summer, pushed in part by Rishi Sunak, the then chancellor.When a second wave swept the UK, a new lockdown was again delayed, with all four UK governments saying restrictions could ease over Christmas, giving people “false hope”, as the report puts it.The Liberal Democrats called on Kemi Badenoch to apologise on behalf of the Conservatives for the “abject failure” over Covid. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said: “The British people will rightly never forgive the Conservatives for leaving the country rudderless and vulnerable, and for partying while our communities were isolated and grieving.”In awritten parliamentary statement, Starmer noted the failings, and also the context of the UK being not properly prepared. He wrote: “Since then, improvements have been made to the way the government would respond to a major crisis.”Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryCoronavirusInfectious diseasesBoris JohnsonMatt HancockPatrick VallanceChris WhittynewsShareReuse this content"

This is important,” Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine would issue no “rash” statements.“The number one task for everyone is a constructive diplomatic process with America and all our partners. It is vital to have stable support for our army and all our planned defence operations and deep strikes.”The cautious response from Ukraine’s presidential administration followed angry denouncements of the plan by some Ukrainian officials who called it “absurd” and unacceptable.According to reports, the sweeping 28-point proposal closely resembles demands made by Moscow soon after its full-scale invasion in early 2022. It was reportedly drawn up by Russian and US officials, with support from Trump. Kyiv was not consulted. One European diplomat said they learned of the plan only when they turned on the news.Ukraine mapIt envisages Kyiv giving up Crimea and the Donbas region, while the frontlines of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia would be frozen along the current line of contact. Ukraine would agree to limit its army to 600,000 personnel, a reductions of hundreds of thousands.European fighter jets would be based in Poland to protect Ukraine, but no Nato troops would be stationed in Ukraine and Kyiv would agree never to join the military alliance, according to the plan seen by Axios and AFP.No foreign troops would be allowed on Ukrainian soil, a condition that rules out a post-deal peacekeeping force led by the UK and France. But the US would provide unspecified security guarantees,according to Axios. In addition, $100bn in frozen Russian assets would be dedicated to rebuilding Ukraine. There would also be a path to reintegrating Russia in the global economy, including the future lifting of sanctions, according to the Associate Press.Ukrainian officials said the document amounted to the effective end of its existence as an independent country. It comes nearly four years after Russian troops tried and failed to seize Kyiv, and as efforts by the Trump administration to end the conflict remain stalled.Zelenskyy held talks on Thursday with a high-rankingUS militarydelegation, led by the army secretary Dan Driscoll.Driscoll – a former classmate of the US vice-president, JD Vance – arrived in Kyiv bearing important messages from the White House, US sources indicated. He is likely to travel to Moscow at the end of next week to discuss the plan with the Kremlin, they said.View image in fullscreenThe US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, left, met the Ukrainian defence minister, Denys Shmyhal, in Kyiv.Photograph: APAmerican diplomats said Donald Trump was trying to achieve peace “with an incredible sense of momentum”.His administration was pursuing an “aggressive timeline” with the Ukrainians to reach an agreement, they added, and wanted to achieve this in the “shortest possible” period. The White House said the plan was “good” for both sides, rejecting concerns that it echoes many of Moscow’s demands.After an hour-long, one-to-one meeting between Driscoll and Zelenskyy, the chargé d’affaires at the US embassy in Kyiv, Julie Davis, said: “We have witnessed today a remarkable pace of diplomatic activity. We are going to continue these efforts today and tomorrow and keep at this.”Officials in Kyiv were unimpressed. They said the proposal – reportedly drafted by Kirill Dmitriev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff – was a “provocation”, the aim of which was to stir up division and “disorientate” Ukraine’s allies,they added.“There are currently no signs that the Kremlin is ready for serious negotiations. Putin is trying to stall for time and avoid US sanctions,”said Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Ukraine’s foreign policy parliamentary committee.“It means capitulation, for Ukraine, for Europe and for America,” said Roman Kostenko, a Ukrainian commander and politician.View image in fullscreenKirill Dmitriev, a Putin adviser and ally, ‘has spun this plan at a time when Zelenskyy is weak’, said one western diplomat.Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersLast week, Trump named Driscoll as his new “special representative”. His mission to Kyiv included explaining the White House’s latest peace plan, as well as military meetings and discussions concerning battlefield innovation, a US official said. Two four-star generals travelled with him.Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special representative to Ukraine, has reportedly planned his departure, saying he would leave in January after a year in the post. Kellogg is regarded as being broadly sympathetic to Ukraine and has been consequently left out of direct US-Russian talks.The White House’s renewed push to force Ukraine to make significant concessions in pursuit of “peace” comes at a difficult time for Zelenskyy, who is embroiled in the biggest political scandal since he became president in 2019.His formerbusiness partner Timur Mindichandat least two government ministersare accused of involvement in a large-scale bribery scheme. Several deputies from Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party have called on the president to dismiss Andriy Yermak, his powerful chief of staff.One western diplomat said the Russians were seeking to take advantage of Ukraine’s domestic crisis.“It seems Dmitriev has spun this plan at a time when Zelenskyy is weak. The Russians are good at exploiting things,” they said. “It feels like every other Russian plan. I don’t think it’s going to fly with Ukraine.”The diplomat said the Kremlin’s demands concerning the Russian language were a “hook” it could later exploit. The proposal did not offer the kind of security assurances Ukraine would need from the US and its European allies for any deal to stick, they added.Europe calls for role in Ukraine talks amid reported US-Russian peace dealRead moreEuropean leaders meeting in Brussels said they had not been warned in advance about the latest White House initiative.The Trump administration no longer provided direct military aid to Kyiv, a fact that reduced its ability to impose a Moscow-friendly peace settlement on Ukraine, one source noted.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said Europe welcomed any efforts to achieve a long-lasting and just settlement of the war, but stressed: “For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.”Kallas said the Dmitriev-Witkoff proposal did not envisage Russia making any concessions. “We have to understand that in this war, there is one aggressor and one victim. If Russia really wanted peace, it could have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already some time ago.”The British government said it backed Trump’s desire to “bring this barbaric war to an end”.0:47Moment Russian missile strikes apartment block in Ukraine – videoBut it emphasised that “only the Ukrainian people can determine their future” and said Russia could end the fighting tomorrow by pulling out troops and ending its “illegal invasion”.US efforts to broker peace have hit roadblocks since Trumpmet Putin in Alaskain August. The US president subsequently imposedsanctions on Russia’s oil industry, in an apparent attempt to push Putin to the negotiating table.Trump said last month that he wasputting on hold his planfor a meeting with the Russian president in Budapest because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time”.In recent months Russia hasincreased its systematic attackson Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, plunging much of the country into darkness.

Our laws are clear, you can refuse illegal orders, you can refuse illegal orders, you must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.”‘Golden crime scene’: Elizabeth Warren calls for inquiry into Trump’s ballroom fundingRead moreThat seemed to prompt a furious response from the US president.On Thursday morning, Trumpwroteon Truth Social: “It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP??? President DJT.” In a third post, headded: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” He also reposted a statement that said: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”Following Trump’s statements on Thursday, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic whip Katherine Clark and Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar released a joint statement condemning the remarks.“Political violence has no place in America,” they wrote. “Representatives Jason Crow, Chris DeLuzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan and Senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin all served our country with tremendous patriotism and distinction. We unequivocally condemn Donald Trump’s disgusting and dangerous death threats against members of Congress, and call on House Republicans to forcefully do the same.”The Democratic leaders also said that they had been in contact with the House sergeant at arms and the United States Capitol police “to ensure the safety of these members and their families”.“Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed,” the statement added.The lawmakers who appeared in the video also released a statement.“We are veterans and national security professionals who love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the constitution of the United States,” they said. “That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.”“What’s most telling is that the president considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” they continued. “Our service members should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty.”They added: “Every American must unite and condemn the president’s calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity.”Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, also condemned Trump’s remarks andposted on X: “Let’s be crystal clear: the President of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the UK, abouta quarter of older teenagersand up to a fifth of younger children have anxiety, depression or other mental health problems.In the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance says under-18s with moderate to severe depressioncan be prescribed antidepressants alongside therapy.But a new review of trial data by academics in Austria and the UK concluded that fluoxetine, sold under the brand name of Prozac among others, is clinically no better than placebo drugs in treating depression in children, and should therefore no longer be prescribed to them.The authors conducted a meta analysis of 12 large trials involving Prozac, published between 1997 and 2024, and concluded that fluoxetine improved children’s depressive symptoms so little as to not be considered clinically meaningful.“Consider the analogy of a weight-loss drug that is better than placebo at producing weight loss, but the difference is only 100 grams,” said Martin Plöderl, a clinical psychologist at Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg, Austria, and lead author of the study. “This difference is unlikely to be noticeable to the patient or their doctors or produce any difference in their overall condition.”The study, published in theJournal of Clinical Epidemiology, identified a “novelty bias” in early trials, which were likely to be more positive, while later studies fail to confirm these effects. It concludes that the potential risks of harmful side-effects of fluoxetine are likely to outweigh any potential clinical benefit.The most common side-effects experienced by children on antidepressants are weight gain, sleep disturbance and concentration problems. They can also increase suicidal ideation.Children detained under Mental Health Act held for hours in A&E departmentsRead moreThe authors also examined clinical guidelines in the US and Canada and found that just as in the UK, they ignored evidence that Prozac was clinically equivalent to placebo and continued to recommend its use for children and adolescents with depression.Mark Horowitz, an associate professor of psychiatry at Adelaide University and a co-author of the study, said: “Fluoxetine is clearly clinically equivalent to placebo in its benefits, but is associated with greater side effects and risks. It is difficult to see how anyone can justify exposing young people to a drug with known harms when it has no advantage over placebo in its benefits.“Guidelines should not recommend treatments that are equivalent to placebo. Many clinicians take the common-sense approach that we should seek to understand why the young person feels depressed and address the factors that are contributing to it.“Guidelines in the UK and around the world currently recommend treatments for children with depression that are not in line with the best evidence. This exposes young people to the risks of medication without any benefit over placebo.”The long-term effects of antidepressants in children and adolescents were “poorly understood” and research among adults showed risks included serious side effects that may be long-term and in some cases persist after stopping the medication, he added.Responding to the findings, a Nice spokesperson said: “Mental health is a priority for Nice and we recognise that depression in young people is a serious condition that affects each differently, which is why having a range of treatment options is essential for clinicians. Our guideline recommends a choice of psychological therapies as first line treatment options for children and young people with depression.“Nice recommends that children and young people with moderate or severe depression are reviewed by specialist teams. Antidepressants may be considered in combination with psychological therapy for moderate to severe depression in some cases and only under regular specialist supervision.”Prof Allan Young, chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Academic Faculty, said that the study should be interpreted with “caution”. “Clinical guidelines weigh many factors beyond average effect size, including safety, feasibility, and patient preferences. It is important that prescribed medication demonstrate consistent evidence and safety data,” he said.In the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.

But while he will host bilateral meetings with world leaders, he will not be able to meet Trump, who has said he is not attending after accusing South Africa ofracially discriminating against the minority white Afrikaner community.South Africa has responded byaccusing the US of “coercion by absentia”.‘We are privileged’: liberal Afrikaners reject Trump’s ‘white genocide’ claimsRead moreCyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, told the B20 business summit on Thursday: “We are sovereign countries. And we need to be treated as equals.“Our sovereignty needs to be respected. We need to sit around the table as equals and having the same share of knowledge, the same share of capability, without any bullying the other.”Asked about Trump, Starmer said: “Obviously President Trump set out his position. I think it’s really important to be there and talk to other partners and allies so we can get on with the discussions around global issues that have to be addressed.”Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping will also be absent from the summit.While South Africa and Russia maintain close ties, Putin is wanted by the international criminal court, to which South Africa is a signatory. Xi has skipped many international gatherings this year, delegating attendance at the Brics and Asean summits to China’s premier, Li Qiang.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They will have a chance to exchange further notes when they meet the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on the sidelines of this weekend’s summit.While Starmer works the international diplomatic circuit, his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is finalising a budget likely to include billions of pounds in tax rises, including a freeze on income tax thresholds. The prime minister and the chancellor decided last week to abandon a plan to raise income tax rates, leaving Reeves looking at other ways to raise about £20bn extra in tax revenue.Starmer said: “Obviously the details of the budget will come on Wednesday. It’ll be aLabourbudget with Labour values. It’ll be based on fairness.“We have to see this in the context of 16, 17 years now where we’ve had the crash in 2008, followed by austerity, followed by a not very good Brexit deal, followed by Covid, followed byUkraine, and that’s why we have to take the decision to get this back on track.“I’m optimistic about the future.

If a mandatory lockdown had been imposed a week earlier in March 2020, there would have been about 23,000 fewer deaths, it concluded.During the second wave in September and October 2020, it said Johnson “repeatedly changed his mind on whether to introduce tougher restrictions and failed to make timely decisions”, and that a second lockdown in England could have been “reduced in length and severity” if he had acted quicker.The report said that in future emergencies, “interventions must be imposed earlier and ‘harder’ than might be considered ideal”, and recommended central taskforces be created in each nation to help with decision-making.The Welsh government was also found to have implemented a two-week “firebreak” lockdown too late and lifted measures too quickly, which contributed to a high mortality rate in the country from August to December 2020.In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, the then first minister, was criticised for her overly centralised decision-making process, in which she held “gold command” meetings with a small group of advisers that “reduced transparency” during the pandemic.On Northern Ireland, the report said a politically divided Stormont executive led to “chaotic decision-making” during the pandemic and the country’s response was “deeply divided along political lines and beset by leaks, leading to an incoherent approach”.Vulnerable people weren’t protectedThe report said several key groups who were more at risk from Covid, such as disabled people and people from some ethnic minorities, were not sufficiently protected owing to a lack of data and policy failures.The government failed to “act sufficiently speedily to mitigate some risks to disabled people”, the report said, such as by not adding people with Down’s syndrome to the shielded patient list until September 2020.It also criticised the redeployment of members of the race disparity unit and the government equalities office to help with the pandemic response, even though it was known from April 2020 that people from ethnic minority groups were at a heightened risk of becoming infected.Messages were confusingConfusing messaging to the public was a key theme of the report, with Johnson criticised for his “expressions of over-optimism”.The inquiry found that he had “failed to convey a proper sense of caution, thereby undermining his government’s public health messaging” on some occasions, such as when he talked about how he had shaken people’s hands in hospital the day before launching a handwashing campaign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This resulted in reputational damage and modellers being considered “over-pessimistic doom-mongers”.The report recommended a training course on “core scientific concepts” for politicians that could be provided at the outset of an emergency.There was no support for expertsThe inquiry said it was “striking that the burden of providing advice to ministers fell on the shoulders of a few individuals, especially in the devolved nations”.Scientific experts described their workloads as “excessive” and “relentless”, and the inquiry emphasised how most of them were not paid for their advice, which they had to fit in around their jobs.They were also subjected to “threats and intimidation” via social media, emails, phone calls and letters. Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, wasassaulted in a park in June 2021. His deputy, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had never expected his family to be threatened with having their throats cut.The inquiry said there was a “real risk that intrusive media coverage, coupled with online abuse, other forms of malicious communication and physical harassment, will dissuade talented people from contributing to the provision of scientific advice”.UK should prepare for next pandemicThe report’s recommendations suggested new structures need to be urgently put in place to improve decision-making in any future national emergency.It said the response to a future whole-system civil emergency should be coordinated by central taskforces in the UK, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with responsibility for commissioning advice, and there should be more scrutiny of emergency powers such as those used to impose lockdowns.Other suggestions included better inclusion of experts from the devolved nations in discussions, creating a register of experts who can be drawn upon for scientific advisory groups and creating an online portal for restrictions and guidance in each area.Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusBoris JohnsonConservativesHealthInfectious diseasesDominic CummingsexplainersShareReuse this content"

At the end of October, the Cuban government announced that it had arrested him. That same day, he was flown back to Mexico and extradited straight to the US.Zhang’s daring escape is still shrouded with intrigue. But experts say his case underlines the deep and growing relationship between Chinese criminal groups and Mexican cartels.“It’s emblematic of how important Chinese networks have become to the core operations of Mexican criminal groups,” said Vanda Felbab Brown, an expert on organised crime at the Brookings Institution.Zhangappeared in a Brooklyn court on Wednesday, where he was accused of smuggling tons of chemical precursors to make fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, for the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels, the most powerful criminal organisations in Mexico.He also faces charges for allegedly trafficking cocaine and crystal meth, and for laundering almost $100m through hundreds of shell companies and bank accounts in the US.Zhang pleaded not guilty to the charges at his arraignment“[Zhang] is what I would call a convergence target,” said Chris Urben, a former agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration. “He’s even better than a kingpin, because while kingpins sit at the top and only a few people communicate with them, he was involved in all of these things.”Zhang – who went by aliases such as El Chino and Brother Wang – arrived in Mexico before the coronavirus pandemic, then married a Mexican and became a Mexican citizen. As someone culturally fluent in the underworlds of both countries, “he offered something that very few can”, said Urben, who now works for the investigations firm Nardello & Co.That might explain why as-yet-unknown actors went to great lengths to help him escape.“It’s not like he got in a truck down to Guatemala,” said Urben. “He facilitated his release from jail. He was placed on home leave, completely set up for him to escape. And then he had this private jet to a country that’s in partnership with Russia and in some wayChina.”“It was the same old story of Mexico,” said Felbab Brown. “It wasn’t just his criminal genius that allowed him to escape. It was corruption.”But in the end it didn’t work: Russia turned him away, then Cuba handed him over.Felbab Brown says that Zhang may have just been trying to get to any country that wouldn’t extradite him to the US. “But it could also be that he knew specific Russian criminal actors or spies or government actors that he was planning to rely on for protection,” she said.As for the cooperation from the Cuban government, Felbab Brown says they may have been trying to “score some goodwill” with the US, having seen the pressure the Trump administration is exerting on Venezuela, nominally over drug trafficking.Given the adaptability of criminal networks, the arrest of any single individual is unlikely to disrupt the supply of precursors to Mexican cartels for long, if at all. Nonetheless, his extradition gives US law enforcement the opportunity to harvest intelligence on all the networks in which he was involved.Revealed: how Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel has created a global network to rule the fentanyl tradeRead moreThe arrest has already drawn attention to the relationship between Chinese criminal groups and Mexican cartels, which has exploded over the last 10 years as they became the principal money launderers for cash from drug sales in the US, according to Urben.Chinese criminal groups have a unique offer for money laundering, which relies on the fact that there are many people in China who want to get money out of the country but are restricted by capital controls, which limit them to the equivalent of about $50,000 a year.The process might start with a Mexican cartel associate delivering cash from drug sales to a Chinese national who lives in the US. Once that person confirms receipt, Chinese brokers use associates in Mexico to pay the cartels in pesos. The money launderers then sell the dollars in the US to people in China who want to, for example, buy property in the US, and receive payment in yuan back in China.All of this can happen near instantaneously and without any money crossing borders, making it harder to trace.And since the money launderers can impose the costs on the “captive” Chinese customers, they can afford to charge the cartels commissions as low as 1-2%.“I had an undercover team that investigated [the previous money-laundering techniques] for years,” said Urben. “It used to take like 10 days for the cartels to get their money and perhaps 7-10% in costs.“The Chinese changed the game.”Explore more on these topicsDrugs tradeFentanylMexicoChinaCubaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As in all years, the chancellor has to strike a balance between:Raising the money needed to fund the services that voters demand.Keeping taxes at levels that are acceptable to voters.Persuading the government’s creditors in the bond markets that it will continue to be able to pay its debts.The gameIn our game you get to try your hand at designing a successful budget. Can you keep backbenchers happy without upsetting the bond markets? And can you do it all while keeping the books balanced?Just like the real chancellor, you begin in the red.At the spring statement, Reeves had left herself £9.9bn of “headroom” against her fiscal rules, which require day-to-day spending to be matched by receipts by the end of this parliament.However, the buffer is widely expected to have been more than wiped out by three things: higher borrowing costs; welfare U-turns; and an anticipated productivity downgrade from the Office forBudgetResponsibility.Taken together, the Institute for Fiscal Studies predicts government borrowing could be £22bn higher in 2029-30 than forecast in March. In response, Reeves would need £12bn from tax rises and spending cuts just to meet her fiscal rule. Rebuilding her £9.9bn headroom would require a full £22bn.However, she is widely expected to go further. Leaving a slim margin of headroom again could rekindle bond market fears. Most City investors expect a new buffer in the region of £20bn.Solving this is all part of your task. You need to reduce the shortfall by £12bn, you’ll see the yellow bar changing in response to your policy calls. But keep an eye on the alerts on how the markets– who may not be convinced by a £12bn turnaround – and polls are responding as you go. Good luck!(If you get stuck watch out for treasury briefings –chart icon– and political notes –note icon– for guidance.){{ html }}Sources and notes: the estimates of income from each of the measures and for the current government balance come from a variety of economists and thinktanks and the government’s own assumptions; Capital Economics, Resolution Foundation, Institute for Fiscal Studies, National Institute of Economic and Social Research, IPPR and HMs Revenue and Customs. These estimates are often based on those economists’ own assumptions about future growth, inflation, collection rates and other variables. So this game should be seen as illustrative of the relative sizes of the impacts of measures. Do not attempt to drive a major economy on the basis of this game."

Sign up hereDamian Carringtonin BelémThu 20 Nov 2025 07.35 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 07.36 ESTShareIt is easy to criticise the UN climate conferences. But unless you’ve been, there’s one wonderful, almost miraculous, thing that you may not be aware of: it is a beautiful gathering of humanity, people from virtually every country on Earth, all thrown together in common cause.What’s more, many are incredibly smart, passionate and dedicating their lives to fighting the climate crisis. The more of them you meet, the more your hope grows that global heating can be defeated.So I want to introduce you to just two of them I’ve met here at Cop30 in Belém, Brazil. The first is an extraordinary firebrand orator from Panama, whose uncompromising clarity shines through the dim halls of Cop. “We are literally paying criminals to kill us [by] giving subsidies to fossil fuel producers,” he says.The second is one of the brightest young climate activists I have ever met, and she has a new project that may just change the world.More from these two inspiring young people, after today’s climate headlines.Essential readsTrump’s anti-climate agenda could result in 1.3m more deaths globally, analysis findsTropical cyclone Fina intensifies to category two and could hit NT coast on FridayEngland’s Beth Mead: ‘If we don’t adapt to climate change, football becomes a privilege, not a right‘In focusView image in fullscreenJuan Carlos Monterrey-Gómez, special representative for climate change for Panama, at Cop29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, last year.Photograph: Murad Sezer/ReutersJuan Carlos Monterrey Gómez is the special representative for climate change for Panama. You’d spot him easily at Cop by his trademark hat. Cop30 here in Brazil has been dubbed the “Cop of Truth” by Brazilian presidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva, meaning now is the time to face up to the reality of the climate crisis.Monterrey-Gómez picked up this challenge in his peerless way: “These are the truths that we really need to internalise in this ‘Cop of Truth’.”“Truth number one, we’re failing. The objective of the UN climate convention is to stabilise greenhouse gases. But in the past 33 years, instead of cutting them, we have more than doubled. If we look at biodiversity, we’re on a pathway to assassinate half of all living creatures.”“Truth number two is that we don’t need more reports, dialogues, committees of experts, roundtables. The science is quite clear. Fossil fuels are making the planet hotter and the best way to stop that heating is to phase them out.”“Truth number three is that the climate crisis, the biodiversity crisis, the land crisis, the ocean crisis, the plastic pollution crisis, they’re all the same crisis. They are the product of an economic system that favours unhinged production, that pollutes everything in its way to the detriment of humans.”His final truth: “We are literally paying criminals to kill us. We’re giving subsidies to fossil fuel producers, when we know everything they produce kills us, quickly or slowly.”Monterrey-Gómez said Cop30 must deliver a clear statement on the phase-out of fossil fuels. It took 28 years of Cops for them to even get a mention, thanks to obstruction from petrostates. “If we cannot even mention fossil fuels, if we cannot commit to protect forests, what the heck are we doing here?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Recent international court rulings have clearly concluded that a stable climate is a human right. But the people who will suffer the most are those yet to be born, so how can their rights be protected?“The international regime needs to have legal imagination, so that we can start talking about the rights of future generations. There is legal innovation happening in the Amazon, in Aotearoa/New Zealand, to give legal personhood to rivers, to whales, so they can stand in front of a court of law and ask for [justice]. But future generations don’t have that personhood.”Siddiqa and her team have now begun collecting citizen testimony from young people around the world on how the climate crisis is taking away their human right to a healthy environment, to safety, to clean air. These will be built into an international declaration on the rights of future generations.“Who is a fossil-free world for? It’s for future generations,” she said.“If we arrive at a place where future generations have legal personhood, we can sue the hell out of corporations in a way that has been difficult to date.

I guess my role in life is going to be to combat that.”With people such as Siddiqa and Monterrey-Gómez on the climate case, and many more like them, I feel optimistic that, as Martin Luther King Jr put it, the long arc of the moral universe will bend toward justice.Read more:Divide over fossil fuels phaseout can be bridged, Cop30 president saysTurkey to host Cop31 climate conference after Australia drops push to hold it in AdelaideChina doesn’t want to lead alone on climate policies, senior adviser warnsTo read the complete version of this newsletter –subscribe to receive Down to Earthin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentDown to Earth newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

On 29 October2024,devastating stormshit the Iberian peninsula, bringing the heaviest rain so far this century. The national alert system sounded at around8.30pm local time; by then, however, flood waters had already broken through the city.Scientists saythe explosive downpours were linked to climate change.I had been working with my husband, Miguel Carpio, for over 30 years. We would spend the day together, we would meet at work. With our daughter, Sara, and her boyfriend, we went everywhere – the gym, the dentist, the hairdresser – as a happy and close-knit family.View image in fullscreenToñi Garcia in Benetûsser, a year after the storm in which her husband and daughter died.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianIn my house, there wasn’t a pair of trousers, a dress or a sock that we didn’t buy together. In my family, there was never a day without an “I love you” or a hug.On 29 October 2024, we left work at half past four in the afternoon and arrived home at around five to our apartment on the fourth floor of a building in Benetússer, on the outskirts of Valencia. Despite working for the regional government, we had received no warning about the rains that were falling in the interior of the Valencian community.But my daughter – a nurse working at La Fe hospital on the intensive care ward – was scared. At half past six, she asked me from the balcony if the town could get flooded. I told her it was impossible. I’m 60 years old and I had never seen it flood. My elders had always led me to believe that it was impossible. Still, as a civil servant who knows the system, I knew that if there was any danger, the authorities would contact us via WhatsApp or text. I made her look at her mobile phone. She had no messages, no alerts. We asked my husband, who also had nothing.View image in fullscreenA flooded slum area in Picanya, near Valencia, on 30 October 2024.Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesI tried to reassure her, saying: “Look, they haven’t warned us about anything, so nothing is going to happen.” My husband and I continued doing things at home. She stayed on the balcony, worried, and at exactly quarter past seven in the evening, she cried: “Mum, Dad, come, come.” We looked out and saw a very low tongue of brown water, less than 15cm deep.The first thing we thought to do was to take the car on to the street in case water seeped into the underground garage. My husband went downstairs and my daughter, who drives a separate car, joined him. I stayed on the balcony and called my sister, who was in Valencia city, to tell her not to come over that night.But not long after they went down, I heard a strange noise in the background. It was as if something heavy was being dragged on asphalt. I looked to the right and suddenly saw a huge wave carrying a wall of reeds. And that scared me, because right afterwards, water started coming in, very strong and with high pressure. It was dragging containers, and soon it was dragging cars. It lifted up all the cars that were parked on the street and started to carry them away. I hung up on my sister and immediately the power went out. We had no electricity.About the seriesThis is climate breakdown was put together in collaboration with the Climate Disaster Project at University of Victoria, Canada.Read more.Production teamI went down the stairs from the fourth floor to the garage, but I stopped at what we call the street courtyard, where the water was already 2.5 metres deep. I still had one more floor to get to the garage, but I couldn’t reach it. So I ran back up the stairs and called my daughter’s boyfriend. The two have an app on their phones so they can know where the other is at any time. He tried to find her, and at nine minutes past eight in the evening, he told me it was impossible: “We’ve all tried, all our friends. I can’t locate her.”I had been hoping that her mobile phone had fallen into the water, that she had lost it, that she and my husband had been safe in a higher area, that they had been able to get out of the garage. But they hadn’t. Before the Valencian regional government had even raised the alarm, the two of them and a neighbour had drowned. It wasn’t until late on the night of the 31st – with the help of a water-pumping truck and an expert team of divers – that they found them.I remember the sounds well. The water was rushing with tremendous force. It was like a raging sea, fierce, stopping at nothing. The level kept rising. After the ground-floor doors burst open, the walls were hit by cars and lorries that were being swept away by the water. The rumble of cars smashing into the pillars is a sound that I will never forget.View image in fullscreenCars partly submerged in flood waters on the western outskirts of Valencia.Photograph: Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty ImagesNot only did 229 people die that day, but there were thousands of people who were saved by the skin of their teeth. People climbed up to the first and second floors. Schoolchildren were rescued by tying sheets together so they could scramble up. We also heard a woman and two men calling for help, who had probably been left clinging on to the fence. We tried to focus our torches on them from home, but they weren’t bright enough. We threw them sofa cushions, furniture, and a neighbour even threw them a tyre, but the water was so strong and rough that it was impossible. We didn’t see them grab hold, and about two and a half hours after I heard them, they stopped making any noise. I never found out what happened to them.‘Mud on our hands; blood on his’: fury lingers one year after Spain’s deadly floodsRead moreThe morning after, we still had hope of finding my husband and daughter. But the lights weren’t working, we had no water, and the authorities weren’t answering our calls. It was a hellish situation of darkness, death and institutional silence. People were looking for their loved ones. Sara’s boyfriend’s family came to my house covered up to their chests in mud. I don’t know how they got there, because it was impossible to walk around or cross the street. There were rows of cars piled up, along with furniture and various objects. The situation was Dantesque. It was total, apocalyptic destruction. We couldn’t believe what we were seeing.I was one of the first members of a victim’s family to publicly denounce those responsible on television. I knew exactly who was responsible: the Valencian regional government. I reproached them for it, I denounced them publicly in the media, I asked for help, I asked for legal advice, I proposed that I would fight for my husband and my daughter and for all the victims until the end. I even suggested that if I did not see justice here in Spain, I would go to the European Union, to Brussels, and that is what I did, I went to the parliament. And to this day, I will continue to fight for what I believe they died unjustly for, because it was due to a lack of prevention.View image in fullscreenWater-ravaged cars  piled up in Paiporta, near Valencia, a month after the floods.Photograph: Eva Manez/ReutersI always say that on 29 October 2024, like me, many families also died, when we lost our loved ones. It is very difficult to move on because we are broken, we are devastated with grief. We have lacked institutional support. We have not yet been able to mourn our loved ones because we are still fighting for them. We continue to demand the truth, which we still do not know. We demand justice. All those who failed us Valencians that day because they were not there to protect us should have resigned. Until that happens – and our struggle continues – it is impossible to mourn.I have been very fortunate because I have had the best people in my life. The ones who have made me happy. I have had the greatest gift in life, which has been them both. And they leave me with a legacy of wonderful memories. I insist that I feel lucky because I knew love, I knew affection.Yesterday, I was with my psychiatrist. He had to increase the dose of the antidepressant I am taking. I told him that we have no life, that until this is over and they admit their mistake, we cannot mourn, we cannot be well, we cannot remember or commemorate them, or live our lives. Because we continue to fight. And now our priority is to continue fighting, for my family and for all those victims.For all those people who do not have strength, I will find it.The interview was conducted shortly before thefirst anniversary of the Valencia floods.Just a few days after the anniversary,Carlos Mazón, the conservative president of Valencia who was widely criticised for his handling of the disaster,resigned.Design and development byHarry FischerandPip Lev.Picture research by Jim Hedge"

Do I want to see it? Or is it something that will make me cringe and want to hide under the sofa? I do like Alan Partridge. He’s kind of terrifying but amazing, so now that I know I’ve been a part of Alan Partridge, I should check it out.When you first worethe green dressin Atonement, did you realise how iconic it would be?MurdomaniaI thought it was a bloody good dress. It never actually lasted. It was so fragile that, any time you touched the front, it would completely break, so they had to make a load of different fronts. By the end, I was thoroughly sick with having the dress remade on me. But it’s a beautiful dress and I had no idea that it would have the life that it did.I’m a huge fan of British cinema, particularly British kitchen sink dramas from the swinging 60s. If you could have been part of a different era of film-making, which would it be?Kal_85I’m going to go for the 30s or 40s, because I love the fast machinegun dialogue; the intelligent, witty, larger-than-life characters, thinking fast. I’m thinking His Girl Friday vibes, Bette Davis, or The Philadelphia Story with Katharine Hepburn whacking lines back like it’s a tennis match.View image in fullscreenSwordplay … Keira Knightley with Kevin McNally in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End, 2007.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyWhat is one habit or skill from one of the characters you’ve played that you have adopted in your daily life?AeterniaI’m pretty good at sword-fighting from doing three years on Pirates. I played Robin Hood’s daughter [in the 2001 TV movie Princess of Thieves] when I was 15, then I did King Arthur when I was 18 where I had to do a knights’ boot camp with a lot of archery. This summer, we bought the kids one of those sucky archery sets for the garden. I got a bullseye, so I was very cool for about five seconds to a bunch of 10-year-olds. I wish the football had stayed. My 10-year-old plays a lot of football. She’s just watched Bend It Like Beckham and was like, ‘What happened to you?’ It’s a good question.Do you believe in the paranormal?LauraLizaNo. But I did see a ghost in the Chateau Marmont, the big hotel in LA where John Belushi died. I feel like everyone’s seen a ghost in the Chateau Marmont. It was the middle of the day – I hadn’t been out the night before, so I wasn’t, you know, in any kind of state. He had a burgundy shirt, black hair. I thought it was a man sitting in my room. I said: “I’m really sorry, this is my room.” When he turned, he disappeared. My brother and my mum were in the other room, and my mum came in and said: “Who were you talking to?” I don’t actually believe in ghosts, but I have seen that one.View image in fullscreenTragic figure … Keira Knightley with Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Anna Karenina, 2012.Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarNever Let Me Go is one of the saddest films I have ever seen. After seeing it I went into a depression for about a week. Did it have the same effect on you?Inversight_26No. Sorry. That’s awful. I remember my reaction from the book because it’s so shocking, like a slow-motion horror movie. I’m sorry this person was depressed by it. Yes, it was sad. It should provoke a reaction, so I guess that’s good. I’m not a method actor. I don’t mean for characters to rub off on me, even if you are conjuring up an emotion. Anna Karenina was the big one because she’s such a tragic figure and she feels so trapped. I remember at the end of it, my then boyfriend, now husband, was like: “I don’t want to live with Anna Karenina any more.” She wasn’t fun.Can you see yourself still rocking it in40 years’ time, like Helen Mirren and Meryl Streep?VirgilHiltsMaybe. Obviously, Helen and Meryl are amazing. But I quite like the idea of retirement: sitting in the garden and being quiet.Do you think West Ham have at last resolved their midfield crisis, and where on the table do you see us finishing this season?TAHarvey[Answering before Graham Potter was sacked.] Based on our recent signings: a new central midfielder, a new left-back, a new centre-back … a centre-forward – Callum Wilson – that was the free loan. We’ve got our top players: [Lucas] Paquetá, [Aaron] Wan-Bissaka … [Crysencio] Summerville is fit again. I’m going to be quietly confident and say we are going to finish 12th. Graham Potter knows what he’s doing.What is your go-to sanity saver?ShiresA hundred per cent drawing, while I listen to things. I suppose the sanity saver is not listening to my lines, and going for a podcast or a book. I’ll be listening to Alan Partridge next, for sure!View image in fullscreenBall game … Keira Knightley as Juliette ‘Jules’ Paxton in Bend It Like Beckham, 2002.Photograph: Bskyb/AllstarNot a question, just a very respectful acknowledgment that writing and illustrating a children’s book is very impressive. I look forward to seeing it and hope it does well!RuthlessCosmopolitanThat is incredibly sweet. I hope you like it, whoever you are, because you might just look at it and go: “Oh, bloody hell.” I’ve always loved drawing. I draw when I learn my lines. They’re normally old men’s faces with very detailed lines. For some reason – I think it’s because I’m dyslexic – so I have to get the words off the page as quickly as possible. I record the whole script, then listen to it while doing these quite intricate drawings to get the lines into my head. I get into a really meditative state, which I love. My scripts are full of pictures of old men’s faces. Now that my husband and friends know I do it, they collect pictures of old men’s faces to give me. But I don’t think I’d like to go on Sky’s Portrait Artist of the Year, because then I couldn’t learn my lines. If I’ve got some dude sitting in the room, that wouldn’t work at all.I Love You Just the Same, written and illustrated by Keira Knightley, is published by Simon & Schuster (£30).

Lung cancer, specifically, at the moment – 50,000 cases of which are diagnosed each year in the UK and which is the most common cause of cancer-related death – but with the potential to prevent many more types in the future.That such a fantastic possibility is moving out of the realms of the fantastical is because of the progress that has been made understanding the body’s immune system and the work it does zapping (medical term) so many cells, probably on a daily basis, when they first start sending out signals that all is not well within their own bodies, and preventing them from multiplying. Until and unless, of course, the day comes when the signals are muted or missed and cancer results. Survival rates for the disease have doubled in the last 50 years, but diagnoses themselves are on the rise, so the race to defeat it continues without cease.The new understanding of how our bodies catch and clear so many potential disasters, however, means that there is now a known interval, a pre-cancerous stage which it is thought could last up to 10 years, in which we could intervene if we knew how.Enter, to all possible fanfare – though everything about her suggests she would eschew it – Prof Sarah Blagden. Who does know how, and is going to start intervening if she can just get the funding for the next clinical trial she needs to run.We meet some of the people under her care, including 68-year-old Trevor from Portsmouth who has melanoma with secondaries in his liver. His wife told him for a year to get his mole checked out. “I should have,” he says. “But this is life.” “Typical Navy man,” says his daughter, Katherine, not wryly. He is now part of the professor’s current trial. His immune system is being trained to attack the cancer cells that were once invisible to it. The growths on his liver are now static. In their consultations we are presented with the rare sight of the doctor looking happier than the patient. You can almost see the sense of triumph – so quiet, but sothere– beginning to build in her. It’s amazing.Prof Blagden’s ultimate goal is to develop a single vaccine that will prevent multiple types of cancer. That is what will help patients like Ella, who has Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which causes a mutation on a tumour-suppressing gene and means carriers have a highly increased risk of developing cancer, especially as children and young adults. Ella had a tennis ball-sized tumour removed from her adrenal gland when she was nine months old and had breast cancer resulting in a double mastectomy three years ago. She is still in her 20s. She is in one of Prof Blagden’s trial groups too, which is working on the potential seen in metformin (a drug usually connected with diabetes treatment) to turn down the particular cellular overactivity in LFS patients, and which could allow a repurposing that would further speed the creation of a multi-faceted vaccine.You could weep for the suffering, and also for the minds concentrating not just on alleviating but on banishing it. For Prof Blagden and her team’s extraordinary, intelligent vision (“I have a big idea … ” she says at the start of the film) and dedication, for all the research and researchers preceding her, for the uniting of people and the technologies they have built to defeat this single foe that kills so many of us and our loved ones.You could also weep, alas, for Prof Blagden’s attempts to secure funding. All the results she has so far are promising and her patients, she knows, so close to being helped in truly unprecedented ways. “I cannot imagine abandoning them at this point.” But her most recent application was refused. “I was just beside myself.” She is being interviewed by the film-makers at her desk when the email comes through. She breaks off to read the news. The funders have deemed her worthy. “This is … a really important pivot point in what we’re doing,” she says, which is Blagden-speak for “Come in, cancer, your time is fucking UP!”The film ends with her holding the first dose of vaccine in her hands, with the news that Ella is still cancer-free and on the new trial, and with Trevor hearing that he has no signs of any active cancer deposits any more. “In my wildest dreams, I didn’t expect that,” says Trevor. The professor just grins. She did, you see. She did.Cancer Detectives: Finding the Cures is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsDocumentaryTV reviewTelevisionCancer researchreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Like Christmas Day, Black Friday has long since ceased to be a mere “day”. Yuletide now seems to start roughly when Strictly does, and Black Friday kicked off around Halloween, judging by the landfill of exclamation-marked emails weighing down my inbox.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Black Friday is a devil worth dancing with if you want to save money on products you’ve had your eye on – and it can pay to start dancing now. Some of the Filter’s favourite items are already floating around at prices clearly designed to make them sell out fast. Other deals won’t land until the big day itself on 28 November, or even until the daftly named Cyber Monday (1 December).As ever, we’d encourage you not to buy anything unless you really need it and have the budget to do so – readour advice on how to shop smartly.We’ll keep this page updated over the next few days with more genuine Black Friday bargains on the Filter’s favourites, from Anker battery packs to KidiZoom cameras via the espresso machine you loved more than any other product this year.How we selected these deals (and excluded others)The key toshopping smarton Black Friday, Cyber Monday or any discount event is to know what you want – and we’re here to help you target the good stuff. We’ve tested thousands of products at the Filter in 2025 and warmly recommended hundreds of them, including many that have genuinely good Black Friday discounts.Instead of listing price cuts on all the products we’ve featured, we’ve focused on the things you’ve liked the most this year, and looked for deals that undercut their long-term average prices by a significant amount. Ideally, their Black Friday price will be their lowest of the year.We don’t take retailers at their word on discount size, either. Amazon may say it’s “70%” off the RRP, but we study the price history of every item using independent tools such asthe Camelizerto find out how generous a discount really is. If an item’s price has been all over the place in 2025, we’ll give the average price below instead of a “was …” price, so you can judge how good a deal it is.Q&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best early Black Friday deals on the Filter’s favourite productsThe best home dealsShark vacuum cleanerView image in fullscreenShark PowerDetect vacuum, £314 (was £549)£314 at Shark£314 at AmazonA vacuum cleaner that empties itself?

Its price cut isn’t quite the 38% Amazon suggests, because it cost £579 throughout 2025, but this is still a legitimately good deal.Damp-destroying dehumidifierView image in fullscreenProBreeze dehumidifier, from £151.99 (was £189.99)£151.99 at Amazon£159.99 at ProBreezeThis “workhorse”, which “extracted moisture powerfully” in ourbest dehumidifierstest, has tumbled to its lowest price of the year (except for a few days in May, because no one buys dehumidifiers in May). If the recent cold snap gave you the condensation blues, here’s your chance to snap up the ProBreeze for a chunk below its average Amazon price of just over £180.Cuddly heated throwView image in fullscreenBeurer HD150 heated throw, £79.99 (was £84.99)£79.99 at AmazonBeurer’s “soft and sumptuous” fleece blanket was crowned “best throw overall” in our guide to thebest electric blanketsthanks to its ability to get toasty fast without using much energy. A fiver off is not a massive discount, but this is its cheapest recent price on Amazon, where it normally costs £84.99 – and other retailers still want over £100 for it. We’ll bring you any non-Amazon deals that emerge in the coming days.Google video doorbellView image in fullscreenGoogle Nest doorbell, from £119.98 (was £179.99)£119.98 at Amazon£129 at CurrysSort the cold-callers from the welcome visitors when they’re still metres away from your front door, with this outstanding battery-powered doorbell that crashes to its lowest price since Black Friday 2023. Andy Shaw named it thebest video doorbelloverall, but lamented that you also have to fork out for aNest Aware subscriptionat £80 a year to save recordings.Budget electric blanketView image in fullscreenSlumberdown Sleepy Nights electric blanket, king size, from £30.59(was £45.99)£30.59 (king size) at Amazon£34.20 at SlumberdownThis Slumberdown Sleepy Nights performed admirably inEmily Peck’s testing, heating quickly to a temperature that was comfortable to keep our reviewer warm through the night.

It’s the king-size one that’s been discounted.Subscription-free video doorbellView image in fullscreenEufy Security doorbell E340, £74.99 (avg £151.29)£74.99 at AmazonLots of video doorbells and home surveillance systems come with a recurring subscription to access some of their features, which you may wish to avoid. If so, then the Eufy Video Doorbell E340 was Andy Shaw’s pick in his testing of thebest video doorbellsout there. He liked the E340 precisely because of its dual camera setup to make keeping an eye on parcels a breeze, plus the onboard storage to stick it to cloud storage. Reliability of movement detection needed some work, though. At £75 from Amazon, it’s also at its lowest price ever this Black Friday from the big online retailer.The best kitchen dealsVersatile espresso makerView image in fullscreenDe’Longhi Stilosa espresso machine, £84.55 (was £89)£84.55 at AmazonThe promise of “ludicrously tasty” espresso and “perfect microfoam for silky cappuccinos and flat whites” proved so irresistible that this was one of the Filter recommendations you loved most in 2025. Our writer Sasha Muller was already wowed by its affordability in hisespresso machinestest, and it’s rarely discounted at all, so we’re not too sad to see it drop just a few pounds for Black Friday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Its compatibility, compactness and coffee impressed the Filter’s cuppa connoisseur, Sasha Muller, enough to be named “best capsule machine” in his bid to find thebest coffee machines.Ninja air fryerView image in fullscreenNinja Double Stack XL, £188 (was £269.99)£188 at Ninja£188 at AmazonIf you’re still holding out on buying an air fryer, here’s a rare chance to grab a big-name, big-capacity Ninja without the big price tag. Not quite so big, anyway. Rachel Ogden named the Double Stack XL “best compact air fryer” in her guide to thebest air fryers, but with its 9.5lL capacity and four cooking levels, this thing can cook alot. Still not cheap, but far below its average price of £229.The best blenderView image in fullscreenBraun PowerBlend 9, from £140 (was £199)£140 at Amazon£148.97 at John LewisYou can spend about £500 on a premium blender, but this superb model from Braun costs below £200 even at full price – something ourbest blenderstester, Rachel Ogden, could hardly believe when she named it “best overall”. Hold on to your smoothie, Rachel, because it’s now less than £150, and not just at Amazon.Tefal air fryerView image in fullscreenTefal Easy Fry Dual XXL, £119.99 (was £199.99)£119.99 at AmazonTefal is known mostly for its ActiFry tech, so when Rachel Ogden crowned the Tefal Easy Fry Dual XXL as thebest air fryer, it made sense. She found it to be a sublime all-rounder in her testing, handling both chips and frozen food very well. With an 11-litre capacity, it’s also Tefal’s largest dual zone air fryer, making it handy for cooking a lot of food for larger families when you need to. Its price of £104 at Amazon is its best ever.The best electric kettleView image in fullscreenBosch Sky Kettle, £64.99 (avg £85.38)£64.99 at John Lewis£64.99 at AmazonThe Bosch Sky Kettle isour favourite electric kettle– as Rachel Ogden noted in her testing, it wins because it is a “good all-rounder that will suit most people”. That’s down to a number of factors, including how easy it is to pour, plus strong build quality and generally decent boil time. For £65 (a return to its best ever price), that seems like a useful reduction.The best personal care appliance dealsSunrise alarm clockView image in fullscreenLumie Sunrise Alarm, from £29.99 (was £49)£29.99 at Amazon£37.49 at BootsOne of your favourite Filter recommendations of the year, this gentlesunrise alarm clockwill wake you up with kittens purring, birdsong, gently brightening light – or a plain old alarm sound if you prefer. It’s been around for a few years and saw a price hike in 2022 (cost-of-waking-up crisis?) before settling at just under £50 from most retailers, so this is a deal worth grabbing.Water flosserView image in fullscreenWaterpik Ultra Professional, from £59.99 (was £91)£59.99 at Amazon£73 at CurrysBlast the gunk from your gums without having to grapple with floss. The Waterpik Ultra is a countertop model so it takes up more space than the cordless type, but this gives it more versatility and saw it score top marks with ourwater flossertester Alan Martin. If you’d rather avoid Amazon, you can find it discounted by other retailers, albeit not by as much.The best IPL deviceView image in fullscreenPhilips Lumea 9900, £404.99 (avg £501.33)£404.99 at AmazonIPL (intense pulsed light) hair remover devices promise to banish stubbly regrowth without the pain of waxing and epilation – at a price. The Philips Lumea 9900, Lise Smith’s pick forbest IPL deviceoverall, has cost as much as £599.99 for much of the year, and occasional discounts rarely go below £450. Amazon’s current price shaves more than £40 off any other Black Friday deal we’ve found.The best beauty dealsA bargain beauty Advent calendarView image in fullscreenW7 Beauty Blast Advent calendar, £16.95 (was £19.95)£16.95 at AmazonAdvent calendars are a Christmas staple, and we’ve seen lots of brands try to put a different spin on them in the past – beauty Advent calendars are some of the most prominent. This W7 Beauty Blast calendar provides excellent value for money at a deal-busting £16.95 from Amazon, especially as it provides genuinely useful products for most folks.

Is it weird that facelifts are becoming normalized for women my age, or am I being too judgmental?Why do I want this even though I don’t want this? Are there any risks or side effects that might sober me up enough to commit tonotgetting a facelift in the future? I feel like I’m going crazy.– Maybe I Need A Lobotomy Instead?You do not need a lobotomy – but only because beauty culture has basically lobotomized us all already, by “reducing the complexity of psychic life”. (At least, that’s howpsychiatrist Maurice Partridgeonce described the effects of the barbaric brain surgery.)Feeling “self-conscious”? Skip the inner work – get a facelift! Dealing with“irrelevance” in the office? Don’t question the prioritization of labor above all – get a facelift! Struggling to“recognize” yourself as you age?Forget reckoning with your mortality – get a facelift! “Dissatisfied” withhow you look on FaceTime calls? Why bother grappling with appearance anxiety in therapy when you could just … get a facelift?Judging by the many recent articles on the growing popularity of this elective cosmetic surgery, pulled-taut skin is the answer to all of life’s psychic ills.This fantasy is reflected in the figures: the number of facelifts performed in the United States increased an impressive (or depressive?)17%since thestart of the pandemic. Google searches for “facelift”doubledover the same time period. “[Plastic surgery] patients are now 10 years younger as compared to pre-pandemic,” New York-based plastic surgeonDr Robert Schwarczrevealed in a press release, “and are coming in their mid-30s instead of mid-40s.”Plenty of celebrities and influencers have publicly confirmed their lifts as of late, includingKris Jenner(70),Catt Sadler(51) andVanessa Giuliani(36). On her new album, Lily Allen, 40, sings, “I feel so drawn, so old / I booked myself a facelift”. Actor Jennifer Lawrence, 35, justtold the New Yorker: “Believe me, I’m gonna [get one]!” Rhytidectomy-mania has even reached “regular” folks:real estate agents,dudes at the gym, young women onpayment planswith their plastic surgeons.It’s no wonder you (kind of) want one! This is how desire works.Contrary to the beauty industry’s favorite marketing line – “do it foryou!” – no desire springs authentic and unbidden from the depths of one’s innermost soul. Rather, as philosopher René Girard argued in his 1961 theory of “mimetic desire”, all human desire is derivative. We want the things we want, in other words – the Labubu, the barrel jeans, the de-aged face – because other people want them.Mimesis “is to psychology what gravity is to physics”,Girard scholar James Alison wrotein the 1998 book The Joy of Being Wrong: powerful, unavoidable, universal.When it comes to beauty specifically, what we want to look like changes as technology changes what it’spossibleto look like. New facelift innovations – less invasive techniques, more “natural” results, subtler scars, faster recovery times,Buy Now Pay Later– lower the barrier to entry. Access is democratized; demand skyrockets.The “cosmetic transparency” movement also plays a part here. Celebrities who openly share the procedures they’ve had destigmatize cosmetic work and provide people with the blueprints to A-list beauty. In a media announcement, New York-based plastic surgeonDr Ari Hoschandersaid he believes “this growing openness toward plastic surgery … is one of the reasons why younger patients are seeking these procedures”.All of this contributes to what I callaesthetic inflation, or the normalization of more and more extreme cosmetic interventions over time.In summation: You’re right. Youarebeing “made to want” a facelift.Personally, I think the number one reason you shouldn’t get a facelift is – in your own words – you don’t want one.But there are plenty of other reasons to opt out, too!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now he wants me and my mother to get work doneI want to ignore beauty culture. But I’ll never get anywhere if I don’t look a certain wayBesides an aesthetically “botched” outcome, complications from facelift surgerycan includehematoma, infection, nerve damage, hair loss, scarring,deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolismand, in exceedingly rare cases,death(the ultimate anti-ager!). What’s more, “adverse psychological reactions to facelift operations are shown to occur in about 50% of patients, with depression and anxiety being the most common,” according to a 2022 paper in theAesthetic Surgery Journal.The procedure can cost anywhere from$8,500to$200,000. That’s enough for a potential down payment on a home, a car, a vacation, years of psychoanalysis or a sizable donation to theNational Center to Reframe Aging.Facelifts also perpetuate ageist, classist, all-around-oppressive beauty norms. (Of course, facelifts aremotivatedby ageism, classism and oppression as well, but crucially,do little to alleviate the material disadvantagesindividuals experience because of these systems and do nothing to challenge these systems – as opposed to, say, gender-affirming surgery, whichdoeschallenge limiting gender ideology.) And since “individual acts of conformity can strengthen these norms”, in the words ofpolitical philosopher Dr Clare Chambers, “individual acts of resistance really can matter”.Last but not least: itisa little weird that beauty culture is convincing so many people to surgically saw off some of their facial skin and sew it back on tighter.Am I being judgmental? Yes! But judgment, like mimetic desire, is both human and unavoidable. We judge. We can’t help it. (Beautyitselfis a judgment; see: Kant’s 1790 treatise on beauty, which is literally titled The Critique of Judgment.)So if we must judge – and we must! – I guess I’d rather find it strange to get a facelift at 36 than find it strange to age.Share your experienceAsk us a questionDo you have a beauty question for Ask Ugly?

But ‘Fu Xia’, as she’s known, has had a profound effect on food lovers in China, tooByLeslie T ChangThu 20 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 09.36 ESTShareEvery autumn in the mid-00s, when I lived inChina, my friend Scarlett Li would invite me to Shanghai to eat hairy crab. Named for the spiky fur on their legs and claws, the crabs are said to have the best flavour during the ninth month of the lunar calendar. They’re steamed and served whole, with a dip of rice vinegar spiked with ginger. The most prized specimens come from Yangcheng Lake near Suzhou, which is not far from Scarlett’s home town of Wuxi. She had moved to Hong Kong as a child, attended high school and college in Australia, and returned to China to pursue a career as an entrepreneur. Despite her years abroad, she remained Chinese through and through – and eating hairy crab with her, I became Chinese, too.Beginning in the Tang dynasty in the seventh century, crabs were harvested from the lakes and estuaries of the Yangtze delta and sent as tribute to the imperial court. Twelfth-century Hangzhou had specialised crab markets and dedicated crab restaurants. “I have lusted after crabs all my life,” wrote the 17th-century playwright Li Yu. “From the first day of the crab season until the last day they are sold, I … do not let a single evening pass without eating them …. Dear crab, dear crab, you and I, are we to be lifelong companions?”In Invitation to a Banquet: The Story of ChineseFood, Fuchsia Dunlop traces the history of this remarkable cuisine through 30 dishes, from slow-braised pork belly to steamed rice. (There are 10 mentions of hairy crab – not to be confused with crab that’s roasted, baked, shredded, stuffed into soup dumplings or steamed buns, or marinated in liquor and served raw in a dish called drunken crab, which gets its own chapter.) Dunlop, who is British, explores the staggering ingenuity and range of a cuisine that she feels has not won the respect it deserves in the world of fine dining: “Only the Chinese have placed [cooking] at the very core of their identity. For the ancient Chinese, the transformation of raw ingredients through cooking marked the boundary not only between humans and their savage ancestors, but between the people of the civilised world (that is, China and its antecedent states) and the barbarians who lived around its edges.”The result is a gastronomy that is unparalleled for its diversity, sophistication, subtlety and “sheer deliciousness”. Many supposedly modern ideas about eating, Dunlop points out, have been accepted in China for centuries. Consuming the freshest meat, fish and produce, local and in season, has been important since the earliest dynasties. “Certainly to have a fresh fish and to cause it to become unfresh is a terrible act,” wrote Yuan Mei, an 18th-century gourmet and poet. Educated gentlemen through the ages have searched obsessively for the freshest bamboo shoots, the finest vinegar, or the perfect bowl of congee. (It tastes best, according to one connoisseur, when made with rainwater in early spring.) Ingredients should be cooked in small quantities using refined methods that reveal theirbenwei, or “root flavours”.View image in fullscreenA hairy crab festival in Huai’an, Jiangsu province, in October.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesThe passage of seasons was marked by the fruits and vegetables available in the markets, starting with apricots and cherries in early summer, followed by peaches and melons, then chestnuts, grapes and oranges at the mid-autumn festival and goose pears and quinces at the onset of winter. Everyone knew that the best handmade tofu came from Xiba in Sichuan, just as Nanjing was the place for salted duck, Pixian for chilli bean paste, and the hills around Hangzhou for the most delicate leaves of dragon well green tea. “Concern for the provenance and terroir of ingredients, so important to modern western gourmets, was not the invention of the French or Californians, but has been a preoccupation in China for more than 2,000 years,” Dunlop writes. The Chinese also pioneered imitation meat, free-range chickens, molecular gastronomy, sushi, tofu, soy sauce, ramen and restaurants, which were fashionable gathering places in 12th-century Kaifeng, six centuries before they first appeared in Paris.Pleasure in eating has always been paired with the need for restraint, and classical texts warned against overindulgence. “Even if there is plenty of meat, [a gentleman] should not eat more meat than rice,” counselled Confucius in the Analects. The ideal has always been to achieve moderation and balance – yinand yang,heating and cooling ingredients, main dishes and rice – in order to nourish the body while living in harmony with nature.For most of recorded history, ordinary Chinese ate whole grains, legumes and vegetables, used small quantities of meat and fish for flavour, and threw almost nothing away. In rice they found a staple grain that supplies more calories per hectare than any other cereal crop, while myriad preparations of what Dunlop calls the “miraculous” soya bean deliver as much protein as dairy and meat but more economically. This nutritional efficiency allowed China to support a large population on limited arable land, with food that is healthy, satisfying and environmentally sustainable.Reading Invitation to a Banquet made me think differently about my long-ago crabfests. The Chinese eat freshwater crabs only at the peak of their season, and primarily in the Yangtze delta area near Shanghai. They are cooked and served simply, which allows their benweito shine. Restraint is built into the experience, yet the freshness, the flavours and the ritual make for meals so satisfying that I can recall them now, detail by detail, 20 years later.The seductive flavours of China’s local specialities have defined Dunlop’s career. Educated at the University of Cambridge, she first went to live in China in 1994, on a one-year scholarship at Sichuan University in Chengdu to study the government’s policy toward ethnic minorities. She was fortunate to have been sent to a place with one of China’s most distinctive cuisines and found herself taking notes on the food. She quit her studies and enrolled at the Sichuan Higher Institute of Cuisine as one of its first foreign students. Over the past three decades she has built a career explaining Chinese cooking to western readers, initially focusing on Sichuan and then expanding to other regions.View image in fullscreenDunlop making twice-cooked pork with a teacher at the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine, May 2001.Photograph: Lai WuMore surprisingly, Dunlop has gained a large following by explaining Chinese food to the Chinese. Her memoir Shark’s Fin and Sichuan Peppersold about 200,000 copies when it came out in China in 2018. Invitation to a Banquet has sold 50,000 copies since its publication there last year, and two of her cookbooks have also done well. Among Chinese food lovers and chefs, Dunlop is praised for her deep understanding of the country’s culinary history. She’s known, like a celebrity, by her first name: “Fu Xia” in Chinese.How exactly did awaiguoren– a Cambridge-educated white woman who grew up 5,000 miles away – become accepted as an authority on matters so important to the Chinese? Amid China’s rapid transition to a modern industrialised nation, traditional ways of eating and living are disappearing. It has fallen to Dunlop, an outsider, to study the history, to sift through the tradition, and to taste the dishes as if for the first time. Along the way, she has become the voice of a more authentic past. “It kind of shames us, because it’s our own culture,” He Yujia, her Chinese translator, told me. “She helps us rediscover what we’ve neglected for too long.”Almost 4,000 years ago, Chinese cooking had already developed certain distinctive traits. One was the divide between grain (fan) and vegetable or meat dishes (cai). A meal must include both, and ritual bronze vessels dating to the Shang dynasty, which began around 1760BC, differ depending on whether they were for serving grain or meat. The cutting of ingredients into small pieces, the mixing of meat and vegetables, and the use of diverse seasonings to create highly varied dishes were all in place by the Zhou dynasty, which dates to around 1046BC. (As the 20th-century writer and philosopher Lin Yutang wrote: “The whole culinary art of China depends on the art of mixture.”) From its earliest days, cooking was seen as a subtle and complex undertaking. “Governing a country,” said Laozi, the founder of Taoism, “is like cooking small fish.” His point was that it’s the attention to detail that matters.During the economic expansion of the Song dynasty, which lasted from 960 to 1279, “the world’s first true cuisine” emerged, as Dunlop writes in her cookbook Land of Fish and Rice. New varieties of rice imported from Vietnam revolutionised farming by allowing the planting of two crops a year, and innovations in cultivation increased yields. The Chinese population boomed, and sophisticated commercial networks sprang up to transport rice, sugar, tea, wine, dried hams and condiments around the country. Novelties like oranges and grapes became widely available, and tea was transformed from a luxury into a daily necessity.The material abundance of this era, Dunlop writes, spawned “a complex gastronomic culture in which food was not only cooked and enjoyed, but also elaborated, discussed and documented”. Records of the Fresh and Strange, written by a 10th-century scholar and poet, celebrated specialities of the lower Yangtze delta such as sweet pears, loquats and a “noodle so pliable that it could be tied in knots”, as Jin Feng writes in Tasting Paradise on Earth, a history of the region’s food. Su Dongpo, an imperial official and one of China’s most revered poets, wrote about humble dishes of pork and cabbage. (His recipe for turnip soup, which was recorded in 1098, survives to this day.) Appreciation of fine food was a mark of culture, like being accomplished in calligraphy, painting and poetry.View image in fullscreenA crab breeding base near Suqian City, Jiangsu province.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesIn 1127, the Song capital city of Kaifeng fell to invaders from Manchuria, forcing the remnants of the imperial court to flee south. On the shores of West Lake they built a new capital, Hangzhou, which became the largest and richest city in the world at that time. On a visit during the late 13th century, Marco Polo was impressed by the numbers of those “accustomed to dainty living, to the point of eating fish and meat at one meal”. With its mix of natives and refugees from the north, the city was something of a melting pot, which was reflected in its cooking. Northern dishes were remade with southern ingredients: shrimp was substituted for mutton, and pastries became lighter and flakier. The fusion of regional cooking styles – the art of mixture, on a large scale – created a truly national cuisine, although not everyone was pleased. “Food and drink have become all confused, with no longer any distinction between southern and northern,” one scholar complained.In The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendour, the twelfth-century gourmet Meng Yuanlao described, street by street and dish by dish, the culinary delights of Kaifeng around 1120, when he lived there as a young man: “Even if there are only two men sitting across from each other, they must use a set of bowls with fluted handles … Even if one drinks alone, such items as silver bowls are used. The fruits and vegetables are fine and exquisite.” He recalled his favourite dishes: quail eggs, fried loyang snow pears.By the time Meng wrote this, the city as he had known it no longer existed; it had fallen to invaders two decades before. Food is ephemeral, but so are places: buildings, streets, even a flourishing capital can disappear like a fondly remembered meal. At the root of the Chinese gastronomic tradition is a yearning for a lost age. Through words, we create what no longer exists in the world.Dunlop has engaged deeply with this tradition. She can pinpoint the earliest appearance in the gastronomical literature of soy sauce, the first use of the word for “stir-fry” and the etymological origins of the term dim sum.Like so many of her Chinese predecessors, she regards food with a moralist’s eye. She would like readers not just to appreciate the wonders of Chinese cooking but also to value the healthy and sustainable approach that lies behind it.In other ways, she blows up the tradition altogether. Dunlop, as a woman who cooksandwrites, breaks with a long line of male intellectuals who tended to discourse about food from a certain remove and didn’t actually cook. (The sage Mencius said: “The gentleman keeps his distance from the kitchen.”) Knowing how to eat well was a sign of refinement, but cooking itself has always been low-status. Dunlop’s classmates in culinary school were almost all young men from working-class or rural families.“If we were making pork balls, we had to pound the meat to a paste with the backs of our cleavers,” she writes. “If we were using walnuts, we had to crack them open, soak them and then, laboriously, peel off their skins.” Cooking is labour, and Dunlop can convey the painstaking multiday process of preparing a dish like braised pomelo pith with shrimp eggs while also tracing the Chinese predilection for using such unlikely ingredients back to the 16th century BC.Of course, Dunlop’s foreignness also sets her apart. In the extensive coverage of her work and life in the Chinese media, she is “the Cambridge graduate who came to China to cook”, “the English person with a Chinese stomach”, “the foreigner who understands Chinese food best”. “She lends legitimacy to Chinese culture and Chinese cooking at a time when Chinese people really need that affirmation,” Tzui Chuang, a Taiwanese-American food writer, told me.One of Dunlop’s goals is to rescue Chinese food from its reputation in the west as “popular, but … cheap, low-status and junky”. As she explains in Invitation to a Banquet, the earliest Chinese restaurateurs abroad – beginning with those who went to California during the Gold Rush in the 1840s – were uneducated labourers with no culinary training. The dishes that they made, like deep-fried wontons and sweet-and-sour everything, were nothing like the sophisticated cuisine back home.View image in fullscreenA chilli farmer in Fengjiang village, Hunan province, drying chillies for sauce manufacture.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesChinese food in the west remained a “bastardised form of Cantonese cuisine”, and this fed a stereotype of the Chinese as slovenly and undiscriminating eaters. Lord Macartney, the leader of a 1793 British diplomatic mission to China, described the Chinese as “foul feeders and eaters of garlic and strong-scented vegetables”. In 2002, the Daily Mail called Chinese food “the dodgiest in the world, created by a nation that eats bats, snakes, monkeys, bears’ paws, birds’ nests, sharks’ fins, ducks’ tongues and chickens’ feet”. More recently, the possibility that the Covid-19 virus emerged in a Chinese market that sold wild animals revived the old “Chinese will eat anything” tropes, though Dunlop notes that consumption of exotic species is limited to a tiny subset of the population and is controversial in China, too.She takes pains to point out that the Chinese are discerning about ingredients and have always emphasised the links between food and health. The quest for nutritious produce in China created a far more diverse array of foods than is known in the west. Dunlop devotes five pages to the “vast clan of cabbages” before moving on to “the punchy alliums, the tribe of onions and garlics”, and then to bamboo shoots, roots and tubers, gourds, mushrooms and seaweeds. She explores the unfamiliar world of vegetables that are harvested from the water, such as water chestnuts and lotus plants, a category that doesn’t exist in western cooking. She describes the fantastic range of flavours and textures that the Chinese have wrought from tofu, which can be silken or firm, smoked or spiced, stir-fried, deep-fried, frozen, toasted, pressed into sheets, soaked in brine or moulded and fermented into “a delicious state of dishevelment, as high and wild as stilton on the brink between ripeness and decay” – a reminder of the double standards that have made western gourmets devalue Chinese food in favour of their own.Dunlop also traces the surprising openness of the Chinese to foreign foods throughout history. (Her scholarship builds on Food in Chinese Culture, a classic 1977 study of Chinese food history edited by the archaeologist KC Chang.) During the Han dynasty, which lasted from 206BC to AD220, exotic foods such as grapes, pomegranates, walnuts, sesame, onions, peas, alfalfa, coriander and cucumbers entered the country from central Asia. In the Ming dynasty, which lasted from the mid-14th to the mid-17th century and was known for its isolationist policies, corn, peanuts, white potatoes and sweet potatoes arrived from the new world. Two other new world transplants, the chilli pepper and the tomato, were adopted more recently and further transformed the cuisine.For a long time historians assumed that Chinese cooking developed its enormous variety because people had to make the most of scarce resources. More recent scholarship suggests that the centrality of food drove innovation. Dunlop underscores the value that the Chinese have always placed on culinary ingenuity: pragmatism and pleasure, not poverty, were always the impetus. To understand the Chinese through their culinary history is also to see them in their best lights – as inventive, adaptable, egalitarian and open-minded. Maybe only a foreigner can see this and say this.Dunlop’s initial encounters with China took place in what she calls “this prelapsarian world of cooking”. In the early 1990s, families in Chengdu and around the country still cooked dinner on charcoal braziers, made their own pickled cabbage and smoked sausage, and shopped every day for meat and vegetables in open-air markets. In the lanes and alleys of the old city, Dunlop met knife sharpeners and tofu vendors, ate delicious noodle lunches for pennies, and tasted classic Sichuanese dishes like fish-fragrant aubergine and twice-cooked pork for the first time. “On warm evenings we would drift down to the riverbank outside the university, where a rash of alfresco restaurants had sprung up under the wutong trees,” she writes, evoking a lost Eden that she only gradually realised was disappearing.As the country’s economic progress picked up speed, Dunlop witnessed the demolition of Chengdu’s old wooden houses, streets and entire neighbourhoods to make way for highways and high-rises. “My culinary researches began as an attempt to document a living city,” she writes in her memoir. “Later, it became clear to me that, in many ways, I was writing an epitaph.”View image in fullscreenXie Laoban’s dan dan noodles from Dunlop’s book Every Grain of Rice.Photograph: Martin Poole/The ObserverIn the three decades since Dunlop first went to China, the country’s food system has also been transformed. Western fast food restaurants arrived, followed by supermarket chains and megamarkets such as Carrefour and Walmart, all of which led to increased consumption of western-style processed and packaged foods, saturated fats and sugary beverages. “Just like much of the US, it was becoming easier for Chinese urban consumers to buy out-of-season fruit from thousands of miles away than it was to get fresh produce from the farm just outside town,” writes Thomas David DuBois in China in Seven Banquets, a history of Chinese food that gives a good picture of contemporary developments.A generation ago most Chinese people knew how to cook; in some parts of the country, including Sichuan, it was common for men to be the primary cooks in the family. But rising living standards and a hyper-competitive work culture have changed that. Many Chinese in their 20s and 30s don’t know how to cook or are too busy to do so. According to recent surveys, more than half the population now eats most of its meals outside the home or relies on food delivery services, which have become ubiquitous over the past decade.Many Chinese are losing touch with the tradition of healthy eating that Dunlop so earnestly celebrates. Consumption of whole grains, legumes and vegetables is in steep decline. According to a 2021 article in the journal Public Health Nutrition, the Chinese now get 30% of their calories from animal products and 29% from industrially processed foods. In 1990, the figures were 9.5% and 1.5%, respectively. Obesity has increased fivefold; the Chinese suffer increasingly from the chronic ailments, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, that afflict so many millions in the developed world.The rise and fall of French cuisineRead moreThe yearning for a simpler and healthier past informs much of recent Chinese gastronomical commentary. Among the most influential is A Bite of China, a hugely popular TV series that explores the country’s culinary heritage, with episodes on rural villagers harvesting lotus root or making glutinous millet buns using traditional methods. One of China’s biggest social media stars is Li Ziqi, a former nightclub DJ who makes mesmerising, near-wordless videos of herself hiking up hillsides in rural Sichuan to chop firewood and pick mushrooms or planting and harvesting cucumbers, peppers and squash in large bamboo baskets. Nearly every video ends with her cooking dishes over a wood fire and sharing a meal with her grandmother in what looks like a cottage without electricity. Li’s videos, which have gained her tens of millions of followers, present cooking as an extravagant rural fantasy and inadvertently convey how exhausting it is to put dinner on the table.When Dunlop first lived in Chengdu, she and her classmates frequented a noodle shop near the university that was owned by a man called Xie Laoban – “Boss Xie”. He was a type recognised by anybody who has lived in China – the stony-faced, chain-smoking proprietor who never cracks a smile or says a word in greeting. Over the years, Dunlop returned for a nostalgic bite whenever she passed through the city. She somehow convinced this uncommunicative man to share hisrecipe fordandan mian, a bowl of noodles topped with crispy minced beef and spicy seasonings that is a classic Chengdu street snack. “In all my wanderings,” Dunlop writes, “I have never come across dan dan noodles as delicious.”The last time she visited the shop, in 2001, the neighbourhood was being torn down for development: “The lanes around Xie Laoban’s noodle shop lay in ruins, bony cadavers of wood and bamboo, and his restaurant clung to one or two other little shops in a precarious island among them …. I sat there and ate my noodles, which were as fabulous as ever, and then it was time to go. I never saw Xie Laoban again. Later that year, I went to look for him. I wanted to tell him that I had described him and his shop in my Sichuanese cookery book, and published his recipe for dan dan noodles, which was now being read and perhaps cooked by a network of Sichuanese food fans all over the world. But the place where his noodle shop had stood was a moonscape of debris, a great plain of rubble, scattered here and there with shattered pickle jars and rice bowls. And none of the passersby knew where I could find him.”The food has been eaten; the buildings and people are gone. Only the words remain.View image in fullscreenA longer version of this article first appeared in theNew York Review of BooksThe best stories take time.From politics to philosophy, personal stories to true crime, discover a selection of the Guardian’s finest longform journalism, in one beautiful edition.

Ministers should get a move onNils PratleyMake UK’s call for the government to recognise that the energy crisis for industry is happening now is spot-onThu 20 Nov 2025 12.55 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 14.33 ESTShareIn the long list of budget submissions from the business world, here’s one the chancellor is probably disinclined to smile upon.Make UK, the body representing manufacturers, would like the government to expand its energy support scheme – the one unveiled in June as part ofthe shiny new industrial strategy– from 7,000 firms to 115,000 businesses. And it would like the promised savings in electricity bills to be backdated to April this year; as scheduled, the so-called British industrial competitiveness scheme, or BICS, is due to arrive only in April 2027.One doubts Rachel Reeves will go there for three reasons. First, these things never get backdated. Second, broadening the scheme would obviously cost more and the government has pledged that other bill payers will not foot the bill – funding is instead supposed to come from “bearing down” on levies and costs in the energy system. Third, widening the scheme would run against the deliberate focus in the industrial strategy on just eight “priority” sectors, which include a few manufacturing industries (such as advanced manufacturing, life sciences and defence) but excludes many more.Yet the spirit of Make UK’s call for the government to get a move on – and recognise that the energy crisis for industry is happening now – is spot-on.The damning statistic that the UK has some of the most expensive industrial energy prices in the developed world is familiar. It is repeated with every act of deindustrialisation in the UK, from thePort Talbot steelworksto theGrangemouth oil refineryto this week’s news ofthe planned closureof ExxonMobil’s 40-year-old ethylene plant near Cowdenbeath in Fife. Those tales usually involve complicating factors (Exxon seems to be engaged in a pan-European restructuring, for example) but a common theme, alongside rising carbon levies, is the sky-high cost of energy.Yet it is only in the next few days that Peter Kyle, the business secretary, will announce the formal consultation of how the BICS scheme will be implemented – meaning how it could be funded, who will be eligible and what the promise of savings in electricity bills of “up to” 25% will mean. Five months to get froma detail-free announcementabout “slashing” electricity bills for “thousands of businesses” to a consultation is far too long.The big development in the meantime is that industrial companies, like non-industrial ones, can see what’s coming next April in their electricity bills. The answer for some is hefty increases as higher transmission charges start to kick in to fund the five-year,£80bn upgrade of the electricity grid, plus a bit on top to finance new nuclear capacity. Heavy users could face annual increases of £500,000, reckons Make UK.To be fair to the government, about 500 firms in the most energy-intensive industries – think steel, chemicals, glass and paper – will be shielded under the separate and established “supercharger” scheme. Their discount on network charges is being increased from 60% to 90%, so their bills should fall. But that still leaves a lot of companies who are heavy energy users – just not the “most intense” – in the eye of the storm.In these circumstances, another of Make UK’s requests feels entirely reasonable: if backdating BICS is a non-starter, then fast-track the scheme to happen in April to coincide with the first blast of network-related costs.

Kyle is due to speak at the Confederation of British Industry next week. Aside from explaining what the “up to” will mean in practice, he should say whether the scheme can be implemented sooner than 15 months from now.“The clock is ticking on tackling our eye-watering energy costs and it is now a case of political will rather than any technical constraints to addressing these,” says Make UK’s boss, Stephen Phipson. Fair comment. The government’s scheme, as it stands, is limited – but it should not take half a parliament to get it up and running.

Not one, but two Commons announcements on immigration from the home secretary. Both of them statements of intent. Foreigners, your time is up. Britain isn’t just full. It’s super-saturated with all the wrong kind of people. Theresa May must be shaking her head. She got labelled with creating a hostile environment just for sending vans round to areas with a large proportion of immigrants, saying: “Piss off home. You’re not wanted.” I guess those were gentler, kinder times. Almost a welcome mat.Fair to say, Shabana Mahmood’s first statement on illegal immigration went down an absolute storm. With Reform. At Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, Lee Anderson had been open-mouthed with admiration.“The government is guilty of dog-whistle politics,” he said. From Reform, there is no higher praise. To out-Nigel Nigel is to live the dream. A thing of beauty. It was all Lee could do not to stand and applaud.Now Shabana was due back in the Commons to tackle legal migration. Time to empty the care homes of low-paid workers. Let the old die. They needed to learn to stand on their own two feet. Not lounge around in bed.First though, Mahmood had an appointment with the BBC’s Nick Robinson to appear on his Political Thinking podcast. She had some important thoughts to share.First were some changes to deporting asylum seekers. Rather than just bunging them £3,000 to go home – which most turned their noses up at – the Home Office would offer a serious wedge. Enough to get refugees to go quietly without a legal fight that could cost the government £30,000.It made for a brilliant business model. For illegal migrants. Come over here by boat. Collect £10,000 on arrival on the beach. Then take the same boat back to France. It’s such a waste that these inflatables were used only once. And after two weeks or so, you could do the same thing and collect another £10,000.OK, there were people smugglers to pay off but you could still earn a decent wedge each month. Enough to have a big enough income to qualify for legal residency.Shabana also had a few words to say about the No 10 briefings against her and Wes Streeting. “It was a total car crash,” she said. “It was embarrassing for the prime minister because he’s then got to sort it out and he shouldn’t be put in that position. It’s not how he does his politics.” She also twice used the word humiliation.As it is, No 10 is just hoping everyone forgets the sorry episode. Sorry for bringing it up again, chaps.In the meantime, Shabana showed up in the Commons just after 1pm for the statement on legal migration. There was far less interest this time round than on Monday. Familiarity breeds contempt. Or there’s only so much anyone can take.TheLabourbenches were almost empty. As were the Tories’. No Reform MPs bothered to show up for their specialist subject. Perhaps they reckon they can now trust Mahmood to deliver without any input from them. Team Shabana.Mahmood started with a bit of her personal backstory. To reassure Labour MPs that this was going to hurt her far more than it was going to hurt them. She was a proud immigrant, she said. She loved this country for the welcome it had shown her parents and so many others.BUT … patriotism was narrowing in this country. Because so many people in Britain were becoming a bit more racist, it was necessary for the government to become a bit more beastly to foreigners. Not only would Labour lose the next election if it didn’t become more unpleasant, what followed would be worse. A spoonful of hatred helps the medicine go down.The BorisWave had been a disaster. So it was time to change the rules. Indefinite leave to remain would now be granted only after 10 years, not five. And then only if you had a clean criminal record, had proficiency in English up to A-level standard.It’s a truth universally acknowledged than an immigrant in possession of ILR must be in want of the ability to quote Jane Austen, have national insurance paid up to date and have no debt. If you can’t afford a house without getting a mortgage, you have to bugger off back to wherever you came from. In other words you have to be a great deal more British – not to say richer – than the average British person to qualify as a Brit.Unlike on Monday, this time roundKemi Badenochtrusted shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, to reply on behalf of the Tories. Partly because even she had exhausted her hatred and anger tank for the week, but mainly because even the Philpster couldn’t really fuck this one up.All he had to do was congratulate Mahmood for adopting Conservative party policy, before suggesting a few tweaks to make it even harder for anyone to get ILR.It’s not entirely clear who MPs think will run the health service. Obviously none of them has been inside a hospital in the past 10 years. Maybe it’s best if we all just die now.A few Labour MPs made pleas for compassion.Stella Creasydemanded “Let love be love”. But their hearts weren’t really in it. They have had the fight knocked out of them. Shabana would get her way.Tory Edward Leigh started talking about illegal immigration. No one had the heart to tell him we had moved on. That was Monday, this was now. Maybe he was suffering from PTSD. It’s been that kind of a week.A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.On Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back with special guests at another extraordinary year, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereExplore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchBudget 2025Shabana MahmoodLee AndersonReform UKImmigration and asylumLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Why had Trump been stonewalling, she asked, “if there’s nothing incriminating in the files”.His response, though, was anythingbutreasonable.It was demeaning, insulting and misogynistic.He pointed straight at Lucey and told her to stop doing her job.“Quiet. Quiet, piggy,” said the president of the United States.From what I could tell, none of her colleagues in the press corps immediately rose to her defense. Things just moved on – business as usual, in a sense.Pete Hegseth’s attempt to gag journalism is a resounding failure | Margaret SullivanRead moreAnd yet, if I were making a timeline of Trump’s use of the press as a punching bag, this moment would deserve a place on it. Maybe it was his pointing. Maybe it was his direct command, as if he were in charge of what a reporter is allowed to ask.Maybe – probably – it was the nasty name-calling, which is meant to put a reporter in her place in front of the world. Maybe – probably – it was the lack of protest from other reporters.This, after all, is life in Trump’s America. Consider just the past day or so.Trump celebrated the Saudi crown prince, who, according to a2021 US intelligence report, approved the killing of a Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. (The crown prince has denied involvement in the killing.) The US president gave him a hero’s welcome to the White House.Trumpinsulted and threatened ABC News and its fine reporter Mary Bruce, who also asked germane questions, about Khashoggi as well as the Epstein files. “I think you are a terrible reporter. It’s the way you ask these questions,”he said. He called ABC a “crappy company” and said its license “should be taken away from ABC because your news is so fake and it’s so wrong”.We’re supposed to be used to this by now.Clearly, the president’s fervid supporters must approve of this sort of thing; they seem to see it as a way the president is using his power and position to diminish the “elite”, who he has taught them to despise.But getting used to it is dangerous. We all get worn down. “What can you do?” shrug even the caring among us.But, for me, “quiet, piggy” somehow breaks through. It should be a bridge too far, not business as usual.Wouldn’t it have been something to see the entire press corps shout back at Trump, in defense of their colleague? Wouldn’t it have been something to see them walk away from the gaggle?Why didn’t they?“Because access beats out solidarity, every day of the week,” Bill Grueskin, a former Miami Herald and Wall Street Journal editor who is a professor at Columbia Journalism School,posted on Bluesky. If any members of the press corps had somehow managed to push back and defend their colleague, they undoubtedly would have been punished by exclusion from these press briefings.So, yes, the access problem.And I’m sorry to say, they also don’t push back because they’re so used to it. After all, it’s nothing new. It’s just an especially egregious example of what’s been going on for years.I’ve been watching these moves of Trump’s for a long time. I was the Washington Post’s media columnist during the entire first Trump term, so I got an up-close look at how he constantly disparaged the press and its representatives – especially women, and even more especially, women of color.Heoften clashed, for example, with Yamiche Alcindor, who then covered the White House for the PBS NewsHour, condemning her supposedly “nasty” questions. This year, hecalled Alcindor, who now works for NBC, “second rate” and demanded that she, too, “be quiet”. He publicly called April Ryan, a longtime White House reporter, “a loser”.Nothing changes – it only worsens – because Trump gets away with it. His stalwart supporters don’t seem to care. The members of the press corps may write a sternly worded letter (or not), but they normalize it, too, by their inaction.Will this “quiet, piggy” moment make a difference? Only for those who care about decency in public officials and in American society.Maybe that’s an old-fashioned notion. And I’m not sure there are enough of us who remember that it matters.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinesUS politicsBloombergcommentShareReuse this content"

Tackling inequality in Britain will require much more far-reaching changesThu 20 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 07.29 ESTShareBy this time next week you will be digesting the budget, you lucky thing. Yet even before Rachel Reeves has commended a single damn thing to the house, her efforts have been written off as a “shambles”, from a “chaotic” government that is Labour in name alone. Which prompts the question: what is the leftwing alternative?Because there is one, on which agreement stretches from Labour backbenchers to many of their opponent MPs and far beyond. Whether you listen to Zack Polanski or Zarah Sultana, the TUC or the YouTubers, they all call for a wealth tax – stinging the rich to pay for schools and hospitals. Who could be against such a thing?Me, for one.I am all for making the wealthy pay their way and, as a creature of warm blood and soft tissue, I delight in anything that winds up some of the worst people. There must be merit in an idea that gets France’s Bernard Arnaultchuntering about“a clearly stated desire to destroy the … economy” – this from the plutocrat (estimated net worth: £139bn) who declared, “As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy.” Trust me, dear reader, this is a whole Radox bath of pleasure I am forgoing.But still, I can’t go along with the consensus emerging around a wealth tax. It is too much of a muddle, not just financially or economically but also politically. As with so many simple and shoddy ideas, it polls beautifully yet smacks of dishonesty. If the wealth taxers seriously want to tackle big money and vested interests, they are going to the gunfight not with knives, but toothpicks.Let us start with some context. Perhaps the best work in this field comes from the Wealth Tax Commission, which in 2020 gatheredwhat it called“the largest repository of evidence on wealth taxes globally to date”. Over 50 experts gave evidence, from economists to the former head of HMRC. The commission recommended “a one-off wealth tax” – in essence, a giant and sudden raid by tax inspectors on couples with over £1m in assets (which would include a lot of homeowning households in nice neighbourhoods, who may not count themselves as rich). That would raise £260bn, or the equivalent of hiking the basic rate of income tax by 9p in the pound.A whopping sum, raised with shock and awe. But that isn’t what you’re hearing about on TV and podcasts now. The far more modest proposals from the left include a 1% annual levy on assets over £10m recommended by the Greens in their latest manifesto. The Wealth Tax Commission estimated that an annual 1.12% levy on assets over £10m would raise £10bn – handy, but in Whitehall terms hardly life-changing. And, experts pointed out, such sums could be raised without manufacturing a new tax but simply by tweaking the existing levies on the wealthy. It would not surprise me at all if next Wednesday the chancellor made some of those tweaks.This isn’t much of a policy, it’s a pantomime – a pantomime of pseudo-radicalism in which the villains are some wankers on yachts and the solution is one simple trick, just like those dodgy internet ads used to offer. It just so happens it would yield about 1% of what the government spends in a year.Where a few years ago leftwingers would argue for the government to borrow more, today YouTube radicals such as Gary Stevenson act as if John Maynard Keynes had never been born. Without a wealth tax, the UK will soon go bankrupt,he warns– an unlikely thing to happen in one of the richest countries in the world, with its own money-printing press. “Traders are about to bring down the government,”he told Guardian readersin January. Ten months later, we await the excitement.If the Greens are serious about redistributing unearned wealth, they should widen their focus from Mr and Mrs Megabucks to well-to-do families across the country who, just by dint of being sufficiently old and/or lucky are sitting in houses that have rocketed in value since the late 90s. But chance would be a fine thing: next May, Polanski and his troops will be marching on inner-London councils such as Hackney, where an ordinary terrace housenow fetchesjust shy of a million pounds, over three times theaverage across England. Far easier to claim the problem is all a few billionaires. So why not go the whole hog and make the Greens the anti-billionaire party, with a charter to remove oligarch influence from our political parties, our thinktanks, our media?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Given how far the rich have had things their way over the past four decades, some evening up is in order. Concern over a deeply unequal society and a lopsided economy is where the wealth tax-ers and I start – but doing something about it requires deep-rooted changes to give more people a fairer share. Changes to the labour laws to encourage union organisation. Changes to corporations to give workers more of a stake. Vastly more social housing. The irony is that Labour leaders have flirted with such steps. Not just Jeremy Corbyn, but Ed Miliband and his call for “predistribution” – for citizens to have agreater share of assetsbefore tax. On that showing, the Labour party that went to the polls in 2015 was more economically radical than the Greens and Your Party are a decade later.I offer these criticisms I hope constructively, with only a soupçon of teasing. Polanski and Sultana aren’t the politicians talking aboutripping gold ringsoff the fingers of asylum seekers, conniving at the mass murder of Palestinians or cheering on the bulldozing of our planning system. In talking about wealth taxes, they have grasped an important political truth. The electoral future of a low-growth country like Britain doesn’t lie in promising voters that with some magic trick you can drive up GDP, but in accepting that the arguments that lie ahead are about the distribution of resources. That’s something the centrists on both the Tory and Labour benches have yet to grasp – which is why next week’s budget will be so painful.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025OpinionTax and spendingInequalityEconomicsThe super-richcommentShareReuse this content"

But it also tells us something deeper about our responses to lossThu 20 Nov 2025 10.55 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 18.38 ESTShareOne of the last remaining fun things about the internet is getting to pass judgment on the goings-on in households that you would never hear about otherwise. OnReddit, for instance, there is a whole thriving sub for just this purpose called Am I the Asshole?, where people describe conflicts from their lives and ask strangers to adjudicate on them.This week,a story on the BBCthrew up a particularly juicy piece of other people’s businessthat has been sparking debates on Chinese social media. It starts in 2017, whenGui Junmin decided to cryogenically freeze his wife, Zhan Wenlian, after she died of lung cancer. She was the first Chinese person to undergo this procedure, which was paid for by a science research institute in Jinan, east China, that agreed with Gui to preserve his wife’s body for 30 years.Reports suggestZhan herself consented to the process before she passed away.But what has piqued the interest of nosy people across the world is the revelation that, in 2020, Gui began dating again. He now has a new partner, a woman named Wang Chunxia. People have asked: is this fair, to either woman? It would be quite a trip to be the wife: defrosted from the land of the dead,slowly working out what happened – and then discovering your husband found a new girlfriend in the time you’ve been on ice. The sheer social and ethical complexity of the situation would have me asking the doctors to stick me back in the freezer.My first reaction to the broad strokes of this story was: leave the poor guy alone. His wife is dead and he found love again a respectful number of years after her passing. This is no crime. But there are more confusing details. Gui apparently told the Chinese newspaper Southern Weekly that his new partner, Wang, was not the new love of his life. Their relationship was only “utilitarian”, and he was prompted to seek out a new live-in partner after he had a severe attack of gout that left him bedridden for a few days. A frozen wife is all well and good, but she’s not going to be much use on the chicken soup front if he gets unwell again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe Wang is delighted with this arrangement. Maybe Gui does love her, but doesn’t want to say so and dishonour his late wife’s memory. Who knows. But I find it a sad story all round, what little we know of it, because at the heart of this headline-grabbing tale is that very human inability to know when to let go. If you read around, you can find quotes from Gui saying he agreed to the procedure because he didn’t fundamentally believe that his wife was truly dead – that she had just gone somewhere to rest for a while. The fact that he has started a new relationship, whatever his motivations for doing so, suggests that the inexorable process of moving on has begun.All cryogenics strikes me this melancholy way, and to a lesser extent so do allbiohacking effortsto maximise human lifespan. It is, I think, no accident that the world’s major cryogenics labs, Alcor and the Cryonics Institute in the US, were both started by people who wanted to preserve their own loved ones. (There are an estimated 500 people cryogenically frozen worldwide, mostly in the US.) There is also a tragically doomed side to it: after all, there is no proof that it will ever be possible to bring someone who has been frozen back to life. Sure, the human race mayone day figure out how to do this. But it seems more likely to me that we won’t. Death is death. However long it takes you to get there, it is the non-negotiable end of the road.This stuff is hard. Of course it is. When someone you love is dying, it’s only natural to feel like you’d do anything to keep them around. Doggedly deferring these moments of painful loss or persuading yourself that these moments can be avoided with the aid of experimental science is a fool’s game. May Zhan rest in peace, may Gui find a nicer way to talk about his new girlfriend, and may my own eventual trip to the undiscovered country be a one-way ticket with no layover in an ice box.Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Things I use, things I no longer use, things I’ve never used and never will, things I’d happily give away if anyone wanted them, things which will surely end up in landfill, dumped there by me or my children, or my children’s children. To misquote Larkin: Man hands on stuff to man, or in my case women. They’ll not thank me for it.Deborah has an interesting take on this, almost as an aside in a radio interview – she’dfeatured in the Guardian the week before– about how, at the age of 65, she’s renting a room in a house she’s sharing with three people whose ages, she says, barely add up to more than hers. She does so by choice, having no appetite for the upkeep of a house big enough to accommodate visiting grandchildren. Renting, she at least knows how much money is going out, and her children aren’t expecting to inherit much. She says they’re agreed that “money isn’t something you collect, it’s something that allows you to do things”. And what she’s got, after she’s paid the rent, she intends to spend on enjoying life.This won’t work for everyone, financially or otherwise, but it’s an interesting take. And so is this, which is her view on the shedding of stuff: “I wanted to stop collecting stuff and start living, and the best way to do that is to have constrained living circumstances and actually focus on going out and doing things.”Now this is an approach to stuff-shedding I hadn’t thought of. Radical. And possibly a trifle annoying to anyone for whom constrained living circumstances aren’t a matter of choice, so have never felt it afforded them much in the way of liberation. But I get where Deborah’s coming from – ditch the dead weight of your largely unnecessary worldly goods to start living, as she puts it, “a better life than I’ve ever lived before because I’m actually doing all the stuff I want to do, and I still come home to a warm room every night”.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHomesOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

When she delivers her budget next week, though, those qualities will be hard to discern. The reason for that is simple but powerful. She has become hemmed in on every side byavoidably tight commitmentson taxation, spending and borrowing. Above all, however, she is hemmed in by Labour politics.It did not have to be this way. Reeves would have had a freer fiscal hand if she and Labour had not ruled out increasing all the three main personal taxes at the 2024 election – a choice the former Conservative minister David Willettsdescribed this weekas “catastrophic”. Reeves might also have won herself more elbow room, albeit at some political cost, if the new government had moved very decisively to say that, having studied the figures, the triple-tax pledge was in fact unsustainable.These, though, are might-have-beens. They were roads not taken. Instead, Reeves got the politics wrong. She waited until this month before belatedly starting to argue, albeit entirely correctly, that the tax pledge had to be broken if Labour was to fulfil its other commitments and to regain direction. Yet in little more than a week she had toabandon the ideain a humiliating retreat.The chief cause of the U-turn was the politics of the modern Labour party. With Labour already sliding in the polls, MPs revolted against breaking a manifesto pledge. They even startedplotting a new leadership. Party whips reported that an income tax rise would not pass the Commons, an event that could have brought the whole government down. As a result, Reeves caved.Where that now leaves the credibility of Reeves, her exceptionally difficult budget, Keir Starmer’s government and theLabourbackbenches will all become a bit clearer, limited measure by limited measure, next week. But the damage to all of them is serious – and the larger political lesson hard to miss. Starmer’s modern Labour party cannot agree about doing anything big, radical or different in domestic policy. Since it cannot agree, it is unable to govern well. It is not up to the job.The mishandling of the taxation issue is far from the only example. Equally pivotal wasJune’s backbench revoltagainst welfare reform, which came in the wake of Reeves’s similarly unpopular cuts to winter fuel payments. In both cases backbenchers showed their power on behalf of claimants, forcing two about-turns on government welfare spending plans. Even so,47 Labour MPs voted againstthe much-diluted welfare bill in July. Whether the plans were wise or not isn’t the main point here. The revolt itself mattered more. It sent the important message that this government could not deliver on welfare reform.This week there was a frisson on a wholly different policy issue. The home secretary wants totighten refugee policyinto a stronger deterrent to Channel migrants. In hermarathon defencein the Commons on Monday, Shabana Mahmood faced more doubters on the Labour benches than she did on the Tory or Liberal Democrat ones. The whips think the revolt is not big enough to upend the plans. But these are early days.The upshot is a Labour party that does not want to cut spending, but at the same time does not want to raise taxes either, and may yet have to be dragged unwillingly towards the voting lobbies when Mahmood’s measures come under the microscope. In other words, Labour is now an alliance of positions, interests and instincts rather than a party with a unifying direction or a leader who clearly articulates an overarching plan for government. As a result, Labour has become several small parties in one.Some of this is down to poor leadership. But not all of it. There has always been tension, even in Labour’s earliest years, between its working-class base and its white-collar and more ideologically driven supporters. More crucially, though, the old core Labour vote of the 20th century has simply disappeared, as has the industrial Britain that generated it. That old Britain will never be reassembled. Nor will that form of Labour vote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By 1997, when Tony Blair swept to power, the working-class share of Labour’s vote was down to 59%, while the middle-class share rose to 41%. In 2010, for the first time, white-collar Labour voters exceeded blue-collar ones.That new imbalance continues today. The essential fact is that Britain is significantly more middle class, better educated, more outward-looking and more liberal. Yet Labour still struggles to adapt to, never mind to lead, this intricate, nuanced and continuing change.“Why is the Labour party in a mess?” asked the social historian Gareth Stedman Jones in a 1984 essay. Among his answers, he said that the party was too comfortable looking back to the postwar Attlee years, it was too easily tempted by old forms of working-class politics, and it was neglecting the concerns and priorities of the emerging middle-class Labour electorate.More than four decades later, every single bit of that critique is still true. Only more so. Today, Labour expends a lot of effort trying to capture working-class Reform supporters. Yet it spends far less trying to retain the support of its middle-class progressive electorate – and indeed seems to enjoy berating them. When a party like this faces in too many directions at the same time, it seems sensible to ask: what, today, is the point of Labour?Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBudget 2025Tax and spendingRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

Yet officials there said Israeli strikeskilled 33 people, including 12 children, on Wednesday; Israel said its troops had come under fire. Another five Palestinianswere killed on Thursday. Hundreds have died since the ceasefire was declared. Even if the shelling stops, the destruction of Palestinian life will carry on as Israel continues to throttle aid, and the consequences of two years of war unfold. The World Health Organizationwarnedlast month that the health catastrophe would last for generations.Food remains in short supply. While displaced families shiver in flooded makeshift shelters, with many facing a third winter of homelessness, aid organisations say theycannot deliverstockpiles of tents and tarpaulins. Israel, which denies blocking aid, has designated tent poles as “dual-use” items that could potentially be used for a military purpose. Save the Childrenreportschildren sleeping on bare ground in sewage-soaked clothing.The Guardian last weekrevealedUS plans for the long-term division of Gaza into a “green zone” under Israeli and international control, to be redeveloped, and a “red zone” left in ruins; a US official described reunion of the strip as “aspirational”. This vision – with international troops essentially propping up Israeli occupation, and Palestinians drawn to those areas to escape squalor and chaos elsewhere – echoes disastrous US policies in Iraq and Afghanistan.This is the grim underpinning ofthe UN security council resolution this week, endorsing Donald Trump’s peace proposals. The “board of peace” looks like a colonial authority overseen by Mr Trump, and perhaps anchored by Tony Blair. Palestinian technocrats, somehow both domestically credible and acceptable to the US and Israel – a notable feat – would work beneath it. All this would be possible thanks to an international stabilisation force that the US hopes to see deployed by January. That would be a stretch even if countries prove truly willing to commit troops.The resolution improved on a draft text and won backing from the Arab world – and angry rejection from the Israeli right – by including references to a Palestinian state and Israeli withdrawal. Yet those references are couched inthe vaguest terms, as an unguaranteed reward for sufficiently good behaviour, rather than as a recognition of inalienable Palestinian rights. If all goes according to plan, “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. Israeli withdrawal would be based on standards and timeframes agreed by the military itself as well as the US and others. Countries have backed not what this text does meanbut what it might conceivably mean or become.Some believe that this is the best that can be salvaged from current circumstances, given Mr Trump’s presidency; others hope that it isjust possiblethat this unpromising start could allow something better to be forged. But it is hard not to conclude that for some governments, this is more about conscience-salving and reputation-laundering than the best interests of Palestinians. Germany has alreadyannouncedthat it will resume weapons exports to Israel. For Palestinians, “what looked like a forever war may be metamorphizing into forever misery”, the political scientist Nathan  Brown haswarned. Countries that were complicit in a genocidal war have all the more duty to demand better.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Interviewers have a duty to keep pressing for fuller factsThu 20 Nov 2025 14.02 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 18.39 ESTShareFor one contemporary, it is the hectoring tone of today that evokes what it was like to be at school with Nigel Farage. “He would sidle up to me and growl: ‘Hitler was right’ or ‘Gas them’,” Peter Ettedguirecallswhen asked about life at fee-payingDulwich Collegein the late 1970s and early 1980s. Later, he adds: “I’d hear him calling other students ‘Paki’ or ‘Wog’ and urging them to ‘go home’.”For others, including some in the college’s combined cadet force (CCF), what lingers is the image of the young Mr Farage in uniform and his renderings of a racist anthem titled “Gas ’em all”. Tim France, a CCF member from those years, remembered Mr Farage “regularly” giving the Nazi salute and strutting around the classroom. “It was habitual, you know, it happened all the time,” he recalls.Jean-Pierre Lihou was a school friend of the future politician. He tooconfirmsthat the teenage Mr Farage would say things like “Hitler was right” and “gas ’em”. Mr Ettedgui would be addressed as “Jude”, two syllables as in German. “He used to stomp around the playground and chant ‘Oswald Mosley’,” adds Mr Lihou. Another contemporary, Andy Field, says that he saw Mr Farage set fire to the school roll after it was said that there were more Patels than Smiths among the pupils.Some material on this period of the Reform UK leader’s life was already public, notably inMichael Crick’s biography, which revealed a highly charged staff discussion over whether Mr Farage should be made a prefect or not. Back then, Mr Farage admitted having said “some ridiculous things … not necessarily racist things … it depends how you define it”. After the Guardian dug deeper this week into Mr Farage’s schoolboy years, that comment seems like an evasion. The claims in our reporting suggest instead that theyoung Mr Farage said things that were clearly racist.Not everyone contacted could recall the incidents cited in our reporting. And no one to whom we spoke claims, any more than we claim ourselves, that Mr Farage the man must still hold the same views that Mr Farage the teenager is alleged to have held more than 40 years ago. Nevertheless, extreme views in any person’s history matter, particularly if that person may be a future prime minister. Mr Farage cannot expect public interest and scrutiny to go away, especially ifReform UKcontinues to dominate the opinion polls and to edge closer to power.Yet Mr Farage is doubling down on his denials. Through his lawyers, he is now denying saying anything racist or antisemitic when he was a teenager. In the House of Commonsthis week, challenged by the prime minister to explain himself in the light of the Guardian’s reporting, Mr Farage dug in. The allegations, according to his spokesperson, are “one person’s word against another”.But that is not true. Mr Farage’s outright denials need to be judged against the testimonies of the more than a dozen people who claim they were either victims of, or witnesses to, racist and antisemitic behaviour. The public has a right to ask: who is telling the truth? Mr Farage’s fitness for office may rest on the credibility of the answers he gives.The rise of Reform UK raises many issues besides Mr Farage’s character. But individuals matter a lot in politics. They shape moods, opinions and eras. Their truthfulness must be held up to the light. Mr Farage’s media interrogators must press further. He, meanwhile, has a duty to provide further answers.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

These are not minor administrative adjustments; they are structural erosions of rights that strike at the heart of Britain’s commitment to fairness and justice.The United Kingdom remains bound by the 1951 refugee convention and the Human Rights Act 1998. These instruments enshrine non‑discretionary duties, including the provision of subsistence and protection against refoulement. To reframe such duties as optional is to mischaracterise international law and invite judicial challenge. More importantly, it undermines the principle that rights are universal and inalienable, not favours dispensed at political whim.The notion of “safety” determined by ministerial decree ignores the lived realities of persecution, trauma and instability.Refugeeswho have built lives, families and communities in Britain should not be subjected to forced return based on shifting geopolitical assessments. Protection must be durable, not conditional, and rights must be upheld consistently, not traded for expediency.Labour appears to prioritise electoral calculation over principled defence of universality. Solidarity has been reduced to a dance of Reform UK’s tune. This is not leadership, it is mimicry – a concession that undermines Labour’s founding ethos.The consequences are grave. Rights presented as discretionary cease to be rights, they become privileges dispensed at political whim. Refugee protection reduced to a temporary lease corrodes both the rule of law and the moral fabric of society.Human rightsare not bargaining tools – they are the foundation of justice and must be upheld without compromise.Danny McCloskeyLondonI despair when I read the rhetoric about asylum and refugee status. The charity Refugees Welcome, Cheshire East held an event in a local Methodist church on 15 November to mark 10 years of our existence. The church was packed with more than 150 happy people, including Syrians, Afghans, Ukrainians and Chagossians, whom we have supported over the last 10 years since our inception. There were speeches of thanks from all the refugee groups, punctuated with musical treats from each group. There was a very special moment when some of the Ukrainian children joined the Afghan dance. Following the more formal part of the afternoon, we met for biscuits and cakes baked by the refugees. We were honoured to be joined by local MPs, mayors and other dignitaries.The people we support have come to Cheshire East out of utter desperation. Becoming a refugee is not a lifestyle choice. Our refugees find jobs as soon as they can. They are generally vastly overskilled for their jobs, but they are ready to pay taxes. They do not want to live on benefits.The refugees we support have now made a life in the UK. Their children are being educated here and often speak with a local accent. They feel safe here and there is nothing for them to return to in the countries they were forced to leave.I hope the government does not feel impelled to out-Reform Reform UK with cruel policies unless it fully understands the situation.Nicky CampbellChair of trustees, Refugees Welcome, Cheshire EastStella Creasy is undoubtedly correct in assuming that asylum seekers don’t read the latest UK policy guidance before setting off to find refuge (ICE-style raids on Britain’s streets: that’s all Labour’s brutal asylum reforms will achieve, 17 November). We therefore have to assume that the majority of asylum seekers that reach these shores are highly motivated, skilful, resilient and relatively resourceful. That’s the thinking University of Birmingham had when we set up theUSE-ITprogramme in 2016: a partnership led by Birmingham city council with a range of stakeholders including the university.Our “asset-based” approach to regeneration viewed asylum seekers as precisely that: a valuable asset. We aimed to find locally at least 60 asylum seekers or refugees with skills that could be employed in the newly built Midland Metropolitan hospital. The team found more than 200 people and matched them into healthcare roles across West Birmingham and Sandwell. The skills of asylum seekers included GPs, nurses, pharmacists and even highly trained medical and surgical consultants. The so-called asylum or immigration crisis needs to be turned on its head. To dampen the dangerous political rhetoric on offer from Labour, we need to recognise the social and economic capital many asylum seekers bring to the UK and maximise such valuable assets.Dr Peter LeeFormer associate professor of collaborative planning, University of BirminghamYour leader (17 November) rightly highlights the enormous bureaucratic costs involved in the proposed 30-month reviews of the eligibility of refugees given permission to stay in the UK. With around100,000 asylum claims annually, the system would soon need to conduct around70,000reviews each year. Home Office staff are already overstretched in processing existing initial claims for asylum. The new money required would have to come from within the settlement for the department agreed in the recent public spending review. One has to ask then what other Home Office budgets would be raided for that purpose.It is suggested that some of the costs might be defrayed by the Home Office instituting aone-off schemeto give permission to asylum seekers from Sudan, Eritrea, Iran, Afghanistan and Syria to stay for a limited period, which, if contractual arrangements allow, would mean there was no longer a need for them to be housed in hotels at public expense. But where would they be housed instead, and who would pay for that housing?Michael BrownChichesterThe far right alleges that foreigners are creating cultural ghettoes in some UK towns and cities by refusing to assimilate with the ways and norms of the “native” population.Shabana Mahmoodproposes to restrict refugees right to stay to 30 months. I can think of no surer way to build ghettoes than imposing blanket insecurity on a section of the community.Arthur CollingeSt Clears, CarmarthenshireExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumRefugeesRaceFar rightHuman rightsUnited NationsInternational lawlettersShareReuse this content"

However, it didn’t explain how previous prohibition‑based policies designed to reduce cannabis use have driven up the strength of street cannabis, the source of most cannabis for people with psychosis, thus making the problem worse.Furthermore, growing data from the Drug Science T21 project and other prescription databases globally shows that medical cannabis can alleviate a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, without inducing psychosis. Any suggestion that rates of cannabis-related psychosis could be reduced by limiting medical cannabis access is flawed and is likely to harm patients currently benefiting from it.Prof D Nutt and Prof Ilana CromeDrug ScienceHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Why acknowledging our own good fortune would make the world a better place, 17 November). I had a relatively ordinary background and worked in the public sector, but the security I had allowed me to have a good life. As he says, these things are not available to so many children. Considering the wealth in this country, that is a disgrace.In 2009, the Guardian published an article about1948 being the best yearto have been born. This was based on every aspect of life you can think of: free education, NHS, availability of work, final-salary pensions and opportunities to buy houses at sensible prices. I was born in 1948. What a total privilege.Mary MullarkeyLostwithiel, CornwallJulian Richer’s article is so correct about the place of sheer luck in our achievements. Having been born in 1940, I have had the full benefit of the 1945-51Labourgovernment’s radical changes to society. I have had the support of the health service virtually all my life, I was enabled to be the first in my family to get a university degree, and when I was about 12 my family moved into smart new social housing. All this was brought about by a government with vision, despite inheriting a war-bankrupt economy. And, because of the policies of the 1940s, by the time I needed employment there were many opportunities to choose from.Young people desperately need a Labour government with an equivalent vision today.Michael McLoughlinWallington, SurreyJulian Richer makes a good case, but an important question remains. On the basis that hard work, determination and talent will no doubt have played an important role in determining how you have got to where you are today, he asks how much factors outside your control have influenced your path in life. The untested assumption is that hard work, determination and talent arewithinyour control.But, as the US neuroscientistRobert Sapolskyhas shown so brilliantly, the presence and expression of such characteristics are just as much products of that which precedes them as everything else. There are no causeless causes. It’s turtles all the way down.Mark de BrunnerBurn Bridge, North YorkshireIt would be a pity if Julian Richer’s critique of today’s class-based unequal society led some people to conclude that the idea of meritocracy should be abandoned.For our country to prosper, he rightly wants to open conversations about how we can enable everyone to fulfil their ambitions. We should begin with considerations about how we could ensure that our political representatives and leaders are selected for their merit rather than for their party’s popularity at the time of an election.Derek HeptinstallWestgate-on-Sea, KentHow true, Mr Richer. As Malvolio said in Twelfth Night: “Some are born great, some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them.” Let us not forget how important luck is; but equally, let’s not forget determination.John MarriottNorth Hykeham, LincolnshireUnsubscribing to the idea of “No one ever gave me anything” is a huge leap forward in one’s personal development, bestowing empathy and compassion.Alan WalkerTorrelodones, SpainHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, international research studies have shown that reducing the chances of young people being involved in crime to begin with are more effective.These include: stable family foster care placements; doing well at school; extending foster care placements beyond 18 years of age; having positive birth family, extended family, partner and social relationships; being settled in accommodation on leaving care; and being supported by leaving-care teams providing personal, careers, housing and financial support.For too many young people these opportunities are lacking or inconsistent, even in the face of substantial evidence detailing their unnecessary involvement in the criminal justice system, very poor outcomes and the associated costs to young people and society – seeIn Care, Out of Trouble, the report of Lord Laming’s review, published by the Prison Reform Trust in 2016.Prof Mike SteinUniversity of YorkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Test cricket’s oldest rivalry resumes on Friday inside Perth’s 60,000-seat thunderdome and with it, mercifully, comes fresh fuel for the ever-raging fire.Because on one level the Ashes never really starts or stops. Since Stuart Broad nicked off Alex Careyat the Oval on 31 July 2023– the final act of a dramatic 2-2 draw – the sides have been tracking each other, all while their supporters chip away from afar.Ashes 2025-26: Guardian writers’ predictions for the seriesRead moreTo the rest of the world this obsession must get a bit tiresome. In recent years, India having won in Australia in 2018-19 and2022-23, and lost a classic here 12 months ago, there has even been talk that the Border-Gavaskar Trophy may have surpassed the Ashes as a rivalry. It is a terrific thing those two nations have got going on, no doubt.But so storied is the Ashes – so intense the relationship – that this still feels a stretch. Sometimes that BGT chat feels like a stick used to beat England, given they have not won a Test match on these shores sinceAndrew Strauss led a 3-1 triumphin 2010-11. Fact is though, no team stirs Australia’s competitive instincts quite like the old enemy.Same goes for English cricket, with Australia the yardstick for nearly 150 years now. The fate of captains and coaches tends to hinge on the result, with teams either detonated or deified based on how they have fared against 11 hard-nosed men in Baggy Green caps.There is an extra frisson to this one. Traditional media, social media, myriad podcasts and the like mean the Ashes discourse barely quietens down during the waiting game these days. Take the fallout fromJonny Bairstow’s stumpingat Lord’s which, despite his absence from this tour, is somehow still very much a hot topic in Australian circles.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes circles the England wagons before hostilities begin in Western Australia.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesEngland have moved on but the size of task that awaits is borne out by the numbers. And not simply that wretched recent run on Australian soil, or that Ray Illingworth’s men were the last English side to win back the little urn here in 1970-71, rather than retain it.Five-Test series – sadly the sole domain of the Big Three nations these days – have been staged 27 times this century and only three away sides have emerged as outright winners: the Strauss tour, England’s 2-1 victory in South Africa in 2004-05, and Steve Waugh’sgalácticosclaiming Australia’slast away Ashes win back in 2001. In short, five on the road is a bloody tough feat to pull off.Yet this England side under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum do seem pretty unencumbered by history. Aware of it, certainly, so too Australia’s No 1 spot in the rankings to their second. As Stokes put it this week, while stressing the past counts for nothing: “Australia is and always will be one of the biggest forces in Test cricket.” But though England’s supporters may fret and fear the usual, 9,000 of them flying into Perth first up, this leadership pairing has spent nearly four years instilling new-world optimism into the players. Evidenced by the likes of Duncan Fletcher, Andy Flower, Kevin Pietersen, Eoin Morgan or Trevor Bayliss in the past, it often takes outsiders to achieve this.As well as having the buffer of being holders, Australia may well squeeze one last hurrah out of a champion side.But it can only be approaching its natural end, the graph due to trend downwards at some point. England’s line has looked more like something from a crypto exchange, the question now being whether it can spike above that of the hosts by 9 January.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mark Wood and Jofra Archer should test ageing reflexes. Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse are no slouches. The one area of concern, clearly, is in the spin department.Wood thought he felt a hamstring twinge last week, the scans said otherwise. But McCullum is a gambler and, on a quick pitch, now is the time to push all the chips into the middle. Australia’s two big absentees, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, may return in time for the pink-ball Test in Brisbane, with a nine-day gap between fixtures aiding their chances. England simply must capitalise before they do so.Either way, 842 days of curtain-twitching and taking notes, all while recycling the old arguments, finally make way for the very thing itself. Receipts will doubtless be kept, pre-series predictions rubbished in due course.

We scored a great goal.”Chelsea v Barcelona: Women’s Champions League – liveRead moreIt is no secret that the Champions League is Chelsea’s white whale. “We all know there’s one thing missing for us,” Millie Bright told the Guardian the preceding week. The defender was on the bench here, Bompastor favouring a centre-back pairing of Naomi Girma and Nathalie Björn.Barcelona have been their perennial party poopers, deliveringheartbreak in the final in 2021before knocking Chelsea out in three back-to-back semi finals up to last season. Chelsea have just one win, but that hard-fought 1-0 victory against the Catalan giants in Spain was undone in London, and one draw in seven games against theBlaugrana.On a horrendously cold night the opening 15 minutes followed a familiar pattern, the visitors dominating possession and frustrating an unsettled home side with their aggressive press. It was the Blues’ goal against the run of play that triggered a more even encounter. The full-back Carpenter, playing in front of the right-back Lucy Bronze, collected the ball from Aggie Beever-Jones just inside the Barcelona half and raced towards the box unchallenged before she lashed it ferociously past Cata Coll. It was a blistering effort and the celebrations were wild, Chelsea taking a lead at home against Barcelona for the first time in four attempts.View image in fullscreenEllie Carpenter lashes the ball past Cata Coll to put Chelsea ahead.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAThe Carpenter-Bronze axis on the right was a potent one, as was the equally rapid combination of Alyssa Thompson and Sandy Baltimore on the left. They nullified the dynamic Barcelona forwards Caroline Graham Hansen and Clàudia Pina, keeping them busy by helping out their own full-backs as they struggled to contain the wide onslaught.The goal injected confidence into Bompastor’s side and they created the better chances of the half, but a Barcelona corner helped cancel out Carpenter’s stunning strike, the ball falling kindly for Ewa Pajor, who took a step to her left and fired in. It was the 36th Champions League goal for the Poland forward, who was a runner-up four times in the competition with Wolfsburg.Chelsea attempted to take advantage on the resumption of the game, Thompson trying her luck after a quick attack but she put her effort wide. There was a nervous energy after half-time, the home team’s inability to convert their superior number of shots on target while Barcelona dominated possession a worry as the clock ticked on.“If you want to be perfect you have to be clinical and that is something we are working on, we won’t give up on that aspect,” said Bompastor.There was an unusual pause shortly before the end of the first half, prompting nine minutes added on, when the live feed of the game went down and disrupted TV coverage and the VAR. The players tried to stay warm on the pitch until the action resumed.View image in fullscreenThe referee stops play before a technical issue delayed the Women’s Champions League tie for nine minutes in the first half.Photograph: John Walton/PAIt was Carpenter who attempted to alleviate the Barcelona pressure that dominated the opening 15 minutes of the second half much in the way it had the first, the former Lyon player breaking forward in a move that mirrored her run for the opening goal but this time her effort was low and wide of the far post.There was frustration for Chelsea in the 74th minute, celebrations cut short after Macario’s clinical header with her first touch after coming on in place of Beever-Jones was deemed offside, the margin extremely tight.There was further agony when Carpenter put the ball wide of the far post with just Coll to beat from close range on the right after receiving a backheel pass from Macario in a neat one-two.Quick GuideWCL roundup: Atlético thrash Twente as Bayern blow away PSGShowAtlético Madridmade it two wins from four in the Women's Champions League with a 4-0 thrashing ofTwente.The Spanish side opened the scoring in the 29th minute via a low, rifled shot from Amaiur Sarriegi before Júlia Bartel, Synne Jensen and Fiamma Benítez piled on the pain for their hosts. The win leaves Atlético ninth in the table and Twente languishing in 14th place.Bayern Munich, meanwhile, rose to fifth with a 3-1 victory atParis Saint-Germain. Linda Dallmann, Momoko Tanikawa and Jovana Damnjanovic found the net to inflict a fourth loss from four on PSG, who are now rock bottom.In the other match of the evening,OH LeuvenheldRomato a 1-1 draw at home.The visitors were well-placed to take all three points thanks to Evelyne Viens' slotted finish after 18 minutes, but the Belgian side were awarded a penalty for an off-the-ball foul after a VAR check midway through the second half and Jada Conijnenberg did the business from the spot.Will MageeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Chelsea were very stable and they pressed us. That meant the second balls were theirs,” said the Barcelona manager, Pere Romeu. “It was a good game. It’s very different to the last semi-finals as Chelsea matched all the players we had and that limited us.”The draw means Bompastor’s and Romeu’s sides remain two of the three unbeaten teams, the former earning a draw for the second time and the latter’s perfect start halted. They remain in good positions, Barcelona topping the table on 10 points and Chelsea in sixth on eight with two rounds of fixtures remaining.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenBarcelona WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Building the team from scratch has entailed a frenetic work rate that the team principal, Graeme Lowdon, has compared to the Apollo moon landing. As F1 descends on Vegas this weekend, Cadillac know time is getting tight.At the final race of the season to be staged in the United Statess, with just over 100 days to go before they take to the track for the first time in Melbourne at the 2026 opener, Cadillac have come on in leaps and bounds but, in what must seem like a sisyphean task, they are aware there will never be enough hours in the day.The chief technical officer, Nick Chester, joined the nascent operation in March 2023 shortly after it was formed, when the team were without even an approved entry. He has been at its heart ever since and enjoys a wry smile when considering the ride.“You can have five minutes looking back at what you’ve done and go: ‘Wow, isn’t this fantastic what we’ve done in less than three years,’” he says. “And then the next minute you think: ‘Yeah, we’ve still got quite a lot to do.’”Chester enjoyed success at Renault in Fernando Alonso’s title-winning years of 2005 and 2006 and was in charge of technical direction at the new Mercedes Formula E team, but nothing has quite compared with the task of bringing the all-American Cadillac brand, a works entry backed by the parent company, General Motors, into F1.“Building an F1 team from scratch, when are you ever going to get a chance to do that?” he says. “It is like nothing else. In an established team you don’t get the opportunity to change cultural approach.”View image in fullscreenSergio Pérez is one of the big-name drivers who will be racing for Cadillac in 2026.Photograph: Federico Basile/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockWith every day that passes minds are more focused on the looming moment of truth in Australia and expectations are being managed. “You have to assume that any new team coming in is going to be last but simply getting on to the grid will be an achievement in itself,” Lowdon noted this year and while Chester echoed this he felt the team had a point to prove as well.“The first thing we want to show is that we should be there,” he says. “So that we turn up and we operate well. We want to show that we’re a proper team doing the right things on the track. Once we’ve shown we’re really credible, then we want to show progression after that.”In August they signed Sergio Pérez and Valtteri Bottas as their drivers for 2026, a pair notable for their invaluable experience in operating at the sharp end in two of the sport’s biggest teams, Red Bull and Mercedes, and Bottas reflected the mood of combative optimism. “Of course, we’re realistic,” he said. “There’s going to be a mountain of work to do, and it’s going to be probably a difficult start, because it is F1. But we’re not there to stay at the back. I believe with this structure, with this group, these people, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be able to get relatively quickly up to the pace and enjoy some success.”To that end recruitment has been in overdrive, with personnel now up to over 400 and planned to reach the target of 600 swiftly. Alongside their current base at Silverstone, the team are in the process of completing an HQ at Fishers in Indianapolis and there is the GM works in Charlotte, North Carolina, where they are building the facility to manufacture the new engine, set for 2029 – until then they will run Ferrari power units – and the Toyota wind tunnel in Cologne. It is a complex organisation, at odds with the trend in F1 for greater centralisation, and has prompted the new cultural approach to which Chester referred.“It’s highly modelled on the Apollo project,” said Lowdon shortly before the British GP in July. “We’re realistic, we know how difficult it is. The timelines, they’re super, super, super short. OK, we’re not putting a man on the moon, but it feels like it sometimes.”So they have adopted, rather than the usual hierarchical system, a flat management structure similar to that of Nasa’s, where there were a range of Apollo teams all working on different aspects of the project across a variety of locations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moving away from management approval for everything is so much cleaner and quicker.”The effectiveness of this nimble approach will be tested in the heat of competition next season and there is no little amount at stake for F1, too. Cadillac have taken on as their test driver the 25-year-old Californian Colton Herta, winner of multiple IndyCar races, with a view to him earning a seat and he will compete in F2 next season. Vegas is one of three races in the US where the sport has recently agreed a deal with Apple for the TV rights, but a successful Cadillac with potentially an American driver would probably offer exponential growth to the sport’s already burgeoning popularity here.Quick GuideToto Wolff sells part of Mercedes stake for £230mShowMercedes boss Toto Wolff has sold his 15 per cent stake in the Formula One team to American billionaire George Krutz. Wolff, who owns one third of Mercedes, will remain as CEO and team principal, and is in Las Vegas for this weekend's race.The 53-year-old Austrian is set to earn close to £230million from the sale in a deal which values Mercedes at £4.57bn - a record for an F1 team.Krutz, the 55-year-old CEO and founder of cybersecurity company Crowdstrike - which currently sponsors Mercedes - becomes a co-owner of the team through his acquisition of Wolff's minority interest making his share five per cent.Kurtz also joins the team's strategic steering committee alongside Mercedes group chairman Olla Kallenius and Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe.Wolff, who oversaw six of Lewis Hamilton's record-equalling seven world championships said: \"George's background is unusual in its breadth: he's a racer, a loyal sporting ambassador for Mercedes-AMG, and an exceptional entrepreneur.\"He understands both the demands of racing and the realities of building and scaling technology businesses. That combination brings specific insight that is increasingly relevant to the future of Formula One.\"Mercedes won eight consecutive constructors' world championships between 2014 and 2021. They are second in the standings with three rounds remaining. George Russell has won two races so far this year.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.For the moment simply living up to Nasa’s “Failure is not an option” adage may be enough for a startup team come 2026.“The people who’ve joined really want the challenge of a new team and doing the first car for a new team,” says Chester. “The level of enthusiasm, excitement, collaboration is brilliant. There are a lot of smiling faces around the factory.“No doubt there’s a few little wrinkles where people are feeling a bit tired on occasion but they’reenjoyingwhat they’re doing.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, Wright says some people are “frightened” of Bellingham’s success.Golden Goal: Jude Bellingham for England v Slovakia (2024)Read more“They cannot get to this guy. He is an achiever, he’s a winner, he goes out and does it,” Wright said on theStick to Football podcast. “They are trying to build something because England have qualified so easily. They need to have something else to pile on, on top of the narrative. I don’t think they’re ready for a black superstar who can move like Jude [Bellingham] is moving. They can’t touch him.“He goes out there, he performs, he does what he does. It’s too uppity for these people.“They all love N’Golo Kanté. He’s a humble black man, gets on with what he’s doing. But if you get a [Paul] Pogba or a Bellingham, and you get that kind of energy, that does not sit well with people. Someone like Jude frightens these people because of his capability and the inspiration he can give.“Because if you are outspoken, black and playing to that level and not caring, that frightens certain people. It’s a tiring exercise to speak about.”View image in fullscreenIan Wright has revealed that he got in touch with Jude Bellingham after the midfielder’s recall to the England squad.Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty ImagesBellingham was recalled to Thomas Tuchel’s squad for games against Serbia and Albania having been left out of October’s squad.Amid discussions about Bellingham’s place in the squad, Wright revealed that he messaged the former Birmingham player before he joined up with the group to warn him of what could happen.“I sent a message to Jude saying: ‘Be ready.’ Something was coming. It’s like a tsunami. Unless you play well and do something, it comes back.“He said: ‘What’s coming?’ and I told him: ‘Be ready for it’ – and it’s here.”Explore more on these topicsIan WrightJude BellinghamnewsShareReuse this content"

Or couldn’t they deal with their loneliness? Or are they just making crazy noises because they have lost their minds already?”Becker had beensentenced to a two-and-a-half-year jail term. Amid his insolvency, he was found guilty of not declaring all his assets so that additional funds could be distributed to his creditors. The judge confirmed that his money was used, instead, to meet his “commitments to his children and other dependents, medical and professional fees, and other expenses”.He was taken from court to prison on Friday 29April 2022, the start of a bank holiday weekend, which meant he was confined to a cell as bedlam broke out around him. “That Friday night until the Tuesday morning when I finally was let out to speak to the Listeners [trusted prisoners who support new inmates] were the three most difficult nights of my life.“You can’t sleep because all of it is true. In jail people do kill themselves, people do harm themselves and people do go crazy. It’s the harsh reality when you have never been to prison and that’s what your lawyers don’t tell you before – maybe not to scare you. HMP Wandsworth is probably one of the toughest prisons in the UK so to be put in there was quite a shock.”On a Wednesday morning in Milan, having gained early release from jail when he was sent back to Germany in December 2022, Becker offers bracing and candid company. His grippingnew bookis an often harrowing, yet moving, insight into his time in prison and how he found calm after the tumult of his life until his mid-50s.Becker was awunderkind, who blew tennis open as a powerful teenager and went on to win six grand slam titles. But fame engulfed him and he made many mistakes. He allowed himself to be surrounded by people who told him how great he was and he listened to their flattering advice. Eventually, he paid a terrible price for his hubris.View image in fullscreenBoris Becker won his first of six grand slams at Wimbledon in 1985 but he was surrounded by yes men.Photograph: Steve Powell/Getty ImagesHis book, expertly ghosted by Tom Fordyce, makes us feel as if we are in prison alongside him. The first few days and nights were terrifying and Becker remembers thinking: “This is torture. Surviving it all is an impossibility. I’m in a cage with a bunch of psychopaths. I’m alone and I’m lost.”He suggests that “it’s easier said than done, but you have to find a way. Time is your enemy inside because the clock ticks very slowly. It’s 22 hours a day inside a tiny cell and that’s hard.”Becker adds that, “in hindsight, it was probably very good for me to stand still for a long time, and 231 days is quite a long time. To truly understand what happened to me before, to put the dance together of what happened, was a relief. But it doesn’t happen overnight.“You have to take real accountability and a cell life gives you that opportunity. I like to think I’m a pretty bright guy and eventually, you start thinking about the whys, ifs and whens of all that happened. Three years later, the reason I’m doing well is because I took full accountability for the good and bad I did.”The 57-year-old leans forward to underline his next point. “But whoever says a prison life is easy is lying. It’s a real punishment.”Becker makes it clear how large sections of life inside Wandsworth and HMP Huntercombe, the Oxfordshire jail where he spent most of his sentence, were essentially run by the prisoners.The prison system seems brokenand rehabilitation has to come from deep within an inmate’s own desire to change himself.“That’s a very important point you raise,” Becker says. “That’s why you have so many reoffenders, committing crime after crime after crime, so they’re inside for the second, third or fourth stint. So you have to really take a good look at yourself, be disciplined in your thoughts and find a [positive] conclusion. Then rehabilitation is possible – but it all starts with you.”Some aspects of prison can be positive and Becker stresses that his rehabilitation was enhanced by a benevolent warder, Andy Small, who persuaded him to take a course in stoicism. “It helped me and eventually, I became a stoic teacher myself where I could talk to inmates and try to rehabilitate some of them in the hope that, once they’re out, they stay on the straight and narrow. Andy was a very tough guy who ran the gym but he showed me how I could tell young prisoners my life story, about having everything and losing everything, and not be too down about it.View image in fullscreen‘You have to take real accountability and a cell life gives you that opportunity. Eventually, you start thinking about the whys, ifs and whens of all that happened.’ Boris Becker believes rehabilitation starts with the offender.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The Guardian“That was huge for me. Andy put his faith into me and I think I delivered. It’s the same now. I read lots of books and I recommend the philosophy of stoicism to people who have issues in the free world. It’s more important than ever with the trying times we live in.”Becker smiles and says: “I was a stoic without knowing it when I was playing tennis. I lived in the moment and I never really had difficulties with pressure on court. I always felt comfortable in my own skin when I was playing tennis. I used some of the stoic methods when I was a tennis player. I just didn’t know it.”He remembers some beautiful moments in prison. Becker coached Novak Djokovic to six grand slam final victories and so he was engrossed when watching Wimbledon on a small television in his cell in the summer of 2022. As Djokovic won match after match to reach the final against Nick Kyrgios it seemed as if his wing of the prison had become immersed in tennis.The final that Sunday afternoon was noisy as the prisoners banged on their cell door whenever Djokovic won another big point. Becker remembers that,after a pulsating four-set final, “I wasn’t afraid any more. And when Novak won, and raised his arms, I stood up and raised my arms too. As I did so, the noise along the wing broke out again, louder than ever before. The banging didn’t stop for 10 minutes. On walls, on doors. With cups, with chairs. It had taken me two weeks to educate them that this was my man, and now I realised. They had understood. I stood there and I cried.”His emotions were intensified by the fact that Djokovic had arranged tickets for Becker’s partner [and now wife], Lilian, and his eldest son, Noah, and they were in his box for every match. “I saw them ringside at every game,” Becker says, “and that’s what I call true friendship, that you’re not forgotten. I always thank Novak for this special memory.”If Becker wasstill coaching Djokovic todaywould they discuss the 38-year-old’s eventual retirement? “Look, I think he’s important for tennis today. He leads by example and shows the young players the amount of dedication you need to come to the top and then stay on top. He’s still chasing his 25th grand slam and reached all four major semi-finals this year and won two tournaments. Who are we to challenge Novak when to stop? I heard the other day that he wants to play at the Olympics in LA 2028. Let him. We need him.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is also amazed by their classy friendship and deep respect for each other when remembering how he was often at war with his bitter rivals Michael Stich,Andre Agassiand Pat Cash. “Well, it’s a little bizarre,” he says of the Sinner-Alcaraz bromance, “but they’re role models and it’s wonderful they have this chemistry on and off court. Our generation was different. We didn’t have any social media. We had different qualities. But, in this trying world, I really appreciate Jannik and Carlos’s behaviour. I talk to them, as they don’t shy away from conversations with us former champions.”Touchingly, Becker has also fully reconciled past differences with his old rivals. Stich wrote him a moving letter when he was inside and Cash, a fellow stoic, came to see him and talk about stoicism in prison. He is now friends with Agassi whom he calls “a brother from another mother”.When Becker turned 55 on 22 November 2022 he was locked up in Huntercombe. Each cell had a solitary kettle. But Becker had never made himself a cup of coffee before jail, let alone boiled a kettle in his pampered life. Before his incarceration he would just pop a capsule into his swish coffee machine. So he had to learn a very basic life skill inside.View image in fullscreenBoris Becker now lives in Milan.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianBut he was still stunned that three inmates had somehow obtained the ingredients to make him three cakes in their kettles for his birthday. “I still don’t know how they did it but they gave me a lemon cake, a chocolate cake and a carrot cake. It was very difficult to cook any decent food for yourself in your kettle, let alone bake a cake, but they did it. Normally you hope your loved one might give you a cake for your birthday or at a restaurant they’ll bring over a beautiful cake with candles. But to have three small cakes baked for me by other inmates made it one of the most emotional birthdays I’ve ever had.”How did they taste? “They tasted great and we all ate them.”He and Lilian now live in Milan and he is working hard, mostly covering tennis and football on Italian television. He is also finally free of all his debts and delusions and, having been through so much glory and infamy, Becker is suitably philosophical: “One of the features of stoicism is that you can’t predict the future. I’m trying hard to have a good life with my wife and my other family. Italy is a wonderful country and life’s good at the moment.”His weathered face lights up when confirming that Lilian will soon give birth. “You fall in love with a woman at the most difficult time in your life, which for me was in the spring of 2018 when my [second] marriage failed and I was insolvent and really struggling. But Lilian sticks with me through thick and thin, even though she doesn’t need to. She’s independent, she’s smart, she’s educated. Quite frankly, without her I wouldn’t be sitting like this now.”Becker pauses and shakes his head in wonder. “Now, to have our first child together in a couple of weeks is a Hollywood movie. I pinch myself sometimes that it happened to me. So I really understand this is a proper second chance. I’m trying to make the most of it.”Inside by Boris Beckeris published by HarperCollinsIn the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393andChildlineon 0800 1111.In the US, call or textMental Health Americaat 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.

The NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny for the half-time show has attracted strong pushback from many on the right, who object to hiscriticism of Donald Trumpand US immigration enforcement.“I really respect Erika for all that she’s done, especially with creating a half-time show for America,” she said. “You know, children are young, they’re impressionable. Young women, young men and everyone, they just need someone to look up to.”NFL will not reconsider Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time show despite Trump backlashRead moreHunt framed her position through the legacy of her grandfather Lamar Hunt, one of the modern NFL’s founding fathers whocoined the Super Bowl name. She said the game was designed to be accessible to fans of all demographics. “When my grandfather named the Super Bowl, he intended it to be something children and families of all ages could come together and watch,” she said. “That football is the attraction and that it didn’t need to compromise its character or rely on cheap appeal to draw an audience.”She argued that the league has a responsibility to choose performers who reflect its long-standing identity. “Football is becoming the world sport, but, at its heart, it’s America’s sport built around family,” she said. “TheNFLhonors women, the military, this country, celebrates communities. So I think that whoever they select going forward for the half-time show needs to reflect those values more closely.”Turning Point USA, theinfluential rightwing college organizationco-founded by Charlie Kirk,announced in Octoberthat it would stage an “All American Halftime Show” during next year’s NFL championship game. The idea quickly gained traction among conservatives who objected to Bad Bunny’s presence at the game.Hunt also floated who she’d like to see on future half-time stages. “An artist like [country music star] Jason Aldean might make sense,” she said, adding: “I’d love to see Miss Taylor Swift up there sometime onceTravis [Kelce]is retired.”Her comments arrive as the league faces an escalating political dispute over its 2026 half-time headliner. Bad Bunny – a Puerto Rican superstar and US citizen who has been vocal in his criticism of aggressive immigration enforcement – addressed the uproarduring his Saturday Night Live monologuelast month, joking that everyone seemed thrilled about the booking, “even Fox News”. He also highlighted Latino contributions to the US and told viewers that if they didn’t understand his Spanish remarks, they had “four months to learn”.View image in fullscreenTavia Hunt, Clark Hunt and Gracie Hunt, from left to right, attend the NFL Honors at Resorts World Theatre before Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas.Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesThe backlash intensified after homeland security secretary Kristi Noem warnedthat immigration agents “will be all over” next year’s Super Bowland said only Americans should attend. Bad Bunny has said fears of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids influenced his decision to exclude the mainland US from his recent world tour.The NFL, despite the conservative outrage, made clear last monthit will not reconsider its selection. Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league is standing by its decision despite criticism from Trump and his supporters. The process, he said, is “carefully thought through”, and “I’m not sure we’ve ever selected an artist where we didn’t have some blowback or criticism. It’s pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.”Trump dismissed the performerin an interview on Newsmax, saying he had “never heard of” Bad Bunny and calling it an “absolutely ridiculous” pick by the NFL. But Goodell said the league chose him because of his extraordinary reach. “He’s one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,” he said. “That’s what we try to achieve. It’s an important stage for us. It’s an important element to the entertainment value.” He added that the NFL is “confident it’s going to be a great show”, calling it “a united moment”.Hunt closed her appearance Tuesday by describing what she sees as a broader cultural shift among young Americans. “I think our generation gets a bad rap, but I am so excited by this movement I’ve seen within this younger generation,” she said. “They are hungry for a deeper ‘why’. They are hungry for Jesus. November is global Bible month, and Bible sales are up.“And I’m just seeing this massive resurgence in young women, in young men, across college campuses getting baptized, sharing the Gospel and wanting to leave this world a better place.”Super Bowl LX will take place on 8 February at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LXBad BunnyNFLKristi NoemICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Kansas City ChiefsRoger GoodellShareReuse this content"

People were evacuated safely.“Thirteen individuals were treated on site for smoke inhalation. Their condition is being monitored, and appropriate medical support has been provided.”António Guterres, the UN secretary general, had appealed earlier in the day for a deal from the summit, welcoming calls from some for clarity on the hotly disputed subject of weaning the world off fossil fuels.The entire venue had to be cleared from shortly after 2pm local time (5pm UK time). The Guardian was told it was likely to be several hours before any delegates were allowed to return.The incident threw a carefully choreographed series of meetings into confusion. The Cop30 presidency was preparing a new draft text of the “mutirão” decision, a central plan of the hoped for outcome of Cop30, and one that until Thursday contained a potential commitment to draw up a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels.The presidency was holding a series of crunch meetings with the main negotiating groups.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I’d want to know that, and I think that’s a very important question for him to answer.”Ettedgui, whose credits include Kinky Boots, McQueen and Super/Man: the Christopher Reeve Story, went on: “Once he found out I was Jewish, you know, that was it. I have this incredibly clear memory of him persistently heckling and hectoring me as a Jew.“He’d kind of come up to me wherever we were. Might be in the classroom. It might be in the school grounds. And he’d say things like ‘Hitler was right’ and ‘Gas em’ and ‘ssssss’, the sound of gas escaping, basically.”Ettedgui said he could not understand why Farage had not simply apologised for his alleged past conduct.He said: “The easiest thing for him to have said when these allegations first came up would have been: ‘Yes, I did say some extraordinarily upsetting things to people that were racist. And I unreservedly apologise to them for that. But I can assure them and the general public that this has nothing to do with my politics today.’ He’s never said that.“I mean, there was a statement that went out from someone from Reform, a spokesperson from Reform. He says there’s no primary evidence, it’s one person’s word against another. If things like this happened a very, very long time ago, you can’t necessarily recollect what happened. I mean, that makes me really, really angry.“Because of course you can, you know, of course I can. And it’s about making sure that before someone goes into a voting booth and casts a vote for Nigel Farage as their prime minister, their leader, the person who’s going to affect policy for the next years to come, that there’s a full understanding of who he is.“And, as I say, that doesn’t mean to say that he’s racist today, but the question needs to be asked and the repeated denials from both himself and his spokespeople. [I] mean that the question is still very much there.”Stevens, the Labour MP for Cardiff East, who became Welsh secretary in 2024, said: “I think [Farage] needs to explain himself, because if he doesn’t explain himself, what [the Guardian] has reported is there for everybody to see.“If he doesn’t, the assumption will be that he did say that. And then you do wonder if he’d formed those views at that age, how much has he changed, if at all? Do you want that sort of man running the country? In a million years, I wouldn’t want Nigel Farage running the United Kingdom.”A Reform spokesperson said on Thursday, in response to Starmer’s calls in the House of Commons for Farage to address the issue: “If things like this happened a very, very long time ago, you can’t necessarily recollect what happened.”A recent YouGov poll had Reform 10 percentage points ahead of Labour in the polls.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKLiz KendallnewsShareReuse this content"

It simply stated: “HHS [health and human services] has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.”The changes appear to be the latest example of Kennedy’s determination to impose his beliefs on the sprawling Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC. They also triggered severe backlash from scientists and advocates, with former and present CDC staff saying the updated page did not go through the normal, scientific clearance process.“I spoke with several scientists at CDC yesterday and none were aware of this change in content,” Debra Houry, one of a group of CDC top officials who resigned in August, told the AP.“When scientists are cut out of scientific reviews, then inaccurate and ideologic information results.”The move was also condemned by theAutismScience Foundation, an organization that initially gave a cautious welcome to Kennedy’s stated mission to investigate the causes of autism – a disorder that can manifest itself in speech difficulties and repetitive behavior – after his confirmation.“We are appalled to find that the content on the CDC webpage ‘Autism and Vaccines’ has been changed and distorted, and is now filled with anti-vaccine rhetoric and outright lies about vaccines and autism,” the foundation said in a statement.Aprevious versionof the page stated that “studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD). No links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.”Widespread scientific consensus and decades of studies have firmly concluded there is no link between vaccines and autism.Pediatricians fill vaccine messaging void left by CDC amid bad flu seasonRead more“The conclusion is clear and unambiguous,” said Dr Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a statement Thursday.“We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations.”The CDC has, until now, echoed the absence of a link in promoting Food and Drug Administration-licensed vaccines. A number of former CDC officials have said that what the CDC posts about certain subjects – including vaccine safety – can no longer be trusted.Dr Daniel Jernigan, who also resigned from the agency in August, told reporters that Kennedy seems to be “going from evidence-based decision making to decision-based evidence making”.Besides positing a link between vaccines and autism, Kennedy has subscribed to thebelief that the condition may be caused by pregnant people taking Tylenol, a suspicion pushed vociferously by Donald Trump, who has urged expectant mothers to avoid taking the over-the-counter drug.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationVaccines and immunisationRobert F Kennedy JrAutismHealthUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But Kendall told the Guardian: “They know that if they don’t implement [and] use the powers that they’ve got in the act, they will lose the trust of the public.”Last week, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after viewing harmful online content, said he hadlost trust in the watchdog’s leadership.Kendall did not give her backing when asked about her own trust in the regulator’s leadership on Thursday.The tech secretary was speaking amid concerns that parts of the online safety regime are not expected to come into effect until the middle of 2027 – nearly four years since the Online Safety Act became law – and that, in the meantime, the speed at which the technological frontier is advancing risks outpacing government guardrails.Kendall said she was now “really worried about AI chatbots” and “the impact they’re having on children and young people”.The dangers have been highlighted by US lawsuits involving teenagers who took their own lives after becoming highly engaged withChatGPTand Character.AI chatbots, which they treated as confidants and advisers.“If chatbots aren’t included or properly covered by the legislation, and we’re really working through that now, then they will have to be,” Kendall said. “People have got to feel their kids are safe.”Ofcom’s chair, Michael Grade, is due to step down in April, prompting a search for a new leader. Dawes, a career civil servant, has been in post as chief executive for nearly six years. Ofcom declined to comment.View image in fullscreenMichael Grade will soon leave his role as chair of Ofcom.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesOn Thursday, the watchdog fined a “nudify” app £50,000 for failing to protect children from accessing pornography. Nudify apps typically use AI to “undress” uploaded photos.Kendall said Ofcom was “rightly pressing forward”. It was the second fine issued by the regulator under the act since it became law more than two years ago.Kendall was speaking in Cardiff at the launch of a new AI “growth zone”, which the government hopes will attract £10bn in investment and create 5,000 jobs on various sites stretching from the Ford Bridgend engine plant to Newport.The government said Microsoft was one of the companies “joining forces with the government”, but Microsoft said it was not making any new investment commitments.Ministers are also hoping to use £100m to back British startups, particularly in designing the chips that power AI, where the government believes the UK has a competitive advantage. But it may be tough to compete with the US chip manufacturer Nvidia, which this week reported it is making nearly $22bn a month.‘Enforced veganism’: Ofcom lets GB News flout accuracy rules, say climate campaignersRead moreOn Wednesday, a Labour MP alleged Microsoft hasbeen “ripping off” the UK taxpayer. The US tech company made at least £1.9bn from government deals in the financial year 2024-25.Asked if she agreed, Kendall praised Microsoft’s AI technology, as used in her own constituency to create school lesson plans, but said: “We’ve got to do more to make sure that we have got the right people in the room who know about those companies and can negotiate the best possible deal. I would also like to see more homegrown companies, particularly in AI.”A spokesperson for Microsoft said the NHS buys its services through a national pricing framework negotiated by the UK government, “ensuring both transparency and value for money” and that its partnerships provide “measurable benefits”.“The UK government chooses to spend its technology budget across a variety of suppliers and Microsoft is privileged to be one of them,” they said.In the UK, the youth suicide charityPapyruscan be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or emailpat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

They said they suspected Ali was “no longer alive” and may have been murdered.But on Thursday, the force said in a statement: “Detectives investigating the suspicious disappearance of Bradford man Ismail Ali in 2020 can confirm that he turned up at a police station yesterday reporting to be safe and well. Officers are working to understand the full circumstances surrounding his disappearance.”The statement added: “Mr Ali’s family have been notified that he has been found safe and well and is being safeguarded whilst necessary checks are being made.”The force said house searches were carried out at three properties after Monday’s arrests and a large amount of cash was seized.It said a number of those arrested remained on bail for suspected money laundering offences and inquiries were ongoing.The statement added: “Officers would like to thank members of the public who shared the appeal for Mr Ali.”According to reports in 2020, Ali, then 46, was last seen in the shop he worked at in the Lidget Green area of Bradford on Friday 29 May. He was wearing a red hooded top, black trousers and dark footwear.His disappearance has featured in a number of appeals over the last five years, with police saying his family were concerned for his welfare.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “The failure of my force has been appalling.”He said he had been left speechless by the “numerous errors” and hurt to Buzzard-Quashie, who had for most of the saga represented herself in court.Balhatchet said: “It is my responsibility to make sure it never happens again.”Basu said the court’s withering condemnation of the force last week had been a “public humiliation and shaming”.Buzzard-Quashie wanted video footage of her arrest, including from police body-worn cameras, which the force did not provide.She complained to the Information Commissioner’s Office, which made an order that all video should be handed over, which the force ignored, before a county court judge made another order, which the force failed to obey again.The force told courts it did not have any more video to hand over, then reversed its position at a hearing in October.Delivering their judgment, Lady Justice Asplin, Lord Justice Coulson and Lord Justice Fraser said that one video clip now handed over vindicates Buzzard-Quashie’s concerns about the arrest. The judgment said police had told the court the clip did not exist but it had in fact been viewed previously by police.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You would expect us and GCHQ and others to have deep expertise around.”The Security Service will not disclose details of the advice it has given to ministers as the planning decision nears, but it is understood that its opinions will have been passed up to the Home Office, its sponsor department.A government source said the message that the security services were relaxed about the proposed development had been communicated to ministers. A spokesperson for the Commons speaker declined to comment.Opponents of the project have cited security concerns, including regarding the presence of cables beneath the site connecting to the City ofLondon, as a reason it should be rejected.There are also concerns about the traffic andsafety implications for local residents, and critics have questioned the optics of allowing China to build its biggest diplomatic outpost in London.However, a former senior British intelligence officer said that, while it was well-known that “embassies are nests for spies”, their location “also presented an opportunity” for potential surveillance.Ministers are weighing up whether to approve the super-embassy by 10 December, having already pushed back the decision twice.The delays have drawn the ire of the Chinese government,which demanded last monththat the UK “immediately fulfil its obligations and honour its commitments otherwise the British side shall bear all consequences”.Beijing isblocking extensive renovation worksat the British embassy in Beijing while the fate of its own embassy building in London is being decided.The Guardiandisclosed that Boris Johnson, while he was foreign secretary, wrote to his Chinese counterpart in 2018 saying he was “committed to ensuring that our projects develop alongside each other”.Richard Moore, who stepped down as chief of MI6 in September, indicated in a series of interviews this month that a compromise was likely to be reached.“I’m sure there has to be a way through where they get an appropriate embassy and we are allowed to retain and develop our own, excellent embassy in Beijing,” he told Bloomberg.“We need [an embassy] in Beijing and it’s important that we have that, so it’s right and proper that the Chinese should get their embassy. Whether it’s this one or not isn’t really for me to judge.”Nigel Inkster, a senior adviser at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and former assistant chief of MI6, said “the size of the embassy is immaterial” and that “it is far easier to monitor staff centred in one location rather than dispersed all around the city”.Inkster added that many countries, including China, now avoid spying out of diplomatic outposts because the increasing sophistication of surveillance technologies had made such operations more difficult.China also recruits people online. Earlier this week,MI5 accused two LinkedIn headhuntersbased in China of acting as fronts for the country’s powerful ministry of state security, seeking to recruit politicians and their associations.An espionage alert was circulated to MPs and peers warning about the activities of two LinkedIn accounts under the names of Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen.Explore more on these topicsChinaMI5LondonForeign policyUK security and counter-terrorismnewsShareReuse this content"

But as many as 1,000 more are believed to still be living in the water.Under Ontario’s ministry of natural resources and forestry guidelines, fish can be euthanized through percussive stunning, electrical stunning or pithing.“The fact that we’ve had approximately 6,000 fish in this pond, in this year, is mind-blowing,” councillor Riley Brockington, who represents the area, told CBC News.“It’s just a number that’s difficult for me to wrap my head around.”Female goldfish produce large amounts of offspring, with a single mature fish able to lay more than 100,000 eggs.View image in fullscreenCelebration pond in Ottawa Central Park neighbourhood.Photograph: Google MapsCarleton biology professor Steven Cooke told the national broadcaster the actual population of the Celebration Park shoal could far exceed official estimates, speculating that there could be millions of tiny young goldfish in the pond, undetected.The scourge of goldfish – a species native to Asia and most commonly found in fish tanks – has become a growing problem as the fish are deliberately released by pet owners into increasingly warm waters.Goldfish can grow to immense sizes in large bodies of water, have few predators and reproduce rapidly. They displace native species and harm plant growth by churning up waters of ponds.Warming water temperatures from a changing climate have also created more hospitable environments for the populations as they spread through local waterways and into the Great Lakes.Authorities in theCanadaand the US have pleaded with aquarium owners to stop releasing pet fish into waterways. In Minnesota, officials removed nearly 50,000 goldfish from local waters. They warned that fish which might be only two or three inches long when they are released can grow to more than 1ft long.Shelby Riskin, an ecologist at the University of Toronto, said that stormwater ponds have increasingly become a breeding ground for the cast-off fish and present a challenge when trying to restore local ecosystems.“There are these flooded areas - and I’m thinking of one in [Toronto’s Don Valley] that can seem no larger than a puddle - and yet at certain times of the year it’s just filled with goldfish,” she said.The fish can thrive in turbid, oxygen-depleted environments, often outlasting and outcompeting local species.“You look and and just see the toxic vape packets floating by these animals.

The industry’s move for increased access also marks an effort to increase jobs and US energy independence,according to the Associated Press.The federal government has prohibited offshore drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which extends fromFloridashores to portions of Alabama, since 1995. The ban stemmed from worries about potential oil spills.How a Texas shrimper stalled Exxon’s $10bn plastics plant | Shilpi ChhotrayRead moreWhileCaliforniadoes have some offshore oil development, there have not been new leases in federal waters for nearly 30 years, the AP said.A proposed schedule for petroleum leasing in federal waters includes up to 34 auctions from 2026 to 2031; these auctions include up to six sales off California’s coastline, 21 off of Alaska’s coastline, and two in the Gulf of Mexico’s eastern portion, Politico said. The sales inAlaskawould reportedly include a region that has never had oil drilling.The move reflects Trump’s dogged efforts to roll back former president Joe Biden’s efforts against global heating. Trump has described climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, and launched a National Energy Dominance Council to boost domestic energy production, with an emphasis on fossil fuels, AP noted.Trump has simultaneously thwarted renewable energy development including offshore windfarms. His administration has also axed billions in green energy grants, the AP said.California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, a Trump foe weighing a presidential run, rejected offshore drilling expansion, calling it “dead on arrival”.Offshore oil development has faced bipartisan opposition in Florida, where unblemished beaches and sparkling waters underpin the state’s $131bntourism industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

InGazaCity, medical officials said two airstrikes killed 16 people, including seven children and three women.Israel said itlaunched the attacksafter its soldiers came under fire in Khan Younis on Wednesday, though they suffered no reported casualties. Hamas condemned the Israeli strikes as a “shocking massacre” and denied firing toward Israeli troops.Palestinians in Gaza said they felt as if the two-year war had never stopped. Officials in the territory say more than 300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes since the ceasefire.“My daughter kept asking me all night, ‘Will the war come back?’ Every time we try to regain hope, the shelling starts again. When will this nightmare end?” Lina Kuraz, 33, from the Tuffah neighbourhood, east of Gaza City, told Agence France-Presse.Mohammed Hamdouna, 36, who was displaced from northern Gaza to a tent in al-Mawasi, said the war had not ended. “The intensity of the death toll has decreased, but martyrs and shelling happen every day. We are still living in tents. The cities are rubble; the crossings are still closed, and all the basic necessities of life are still lacking,” he said.View image in fullscreenIsraeli airstrikes on camps in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, killed 17 people on Wednesday, hospital officials said.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersQatar, a key mediator throughout the two-year war, condemned the “brutal” Israeli airstrikes, saying they were “a dangerous escalation that threatens to undermine the ceasefire agreement”.On Monday the UN security council endorsed Donald Trump’s plan for Gaza, including the deployment of aninternational stabilisation forceand a possible path to a sovereign Palestinian state.Shelter and food in desperately short supply as Gaza braces for harsh winterRead moreHowever, huge challenges remain. It is unclear how Hamas will be made to relinquish its weapons, who will supply the troops for the new peacekeeping force, and how “full aid” will reach Gaza without Israel lifting many of its current restrictions on humanitarian supplies.Hamas is still holding the remains of three hostages, and Israeli military forces hold more than 50% of Gaza after withdrawing from some of their positions at the time of the ceasefire. The territory is now divided by the “yellow line”.Gaza’s health ministry has reported more than 300 deaths since the ceasefire came into effect, an average of more than seven a day. Each side has accused the other of violating its terms, which include increasing the flow of aid into Gaza and returning hostages, dead or alive, to Israel.The two-year war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 during a surprise attack into Israel in October 2023. More than 69,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the ensuring Israeli offensive and in strikes since the ceasefire. The bodies of thousands moreremain under the rubble.The new violence in Gaza coincided with a barrage of Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon on Wednesday. A day earlier, an Israeli airstrike killed 13 people in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh, the deadliest Israeli attack on Lebanon since a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict a year ago.Agence France-Presse andthe Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

We welcome all the meaningful efforts to end this war, but like we have said before, it has to be just and lasting. That also means that the Ukrainians, but also the Europeans, agree to this.”View image in fullscreenThe EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: ‘We haven’t seen any concessions on the Russian side.’Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty ImagesMinisters were solid and calm about the latest plan, Kallas told reporters after the meeting, “because we have seen this before, and because different peace plans cannot work if the Europeans and Ukrainians do not agree to this”.She stressed the EU would continue working on sanctions to increase pressure on Russia: “The EU has a very clear two-point plan: first, weaken Russia; second, support Ukraine.”The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, sounded a similar note. “All negotiations about a ceasefire, regarding the further peaceful development of Ukraine, can only be discussed and negotiated with Ukraine,” he said. “And Europe will have to be included.”The draftUS-Russian peace plan, which emerged in media reports on Wednesday, would require Ukraine to surrender territory and cede unprecedented control over its political and military sovereignty to Russia. It came after a massive Russian drone and military attack on western Ukrainekilled at least 26 peopleand injured more than 100 in their apartments.Jean-Noël Barrot, the French foreign minister, said peace could not mean capitulation. “The principle of peace must start with a ceasefire on the line of contact which will allow engagement in discussions on the questions of territories and security guarantees. That is what we have always said, that is what Ukraine has always said … But what we see today is that Russia andVladimir Putinare an obstacle to peace.”Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, who was expected to inform his counterparts about thesabotage attack on Poland’s railway networkthis week, said: “We commend peace efforts. But Europe is the main player, the main supporter of Ukraine, and it is, of course, Europe’s security that’s at stake. So we expect to be consulted.”“I hope it is not the victim that has restrictions on its ability to defend itself, but it’s the aggressor whose aggressive potential should be restricted,” he added.View image in fullscreenRadosław Sikorski, Poland’s foreign minister, said Europe’s wider security was at stake in any future peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.Photograph: Czarek Sokołowski/APMinisters were meeting as Russia’s parliament said that any “confiscation” of Russian assets by the EU should draw legal action against Belgium and Euroclear, the Brussels-based depository where most of the frozen sovereign wealth is held.The EU is stalled over a plan to use Russia’s frozen assetsto generate a €140bn (£123bn) loan for Ukraine, largely because Belgium is seeking further guarantees about legal risks.

The Brussels-based securities depository houses around two-thirds of all Russia’s sovereign wealth in the west.What do we know about the reported US-Russian plan to end the Ukraine war?Read moreOn Thursday the Duma – Vladimir Putin’srubberstamp parliament– voted unanimously in favour of the resolution, according to a statement on its website. “The confiscation of Russian assets – no matter how artful the disguise – cannot be conceived as anything other than a violation of Russia’s sovereign rights,” it said. “Any infringement of Russian assets must draw an appropriate legal response, starting with claims for damages – with the demand for the seizure of property as a security measure – towards Euroclear and Belgium.”Euroclear declined to comment, but referred to an interview its chief executive, Valérie Urbain, gave to Le Monde earlier this month. Anything that remotely resembled confiscationwould be illegal, she told the paper: “We must be extremely vigilant,” she said, warning that Russia could take legal action.Kallas did not refer to the Duma vote directly, but said Russia was afraid of the reparations loan, suggesting that explained Moscow’s interest in the latest peace plan. “I think they are coming to the point where they are running out of money and they want to show outside that they are super strong ... but actually it’s not the case,” she said.In Brussels on Thursday, Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, voiced his government’s typical hostility to EU efforts to support Ukraine, saying it would be unimaginable to “send the money of the Hungarian people to a corrupt Ukrainian war mafia”. This is a likely reference tothe corruption scandal engulfing Ukraine’s government, which Budapest has seized on to bolster its anti-Ukraine stance.Explore more on these topicsEuropeEuropean UnionUkraineVladimir PutinUrsula von der LeyenRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Britain has a problem | Richard PartingtonRead moreThe figures mean one in eight young people are Neet amid a rapid increase in unemployment more broadly, with the official jobless rate at 5%, the highest level since the Covid pandemic. Last weekthe Guardian revealedthat almost half of all jobs shed since Labour came to power were among the under-25s.Barry Fletcher, the chief executive of the Youth Futures Foundation, said: “This is a long-term problem that continues to negatively shape the lives of too many across the country.”The squeeze on spare cash for young people contributed to a 3.3% slide in sales at established JD Group stores in the three months to 1 November. Sales were also down in the US and EU – by 1.7% and 1.1% respectively – amid similar pressures as well as a lack of new product launches to draw in shoppers and the slowdown in the trend for women’s vintage trainers.The company has also suffered from a heavy reliance on Nike, whichhas been strugglingto spur consumer interest recently with critics pointing to a lack of new ideas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asda was once one of the UK’s biggest retailers – where will it all end?”Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, said: “From the outside it looks like a sign of weakness that tangible fixed assets are being sold at this time.”He said the deal might help Asda to pay off debt or allow more capital to invest in the business but would also mean higher rents, meaning less cash for day-to-day operations.“If trading was hunky dory, that can be accommodated in the big scheme of things, but that is not the case. We had expected a more stable trading position from Asda by now,” Black said. “Recent market share data has been very poor for grocery. It all feels rather tight.”Patrick O’Brien, an analyst at GlobalData, said Asda’s promise in March under its new chair, Allan Leighton, to stir up the market with abarrage of pricecuts, did not appear to have hit home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have gone to two buyers: DTZ Investors and Blue Owl Capital.The deal is part of plan to cut hefty debts at Asda since a highly leveraged£6.8bn takeoverin 2020 by the billionaire Issa brothers and the private equity firm TDR Capital. TDR now controls the group after buying out one of the brothers, Zuber Issa, while Mohsin Issa retains a 22% stake.Amarveer Singh, a credit analyst at CreditSights, said the deal would negatively affect Asda’s credit rating as it would increase leasehold exposure while the proceeds of the sale and leaseback would not be used for investment or cutting the group’s main debts. Bonds fell as it emerged that the money is to be used to pay off a debt to Walmart, the US retailer that previously owned Asda and retains a 10% stake, as first reported by the Financial Times.Asda previously sold most of its warehouses for £1.7bn in 2021, and 25 supermarkets for £650m two years later, in similar deals in which it agreed to lease back the properties. It also signed a more unusual ground rent deal for £300m in 2023.An Asda spokesperson said: “Asda’s property strategy is centred on maintaining a strong freehold base while also taking a considered and selective approach to unlocking value from our estate where appropriate. These transactions reflect that approach, enabling us to realise value from the sites while retaining full operational control.”Explore more on these topicsAsdaSupermarketsRetail industryLeedsnewsShareReuse this content"

As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI from pre-training to post-training to inference.”The company surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in nearly every regard, as it has for multiple quarters in a row, a sign that the financially enormous AI boom is not slowing down. Nvidia reported $1.30 in diluted earnings per share on $57.01bn in total revenues, beating investor expectations of $1.26 in earnings per share on $54.9bn in revenue. Sales are up 62% year-over-year. The company reported $51.2bn in revenue from datacenter sales, beating expectations of $49bn. The company is also projecting fourth- quarter revenue of around $65bn; analysts had predicted the company would issue a guidance of $61bn.On the call with investors, Huang said that there were three huge platform shifts: a transition from general purpose computing to accelerated computing; a transition to generative AI and a transition to agentic and physical AI, eg robots or autonomous vehicles.“As you consider infrastructure investments, consider these three fundamental dynamics,” Huang said. “Each will contribute to infrastructural wealth. Nvidia … enables all three transitions and does so for any form or modality of AI.”Demand for the company’s chips continues to grow, he said.“AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As investors worry that mounting CapEx will force companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Nvidia continues to prove that datacenter scaling is not optional, but rather the central need for every tech business in the world.”Analysts and experts said that although they were largely confident Nvidia would beat Wall Street expectations, they were anxiously awaiting the earnings call for morenews on the status of industry demand for the firm’s AI chips.“There is still no doubt that Nvidia is far and away the leader for AI-focused chips,” David Meier, senior analyst at investment websitethe Motley Fool, wrote. “So, I expect revenue, margins, and cashflows to be pretty close to analysts’ estimates. But the valuable information is more likely to come from the commentary about where management sees its markets headed, whether it’s in the AI market or [a] new market the company is currently pursuing.”Shares in Nvidia have been down 7.9% in November after major investors dumped their stocks in the firm. Peter Thiel’s hedge fund,Thiel Macro, sold off its entire stake in the chipmaker in the last quarter. His holdings would have been valued at about $100m, according to a Reuters report. Softbank has also sold off its $5.8bn holdings in the company, further boosting fears of an AI bubble.Shares in Nvidia – which last month became the world’s first $5tn company – rose more than 5% in post-market trade, while S+P 500 and Nasdaq futures also soared. Asian markets also rallied on Thursday, following the news.However, SPI Asset Management’s Stephen Innes said: “Nvidia’s latest forecast has, for now, dulled the sharpest edges of the AI-bubble anxiety that had gripped global markets … But make no mistake: this is still a market balancing on a wire stretched between AI euphoria and debt-filled reality.”“I do not believe that Nvidia’s growth is sustainable long-term,” said Forrester’s senior analyst Alvin Nguyen. “AI demand is unprecedented, but if there is a market correction due to supply meeting demand or a slowdown in the pace of innovation/businesses getting used to the pace, I expect that the continued growth in Nvidia share value will slow down.”Explore more on these topicsNvidiaArtificial intelligence (AI)Quarterly resultsStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

What we’re seeing now is that customer demand is not in line with that ambition.”Brankin added: “It’s really easy to sell people things they want,. It’s hard to sell people things they don’t want.”Many new EVs are sold to businesses for their employees, who benefit from lower rates of “company car tax” compared with diesel or petrol options.Brankin said Reeves should retain this tax benefit for companies “greening” their fleets.Ford, whose world headquarters is in Michigan in the US, employs about 6,000 people in the UK, including at its diesel engine plant in Dagenham.Brankin said the company was yet to make any decisions about the long-term future of the Dagenham plant, which will build diesel engines up until 2030.“We’re working really hard on what the next life of Dagenham looks like,”she said, adding there was “nothing that we’ve settled on at the moment”.A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there’s no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers whilst backing the transition to electric vehicles, which is why we have invested £4bn in support, including grants to cut upfront costs by up to £3,750 per eligible vehicle.“Just as it is right to seek a tax system that fairly funds roads, infrastructure and public services, we will look at further support measures to make owning electric vehicles more convenient and more affordable.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsFordAutomotive industryTax and spendingMotoringBudget 2025TaxnewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what it needs to doMichael HoganThu 20 Nov 2025 09.45 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 09.47 ESTShareMother of God, fella, they’re back at last. In a rare piece of good news for the beleaguered BBC, blockbuster dramaLine of Dutyis to return for a long-awaited seventh series. So long-awaited, in fact, that many fans feared it would never happen. Luckily, the police still need policing. Even the fictional Central police force.The last run of creator Jed Mercurio’s corrupt cop thriller was the top-rated TV drama (excluding soaps) since modern records began in 2002, pulling in an average of 16 million viewers and a whopping 17 million for the finale over 28 days. The show’s three stars will now reprise their roles in a six-part comeback that begins filming in Belfast next spring.As we return, anti-corruption unit AC-12 has been disbanded, rebranded as the Inspectorate of Police Standards. The dream team of Steve Arnott (Martin Compston), Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) and Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar) are assigned “their most sensitive case so far”.Det Insp Dominic Gough is a charismatic officer, making his name for a string of takedowns of organised crime. However, he is accused of abusing his position of trust to act as a sexual predator. Is Gough guilty? Or is his case a deliberate distraction from a bigger threat?We’re only interested in one thing and that’s catching bent coppers. Oh, and whether Line 0f Duty can recapture its magic after a five-year absence. Here are the (AC-)12 things we want to see from the revival …1. Cast a big-name antagonistView image in fullscreenUnder investigation … Lennie James as DCI Tony Gates in the opening season of Line of Duty in 2012.Photograph: AlamyWe need a complex villain to keep us guessing. The previous six series have boasted top-tier talent as the team’s adversaries. In chronological order,Lennie James,Keeley Hawes, Daniel Mays, Thandiwe Newton, Stephen Graham andKelly Macdonaldhave been investigated by our heroes. Who will play dodgy DI Gough? Casting should aim high. Matthew Macfadyen,Paapa Essiedu, Matt Smith,Adeel Akhtaror Andrew Scott, maybe?2. No more damp-squib revealsThe series six finale was widely derided when it unmasked the shadowy string-puller known as “H”. It turned out to be bumbling DSI Ian Buckells (Nigel Boyle), who wasn’t so much a criminal mastermind as an inept chancer who had failed upwards. Cue howls of disappointment from sofas nationwide. The new series is a chance to retrofit this anticlimax as a red herring, with hapless Buckells taking a hit for the real supervillain.3. Long interrogation scenesView image in fullscreenOn the record … Sian Reese-Williams as Sgt Jane Cafferty gets the AC-12 treatment in series five.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyLine of Duty became renowned for its trademark interview scenes – claustrophobic cat-and-mouse showdowns that begin with a long beep from the recording device, before lasting up to 20 minutes. Suspected wrong ’uns are probed. Surprises are sprung. Shot in one take, they’re like rivetingly tense mini-plays. Plenty of these please.4. Strip back the storytellingThe last two series became too bogged down by interwoven plots, recurring side characters and the show’s own lore. Keep it simple. Follow a knotty main case, with one overarching storyline at most.5. LOA (lots of acronyms)Line of Duty became notorious for its liberal use of police jargon. The MIT are investigating the OCG. They’ve embedded a UCO and have a CHIS. RTC up ahead. Possible GSW. Put AFOs on standby and await sit-rep.6. Keep action realisticView image in fullscreenEat lead? Martin Compston in season five.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyHigh-octane sequences sometimes got silly – remember gun-totingVicky McClureclinging to the side of a lorry? – but such set pieces add adrenaline-pumping thrills. Armed response raids would go wrong. Prison vans would get rammed off the road. Police convoys would be hijacked by sinister black SUVs. Make them exciting but still plausible.7. Real-world resonanceMercurio’s writing has often been at its best when close to the bone – whether it’s referencingJean Charles de Menezes,Jill Dando, Jimmy Savile orStephen Lawrence. As Mercurio wryly noted in the recent announcement: “Corruption in this country is supposed to have come to an end while Line of Duty was off-air, so I’ve been forced to use my imagination.” The new case sounds ripe for real-life parallels and righteous anger.8. Waistcoats, swears and Ted-ismsView image in fullscreenTed talk? Adrian Dunbar as Supt Hastings in season five.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyCocky Arnott wore estate agent waistcoats. Steely Fleming got one good swear per series (“Stop making a tit of yourself and piss off”). Warhorse Hastings dispensed homespun Ulster catchphrases (sucking on diesel, wee donkey, etc). These constants must not change.9. Be willing to kill off charactersView image in fullscreenTerminated … Jessica Raine as DC Georgia Trotman in series two.Photograph: AlamyNot since Game of Thrones has a drama been so ready to ruthlessly dispatch its big players. Jessica Raine and Daniel Mays lasted just a single episode apiece. Countless others have gone to the great holding cell in the sky. Shock deaths raise the stakes and keep viewers guessing.10. A comeback for CarmichaelView image in fullscreenInsufferable … Anna Maxwell Martin’s DCS Carmichael in season five, 2019.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyAnna Maxwell Martin went viral for her villainous turn as DCS Patricia Carmichael – an insufferably smug rival who had it in for Hastings and wanted to close down AC-12. Now she’s got her wish, let’s see her gloating – before getting her comeuppance.‘The job of a lifetime’: Line of Duty to return for seventh seasonRead more11. No box-set dropIt has become standard practice for the BBC to release its flagship dramas as iPlayer box sets. This would be a mistake with a show as suspenseful as Line of Duty. It should be a communal viewing experience, thriving on cliffhangers and sustained tension. Waiting for the next episode fuels fan theories and sparks debate. Eliminate the spoiler problem and make it event TV, like a fictional equivalent of The Traitors. But less farty.12. Don’t leave it so long next timeIf the new series airs in late 2026 or early 2027, as predicted, it will be almost a six-year gap between series. Let’s not let such lengthy waits become standard. Ted Hastings will be well past retirement age, for a start. He didn’t float up the Lagan in a bubble.Explore more on these topicsLine of DutyTelevisionDramaVicky McClureAdrian DunbarTV crime dramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

You just can’t look awayAdrian SearleThu 20 Nov 2025 12.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 14.28 ESTShareSometimes a smaller exhibition is more effective than a full-blown survey.Bridget Riley: Learning to Seeat Margate’s Turner Contemporary brings us an invigorating and magical ensemble, juxtaposing 26 works from the 1960s to the present and shuttling between large canvases, studies and works painted directly on the wall. Learning to See concentrates the mind and sharpens the eye.Riley’s paintings come at you all at once. They arrest you and they still you. The longer you look, the more they reveal and the more they seem to change. As they ensnare you, the more rewarding they become. “How does she do that?”,might be a first thought. How are the colours ordered, what’s the logic of their construction? But there’re also the things they do to your nervous system, in that unknowable gulf between eye and brain, between perception and its after-image. The colour values of Dancing to the Music of Time (2022), a big wall drawing made originally for a museum in Canberra, go dun-coloured as you first approach, until each painted disc begins to glow with a silvery penumbra. Comparing colours, you can’t remember the last as you come to the next. I pinball back and forth, getting lost in the music. Angel, a smaller wall drawing, has discs whose stately turning alignments have the kind of brevity and apparent simplicity and inevitability of a few piano phrases by Erik Satie. It’s simple. It’s complicated. It’s mesmerising.View image in fullscreenDemanding attention … Bridget Riley in front of Dancing to the Music of Time.Photograph: Holger NiehausGetting up close and backing away, you can get ensnared by Riley’s systems and her logic. However analytical you might try to be, they continue doing things to you on a physical, phenomenological level. We are not accountants of the optical, and Riley reminds us that we are bodies in space, perceiving the world. Through the window on the balcony, there is a horizon between sea and sky. On the wall opposite, Riley’s horizons keep multiplying. Pin them down and they slip away.These are not eye tests. Riley makes you look, and not only at things she has painted. The 94-year-old artist makes you acutely aware of time lengthening and compressing. Where you stand or sit, how you approach and step back, how she makes you turn and raise or lower your eyes, and go from one work to another, all come into play. She makes you do it again and again, even as you stare at a single work. How alive she makes me feel. Those turning points and axes and intervals, those multiplying staves of colour which she orders, re-orders and repeats, generate both movement and a magisterial sense of implacable stasis.With its perfectly calibrated, wave-like rhythm, Arrest 3, from 1965, loses me in the same kind of optical conundrum as a pattern on a tiled Moorish floor. Streak 3 (1980), with its even more complex and dense curving coloured lines, flowing together and apart, pulls my eye over the swell of its cross-currents as the undertow drags me along.The close-packed verticals in Pharaoh, painted last year, are held in place by eight regularly spaced white pauses; moments where you hold your breath until, stepping away, you come up for air.View image in fullscreenA swell of cross-currents … Streak 3, 1980.Photograph: John Webb/© Bridget Riley 2025. All rights reserved. Courtesy of the artist.Riley’s recent Current paintings are like seeing a pattern of triangles through the distorting ripples of a glazed door. Larger triangles and serpentine rhythms proliferate, less on the paintings themselves than in the viewer’s mind. The two paintings titled Late Morning: one a broad canvas filled with horizontals (1967-8), the other (from 1978) with the filled tight verticals, have me finding bulges and falterings where none exist. I end up on my hands and knees, checking. Why are they named after a time of day? Does time sweep away toward the edges of the painting, the past receding to one side, advancing and brightening into an undefined future on the other? I’m lost in the incomprehensible middle of things.For much of her long career, it has been Riley’s belief that “as a modern artist you should make a contribution to the art of your time, if only a small one”. Riley’s contribution grows with time. She has been both singular and focused in her preoccupation with the acts of looking and of seeing. The two are not the same. Seeing can be a glimpse (what de Kooning once called a “slipping glimpse”), but Riley prolongs the glimpse and the slippage into prolonged and repeated acts of looking. She turns concentration into reverie and leaves me agape, wide-open and surprised. I can’t stop looking.Bridget Riley: Learning to See is atTurner Contemporary, Margate,22 November to 4 MayExplore more on these topicsBridget RileyArtPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

When he has a new project heading for the small screen, everybody wants a part of him.Ken Burns on Leonardo da Vinci: ‘He may be the person of the last millennium’Read moreBurns has done “more fucking podcasts than I ever thought possible”, he says, nearing the end of nine-month promotional tour that included 40 cities, 80 screenings and hundreds of interviews. “I think there are 340.1m podcasts, one for every American, and I’ve done half of them.”Fortunately Burns is a force of nature, as loquacious behind the mic as he is prolific in the editing room. The 72-year-old has gone everywhere from Monticello toThe Joe Rogan Experienceto talk about one of his most ambitious projects: The American Revolution, a monumental six-part, 12-hour documentary series that dominated the past decade of his life and arrived this week on PBS.Like slow cooking in an age of fast food,The American Revolutionis defiantly traditional, more redolent of The World at War, narrated by Laurence Olivier for British television, or Burns’s own The Civil War, which launched a thousand sepia-tinted parodies to the plangent strains of a fiddle, than the era of streaming docs and podcast series.But for Burns, who has built a career chronicling strands of US history including baseball, country music, jazz and national parks, its origin story is not just another subject but foundational. “I said this to my co-directorSarah Botsteinthe other day, and she agreed: we won’t work on a more important film,” Burns reflects by phone from New York. “Hopefully there are as important things coming up but this one has a singularity to it.”Burns, co-directors Botstein and David Schmidt and screenwriter Geoffrey Ward drew upon thousands of books and other historical materials. Dozens of historians, spanning age and perspective, provided on-air commentary along with leading scholars from a range of other fields including slavery (Vincent Brown), Native American history (Ned Blackhawk) and the British empire (Maya Jasanoff).The style of the series will feel familiar to devotees of The Civil War, one of the most influential and widely watched documentaries in US television history. Its distinctive style included slow pans and zooms across still photos, generous use of period music and actors such as Sam Waterston,Morgan Freemanand Jason Robards reading diaries, letters and speeches.That was the moment Burns established his reputation; a generation later, now the doyen of documentaries, he can apparently summon any actor he chooses. Appearing alongside Burns at a recent event at Trinity Church in New York, the Hamilton creatorLin-Manuel Miranda observed: “When Ken Burns calls, you say ‘Yes.’”The decade-long production schedule also helped in terms of flexibility. Recordings took place in studios, on location and remotely via Zoom, a tool embraced during the pandemic. Burns recounts working with Josh Brolin, who found a few free hours in Atlanta to record his lines as George Washington before flying off to his next engagement.Brolin is joined by Kenneth Branagh, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Morgan Freeman,Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Jonathan Groff, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Samuel L Jackson, Michael Keaton, Tracy Letts, Damian Lewis, Laura Linney, Tobias Menzies, Edward Norton, David Oyelowo, Mandy Patinkin, Wendell Pierce, Matthew Rhys, Liev Schreiber, Dan Stevens, Meryl Streep and many others.Burns adds: “Frankly, this may be the best single cast ever assembled for any movie or television show, period. They do an extraordinary service. They’re not picked because they’re celebrities. I got so angry when somebody said, ‘So why the celebrities?’ I go, ‘These are actors.’ They’re the finest actors in the world and they can bring this stuff alive. Tom Hanks can read a phonebook, as far as I’m concerned. Meryl Streep, the same thing.”Still, the absence of living witnesses, photography and newsreels forced Burns and his team to lean heavily on the written word, weaving together the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures. This allowed them to introduce audiences not only to the “bold-faced names” of the founders but also to “dozens of others who are seminal to the story”, many of whom never even had a portrait painted.View image in fullscreenA still from The American Revolution.Photograph: PBSBurns also indulged his personal passion for geography and cartography. “I love maps,” he notes, “and there are more maps in this film than in all the other films I’ve done combined.” He reports that audiences at early screenings have remarked on the variety and effectiveness of their use in clarifying troop movements, territorial disputes and the sheer scale of the conflict.The team filmed at nearly a hundred historical locations across North America and in London to capture the landscape’s character and worked extensively with re-enactors. All these elements combine to tell a story more violent, complex and globally significant than the one taught in schools or sanitised by powdered wigs, heroic tableaus and marble monuments.The revolution, it contends, was no mere parochial quarrel over land, taxation and representation. Instead the film portrays a blood-soaked struggle that ultimately drew in more than two dozen nations and improbably came to embody what it calls “the noble aspirations of humankind”.What had begun as a jumble of grievances levelled at London by far-flung British subjects in 13 fractious colonies soon descended into a brutal civil conflict, setting brother against brother and neighbour against neighbour. In episode two, the historian Alan Taylor observes: “The greatest misconception about the American Revolution is that it was something that unified Americans. It leaves out the reality that it was a civil war among Americans.”For him, the revolution is a story that “for most of us is drowning in sentimentality and nostalgia and is incredibly superficial and doesn’t have the respect for what actually took place, and all the participants and the incredible violence of it. One of the casualties of that superficiality is that we’ve seen it in bloodless, gallant terms.”It was, he contends, a revolution that proclaimed the world-changing idea of the unalienable rights of people; a brutal civil war, pitting Patriots against Loyalists; and a global war, the fourth in a series of conflicts between Britain, France and Spain for the “prize of North America”.Burns also wanted to rediscover the uncertainty out of the outcome. “There’s a lazy arrogance that the present always exerts on the past because there’s that confidence that we know exactly what happened. But good storytelling makes it contingent.“George Washington, for example, didn’t know he was George Washington. He didn’t know he was going to be on the dollar bill and the quarter and have a big spiky monument in the national capital, which is named after him, and on the other side of the continent a state, and then in every other state a county or a town that’s named after him.“I rememberDavid McCullough, the late historian, told me that good history is thinking that it might not turn out the way you know it did. I’ve gotten lots of people who’ve called me up and said, oh, they were playing the Civil War series and I got to the last episode and I really wanted the gun to jam at Ford’s Theatre. I tell them right back: me too!”Burns keeps a neon sign in his editing room that reads: “It’s complicated.” The American Revolution analyses the central role of Native Americans and African Americans in a way that a documentary on this subject made in the 20th century probably would not have done.View image in fullscreenBehind the scenes of The American Revolution.Photograph: Mike DoyleIt refuses to treat Native Americans as a monolithic obstacle to colonial expansion. Burns stresses they cannot be relegated to a simple “them”. Nations such as the Shawnee and the Delaware were active players on the world stage, with deep economic and diplomatic ties to Europe. To lump them together, Burns argues, “does an incredible disservice to the enormous complexity” of a story in which they were central participants, not passive victims.The film also confronts the central hypocrisy of the revolution head-on. Burns describes southern planters, including Washington himself, decrying their “enslavement” by British policies while holding hundreds of people in bondage. As the late historianBernard Bailynexplains in the film, the revolution’s rhetoric forced the issue of slavery into the open.Burns says: “You suddenly introduced a super-glaring contradiction into your universal truth.” Yet the language of the Declaration of Independence, particularly its assertion that “all men are created equal,” was an idea so potent it could not be contained. “The second you say all men are created equal, you have just blown down the walls of Jericho, right? Because all means all.”Washington,an unabashed slaveholder, embodied the paradox. Burns presents a man who was “deeply flawed”. When he first took command, the Virginia planter was disturbed by the presence of Black troops and “wanted no more recruited”. He evolved on the issue and ultimately freed his slaves upon his death.As a commander, he made “glaring tactical mistakes” at Long Island and Brandywine, and at Kip’s Bay was so “rash” that he risked his life and the entire cause. Yet it was Washington who convinced soldiers to fight on through the darkest of times and to unite people from disparate colonies into a single American identity. He was a master at selecting talented subordinates, showing no jealousy of those who might have been better generals.In his most revolutionary act, he resigned his military commission when he could have been king. As Burns points out, it was Britain’s George III who, upon hearing of this, declared Washington “the greatest man in the world”.The film also offers a more nuanced portrait of George III whom, Burns insists, is “not the raving lunatic that everyone in the United States thinks he is”. Instead, he is presented as an “interesting, dedicated constitutional monarchist” presiding over what was then seen as the world’s most advanced form of government.Interviewers of Burns and reviewers of The American Revolution have been eager to draw parallels with Donald Trump and the current political moment. The film-maker’s views on the president are no secret. During a 2016 commencement speech at Stanford University, he called then-candidate Trump an “insult to our history”. Eight years later,addressing Brandeis University students, he called Trump “the opioid of all opioids, an easy cure for what some believe is the solution to our myriad pains and problems” and urged attenders not to vote for him in November.But Burns began work on The American Revolution during Barack Obama’s presidency and continued through the administrations of Trump and Joe Biden. He has no desire to turn his promotional tour into shrill political activism. With its intellectual generosity, plurality of voices and statement of faith in public broadcasting, the film speaks for itself as a bulwark against the id of Make America Great Again.View image in fullscreenBehind the scenes of The American Revolution.Photograph: Mike DoyleBurns offers one of his favourite quotations, attributed toMark Twain, that “history doesn’t repeat itself but it rhymes”. To avoid dating the film by leaning too heavily into present-day parallels, he describes his film-making discipline as being like Odysseus “lashed to the mast”, deliberately ignoring the “sirens” of contemporary commentary. He even deliberately removed one element from the film because its rhyme with the present was so strong that “no one could possibly believe that we didn’t put it in” for that specific reason.However, some rhymes were too historically essential to remove. In one episode, referring to the draft constitution’s balance of powers, narrator Peter Coyote says: “They feared that a demagogue might incite citizens into betraying the American experiment. Alexander Hamilton was concerned that an ‘unprincipled’ man would ‘mount the hobby horse of popularity’ and ‘throw things into confusion’.”By accident rather than design, the documentary arrives less than eight months before thecountry’s 250th anniversary, a time of deep political and social division that extends to how the founding story should be told. Trump has called for a “grand celebration” in July 2026 and denounced “woke” history, criticising the Smithsonian Institution for being preoccupied with “how bad slavery was”.Does Burns worry that Trump will hijack the semiquincentennial to tell a simplistic, white male version of America’s founding? “I’d be disappointed if that was the case but everybody left, right and centre loves a complicated story,” he says. “What have we had drummed into our heads for the last five years but that the darling show of the right isYellowstone? It has Kevin Costner as its patriarch and he is wise and whatever; he’s also a murderer that dumps bodies down a ravine.“His strong-willed daughter is the same way and he’s got two sons, one of whom is married to a Native American; the other is a traitor to the family. The daughter is in love with the foreman who oversees ranch hands that are gay and straight, young and old, male and female, Black and white. All surrounding is a Native American legacy that is still trying to assert itself superimposed over this overweening greed for land and development.“And people love it. I don’t know how finding the revolution in its complexity could in any way undermine -” He pauses. Then he switches gears and sums up: “A good story is a good story is a good story.”The American Revolution is available on PBS, the free PBS app and at pbs.orgExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryUS televisionFactual TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Prepare to be pummelled into submission as your time is siphoned off by OK entertainmentRachel AroestiThu 20 Nov 2025 03.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 03.03 ESTShareThis is a cosy, lighthearted whodunnit about a retired professor who gets a second wind as a private eye. It’s also a bingo card for just about everything that makes streamer-era TV so patronising, uninspiring and mind-numbingly dull.On the surface, A Man on the Inside’s crimes might seem negligible: it’s a little schmaltzy, a little too pleased with itself in that wisecrack-stuffed American comedy way. Yet it’s exactly that inoffensiveness that makes this strain of television so insidious. When the New York Times critic James Poniewozik coined the term “mid TV” to describe the current “profusion of well-cast, sleekly produced competence” that has come to dominate our screens, it wasn’t so much a vicious takedown as a shrug at the blah-ness of it all. The tech giants have pummelled us into submission by siphoning off our time via OK entertainment.Admittedly, it’s a lot to lay at the door of an amiable mystery about elderly people. And this series is no worse than the majority of content pumped on to platforms nowadays. But it does unite an unusual number of modern TV’s most cynical methods. For a start, it trades blatantly on the past glories of its personnel. In this case, the headline creator-actor combo of showrunner Michael Schur, whose CV includes Parks and Recreation andThe Good Place, and the venerable Ted Danson, who happened to star in the latter.Then – to hedge bets even further – there’s the IP groundwork. The first season of A Man on the Inside was based on a 2020 documentary calledThe Mole Agent, about a man who infiltrates a care home to investigate accusations of abuse. This show is far too anodyne to even entertain the notion of such mistreatment: instead, Danson’s Charles, at a loose end since his wife died, goes undercover in a retirement community in San Francisco to find the perpetrator of a jewellery theft – heartwarmingly rediscovering the friendship and connection his life has been lacking along the way.It’s the kind of pithy conceit that can become incredibly tedious when stretched thin over eight 30-minute episodes. Like many a streamer comedy-drama, the pace is glacial and the plot both predictable and loudly spoon-fed to us by the characters, which means it can be second-screened with ease. In other words, it’s just another symptom of our current tech hell: this is TV seemingly designed to be played ambiently while viewers scroll on a different device.And now, of course, the success of that original standalone idea – whose central mystery was resolved in the first outing – must be capitalised on. In season two, we reunite with Charles, who is craving another undercover challenge to get stuck into (his PI work now mainly involves exposing the affairs of married men). One second after informing his stony-faced, fun-sponge boss Julie of this desire, a college president bowls into her office with a yarn about a stolen laptop and a protest against the billionaire alumnus who has agreed to make a substantial donation to the school. I wonder who could pose as a harmless visiting professor and wheedle out the culprit?Loath to waste a scrap of audience investment, A Man on the Inside cannot simply wave goodbye to the season one characters who have zero connection to this new case, so retirement community manager Didi and residents Calbert, Virginia and Elliott are shoehorned into the action. More plausibly, Charles’s daughter and her family also return, and we meet Julie’s estranged ex-con mother and her eccentric boyfriend Apollo (Schur favourite Jason Mantzoukas), who provides the season’s only properly funny moments. Meanwhile, Charles gets some romance of his own courtesy of a freewheeling music professor played by Danson’s actual wife Mary Steenburgen.A Man on the Inside frequently recalls another series about citizen detectives made up of a mildly baffled 70-something man (or two) and a remorsely deadpan 30-something woman. Yet whereas Disney+’sOnly Murders in the Buildingfrantically pipes out jokes – some eye-rollingly old school, some ingeniously clever, some thrillingly edgy – this show limits itself to risk-averse humour; retaining the weighty themes (in this case old age and its attendant isolation) but failing to probe or subvert them.Eventually, the puzzle of the stolen laptop is solved in not exactly jaw-dropping fashion. But then you wouldn’t really watch A Man on the Inside for the mystery. Or the comedy. You’d watch it for the background noise; something to fill the silence while you look at something more interesting on your phone.A Man on the Inside is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTed DansonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Adapted by writer-director Dylan Southern from Max Porter’s novellaGrief Is the Thing With Feathers, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch who gives an honest and well-intentioned performance as a children’s author and graphic novelist. Living a middle-class existence in London, he is suddenly widowed; one of the movie’s off-target qualities is its refusal to specify the cause of death or even show us clearly what his wife looked like, which in real life would be unbearably vivid facts. Sam Spruell has a quietly sympathetic role as Cumberbatch’s brother.Left to look after their two young boys, he succumbs to a kind of breakdown, and hallucinates a giant nightmarish crow, which after a while the boys can sense too. The crow is derisively voiced by David Thewlis, and resembles the Ted-Hughes-ish illustrations Cumberbatch was working on. It sneeringly, ruthlessly mocks and jeers at his “sad dad” anguish; while everyone else is walking on eggshells around him, perhaps making things worse, the brutal crow jabs its beak into his psychic wound.The film has some cliches: the cartoonishly misjudged and intrusive gesture of sympathy by a school-gates mum, and the solo pushing of a trolley around a supermarket which morphs into a bad dream. The death-totem crow is not cliched, exactly, though it did remind me ofDaina O Pusic’s comparably unsatisfying film Tuesday, which offered a giant macaw as a symbol of death. But this special effects crow is, for me, not believable either as a symbol of grief or as a radically therapeutic way of challenging or working through it, and the film is itself is too flagrantly tasteful and sensitive to work as a horror movie. Quite simply: when the crow is off the screen, the drama starts to be involving and affecting. Once the crow is there, the film looks self-conscious.The Thing With Feathers is out now in Australia, on 21 November in the UK, and on 28 November in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsMax PorterBenedict CumberbatchreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tonight, a noticeably varied audience of fans has shown out for Nicks’s rescheduled date, ranging from witchcore-styled teens to longtime fans who retain a love for the 70s’ bohemian style as well as the decade’s social consciousness: the venue is sold out of veggie burgers.While Nicks hasn’t released a studio album of new material since 2011’s In Your Dreams, she hasn’t strayed too far from the center of pop culture since. In recent years, she’s regularly performed with Harry Styles,helped inspirea song on Taylor Swift’s zillion-selling The Tortured Poets Department, and had two Barbie dolls created in her honour. In 2019, she became the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, in an overdue corrective to initially sluggish critical recognition of her solo work. (She holds the record for the most Grammy nominations for female rock vocal performance without a win.)View image in fullscreenStevie Nicks at Barclays Center.Photograph: Sarah WaxbergAfter limbering up with some ballet moves and roaring that it’s time to get the party started, Nicks launches into a setlist spanningFleetwood Macclassics and choice cuts from her stellar 80s albums Bella Donna and The Wild Heart. On If Anyone Falls, she’s fired up as her muscular voice rises to a shout, while the storming centerpiece Stand Back comes alive with a throbbing motorik intro, synthy power-chords, and analog bits of kit that light up like a spaceship’s control room.The show is part musical performance, part An Evening With Stevie Nicks, with extended and sometimes self-deprecating anecdotes forming the evening’s tapestry. Before launching into a performance of the less-memorable recent single The Lighthouse, Nicks describesbeing invited to perform the song on Saturday Night Live. “Which I hadn’t been on since, I dunno” – she pretends to think about the year – “nineteen …hundred.” At other times, she’ll tell stories about her capes, regularly disappearing offstage to switch out one embroidered garment for another and rightly pausing to invite a little commotion for the look.There’s a similar looseness to Nicks’s commitment to building her songs into three-dimensional theatre. In a new version of her Rumours clapback to groupies, Gold Dust Woman becomes a brilliant 13-minute cacophony during which Nicks seems to play both the song’s narrator and the flirty hanger-on: during an extended guitar solo, she dances trance-like as if crafting a love potion, before bellowing a command for the witchy intruder to get out. With her lowered register, it would be pushing it to say that Nicks had never sounded better, but she’s majestically assured on Dreams, with her deepened register adding to the song’s ache.View image in fullscreenStevie Nicks at Barclays Center.Photograph: Sarah WaxbergMissing tonight are Nicks’s former live staples like Leather and Lace, Enchanted, and Sara, as well as well-streamed minor singles like Talk To Me and Rooms On Fire. It’s hard to exactly begrudge Nicks for focusing on the material she knows works as she makes her return to the stage, but a few deeper cuts would have been welcomed by diehards as well as freshened the setlist, which is essentially a curtailed version of her 24 Karat Gold Tour.Her sense of passion and play still burns bright. “Dance all night long,” Nicks tells the audience as parting words, after a stripped-down Landslide has brought the arena to a hush. “That’s probably what has gotten me to 77 years old. Dance on your way to the kitchen; dance on your way to watching TV; most of all, dance for me.” Her words are warm, whimsical and utterly sincere. She has more than earned her victory lap.Explore more on these topicsStevie NicksPop and rockNew YorkFleetwood Maclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

In this case, it’s Brahms’s First Symphony, captured live at the Philharmonie just two months ago, coupled with the Tragic Overture, recorded last year.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Symphony No 1, Tragic Overture.Photograph: Berliner Philharmoniker RecordingsFor this performance, Petrenko examined Meiningen Court Orchestra scores marked up with specific directions given by the composer himself. The results may strike some as interventionist, however there’s an organic momentum here that is hard to resist with a pronounced flexibility that, according to the excellent booklet essay, clarifies Brahms’s “furious struggle against the bar line”. Balance is impeccable, although solos seem over spotlighted at times by the recording engineers.The Tragic Overture leaps to life with dramatic urgency, its deftly crafted arc one long adrenaline rush. It does, however, sound like it’s been recorded in a more grateful acoustic, avoiding a woolliness in the bass that occasionally afflicts the symphony.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

They usually do. When not composing film soundtracks, or producing an eclectic range of other artists – the Weeknd, Anohni, Charli xcx, Soccer Mommy – Daniel Lopatin has released a string of acclaimed works, each with their own overarching idea.The “hyperreal world music” of 2010’s Returnal was inspired by the fact that people now see more of the world than ever without actually leaving their homes. In 2015, Garden of Delete had an accompanying origin story about an adolescent humanoid alien called Ezra; 2018’s Age Of imagined artificial intelligence attempting to recreate human culture after humans themselves had been rendered extinct. Lopatin also has an all-consuming obsession with nostalgia and forgotten pop cultural artefacts: he’s made albums based around warped loops of 80s pop hits, preset sounds on obsolete synthesisers and recordings of US radio stations changing formats, discarding the musical genres in which they previously specialised in favour of the current vogue.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Tranquilizer.Photograph: Warp RecordsAll of which makes Tranquilizer very much in the Oneohtrix Point Never wheelhouse. It feels not unlike a sequel to Replica, released 14 years ago. On that album, Lopatin drew on sounds from a collection of bootleg DVDs he bought online compiling old TV adverts from the 80s and 90s. Tranquilizer is constructed from a cache of old sample CDs – pre-packaged collections of royalty-free sounds that used to be sold to musicians and producers in the 90s and early 00s – that Lopatin found uploaded to the Internet Archive. An extra frisson came when, after bookmarking the page for future use, he discovered that it had been deleted. It subsequently reappeared, but it underlined the shakiness of the assumption that everything is preserved for ever in some corner of cyberspace.There was something disorienting about the music on Replica, not least its use of minute snatches of spoken word: you’d hear the intake of breath and the first syllable of a voiceover, but the rest of the sentence would never appear, just a tiny fragment of its opening, looping or juddering. There’s something similarly unsettled about Tranquilizer. Sample CDs were frequently compiled along genre lines, labelled for use in drum’n’bass, or hip-hop, or house: from the start, the sounds on Tranquilizer strongly suggest that the CDs Lopatin downloaded were intended for those making ambient or new age music. For Residue opens with the sound of the ocean, some big, Pink Floyd-y guitar chords, wordless breathy vocals and thick, warm electronic tones. Elsewhere, you hear such obvious 90s ambient signifiers as tinkling windchime-like tones, Satie-esque piano figures, slow-paced non-specific “tribal” drums, the crackle of old vinyl and snatches of muted trumpet that recall the sound oflate Brian Eno collaborator Jon Hassell. The synthesisers at the end of Modern Lust, meanwhile, are a dead ringer for those used on the KLF’s landmark album Chill Out.Oneohtrix Point Never: Dis – videoAphex Twin, a Brixton squat and a load of wet mattresses: revisiting Telepathic Fish, the heart of the 90s chillout boomRead moreDespite its title, Tranquilizer never feels particularly recumbent. Rather, it lulls the listener into a false sense of security with the familiarity of its sounds, then throws you for a loop. Sometimes the effect is straightforwardly unsettling, as when the patterns of the sounds on Bumpy run jarringly out of time, like a stuck record, or abruptly switch and change on Vestigel; or bend in pitch, lending a sickly, lightheaded air to Lifeworld. Sometimes the effect is overwhelming and euphoric: the shift during Rodl Glide, where a slow ooze of sound is dramatically replaced by full-on rave dynamics, or the sudden eruption of chattering synths midway through Dis. (In a startlingly Proustian period detail for listeners of a certain age, the track is also disrupted by the sound of speaker interference caused by an old 2G mobile phone.) Over five and half minutes, closer Waterfalls moves from windswept empty landscapes to busy urban propulsion, from passages that sound like the Japanese new age music collected on Visible Cloaks’ celebrated 2010 mix series Fairlights, Mallets and Bamboo to a burst of something that resembles an early 80s kids TV theme: the effect is heady and exhausting rather than relaxing.For all the calm its source material was ostensibly intended to provoke, the record spends an hour in constant, agitated motion: chillout music transposed into an era where it’s increasingly difficult to chill out, where the constant bombardment of content and the dopamine hit of doomscrolling has made relaxing something we have to work at. Tranquilizer seems unlikely to help you calm down. It’s too kaleidoscopic and restless, too crammed with sounds: an album that demands – and repays – your full attention, rather than simply drifting by.This week Alexis listened toGans – This Product DubRaucous punky Brummie duo – and producer Ross Orton – rework a track from their debut album Good for the Soul into a potent, left-field dancefloor gem.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekElectronic musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ahead of the premiere recording of her piano concerto, its soloist looks at a musician who learned the hard way about ‘belonging’Samantha EgeThu 20 Nov 2025 11.31 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 14.28 ESTShareAvril Coleridge-Taylor always felt the weight of her father’s legacy. As the daughter ofSamuel Coleridge-Taylor, one of the most famous British composers of the early 20th century, Avril’s was a name enveloped in the long shadows of history.Earlier this year, I sat with these shadows as I prepared to makethe world premiere recordingof Avril’s 1936 piano concerto with the BBC Philharmonic. With its impassioned harmonies, soulful lyricism and valiant rhythms, Avril’s work will grant new listeners fascinating insight into how she – a wartime composer, born in 1903 – conceived of her world as a woman of colour.But here’s the thing about shadows. It can take a while to adjust, to see shapes as they really are, to distinguish truth from distortion, and I had been afraid to confront Avril’s past for a while.I had so wanted her to be her father’s daughter. In some ways, she was. The pastoral English palettes of Samuel’s influence can be heard in many of her works, including From the Hills (1934) and Sussex Landscape (1940). But you only have to look at the titles of her father’s compositions to see how he heard himself as not only a flag bearer of English Romanticism but a voice of the African diaspora.This was where father and daughter seemed to diverge.White America judged Samuel by the brilliance of his  music rather than the colour of his skinDuring his studies at the Royal College of Music, Samuel – the son of a Sierra Leonean father and a white English mother – started to lean into his African roots. When the African American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar came to London in 1897, the 21-year-old composer eagerly sought him out. He set Dunbar’s African Romances to musicand the following year used the poet’s words for an opera, Dream Lovers. Then came the choral piece that put Samuel on the map:Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast.Based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s The Song of Hiawatha,Samuel’s Hiawathawas an international hit, especially with African Americans who felt vicarious pride as white America judged Samuel by the brilliance of his music rather than the colour of his skin.Fame did not temper Samuel’s politics. In 1900, he attended the First Pan African Conference in London where he met the African American intellectual WEB Du Bois and witnessed a range of talks, including on the oppression of Black South Africans. He was an activist until the end. He maintained ties with early civil rights leaders such as Du Bois and Booker T Washington, delivered his own speeches on racial equality, and even discussed issues of racism with President Theodore Roosevelt during an invitation to the White House in 1904. As for his music,reminisced Du Bois, “he wrote his name so high as a creative artist that it cannot soon be forgotten.” He died in 1912, aged 37. But what would Samuel have made of his daughter’s decision to work in South Africa in the 1950s?“Daughter of Famous Composer gives OK to S African Bias,” ran a headline in the Black American publication Jet magazine. Apartheid “seems to me the right policy”, Avril told Jet. When pushed to clarify, she backtracked: she didn’t agree with apartheid “in principle” and it “should be allowed to work itself out, guided by well-meaning South Africans of all races”. Had Avril been more attuned to her father’s politics, or born in Jim Crow America, she might have thought twice about apartheid. But life had sheltered her.View image in fullscreenSamantha Ege and the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra recording the first album devoted entirely to the music of Avril Coleridge-Taylor.Photograph: Jason Dodd“I have a British passport,” she said, “and the officials never asked me questions about my race.” So, with her “porcelain-white” skin (as Jet put it) she floated among the Europeans, buoyed up by their praise for her late father. She gave a talk about her father’s music at the University of Cape Town and conducted the South African Broadcasting Corporation Orchestra in Johannesburg, programming the heroic third movement of her Piano Concerto, subtitled: “In remembrance of my Father.” Although a confident pianist herself, she never played as the soloist in her concerto. Instead, she always led as the conductor; and so the apartheid orchestra played under her baton.Avril hoped, in her own words, she “might bring a change”. But by 1954, things fell apart. Once officials learned of her African heritage, she could no longer stay in the country. Her British passport didn’t protect her, the British high commissioner advised her to leave or risk imprisonment. She returned to England, deeply ashamed as the magnitude of her naivety dawned. “The lesson was a hard one,” she lamented. Adding to her humiliation was the 1955 publication of her ill-fated Jet interview, a yearafterher unceremonious exit from South Africa.As I sat with these shadows, I sensed a familiar story. The story of being British until you’re not – one that calls to mind African-descended soldiers who fought on behalf of the British during the second world war and survived only to be denied their due compensation. And the Windrush generation, who built postwar Britain out of the rubble, but still face legal challenges around their relationship to the only place they’ve ever called home.Lenny Henry: ‘Classical music belongs to us all. Just look at Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’Read moreIn the aftermath, Avril thought of her father and the “tremendous faith he had in the coloured people of the world”. She wrote a piece called Ceremonial March (1957) for Ghana’s independence. Its commemorative overtones have much in common with her rousing In Memoriam: To the RAF (1945) and plaintiveIn Memoriam (1967), which she later dedicated to her brother Hiawatha on his death in 1980, as well as to her father.Samuel had gifted Avril with a sense of belonging in the world, and she took that to heart – for better andfor worse. She could have made life easier for herself in South Africa by concealing her own African heritage and the Coleridge-Taylor name. But she embraced all that she was, and this extended to her music. The Concerto movement dedicated to her father proceeds with bold symphonic colours that insist, “I am here.”If we are to hear the history of Black and mixed race Britain as it was, then we must sit long enough to see that the shadows of the past are nothing to fear if we intend to learn from them.Avril Coleridge-Taylor: Piano Concerto and Orchestral Works with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and John Andrews, is out on 21 November onResonus Classics.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicSouth AfricaBBC Philharmonic OrchestrafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it was brutal colonial indoctrination that ensured the modern descendants of the aspirant imperial middle classes from Barbados to Burma, with their tea caddies, gin-stuffed drinks cabinets and yellowing Penguin paperbacks, still devour Maugham, Shaw and Kipling. Perhaps they just have good taste.Wodehouse’s detractors are many – Stephen Sondheim (“archness … tweeness … flimsiness”), Winston Churchill (“He can live secluded in some place or go to hell as soon as there is a vacant passage”), the Inland Revenue – but for millions around the world he remains the greatest comic writer Britain has ever produced. And he clearly still sells here, as this collection of a dozen new officially sanctioned stories by writers, comedians and celebrity admirers, out in time to be a stocking filler, attests.These aren’t the first modern Jeeves stories –Ben SchottandSebastian Faulks, no strangers to the stocking-filler market, have contributed three novels in the past 12 years – but they’re the first attempt at the form that made Wodehouse one of the highest-paid writers of his time, the short story. It’s easy to parody Jeeves and Wooster: the pyjama-clad prelapsarian sexlessness, the midnight bally-hooing and double-barrelled surnames. It’s much harder to pinpoint what makes them stand the test of time – the remarkable psychological insights into human nature that Jeeves displays, the inherent decency of Bertie Wooster, the gift for observation and description that never reaches too far or outstays its welcome.Much like Wodehouse’s post-50s output, it’s a mixed bag of the quotidian with a few touches of magicWodehouse always played absurd situations completely straight; even in the face of outright insanity, characters will remain decorous to a fault, straitjacketed by centuries of social convention and selective breeding. There are no winking asides to the audience; while Bertie is an inveterate fourth-wall breaker, his humour, and thankfully this collection, is never tainted by what dooms most 21st-century comic novels: references to social media that make no sense in a year or two’s time. Wodehouse planned laboriously, writing hundreds of pages of notes, his novels structured around set pieces chosen and then relentlessly stress-tested for their comic value. For every apposite simile and unexpected transferred epithet, a dozen were rejected. The stories here are well put together, if not as expertly planned, with sometimes a slight laboriousness in the construction as they get into gear. The urge of every pastiche writer, to explore territories unknown to the original writer, is mostly handled tastefully: see Frank Skinner’s opening sojourn into modern London by way of cryogenics gone wrong, and John Finnemore’s blitz air raid warden duty. Roddy Doyle’s Dublin terrace-set effort will cause localised outbreaks of apoplexy on Boxing Day afternoon.For every modern touch there are surfeits of Bertie’s slangy initialising, “Knock me down with a feather”-ing and Jeeves’s encyclopedia quoting. Much like Wodehouse’s post-50s output, it’s a mixed bag of the quotidian with a few touches of magic. Dominic Sandbrook’s inspired story, in the form of a university exam and with lovingly Craig Brownish send-ups of Chips Channon and George Orwell, is the best piece here, and features the utterly barmy line: ‘‘‘The day Roderick Spode appeared on Multi-Coloured Swap Shop was the day that British culture died’ – Polly Toynbee. Is this fair?” The QI elf turned novelist Andrew Hunter Murray’s sparky entry aims at the pomposity of Britain’s most resolutely Wodehousian industry, publishing, and there’s a touching feminist reworking of Aunt Agatha by Scarlett Curtis. A few stories waste interesting set-ups by overusing modern references as a shortcut to easy laughs.As Evelyn Waugh wrote, the reading public has never much cared how Wodehouse’s characters would react to changing social conditions. Wodehouse himself well understood, during his self-exile on Long Island following his disastrously ill-thought-throughwartime radio broadcasts from Berlin, that he was a man out of time – see his rueful revised lyrics for a 60s Cole Porter revival: “When the courts decide, / As they did latterly, / We could read Lady Chatterley, / If we chose, Anything goes”. Feeling rejected by his country, he chose to aim for timelessness.This new collection will be warmly welcomed by fans who want to keep Wodehouse’s name and reputation burning brightly. The stories clearly come from a place of love and respect, plus, on the 50th anniversary of Wodehouse’s death, the keen-eyed appreciation of a commercial opportunity. Jeeves (and Wooster) would approve.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Or at least that was the myth. Now Sarah Lucas, toughest of the YBAs, is 63, her fried eggs and kebab are art history, and she’s besties with Maggi Hambling, 80, one of the last of the old-school painters. Lucas admires Hambling not just as an artist but a woman, and in Maggi the Maggi, she has created a loving, heroic image of Hambling’s face made entirely of cigarettes. Hambling returns the compliment with Sarah at Work which, like all her paintings here, is a slapdash mess. But it’s hard to pay much attention to Hambling’s daubs when your eyes are full of balloon breasts (by which I mean boobs moulded on party balloons), shiny red bums thrust in the air, floppy phallic ears and spindly pipe cleaner legs wearing shoes Lucas must have bought in bulk from a fetish shop.In the latest iteration of her Bunny sculptures, laughable yet tragic creatures that render the Playboy Bunny absurdly literal,Sarah Lucascreates orgiastic hilarity and aesthetic mayhem. Limbs, eyes, nipples are everywhere as these poor things pose on concrete chairs in a style you might find in an exclusive sex club, or a male fantasy of some such place. It’s the stuff of the manosphere’s wildest dreams, a lurid monument to hyped-up internet-driven porn. Yet furious feminist satire is just one dimension to Lucas’s extraordinary works.View image in fullscreenA dollop of moody marks … Wall of Water, Sunset by Maggi Hambling.Photograph: © Maggi HamblingShe and Hambling met, we’re told, at the Colony Room in Soho. But while it’s Hambling who was friends with its most famous frequenter Francis Bacon, it is Lucas who deserves comparison with him. Her splayed anatomically explicit bodies of the Bunnies are as desperate and universal as his eviscerated people in claustrophobic interiors. This prison of porn becomes an image of hell as startling as any Bacon painted: you laugh then you cry at these saucy horrors. A Cycoplean girl curled up in a corner peers pitiably at you from her collaged eye, a cigarette in a stumpy paw.But I would be lying if I said I spent this exhibition in soul-searching despair at the male mind. Instead I was thrilled by Lucas’ creativity. Once she mocked the proprieties of sculpture with readymades such asAu Naturel, that signified male and female with two oranges and a cucumber next to a tin bucket and a pair of melons. Now she makes complex, technically difficult sculptural masterpieces, such as Ooh La La that thrusts itself into your face as soon as you walk into Sadie Coles HQ.Crouched on a hard cold chair, glistening in shades of crimson, this outrageous erotic statue with shades of Allen Jones looks like it’s made of latex. In fact it’s cast in bronze, lacquered and painted – a sophisticated, crafty way to create something just as raw and vital as her early readymades. Where some of her generation have turned away from conceptual art or become self-parodies, Lucas has grown without betraying her roots: she combines art and truth in ever more stunning ways, with physical extremes, spectacular gyrations. One Bunny, collapsed on a chair with arms thrown all over the shop and two sets of balloons – which could be breasts or eyes – makes you see how she matches Picasso, eye-nipple for nipple-eye. In fact this appears to be a parody of his most furiously misogynistic painting, the1929 Large Nude in a Red Armchairin the Musée Picasso. Lucas translates the howl of this raging image of Picasso’s wife Olga into three dimensions and 21st-century sleaze. The two artists meet as fellow connoisseurs of the perverse and true. And Lucas is very funny, did I mention that?View image in fullscreenSarah Lucas and Maggi Hambling.Photograph: Steven HattonThere is a gulf between her and Hambling and it is not generational. Lucas is precise, witty and intelligent. Hambling’s works are none of those things. The first big canvas by her is, at first, impressively wild and turbulent – a semi-abstract dollop of moody marks – but somehow it curdles and slumps as you look, its freedom turns out to be mere mess, a pretence of energy. It was done in 2012, years before the well-publicised accident in which she lost a finger. And that sagging sense of futility only worsens. Hambling even shows her sculptures, which are as floppy and false as her paintings. It’s like an art fair where you might see art of wildly incompatible kinds and qualities lumped together – except here it’s not commerce but an emotional connection between the artists that has created this ludicrous juxtaposition. But if this friendship has helped to sustain the roll of artistic brilliance that Lucas is on, who am I to question it?At Sadie Coles HQ and Frankie Rossi Art Projects, London, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designMaggi HamblingSarah LucasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jacob Richmond and Brooke Maxwell’s cult hit, which began life in a fringe theatre in Canada in 2009, has the spirit of the circus woven into its fabric. It arrives in London, quirks and all, in a wonderfully eccentric production directed by Lizzi Gee.A story about six high-school choristers sent spiralling to their demise from a rollercoaster is hardly the most conventional ground for an all-singing, all-dancing show. But as we travel with them into a space between life and death, where they are forced to compete for a second chance on Earth, the narrative gradually slips away from its morbid trappings and celebrates life.Led by a fortune teller, The Amazing Karnak (Edward Wu), who moves with the stiffness of a wind-up toy and towers above the stage, the teens are instructed to come forward, one by one, to make their case. What follows is a spectrum of musical numbers, with each contestant presenting a condensed version of their life story.Ocean (Baylie Carson), the squeaky queen bee, goes first with a song celebrating herself. Noel (Damon Gould) follows with a dreamlike fantasy of high kicks and corsets. Ukrainian rebel Mischa (Bartek Kraszewski) delivers a punchy rap. Ricky (Jack Maverick), who grew up mute, transforms into a sequin-wearing god in the 70s-inspired Space Age Bachelor. The nicest girl in town, Constance (a brilliant debut from Robyn Gilbertson), discovers her love for the world just as it’s too late. Jane Doe (Grace Galloway), who was decapitated in the crash and now wears a doll’s head, performs a haunting aria for the unknown person she might have become.Precipice review – horror on the Thames in a baffling musical dystopiaRead moreAfter a while, the structure begins to feel formulaic. With each character given only a fleeting moment in the limelight, there’s little time to truly get beneath their skin. Still, it’s easy to see why the show has picked up such a dedicated fanbase over the years. This is a genuinely unique musical and, with a few tweaks, it could soar.AtSouthwark Playhouse Elephant, London, until 10 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsSouthwark PlayhouseCircusreviewsShareReuse this content"

Only one of them, however, will strip down to his long johns as he sings I’m Too Sexy by Right Said Fred.At Liverpool’s Royal Court they do things differently. With his brushed back mane of silvery hair, Paul Duckworth’s Scrooge is not just miserly, he is also libidinous and foul-mouthed, not to mention being a hot shot on the harmonica.On top of that, he is actively corrupt. His colleague Jacob Marley has mysteriously disappeared and Scrooge, having doctored the will, stands to inherit his biscuit factory. The joke about Jacob’s cream crackers is the first of many a biscuit pun.View image in fullscreenFormidable vocals … Lindzi Germain, left, as Barbara in The Scouse Christmas Carol.Photograph: AB PhotographyMarley’s widow Barbara (Lindzi Germain) reckons something is afoot, which means, in this telling by Kevin Fearon, the ghosts ofChristmaspast, present and future are less the supernatural visitations imagined by Dickens and more a ruse to flush out Scrooge. His drunken sleep is disturbed by the Garston ghost busters, merrily squirting water into the audience from their proton guns and scaring him into coming clean.Surprisingly, the more the show pulls in its own wayward direction, the more the original asserts itself. Cross out the knockabout antics and the romantic subplots (turns out Scrooge and Barbara have history) and you are back to a wholesome message about generosity and community spirit. No harm in that, but the focus on rattling out the story does lower the joke count, especially as too often we get a swear word where we expect a gag to be.The exuberance of Mark Chatterton’s cast covers up the cracks. If they deserve better material than this, they are not going to let it show. Whether it is a doe-eyed Lenny Wood as Bob Scratchitt or a multitasking Keddy Sutton as everything from a housekeeper to a mayor, they all feed into a high-energy ensemble. Gluing the show together are the song-and-dance numbers powered by Ben Gladwin’s live band and Beverley Norris-Edmunds’ choreography, not forgetting Germain’s formidable vocals on the big ballads.AtRoyal Court theatre, Liverpool, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreChristmas showsLiverpoolCharles DickensComedy (Stage)ChristmasComedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Not a huge leap is it? And here it is, in the National Gallery, Edwin Austin Abbey’s study for The Hours, ahuge circular paintingwhich adorns the ceiling of the Pennsylvania state capitol – a bold, blue and gold testament to the US’s glory.It’s hard to believe – with museums everywhere begging for money from arms dealers and drug barons, and the arts becoming increasingly defunded – that back in turn-of-the-century America, the arts had value. And Abbey reaped the benefits. He was born in the US in 1852 but made his name in the UK. And when the big kahunas from the newly megarich Pennsylvania came knocking, he answered the call of the motherland.Pennsylvania had abundant natural resources, vast amounts of industry, and when its statehouse in Harrisburg burned down in 1897 they decided their new one had to be grand, opulent – and covered with gold leaf. The US really hasn’t changed that much.View image in fullscreenAbbey’s compositional study for The Apotheosis of Pennsylvania mural, about 1902-1911.Photograph: Yale University Art GalleryAbbey was commissioned to plaster the new state capitol building in allegorical and historical murals, and the final study for its circular ceiling painting is the big draw of this small, evocative exhibition. At 12ft wide it’s enormous, but still only half the size of the original. Twenty-four figures dance around its circumference in various states of undress – they are the hours of the day, nude and yawning in the dawn’s early light, and sombrely cloaked in black under the midnight moon. The sky behind them is deep lapis blue, the twinkling stars a field of gold. It’s European symbolism on steroids, Odilon Redon crossed with Gustav Klimt and given an apparently infinite budget.What a way to tell the world that you’ve arrived as a big player on the international stage: with gold, nudity and audacious ostentatiousness. To be clear, that’s the point of this: it’s propaganda, soft power, art as a tool of the state. When you’re booming, you do elaborate stuff to make sure everyone knows about it and that’s how art has been used for centuries. You think Michelangelo was commissioned for the Sistine Chapel purely out of religious devotion? It’s cultural muscle flexing, it’s expressions of wealth and power through art.View image in fullscreenFigure study for The Spirit of Vulcan, Genius of the Workers in Iron and Steel, about 1902-08.Photograph: Yale University Art GalleryAbbey’s study for The Hours is a pretty, hypnotic swirl of a painting, and all the glistening gold and deep blue is hugely atmospheric. But the painting is also a bit chintzy and rough. None of the figures are particularly fleshed out or neatly delineated, partly because it’s a study, and partly because it was going to go on a ceiling way above your head, so who was going to notice?The six studies shown alongside it – including an ultra-smudgy study for a big group portrait filled with American heroes such as Daniel Boone and Benjamin Franklin – just leave you wanting to see the finished works. The wall text talks about how this exhibition “begins to return Abbey to the attention he deserves”. But some rough old studies and a maquette don’t make a hugely convincing argument. “He’s great, honestly, you’ve just caught him on a bit of a bad day” isn’t a great way to reintroduce audiences to a forgotten painter.But the contemporary resonances are many and loud. As Donald Trump remodels the White House in his own gilt-encrusted rococo vomit aesthetic, you realise he’s doing nothing new, that states have always used art to consolidate power, and waste gold reserves in the process.Edwin Austin Abbey: By the Dawn’s Early Light is at theNational Gallery, London, from 20 November to 15 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtExhibitionsNational GalleryPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

But, overshadowing what could be a $60m sale are questions about works that have allegedly disappearedRichard MorganThu 20 Nov 2025 10.11 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 16.05 ESTShareThis may well be Frida Kahlo’s biggest year yet. There’s the recent opening of a museum in Mexico City celebrating her life and work. There’s the Art Institute in Chicago exhibiting her work for the first time. And then, in Shenzhen, there’s the show that marked her Chinese debut. All this “Fridamania” tucks in between last year’sbig screen documentary Fridaand next year’s exhibitions in London and the US.What’s more, to cap it all, a Sotheby’s auction in New York today is almost certain to make Kahlo a record-breaker. Her 1940 painting The Dream (The Bed) is forecast to fetch between $40-$60m, which would dwarf the previous record for a female artist, set in 2014 by Georgia O’Keeffe’s Jimson Weed/White Flower No 1, whichsold for $44.4m.It’s almost enough confetti to obscure a report published in April by Hilda Trujillo Soto, who served as a deputy director and then director from 2002 to 2020 at Casa Azul, as theFrida Kahlomuseum in Mexico is known. Concluding her own independent five-year investigation after leaving the museum, Trujillo Soto alleged the disappearance of two oil paintings and eight drawings between the museum’s 1957 and 2011 inventories, as well as at least six pages extracted from Kahlo’s illustrated diary. Summing up these “crimes against the property of the nation”, Trujillo Soto declared: “As a Mexican society, we are owed an explanation.”One of the allegedly missing works, 1952’s Congress of the Peoples for Peace, was sold by New York’s Mary-Anne Martin FineArtgallery for $2.66m at auction in 2020. According to Wayback Machine’s online archives, the gallery was also offering Kahlo’s other allegedly stolen painting, 1954’s Self-Portrait Inside a Sunflower, with provenance listed only as “private collection, Dallas”. The gallery did not respond to interview requests about this.View image in fullscreenAll but worshipped in Mexico … Frida Kahlo in 1944.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveTrujillo Soto’s broader conclusions were supported by Helga Prignitz-Poda, a Berlin-based Kahlo expert. “Many things have disappeared from Casa Azul,” she told journalists in response to Trujillo Soto’s report.“Frida painted her reality – even when it was uncomfortable,” Trujillo Soto told me. “I wrote mine. Discomfort and all.”Kahlo is all but worshipped inMexico, her work fiercely protected, ostensibly, by patrimony laws. She is to Mexico what Turner is to Britain or Michelangelo is to Italy. Yet rather than investigating Trujillo Soto’s catalogue of missing works – if only to discredit it – the government has stonewalled the issue. All three chiefs of the Ministry of Culture’s Transparency Unit opted against transparency, deferring completely to representatives at the state-run Bank of Mexico, which manages Kahlo’s trust. Those bank officials did not reply to our interview requests.The trust, though, has accused Trujillo Soto of holding a grudge. In a statement it said that she “never filed a formal complaint” and added: “On the contrary, their contract was terminated after irregularities were detected in their administration and for having benefited third parties with the assets under their care”, an accusation she in turn denies.The day after Trujillo Soto’s claims, Inbal, the agency tasked with protecting and promoting Mexican art as heritage, said it “has not granted any permission for definitive exports of works by [Kahlo]”. But it did not otherwise comment on possible foreign sales of the museum’s inventory.View image in fullscreenCongress of the Peoples for Peace, at a Sotheby’s preview in 2020.Photograph: Cindy Ord/Getty Images,“It’s a strategy of silence,” said Trujillo Soto of the Ministry of Culture. “If I were a man, my report would be seen as an analysis. But I am a woman, so Mexican machismo decides that what I say is gossip instead.”In a statement, Casa Azul called Trujillo Soto’s allegations “unfounded, erroneous and [lacking] verifiable evidence” but did not amplify their position with evidence of their own. Asked to put concerns to rest by demonstrating that the missing works are still part of the museum’s inventory, Perla Labarthe, the museum’s current director, was unresponsive.“I believe that after my death,” Kahlo said, “I am going to be the biggest piece of shit in the world.” Casa Azul increasingly seems like ground zero for Kahlo’s shitstorm. In fairness, the government and the museum already openly defy the last will of Diego Rivera, the muralist who married, divorced and remarried Kahlo before she widowed him. That will ordered “under no circumstances or pretext may the objects belonging to the heritage be removed from the premises”.Museums sometimes engage in deaccession, the act of selling art to pay for costs, debts, renovations, or just to pad pockets. It can go unreported to cover humility or humiliation. Unauthorised deaccession is probably the most bureaucratic euphemism for theft.Interpol officials declined to discuss the matter but law enforcement agents familiar with the details – who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly – said the Mexican government has not yet sought Interpol’s assistance, and Interpol can only act at the request of its member governments.Similarly, “the museum has not registered any losses with us,” said Julian Radcliffe, chair of the London-based Art Loss Register, which has flagged four disputed Kahlos in circulation, “but that is not surprising since museums are reluctant to admit to missing items, and, of course, there are many more losses due to internal theft by museum curators from stock or storage than by external robbery of items on display”.View image in fullscreenKahlo’s Self-Portrait Inside a Sunflower, 1954.Photograph: Markus Schreiber/APRobert Wittman, a retired senior investigator at the FBI’s Art Crime Team, expressed surprise that the Mexican government was not sounding more alarms – especially given that the country’s previous presidency prioritised art repatriation with strong success. “Mexico should do their due diligence,” he said.Reluctance to report missing art can be a matter of institutional embarrassment or outright corruption, saysChristopher Marinello, an art lawyer who founded Art Recovery International. Even among the standard chaos and drama of art theft, he added, “Mexico is a whole other problem. We have worked on cases and struggled to obtain police reports only to discover that members of the local police force were the main suspects in committing the theft.”A 2015Sotheby’s Institute of Art analysisof Mexican patrimony laws and their impact on the art market found that work by artists on the patrimony list was suppressed in Mexico to at least half its worldwide value. Mexican auction houses have complained to legislators that patrimony restrictions cause as much as a 30% dampening of business, as buyers see their private ownership as an obtrusive de facto shared custody with the government.So Casa Azul’s lack of investigation is further vexing amid abundant motives and suspects for art theft. Mexican auction houses, buyers, curators, gallerists and police all have vested interests in patrimony’s underground market. Meanwhile, it’s not just Interpol that can’t act alone. Neither can art market observers.View image in fullscreen‘If I were a man, my report would be seen as an analysis’ … Hilda Trujillo Soto poses for a photograph at Casa Azul in 2020.Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters“As far as we know, there have not been any formal or legal accusations substantiating claims of stolen works,” says Raúl Zorrilla, the CEO at Kurimanzutto, one of the most-respected galleries in Mexico City – which avoids all secondary markets, including Kahlo’s, in favour of living artists. “We prefer to anchor any discussion in the frameworks of law, provenance verification, and institutional process rather than speculation.” Earlier this week in New York, Christie’s auctioned a minor Kahlo. It sold for just $7.2m, perhaps because it is small and not a self-portrait (it’s a painting of knickknacks in a shop window in Detroit). Yet $7.2m is still a huge sum. In 2021, Kahlo’s 1949 self-portrait Diego and I sold for $34.9m, more than quadrupling the previous $8m high for a Kahlo sale and also breaking the broader record for Latin American art that had been held since 2018 by a $9.76m painting by Rivera.Such blockbuster auctions may be as dangerous to Kahlo’s legacy as any theft. “The criminal element doesn’t have much imagination,” says Noah Charney, a Cambridge University doctoral candidate studying the history of art theft. “They steal what they’ve recently read about as having high value.” And not only thieves. Collectively, he said, we share “a subconscious understanding that if this artist is worth stealing, they must be very good”.At her first exhibition – in New York in 1938 – Kahlo happily sold 12 of 25 works. In her life, she was praised by the art legends of her day: Kandinsky, Miró, Picasso. The surrealist André Breton called her art “a ribbon around a bomb”. Unimpressed, she called them all “artistic bitches.”Kahlo’s ideals – of communism, feminism, hedonism, intimacy, magic, queerness, romance, truth and trust – ached to stir uncertainty in audiences. Now, more than 70 years after her death, the art market is reckoning with Kahlo uncertainties that are of its own making.Explore more on these topicsFrida KahloArtMexicoAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What was remarkable, however, was the way the Finnish conductor drew out the groundbreaking qualities in some of the more conventional works. This was particularly apparent in the central movement of the Karelia Suite where the warmth of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra’s strings was underpinned by a folk-inflected harmonic pungency, or in the outer movements where intricate countermelodies that sometimes go unnoticed were revealed.It was good, too, to hear a selection of Sibelius’s seldom-programmed vocal works, especially inHelena Juntunen’s characterful performances. A compelling actor, she threw herself into three of the composer’s finest orchestral songs, her body contorting with emotion as the audience hung on her every crystal clear syllable. Baron Magnus, a lyrical ballad in which a gloomy nobleman dallies with a mermaid and (unusually) lives to tell the tale was exquisitely characterised. Juntunen’s stirring soprano was rich and creamy, her dramatic commitment absolute.View image in fullscreenOsmo Vänskä conducts the CBSO in Symphony. Hall, Birmingham.Photograph: Jonathan FerroComposed in 1913, the tone poem Luonnotar is an innovative masterpiece. Rooted in the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, it describes the creation of heaven, moon and stars out of broken duck eggs as they tumble from the knee of a pregnant nature spirit. Juntunen, returning to the platform in traditional dress, revelled in every aspect of its weird brilliance.Many have speculated on the meaning behind Shostakovich’s cryptic 15th symphony: the composer said little about it before his death. Vänskä adopted a brisk, puckish approach to the up-tempo movements, relishing the music’s neurotic tics. The percussion section in particular had a field day, and the orchestral playing in general was up a notch on the first half. Diaphanous textures and a sustained tension heightened the Chekhovian ache of the slower movements, the music drawing to a close at last with a ghostly death rattle and a hint of mocking laughter.AtBristol Beacon on 20 November.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicCity of Birmingham Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

The actor stars in Ryan Murphy’s legal drama, which has received a string of zero-star reviews. In her appraisal,the Guardian’s Lucy Mangandescribed it as: “Fascinatingly, incomprehensibly, existentially terrible.” The series currently holds a 3% rating onreviews site Rotten Tomatoes.According to Close, the main issue was the choice to air the worst three episodes first. “I personally think that the first three episodes were the weakest,” she told Variety. “That was a tough way to start. I’ve seen all nine episodes, and I think it actually adds up to something.”She also spoke out in support of her co-starKim Kardashian, who plays one of a number of women who found a legal firm that deals with divorces in California. She says she had a good relationship with Kardashian on-set, at one point going to an alcohol-fuelled viewing of Close’s movie classic Fatal Attraction, which was organised by Kardashian’s mother Kris Jenner.“What surprised me was Kim’s seriousness of intent,” Close said. “She always knew her lines. She never was late. She always was prepared. She had no pretensions that she was a great actress, but she was smart enough to have people around her who she could learn from. If she was a big ego, or what I call a ‘life-is-too-short person’, I would have been unhappy, but she’s not.”Close also blamed the Kardashians’ reputation for part of the negative backlash. “The Kardashians would say this themselves, but not everybody likes them. They have an image.”Close has previously spoken of her love for the show. Duringa Guardian interview that questioned the quality of the writing of All’s Fair, she said: “I swear to God, I’ve seen all nine episodes and it’s pretty fucking good. It is what it is: it’s juicy and outrageous at times and touching.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionRyan MurphyGlenn CloseKim KardashiannewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes that big-screen bargain isn’t quite the steal you might think, and even if the price is right, niggling problems could sour long-term satisfaction.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And it may be that you don’t need a new TV at all – don’t let the Black Friday FOMO fool you. Read our guide tomaking the most out of the TV you already have.But if you are set on a new TV, the trick is to know what you want, and why, before you start shortlisting. Here we tell you everything you need to look out for, before rounding up some of the best TV deals in this year’sBlack Friday sales.Black Friday TV deals: what to look forView image in fullscreenSteer clear of the bargain aisle if you want your new TV to make a statement.Photograph: Pressmaster/Getty ImagesDesign is importantDesign counts. If you want that new TV to be a statement in your living space, stay clear of the bargain aisle – that’s where you’ll find cookie-cutter designs with flimsy plastic pedestal stands. If you’re not wall mounting, pay particular attention to the feet. Are they placed close to each edge? On a TV 55 inches and larger, that could mean you’ll also have to factor in new furniture just to accommodate it.Central pedestal stands are always the easiest to live with, and some models also have a swivel so that you can angle the screen to best suit your seating. It’s a little bonus well worth having.Think about when you’ll use itAre you buying a TV for everyday use, or do you hanker after a special screen for movies? If it’s the latter, buying an OLED will generally be your best bet. Unlike LED-based TVs, there’s no need for a backlight, because OLED pixels are self-emitting. This means when you dim the lights, black levels stay nice and inky and shadow detail is retained, giving your pictures cinematic depth. Conversely, LED models (be they LCD LED, QLED or Mini LED) tend to look their best in rooms with ambient light, and therefore make better daytime TVs.Connectivity countsDon’t just look at the front. The cheapest TVs you’ll see during the Black Friday sales will only offer three HDMI inputs at the back. This may be fine if you don’t plan on connecting much equipment, but it could prove limiting in the long term. Cheap televisions tend to offer poor audio, so one of those HDMI ports will probably be assigned to a soundbar. That just leaves two to share between games consoles, set-top boxes and Blu-ray/DVD players.View image in fullscreenMaximise gaming performance by playing at a higher refresh rate.Photograph: simpson33/Getty ImagesConsider what you need for gamingIf you plan to play video games on your new set, check to see if those HDMIs support a 120Hz high refresh rate. If you own a PlayStation 5 or current Xbox, you can maximise performance (and therefore improve your chances of winning against your mates) by playing at a higher refresh rate. These 120Hz-capable TVs also tend to offer VRR (variable refresh rate) and ALLM (auto low latency mode), acronyms that add to the gaming experience.Incidentally, if you buy a Sony Bravia, there’s a good chance it will also have PS Remote Play, meaning you can enjoy your PlayStation console while it’s not even in the same room as the TV.Of course, you can always play games on standard 60Hz TVs, and if you have an older console or just like casual family games, you’ve nothing to worry about.Don’t avoid last year’s modelsMany TV makers use Black Friday to offer cheap deals on older stock, to clear inventory. This is where you really can grab a killer deal, particularly at the mid-to-higher end of the market.For example, a 2024 LG OLED C5 55in screen has a sale price of £1,199. The 2025 G5 OLED, also on sale, still commands a premium of £1,599. Last year’s top models will still impress 12 months after release.Buying a well-reviewed older TV is almost always better than buying a newer model that’s been stockpiled to shift in volume during the sales.Not all HDR is worth havingIt’s worth bearing in mind that not all HDR (high dynamic range) TVs are created equal. While every 4K model sporting a Black Friday price tag will boast HDR compatibility, there can be huge differences in performance. Entry-level screens – typically those 50in models selling for little more than £200 – will invariably lack the brightness to make HDR programmes really shine. Indeed, in their attempt to make HDR details (such as bright street lights, fireworks, explosions and so on) pop, the rest of the show can look unnaturally dark. These HDR ‘lite’ TVs are actually better suited to non-HDR programmes, such as regular SDR (standard dynamic range) channels on Freeview, rather than streams from Netflix and Co.The good news is that HDR performance improves dramatically from the mid-range upwards, and is a real differentiator at the posh end of the market.Be aware also that HDR comes in different flavours. In addition to standard HDR10, there’s HDR10+, Dolby Vision and cleverly ‘Adaptive’ versions of each on top, able to react to the light levels in your living room. Film fans favour screens that offer Dolby Vision, but not every brand has it. Samsung is the most prominent outlier.Sound adviceFinally, listen out for audio. It’s a fact that thin, inexpensive TVs generally tend to sound awful. They lack bass and become painful when you crank the volume. But there are exceptions that could save you from shelling out on a soundbar.Samsung QLED TVs boasting object tracking sound (OTS) offer far better audio than you might expect, and tend to have innovative processing that can enhance dialogue and combat extraneous noise, making them great for family use. Meanwhile, Sony OLED TVs have a clever Acoustic Surface Audio sound system, which uses actuators on the rear of the OLED panel to produce impressive high-fidelity audio. And if you want the full home theatre audio enchilada, Panasonic’s best sets have a full 360-degree sound system with front, side and up-firing speakers tuned by sister brand Technics, able to produce convincing Dolby Atmos cinema sound.And here’s a closing tip. Even if your Black Friday bargain TV doesn’t have decent sound onboard, check to see if it passes a Dolby Atmos signal out over the e-ARC HDMI connection, because you can always add a great-sounding Dolby Atmos soundbar during the January sales.Steve MayQ&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best 4K TV deals this Black FridayAn affordable 55in TVView image in fullscreenHisense A6Q LED, 55in£299 at Argos£299 at AmazonFor such an affordable mid-sized TV, this Hisense A6Q ticks most of the boxes, with a 4K resolution and a pleasant complement of HDR standards (Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG) that can provide vivid highlights in supported content. Freely is built in to provide access to live and on-demand TV out of the box, with no aerial or set-top box required. For gaming, there’s support for Auto Low Latency Mode, although the refresh rate tops out at 60Hz (120Hz or higher is preferable for smoother onscreen action with recent consoles). Connectivity is limited to three HDMI 2.1 ports.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A bargain TCL TVView image in fullscreenTCL C6KSQD-Mini LED, 50in£349 at Argos£349 at AmazonThe TCL C6KS seems too good to be true, packed with higher-end features at a bargain-basement price. It’s a modest 50 inches, but its Mini LED panel is bright and sharp with 160 dimming zones, allowing for surprisingly vibrant and saturated images for a television at this price point. Its new HVA panel helps in providing more depth to its overall images, top. For this price, the fact that it supports HLG, HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision is excellent. Many TVs several times more expensive can’t say that.Gaming performance is fine – it’ll do up to 4K/60Hz with VRR and ALLM – although the lack of higher-refresh-rate output means it isn’t optimal for powerful home consoles or PCs. In terms of connectivity, there are three HDMI ports, one of which supports eARC to hook up a soundbar or speakers for improved audio. The Onkyo-branded system with this TV is surprisingly detailed, though – you may be able to get away with using it for some time before feeling the need to upgrade to separate speakers.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A quality Sony TV for a low priceView image in fullscreenSony Bravia KD55X75WL, 55in£499 at AmazonWhile this isn’t Sony’s latest and greatest option, it’s a quality telly for a great price. It’s a moderate size that should be good for most rooms, and HDR support is reasonable, with HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision all supported.This Sony TV also comes with four HDMI ports for inputs, plus support for eARC to connect a soundbar or supported speakers. For gaming, it has ALLM, a custom screen size setting, a black equaliser and an onscreen crosshair – features more commonly seen in monitors than TVs.Smart TV duties are handled by the familiar Google TV OS, providing good access to smart apps, and it bundles in 15 credits of Sony Pictures Core and a 24-month streaming package.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A bright Mini LED TVView image in fullscreenHisense U7Q ProMini LED, 65in£899 at John Lewis£899 at CurrysThis large, feature-rich Mini LED TV looks like a capable option for everything from games to films.There’s a rich set of HDR support (Dolby Vision and Dolby Vision IQ, plus HDR10+, HDR10 and HLG) and the Mini LED screen allows for some serious depth and searing brightness (Hisense claims a peak brightness of 2,000 nits).The integrated speakers provide up to 50W of power and support Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround standards. There are different sound modes to dig into, too, as well as different picture modes, so you can optimise image quality as you wish.It has four HDMI 2.1 ports with full support for 4K/120Hz gaming, so will play nicely with modern games consoles (and if you’re a PC gamer looking for a living-room monitor, you’ll be glad to know that refresh rate can be overclocked further up to 165Hz). Support for variable refresh rate and ALLM further enhances the gaming experience.Price history:not available, but this is its lowest ever price at Currys.An entry-level LG OLED for lessView image in fullscreenLG B5OLED, 55in£899 at John Lewis£899 at AmazonLG’s B5 OLED is the most affordable entry in the brand’s 2025 OLED lineup, adding a new processor, improved connectivity and an updated UI to last year’s B4 model.It comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports with full support for 4K/120Hz output, and also offers VRR and ALLM for gaming. In terms of HDR, the B5 supports Dolby Vision IQ, Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG and Cinema HDR, offering impactful highlights in supported content. It also comes with LG’s slick and easy-to-use webOS operating system, with a wide range of streaming apps, plus different picture modes. The 20W speakers support Dolby Atmos.If you want a larger version, the 65in version is currently£1,299 at AO.Price history:this is the lowest ever price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It provides you with plenty of screen real estate and Philips’ own TitanOS smart system for accessing smart TV apps.There is decent HDR support for such an affordable television, with HDR10 and HLG, plus compatibility with HDR10+, and it has three HDMI ports – one of which is an eARC port for soundbars. It also supports HDMI VRR and ALLM for gaming. With this in mind, though, its maximum refresh rate is 60Hz rather than 120Hz. Its 20W speakers also have Atmos support.What’s unique about Philips TVs is the presence of the company’s Ambilight system, which provides atmospheric lighting on the rear of the unit that projects on to the surface behind it. Aimed at reducing eye strain, this is also useful if you want to add a splash of colour to your room.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A smart Samsung OLEDView image in fullscreenSamsung S90FOLED, 65in£1,395 at Amazon£1,599 at John LewisThe S90F is one of the only QD-OLED TVs Samsung offers – combining the inky blacks and virtually infinite contrast of an OLED with the higher peak brightness of a QLED. It means this telly provides sublime image quality. HDR support consists of HDR10, HDR10+ and HLG; Samsung still isn’t supporting Dolby Vision.The four HDMI 2.1 ports are welcome, and offer support for proper 4K/120Hz gaming, with up to 144Hz for PC gaming. There is also support for variable refresh and ALLM, alongside Samsung’s Game Hub menu.Price history:this is its lowest ever price at Amazon.Sony’s best OLED TVView image in fullscreenSony Bravia 8 IIQD-OLED, 65in£2,199 at John Lewis£2,199 at CurrysSony’s Bravia 8 II is one of the best TVs currently available – with a price to match. The QD-OLED panel is 25% brighter than on the A95L model it replaces, with even sharper picture quality, not least with HDR enabled. There’s support for Dolby Vision, HLG and HDR10, and claimed peak brightness is a searing 4,000 nits.The Acoustic Surface Audio+ speaker system is widely well reviewed, providing surprisingly solid audio for a set of TV speakers. Gaming support is strong, too, with 4K/120Hz input supported over HDMI 2.1, plus VRR and ALLM. There’s even an ‘optimised for PS5’ mode that automatically optimises the TV’s settings when it detects that the PlayStation is plugged in. Unlike Samsung and LG’s flagships, however, there are only two HDMI 2.1 ports here (one of which is an eARC, if you did want to connect a soundbar).Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An LG mid-range TV for a little cheaperView image in fullscreenLG C5OLED, 55in£1,099 at John Lewis£1,099 at CurrysLG’s latest mid-range C-series model OLED offers an improved operating system and a new processor over last year’s C4. The new processor helps it to better upscale content to 4K than previous models, too, which is handy if you watch a lot of older and lower-definition content.There are four HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K/144Hz gaming (or up to 4K/120Hz on consoles), with VRR and ALLM supported on all of them. HDR support comes in the form of HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision, and this 55in model benefits from LG’s Evo panel for even stronger brightness.As you’d expect from an LG OLED, it comes with dazzling image quality with inky blacks, sublime contrast and wonderfully accurate colours that make viewing everything from games to movies a pleasure.Price history:it’s been available slightly cheaper but this is its lowest price at a mainstream retailer.A great mid-range Sony OLEDView image in fullscreenSony Bravia 8A OLED, 55in£1,299 at John Lewis£1,299 at ArgosThe Sony Bravia 8A was initially more expensive than the standard Bravia 8, but as pricing has settled, this A variant has become a more compelling choice. One of Sony’s 2024 TV models, it comes with an OLED panel that it claims is 10% brighter than its predecessor. HDR support comes in with Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG (no HDR10+). It also comes with Sony’s AI-enabled Bravia XR processor inside, plus the same Acoustic Surface Audio+ sound system for surprisingly decent audio. The Google TV operating system also provides a familiar experience.As an OLED, image quality looks to be rather excellent, and gamers should be decently happy with HDMI 2.1 support for 4K/120Hz output with VRR and ALLM. As with the other Bravia above, this comes with the caveat that HDMI 2.1 is supported on only two of this TV’s four HDMI inputs.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The small 42in smart OLED TVView image in fullscreenLG C5OLED, 42in£849 at Argos£849 at AmazonThis 42in TV is the most compact OLED you can buy in the current LG range, making it a dead cert if you’ve got a smaller room like me, or want to use this TV as a super-size monitor.There are four HDMI 2.1-enabled ports with 4K/144Hz capability (and up to 120Hz on consoles), plus VRR and ALLM support for gaming. There’s also solid HDR support with HDR10, Dolby Vision and HLG. LG’s new webOS 25 brings small upgrades, such as the ability to hide apps on the front screen, and it’s a reasonable smart TV system to use every day.It also comes with a new AI Magic Remote with what LG calls ‘AI buttons’ – voice controls and drag-and-drop functions.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The surprising Mini LED standout 65in TVView image in fullscreenTCL C7KQD-Mini LED, 65in£749 at CurrysTCL has become known for its more affordable, feature-rich televisions in recent years. The C7K is a shining example of this, providing excellent image quality at a modest price point for its 65in size. A particular highlight is its fantastic black levels, contrast and dynamic range, helped along by a bright QD-Mini LED panel with 1,008 dimming zones and a claimed peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits.It also has a full complement of HDR support, with HLG, HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision for impactful highlights. Gaming support is great, with two out of the four HDMI ports supporting 4K/144Hz HDMI 2.1 powers with VRR and ALLM. Plus, if you’re willing to drop the resolution down to Full HD from 4K, it can double the refresh rate to 288Hz. That’s a feature more typically found on a PC monitor than a TV, but if you have a powerful PC connected and want to maximise performance in high-refresh-rate games, then the C7K should allow you to do so.This new model also adds in a Bang & Olufsen stereo with 60W of power, replacing TCL’s previous collaboration with Onkyo, as well as support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundtracks.If you’re after an even bigger screen, the 75in version is£948 at AmazonandAO.Price history:it’s only £40 cheaper than it’s been at Currys all month, but it’s still its lowest ever price.A big-screen LG OLEDView image in fullscreenLG C4OLED, 77in£1,799 at AmazonLast year’s mid-range LG OLED, the C4 was the first LG C-series OLED to support native 4K/144Hz output over its four HDMI 2.1 ports – a boon for gamers. It also brings proper Nvidia G-Sync certification for one of its supported VRR standards.The presence of webOS 24 brings benefits such as a built-in Chromecast for easy wireless casting right out of the box, and the Alpha 9 processor brings AI smarts to enhance the clarity of onscreen dialogue and to bring even more channels of virtual surround sound. The internal 40W speakers have Atmos support to provide more cinematic audio in supported content.Price history:this is higher than it was during Prime Day – but only by 2p.For more:How to shop smart this Black FridayHow to avoid bad Black Friday laptop dealsThe best early Black Friday dealsExplore more on these topicsThe FilterThe FilterTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s what it’s like to work in a job that is essential and often perilously undervaluedSammy GecsoylerThu 20 Nov 2025 06.34 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 09.59 ESTShareWhen 64-year-old Sue Cabourn began her career in the late 90s, the next generation of artists including Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin and Gillian Wearing were dominating the cultural agenda. All of them were state-educated but, had they attended school now, things might have panned out differently.There has been an exodus of art teachers (a27% dropin the number working in English state-secondary schools from 2011 to 2024), lower uptake (48% fewer studentshave taken on arts subjects at GCSE since 2010), and areformed systemthat critics say hasstifled creativityand prioritised Stem (science and technology) subjects over arts and humanities.Even outside school, the arts have sustained heavy losses. Last year, the Campaign for the Arts said that culture spending by councils had beencut by more than 50%a person in England since 2010. It sounds like a grim time to be trying to inspire the next generation of would-be artists, but this hasn’t stopped 29-year-old Jasmine Pert from taking on her calling. In the following conversation, Cabourn and Pert talk about the reality of being an art teacher today, with all the challenges (and joys) that come along with the job.How did you become art teachers?Jasmine Pert:I wanted to get into the profession since I was a child; it was my favourite subject at school. My mum always jokes that, when I was about 14, I said: “I’m going to be an art teacher because you get to sit and drink coffee and listen to Radio 2 all day.” If only! I started my teacher training in lockdown and I’m coming into my fourth year on the job. I now work at a secondary school on the east coast of Scotland. I love it. I feel very fortunate that I’m getting to share the thing that I enjoy the most with other people.Sue Cabourn:It sounds awful, but I became an art teacher purely because my husband had a back injury and I had three children. I thought: what job could I study for that would fit around everything? My first job in the late 90s was working with adults who had learning difficulties. Then, they started giving me classes with students who had been excluded from school. As you could imagine, they were quite disengaged. It was a baptism of fire. From there, I worked in a secondary school in Nottingham for about 20 years before semi-retiring. I moved to the Isle of Man but I still do cover lessons at the largest school on the island. There have been ups and downs but I have so many happy memories from my 27 years on the job.When I started teaching, everything was much simpler. The students weren’t on their phones like they are nowSue, can you take us back to the heyday of the profession?SC:The peak time for me was probably around 2006 or 2007. There just seemed to be much more money in education. My school hired a technician to help out and we could afford good quality supplies. We were even doing pottery and ceramics. We also went on lots of trips. We went to London and visited all the big galleries, but it wasn’t just about seeing the amazing art. On the train down, some of the students were standing in the compartments between carriages and looking out of the window all excited because they’d never been on a train before. It was such a rich experience for them. We even went to Paris and visited the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa. Another success story was taking my class to theYorkshire Sculpture Park. It’s such an amazing place. Usually when you go to a museum you can’t touch anything, but there they could run free and even climb up the sculptures. They loved it.View image in fullscreenSue Cabourn: ‘I’ve got a shoe-box full of thank you cards from students. It really makes a difference on a tough day.’Photograph: Dave Kneale/The GuardianHow have things changed since?SC:Right now, I feel a bit frustrated. The funding has changed. At some of the recent schools I’ve worked at, we didn’t really do 3D work and having a technician was rare. A lot of students say “I can’t draw”, but if you give a child a piece of clay they can create wonderful things. We had some students from Afghanistan about 15 years ago. There was a language barrier, which was a challenge, but their clay and textile work was so impressive. Things now seem more focused on results. Children’s sketchbooks seem very restrictive and, since Covid, we’ve had to adapt to remote learning and create lessons that can be accessed from home. To me, that doesn’t sit right.Are these challenges you’ve come across, Jasmine?JP:In my current school, I have my own classroom, art cupboard and even a big clay facility, which is great. But we’re pushing for more trips, though we have to be aware that going on lots of trips is not affordable for everyone. We are also pushing for more teaching and classroom time because a lot of the behind-the-scenes work is quite admin-focused, trying to get stuff done when the kids aren’t there. You do hear on the grapevine that these things weren’t done by teachers before. Was this the case for you, Sue?SC:There wasn’t as much assessment as there is now; it feels like assessment for assessment’s sake. That’s why I stepped out of the game for a bit back in 2022. I thought: I’ve had enough of this now. During lockdown, I was doing all these spreadsheets at home. I remember one Saturday morning, I sat for eight hours doing paperwork and thought, “This isn’t what I signed up for”. It’s not teaching any more; it felt like admin. It stopped the joy of it for me.What are students like today?SC:When I started teaching, everything was much simpler. The students weren’t on their phones like they are now. Behaviour management was still tough but it was far less challenging than now. Some students also lack fairly simple skills. The other day, I was showing a year 8 student how to use a compass. That’s something that they should have learned in primary school. I also had a boy in year 10 who didn’t understand why his watercolours weren’t working – he hadn’t used any water. In your head, you think, what has happened to the basics? Homework has gone out of the window since Covid too. I hate to say it, but children are lazier now.View image in fullscreenJasmine Pert: ‘Digital art is huge.’Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianJP:I’ve seen a lot of changes since Covid, when it became nearly impossible to teach art because everything was taught remotely. As a result I’ve seen more and more children coming to school who aren’t at the level they should be for their age, which means we have to quickly fill in the gaps. I have had students I’m having to show how to hold a pencil, use a ruler or scissors. It’s becoming more rare, it feels, to come across students who have analogue hobbies.How has technology changed the job?SC:One of the biggest tasks I had to do when I started teaching was filling out the class register book by hand every morning, which included writing out the name of each student. This was before computers came in, so that’s one improvement, but for the most part it’s been negative. Before I left mainstream teaching, I was showing a year 11 class some beautiful art books in our school library. A lot of them had never stepped inside. I asked them to find some artists in these books but they didn’t know how to use the index; they were so used to going straight to Google. It made me feel quite sad. The task was about going through a beautiful art book and looking at the pages, not relying on the internet.View image in fullscreenJasmine Pert … ‘I feel very fortunate that I’m getting to share the thing that I enjoy the most with other people.’Composite: Guardian Design; Dave Kneale; Murdo MacLeod for The GuardianJP:I think technology definitely has its place in the classroom. Digital art is huge now and even things like Pinterest are a quick and easy way to show students something that might inspire them. Also, some students use how-to videos on YouTube to practise their drawing. However, the introduction of AI is scary territory. For other jobs in the sector it’s frightening, too. AI can create an entire children’s book within seconds that looks legitimate but there’s not any handcrafted quality. It almost feels throwaway to me. But I’m not an expert and some artists might find it useful.SC:I don’t understand AI myself. I showed my husband a video of a monkey with a kitten and he said, “That’s AI.” If I don’t even know what’s real, how are you going to know in the future, when a student gives you a piece of work, that they haven’t been helped in some way? It’s bad enough when parents would help students out with homework. Now there’s the prospect of things being computer-aided. I’m glad I’m coming to the end of my career now.Have your students gone on to pursue the arts further and what success have they had?SC:One of the most heartwarming things is when I’ve got emails from students, or they come in to see me, to say thank you. You never expect it at all but I’ve got a shoe-box full of thank you cards. It really makes a difference on a tough day. I remember once, I was probably at your stage, Jasmine, I had a really awful class last thing on a Friday. They came in chanting football songs before they even sat down and then some lads started throwing crayons at each other. When they left the classroom, I cried. It was the first time I’d ever cried at work. It’s at those really low moments when you have to think of the positives, and hearing how well my former students have done is the perfect boost. One of my students is now a film-maker who has won awards and another works at a high-end agency. When you hear about those successes, it means everything.JP:I agree, Sue. I have worked in a range of schools, some more affluent than others. Being able to create a space where a pupil can feel safe to express themselves is really important to me. So many influential artists come from working class roots, Grayson Perry and Tracey Emin to name a few. This is why it is really crucial to develop, fund and protect a student’s curiosity in the subject. When I hear about students who choose to take up art when they leave school or enter local competitions, it makes it worth those exhausting days.Why is art important for students with additional needs?SC:After working in a special needs school in Nottingham with autistic children and those with complex needs, I would say art was one of the most important things for them because it gave them a creative outlet. They would happily have a go at anything. If they were having a difficult day, their mood could be lifted by a lovely new pack of felt-tip pens or getting the paints out. I had one student who was painting a canvas blue. He was so fascinated with this blue paint; he started painting his hands blue and then he moved the brush up his arm. I didn’t stop him because, at this point, his clothes were covered in the paint. It was such an important experience for him to see the colour, the way it moved and the texture of the paint on himself.View image in fullscreenSue Cabourn … ‘Our subject is just as important as any other.’Composite: Guardian Design; Dave Kneale; Murdo MacLeod for The GuardianJS:In the past I’ve taught pupils with additional support needs, where some of the students have dexterity issues. This can make it difficult for them to draw, so, in these cases, I’ve had to work with them to find alternative ways to express themselves in the classroom, which is usually through craft work. Not every class is the same but I’ve found the process really rewarding and inspiring.Jasmine, has being an art teacher lived up to expectations?JP:Sometimes I do have time to drink coffee and, if I’m lucky, it’s quiet enough to hear my radio and listen to Radio 2. It’s definitely more full on than I had anticipated. On my very first day of being a student teacher, my mentor said to me, “Jasmine, you’ll be able to do the teaching part with your eyes shut. It’s everything else that goes with it that takes time and energy.” I feel like that comes into my head all the time. Overall, it has lived up to my expectation. When I’m actually teaching and able to be around the students, it’s my favourite thing.‘You definitely felt disposable’: models – one 27, one 62 – discuss Botox, weight loss, creativity and the threat of AIRead moreSue, have you got some words of wisdom for Jasmine?SC:Our subject is just as important as any other. As art teachers, we have more skills and understanding about the wider world than people realise. We see, feel and understand things that others don’t see or value. Don’t second-guess yourself or feel you’re not worthy because of how some people see the subject. Also, when you come across a child who doesn’t like your subject, it’s not necessarily you. It’s often not personal. Some young people have got a lot going on in their lives and they only see you for that hour in the week. If you can make an impact in that short amount of time, you’re doing an amazing job.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

At centers like Maddie’s Place, mothers stay with their infants – and leave together, in recoveryAnn Neumannwith photographs by Rebecca KigerThu 20 Nov 2025 07.56 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 13.44 ESTShareEight months pregnant and in pain, Stephanie Rosell went to the Holy family hospital emergency room after an infection began spreading up her legs. Unemployed and homeless, estranged from her family, she lived in a shed she had built in a friend’s yard. She was also addicted to fentanyl.As doctors treated her infection, she began to panic. Withdrawal was setting in. She leaned over the bed and vomited.Stephanie finally broke down. “Listen, I gotta go. I have to go home and get high.”She had used fentanyl before coming to the ER and had just enough time to get treated before she needed to go home to get high again. She thought she still had four weeks left to figure out how to get clean and have this baby.The nurse had other ideas. She told Stephanie she was not going anywhere.“Yes, I am,” Stephanie said.But the hospital refused to discharge her: the infection in her legs was serious, but doctors had discovered she also had an amniotic fluid leak. The nurse, Izzie, warned her: if she walked out, she and her baby would not survive.Izzie persuaded the doctor to give Stephanie controlleddoses of fentanyl every few hours, knowing that withdrawal could endanger her and the baby. After delivery Stephanie would be switched to methadone, a medication that eases withdrawal and is commonly used in addiction recovery.Five days later, on 12 November 2022, Stephanie delivered a baby girl weighing 4lb 8oz – premature, small but alive.When the nurse asked if she wanted to hold her baby, Stephanie said: “No.” She was numb. Her epidural had failed, her last dose of fentanyl had been administered four hours before delivery.She felt sick. Unprepared to be a mother. Undeserving.Stephanie had tried to get clean several times during pregnancy, and felt horrible each time she failed. She felt worthless, berating herself for not being able to do the impossible. An OB-GYN told her to “just” stop using. Even her dealer refused to sell to her when she became visibly pregnant.“But I couldn’t,” she said. “I needed help.”View image in fullscreenStephanie Rossell hangs up laundered shirts that family and guests are required to wear when visiting Maddie’s Place in Spokane, Washington. Stephanie is a mom who went through the organization’s program for moms and babies dealing with substance abuse and exposure.The pervasive expectation that her love for her baby would make her quit only led to greater shame and self-abuse, a trigger for her to use again. Yet she could not simply will her addiction away, any more than she could will away a chronic disease.The baby was taken to the NICU. When Stephanie finally saw her, she was hooked up to tubes and leads, so tiny she thought she would break her. Holding her for the first time, she felt nothing. “I just stared at her and was like, ‘What am I going to do with you?’” She still wasn’t sure she wanted to be her mother.After two days she decided to name her baby Izzie, after the nurse who had been so kind to her.Hospital staff told her about Maddie’s Place, a new kind of care center in Spokane, Washington, where mothers and their drug-exposed newborns are treated together, not apart.In much of the US, where a baby is diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) every 18 minutes, infants are still whisked to NICUs and medicated while their mothers face child-protection investigations. But a small, growing network of centers like Maddie’s Place is proving a simple point: when mothers and babies stay together, outcomes improve, foster placements fall and long-term costs decline.It took Stephanie a while to gather the courage to call, but she finally did. After confirming she would be a good fit for the program, two staff members came to pick her up.She stepped out of the hospital still in withdrawal, scared and uncertain about what would come next.At Maddie’s Place, Stephanie still feared CPS would come take Izzie – even though she was not sure she wanted to keep her. The fear lingered: that at any moment, someone could walk in and take her baby away.For the first two weeks, Stephanie kept to herself. “I didn’t really want anything to do with any of them,” she said. “I didn’t have a lot of trust at that point.”Life on the streets, she said, was about survival.Drugscame first; trust came last.Stephanie had one close friend, but even that bond was fragile. The people she loved always found ways to hurt her. She did not know how to love herself, let alone anyone else.Every day, staff from Maddie’s Place drove her to a clinic for methadone, administered in pill form. Slowly, she was starting to get clean.She spent every minute outside treatment with Izzie, and could see that her baby was getting the specialized care she needed. Her girl had some trouble feeding at first, with intolerance to some formulas and pronounced gastrointestinal issues. She needed feeding therapy. She also had heightened sensory issues and required an occupational therapist – all common issues for babies born with NAS.If this little kid could see that these babies deserve to be loved, then I could do this. I could be a momStephanieOne afternoon before Thanksgiving, Stephanie sat in the visitation area, where parents in active addiction can come for supervised visits with their babies. Katie Bunch-Smith, a peer support specialist, stopped by with her own five kids in tow to drop off cookies. They all gathered around Stephanie, who was sitting on the floor holding Izzie.The children were wide-eyed, in awe of the tiny infant in Stephanie’s arms. “They had no care in the world. They didn’t care that I had used drugs with her. None of those things mattered to them,” Stephanie said. “They just were so excited to see this little baby.”She keeps a photo of the moment. She is clad in black pants and a hoodie, a gray knit hat with a pompom on her head, sitting on the wooden floor with the door behind her. She is thin. Her head is tilted forward so you cannot see her face. She is holding Izzie up on her knee for the other kids to see and they are gathered around, fawning and reaching out to the baby.Jacob, eight, asked the moms: “Where are all the dads?” The moms tried to explain that the dads were busy, called away to other tasks, that they would be there if they could.“When I have kids,” Jacob said, “I’m going to be the best dad ever. I’m gonna show them that they deserve to be loved.”Stephanie and Bunch-Smith looked at each other. “I just lost it and fell apart,” Stephanie said. “If this little kid could see that these babies deserve to be loved, then I could do this. I could be a mom.”View image in fullscreenStephanie reads a book to her daughter Izzie before bedtime.Tools for treating drug-exposed newborns have existed for decades.The Finnegan NAS scale was developed in 1975 by Dr Laura Finnegan to allow nurses to evaluate newborns and chart the severity of withdrawal symptoms,such as hypersensitivity to sound, light and touch.At the time, NICU standard practice was to administer drugs to babies to ease their withdrawal, but low staffing meant that they were often left alone in their cribs to cry. Their mothers, having tested positive for drug use, were arrested and later sent back to the street. Others, shamed by their addiction, simply disappeared on their own.The babies, more often than not, were funneled into the troubled foster care system.In 2011, Rhonda Edmunds worked as a NICU nurse at Cabell Huntington hospital in Huntington, West Virginia. She and her colleagues began to notice an increasing number of babies born with NAS.These babies often struggled to feed and suffered from diarrhea, gas and other gastrointestinal problems. Some arched and stiffened their backs, shook all over with tremors, or had low body tone. And the time they needed in the NICU was noticeably longer than other newborns – a concern for hospitals with limited staff and beds.Edmunds needed all the help she could get. She found a program in Kent, Washington, that had been treating babies with substance exposure for decades. Beginning in the 1980s, during the cocaine epidemic, foster mother Barbara Drennen had devised techniques for soothing newborns in substance withdrawal, bridging their time between the NICU and foster care.At first Drennen cared for the babies in her home, but the demand allowed her to open a facility,Pediatric Interim Care Center, where she formalized treatment and eventually cared for more than 3,000 babies. Mothers could visit their newborns, but they were not housed on site.Drennen, who is now 83, is an encyclopedia of hands-on experience in infant abstinence syndrome. One of the greatest challenges she has faced over the past 25 years is the constant need to adapt to new drug epidemics.Each drug causes unique symptoms in babies. With heroin, the baby sways side to side and does not want to be touched in the early days. With methamphetamine, the baby can handle some stimulation, but has trouble eating.View image in fullscreenAn infant cries while being swaddled at Brigid’s Path in Kettering, Ohio.Drennen invited Edmunds and her team for a visit. She taught them that the babies need their environment to be calm and controlled. Swaddling babies is helpful in order to have them concentrate on breathing and eating, and not “flailing around”.Therapeutic handlingtechniquesinclude holding the baby in a “C” position and moving them up and down to comfort them (not swaying them from side to side). Anticipating their need for food or a clean diaper is also important to a baby’s self-regulation: they learn to distinguish those basic needs from the disruption of external stimuli or emotional impulses, and how to calm themselves.Edmunds took those newly acquired skills back to West Virginia, where the opioid epidemic was intractable; a mix of poverty, unemployment, limited healthcare and deep funding cuts has made the state’s overdose death rate among the highest in the country.It was soon obvious that the care these babies needed could not be provided by the NICU. In 2014, Edmunds and her colleagues openedLily’s Placein a former orthopedic office in Huntington – where staff and volunteers regulated babies’ stimulation by dimming lights, limiting noise and providing care around the clock. The local hospital started to refer newborns in need, and word spread.The mother with the baby is treatment for the baby. The mother is the magicLauren JanssonLily’s Place added something new: they began to treat mothers and babies, the “dyad”, together. This approach is slowly gaining wider attention and the approval of experts.Lauren Jansson, a professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins school of medicine, told me that dyadic attachment is vital – and a solid bond starts with making sure the mother is doing well. Sending dysregulated mothers and babies out into the community is bound to fail. “What’s going to happen? The baby’s going to wind up in foster care with special needs or developmental problems. The mother ends up with mental health problems.” Or back on the street.“The mother with the baby is treatment for the baby,” Jansson said. “The mother is the magic.”Edmunds wanted to allow the early weeks of a newborn’s life to be motivation for mothers and fathers to get help and to access a recovery program so that they could be involved in their child’s life.It was in the infants’ best interest, too. From experience, she knew babies recovered more quickly with close contact and attention from their mothers – a finding supported bymedical research, which shows that both mother and child fare better together.A 2021studyby Johns Hopkins school of medicine, co-authored by Jansson, called dyadic care a “window of opportunity” to assess how mother and baby regulate and respond to each other. When mothers are encouraged to bond with their infants through skin-to-skin contact and pay close attention to their babies’ needs, both are able to better manage their own attention, emotions, physiology and behaviors. It is, according to Jansson, a necessary prerequisite for babies’ early learning.To this end, Lily’s Place provided private rooms for mothers and their babies, coupled with support services that encouraged mothers to enter drug rehabilitation. Help was also on hand to navigate family court and to decipher opaque state and federal services – temporary financial assistance, food stamps and even the DMV – that would get them on their feet. Formula, toys, baby clothes, diapers and other items were also made available.Lily’s Place’s success made waves. Today, there are five pediatric transitional care centers in the country, all in cities hit hardest by the opioid crisis. What began as one nurse’s experiment in Washington state soon spread:Brigid’s Pathopened in Ohio in 2017,Jacob’s Hopein Mesa in 2019,Hushabye Nurseryin Phoenix in 2020, and Maddie’s Place – where Stephanie stayed with her baby Izzie – opened in 2022.Together, they form a small but growing network built on a radical idea: healing a baby means healing the mother, too.View image in fullscreenStephanie watches as Izzie pretends to be Elsa from Frozen in her bedroom.At Lily’s Place last August, recovering mothers gathered in the shade behind a five-unit residence to talk about how they fell into drug use – and how they were fighting their way out.The women, and more than two dozen others I interviewed, all said the same thing in different ways: drugs had led to the belief they were not worth even the smallest acts of care. For many, addiction began in trauma, in its various forms: abuse, degradation, abandonment. Yet their resourcefulness and resilience rarely make it into the broader narratives about addiction.Rebecca – a tall 36-year-old with meticulously kept long hair and carefully applied makeup – began smoking meth with her father, who sexually abused her. He cut and burned her; she showed me the scars running down her arms and legs. She spent decades drifting in and out of homelessness.“I have an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old,” she told me. “I lost them because when me and their father separated, I didn’t have anybody there for me.”Later, she was held captive by a man who tied her up and starved her. He set fire to the building they were squatting in before hanging himself in front of her.She is clean now, and attends classes at Lily’s Place that help her manage her trauma and subsequent anger and anxiety. And she has visitation rights for her other two children, daughters ages 11 and seven.Shayla, 26, another resident, grew up in Charleston in a household littered with drugs. Her grandparents lived nextdoor and adopted her. But her grandfather was controlling, and she seldom left the house. When her grandmother died, right after Shayla graduated from high school, her mother came back into her life.“My mother was the first one I did heroin with,” she told me. Because her parents had no boundaries, she modeled what she was familiar with and found herself in abusive relationships. “I started going down the wrong road and doing things for drugs, but I ended up getting pregnant.”It is easy to see how birth control slips out of reach for these women – when there is no healthcare, when shame keeps you from the clinic, when you are fleeing violence, when you do not have a car, when survival narrows to one task: staving off withdrawal.Shayla’s baby is eight months old and lives with a family member. She sees her once a week.Again and again, their stories turned on loss: a parent, a child, a sense of worth. For Stephanie Rosell, it was her brother.View image in fullscreenStephanie leaves work at Maddie’s Place to head home.Four weeks before her graduation from high school, Stephanie’s brother Andrew was killed in a traffic accident. A city recycling truck turned right on red and struck him in the crosswalk, trapping him beneath the vehicle. “When they took him out from underneath the truck, basically his insides exploded,” she said.He was 16, just 14 months younger than her. Because their parents worked swing shifts, she had always looked after him, getting him ready for school or getting him bathed and into bed at night. When their parents separated, they became each other’s support system.“We fought like cats and dogs,” she said, “but we always had each other’s backs.”After his death, the family fell apart. Stephanie started using drugs to handle her pain. The next year, at 19, she got pregnant. She was devastated: she had never pictured herself as a mom. But she didn’t believe in abortion.I have always loved her. It’s not that I didn’t want her. I just didn’t know how to be her momStephanieAt the time, Stephanie was using what she called “party drugs”, but not harder drugs like opiates. She stopped using them during the pregnancy. “I was able to get sober because I was pretty clear-minded at that age,” Stephanie said. But she was still miserable, still beset with grief.She gave birth to her daughter Elizabeth at the age of 20. For a year and a half, Stephanie labored to be a good mother. “I tried to be with her dad and have a family and do all the things, because I thought that’s what I was supposed to do,” Stephanie said. Then Elizabeth’s dad relapsed on meth. Stephanie, who had never dreamed of becoming a single parent, found herself with no help with childcare while struggling with postpartum depression.Elizabeth was sick and inconsolable, and Stephanie did not know why. She sought help, but remembers doctors acting like she was “some idiot kid who didn’t have any business having a baby”. Repeatedly, they told her, wrongly, that nothing was the matter with her child. When she was around one year old, Elizabeth was diagnosed with kidney reflux so acute it “would have knocked a full grown man to the ground”.Nights were the worst. Elizabeth could not sleep and wanted only to be held. Stephanie did not sleep for days. Eventually, she called her mother and said: “You need to come get her now or I’m going to put her in a closet and let her cry. I can’t do this.”After that, Stephanie’s life spiraled out of control.The first time she used meth was with Elizabeth’s dad. They had an agreement with Stephanie’s mother that they could only see Elizabeth when they weren’t high. “It slowly progressed to where I had her less and less,” Stephanie said.Guilt and shame at failing to be a mother kept Stephanie away from her daughter, but she knew Elizabeth was cared for, clothed and safe. She would sometimes see her on birthdays, but they didn’t have much of a relationship until Elizabeth was 14.“I have always loved her,” Stephanie said. “It’s not that I didn’t want her. I just didn’t know how to be her mom.”View image in fullscreenStephanie and Izzie having lunch in their kitchen.The years ticked by. Stephanie worked off and on, but addiction kept pulling her under. Her use progressed from meth to heroin to fentanyl. Sometimes she was on the street or reliant on fleeting friends.When addiction takes over, you will do whatever it takes to get high. Some steal from friends and family, or trade sex for drugs. Stephanie stole from big box stores, and she was good at it. Dealers would give her a list and she would pick up laundry detergent, toilet paper, socks, dog food, whatever was on the list, and exchange her haul for drugs. She was caught only once, after bringing along a sketchy friend who drew attention. The charge was second-degree shoplifting.During the pandemic, Stephanie started to see a man she met at work, where she was doing traffic control flagging for road construction crews. They drank together, stayed in touch when he moved to Idaho, and again when he later relocated to Texas. When she decided to visit him, she made a plan to get off fentanyl on the way. She brought a few pills and a little heroin, thinking the long drive might help her taper as she switched to a drug she knew, one she believed she could handle.That did not happen.She was in Texas for six days when she had a car accident. A crash at 70mph into a concrete embankment that totaled her car, fractured her spine, broke her leg, shattered her heel and lacerated her kidney and liver.The man she was visiting was the only person in the area she knew, and he was not eager to help her. She called her parents, who, though they were no longer married, drove the 2,600 miles together to pick her up.But that was all they were willing to do. Back in Spokane, they told her she was on her own. “They dumped me off on my dope man’s back porch and were like, ‘Good luck!’” she recalled. She was still in a wheelchair.Six months later, she found out that she was pregnant again.View image in fullscreenStephanie fastens Izzie into her car seat.While visiting Maddie’s place, I got to meet the babies staying there. The facility can care for 16 infants and mothers at a time – and they were at full capacity.I held sweet baby M in my arms and cooed quietly to settle him. He was fussy, whimpering periodically. I rocked his limp weight and smelled his satisfying baby smell. He was the third baby I held that day, more restless than the others, constantly turning his full head of black hair in the crook of my arm.His mother, whom I will call Posey, bustled around the nursery with uncommon energy. She was preparing for her and her baby to go home that day.Open gallery|0Posey asked the cuddlers – employees and volunteers who care for infants with oversight from a full-time nurse – about a onesie. Otherwise, the room was quiet.Emma Jones, the communication’s manager, a master cuddler with a genius for social media, talked to me quietly as we stared at the babies. Jones’s skill had built ahuge following. She shows the world what Maddie’s Place does, educates the public on the special needs of NAS babies, and garners donations: diapers, baby clothes, formula and money.As I held baby M, feeling triumphant for finally soothing him, his mother sat beside me and took his small hand. She switched on a tiny buzzing nail file and tended to each finger with quick precision. He whimpered at the vibration. When she was done, she lifted him from my arms to change him. She moved briskly, not quite in sync with her baby.She laid him down on the changing pad and as Posey pulled one limb after another out of his jumper, he wailed at the top of his lungs. His diaper was dry and did not need to be changed. Posey labored to show her mothering skills, knowing she had a nursery full of professional baby whisperers in the same room.“Come on buddy, just for Mommy, stop crying, just for once,” she said, picking him up and putting him on her shoulder. Still he wailed.Watching her, I thought of how hard it is to mother under scrutiny. I worried about how she was going to cope at home alone with her infant. I had known Posey for five minutes but the worry irrationally welled up within me.View image in fullscreenA bottle of formula is prepared for an infant in the nursery at Brigid’s Path.I am not the first person to wrongly stigmatize recovering new mothers. In the 80s, hundreds of motherswere arrestedfor using cocaine while pregnant. The wave of concern for the “crack babies” focused on exaggerated effects that drug use might have on the children of predominantly Black mothers, but never considered the effects of untreated addiction, poverty, racism or poor prenatal care.A similar discourse about “meth babies” arose when a wave of methamphetamine use spiked two decades later, with an accompanying wave of arrests. Writing about it at the time, the journalist Libby Copelandnoted: “Legislators and prosecutors like to talk about sending pregnant drug abusers ‘a message,’ but you have to wonder what exactly the message is, if the threat of punishment does little to help women gripped by addiction.”Today, 17 states haveestablishedfetal rights, either by law or the courts. These laws, often gestated among anti-abortion groups, masquerade as concern for babies but serve as a punishment for mothers. In August 2025, women in Arizona who tested positive for prescribed treatment drugs such as Suboxone were having their childrentaken away.Sometimes, foster care is the only answer. Yet for the 390,000 children living in foster homes today, the system can bring its own harms: higher rates of physical, emotional and learning challenges, especially for children from families struggling with poverty, addiction or racial inequities.The numbers are staggering:roughly 75-80% of NAS infants discharged from hospital NICUs go into the system.The pain of losing a child to foster care is familiar to Dona Couch. We met at Brigid’s Path in Kettering,Ohio. She was holding her five-week-old, Zurii, who cooed and looked at her. It was afternoon, with low light coming in the back windows. Two of Dona’s older girls, Raridy, 11, and Journii, two, romped and played around her.Dona, 38, is calm and self-possessed, her long, light brown hair falling loosely around her shoulders. For the past two years she has worked at a smoke shop, where her boss held her job open through her maternity leave with Zurii.View image in fullscreenDona Couch cheers for her daughter Raridy at a flag football game in Dayton, Ohio. Her daughter Journii, two, and Dona’s mother are along the sidelines.Journii’s birth was more complicated. Dona had been sober for six years when she was assaulted. Her cousin’s child’s father had thrown a piece of wood at her, shattering her right femur. She was rushed into surgery, and given pain medications which led to her relapse. She was still using when she found out she was pregnant with Journii.She and the baby wound up at Brigid’s Path. At first, Journii was on meds, with tremors, a fever and she regularly vomited. “She would shake and scream and cry constantly,” Dona said. “You couldn’t console her.”Because Dona was still using, she could not stay overnight with Journii. But she could stay for the duration of visiting hours every day. A family advocate supervisor, Lindsie Marsh, helped get Dona back into recovery. Journii went home with foster parents until Dona got out. (Dona and Journii’s former foster parents are still close.)The old adage that mothers know how to mother is tacit here, but it’s realistically tempered with the knowledge that new mothers need help. They may not have had good role models, they may lack confidence. Just as lactation consultants coach new mothers through how to breastfeed, Brigid’s Path’s nurses and doctors can coach new mothers of NAS babies how to best provide care.View image in fullscreenJournii and Raridy, 11, have lunch while their mom, Dona, sweeps the kitchen floor.“We’re a downstream intervention for the baby, but our goal is to be an upstream intervention for the mom for the next pregnancy,” Lisa Jasin, Brigid’s Path’s clinical director, had told me that morning in the bright conference room. “That’s grace for the past, and hope for the future.”A year or so after Journii’s birth, Dona had wanted to get pregnant again. She was newly married to Darrell, Journii’s father. Her oldest daughters and Darrell had become an integrated family. Dona was still in recovery and began to ween off of Subutex, a prescription recovery drug similar to methadone. But she got pregnant sooner than anticipated.She was afraid Zurii would have to go through withdrawal like Journii had. “It was a huge thing. I’d seen like five different doctors and they wouldn’t let me come off Subutex.”She called Lindsie Marsh at Brigid’s Path, who told her: “Honey, it’s OK, we’re here if you need us.”Just because someone was an addict doesn’t mean they can’t be a good motherDona CouchMarsh, a mother who had experienced addiction a decade earlier, knew intimately what Dona was going through because she had been there herself. “She believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself,” Dona told me.With support, Dona followed her doctor’s orders and had a healthy pregnancy. She and baby Zurii transitioned from the hospital to Brigid’s Path, where Zurii’s early days were much less disrupted than Journii’s had been. After 10 days, both mother and baby were able to go home together.“Just because someone was an addict doesn’t mean they can’t be a good mother,” Dona told me. “And it doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to have their children. Our little family is very important and I strive to make sure we’re doing the right thing, trying to set an example for my girls.”View image in fullscreenZurii (three months), Journii, Dona and Raridy, cuddle on the couch at home.By treating the dyad, both mother and baby, Maddie’s Place reports that an astounding 95% of the parents who came through their doors are now in recovery and have custody of their children.Yet translating that success into broader practice has proved difficult. As hospitals across the country experiment with new models for caring for infants with NAS, one of the most influential, and to some problematic, approaches has been Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC), a protocol that prioritizes soothing over medication.In 2014, Dr Matthew Grossman at Yale University formalized ESC as a treatment model designed to dramatically reduce the use of pharmaceuticals for newborn withdrawal and to encourage near-constant hands-on care. But hospitals remain ill-equipped: most lack the low-stimulation spaces these babies need, as well as the staffing to support mothers staying at their side.Some clinicians now worry the pendulum has perhaps swung too far. Jansson, the Johns Hopkins pediatrician and dyad-care specialist, argues that widespread adoption of ESC has led to the undermedication of certain newborns who would benefit from pharmacological support in their first months of life.View image in fullscreenDona embraces her daughter Raridy after a flag football game.A 2025 study found that more than 80% of NICUs now have policies referencing ESC, but only about half are putting those practices into effect – and only half of those allow mothers to room in with their infants. Even when hospitals want to adopt dyadic models, most simply do not have the staff, expertise or space to do so.Jansson supports the kind of care provided at Maddie’s Place, but, she told me, the economic argument is hard to sell: the savings – in future costs for foster care, juvenile detention, abuse, learning difficulties and maternal relapse – are real but long-term, while hospital budgets are short-term.The argument that Shaun Cross, CEO of Maddie’s Place, is taking to state and federal legislators is that pediatric transitional care facilities are more effective than the current hospital model. They are highly staffed and allow longer stays. Their peer team is formidable and made up of men and women who have lived through substance use, homelessness, incarceration, poverty, trauma and unemployment. This model fosters an inclusive, nonjudgmental community.Of course, this comes at a cost. And while Maddie’s Place has been extraordinarily successful at fundraising – garnering about $16m to date – not every facility has been so lucky.View image in fullscreenRaridy caresses Zurii at a flag football game.Some hope for funds came in 2018 when Congress passed the bipartisan Caring Recovery for Infants and Babies, or Crib Act, signed into law by Donald Trump that September, which allowed Medicaid to cover services provided by pediatric transitional care facilities. Only two states adopted the act.During the first Trump administration, Melania Trump visited Lily’s Place, and a mother from Brigid’s Path attended the State of the Union address. Several lawmakers have toured Maddie’s Place. But the spotlight has not translated into a sustainable funding model. Barbara Drennen’s Pediatric Interim Care Center in Washington recently lost their funding, in June. At Lily’s Place, funding has also been a problem.When I visited Brigid’s Path in Ohio, only one of its two nurseries was open. The facility had lost several grants and its state funding earlier that summer. Although Ohio had adopted the Crib Act to allow Medicaid reimbursement for residential care, the payments had not yet started. To bridge the gap, Brigid’s Path had to lay off nearly two dozen employees.Yet all three of the centers I visited offer a clear financial advantage: their costs are far lower than an NICU stay. Still, when the funds did arrive at Brigid’s Path, the per diem rate, $559, will cover only a fraction of the center’s costs, and represents a portion of the $7,200 hospitals receive for the same babies.Maddie’s Place has shown similar savings. When adding up the costs for care alone, the price per baby for a stay at Maddie’s Place is tens of thousands of dollars cheaper than the NICU; they estimate $44,000 less.View image in fullscreenZurii, Dona, Raridy, Dona’s husband, Darrel ,and Journii play on the couch at home.Izzie is really into Frozen right now, the animated children’s movie about Elsa, a snow princess with special powers she cannot control. The princess learns that only love will help her use her powers for good.Izzie likes to stand in the living room, wearing a blanket like Elsa’s cape, and fling her arms around singing: “Let it gooo!”“She’s so happy all the time, a little ball of love and joy,” Stephanie said with a smile.She had a few developmental issues. It took her a little longer than usual to crawl; balance and walking have been challenges. But she is otherwise healthy, vibrant, growing and learning.When I ask Stephanie what most people do not understand about addiction, she tells me that too many still think that just telling drug users to stop will help them.“When you’re using, you already feel worthless,” Stephanie said. “I felt like the world’s worst person when I finally asked for help.”When I press her about why Maddie’s Place has a 95% success rate – why mothers and fathers who go through the program still have their babies and are now living normal, happy lives – she says it is because Maddie’s Place is not just about the babies.View image in fullscreenIzzie is pushed on a swing at a park by her mom, Stephanie.“A lot of times our new staff come in here and they want to work with the babies. They want to love these babies back to life, which is great. But the dyad is just as important.”She pauses for a second.“The one thing I’ll scream so that everybody can hear me, is that we’re still humans. Just because we use, just because we were homeless, just because we couldn’t get clean while we were pregnant, does not make us any less of a human.”The biggest misconception, she adds, is that Maddie’s Place simply hands babies back to drug addicts.“That’s not it. We’re changing lives and encouraging them to love themselves. We see people come in here as one person and leave as a whole other person.”"

Laura and Kelly had been drinking prosecco. “I tried Beaujolais once,’ said Kelly. “Didn’t like it – a bit boring.”View image in fullscreenLaura, right, and Kelly, left, outside the No Sign Bar in SwanseaPhotograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianIn the 1970s in the UK, the “Beaujolais Nouveau Run” became modish, with motoring enthusiasts racing back from eastern France to London with the first cases of the new wine.By the 1980s, the wine became associated with City traders and the upwardly mobile. A poster for Beaujolais Nouveau can be seen in the beloved 1989“Yuppy Love” episode of Only Fools and Horseswhen Derek “Del Boy” Trotter falls through a bar flap in a bistro.Popularity waned in the 2000s but there are signs of a comeback. Global heating may have improved growing conditions in the area and the skill of a new breed of Beaujolais winemakers has led toit winning plauditswithcritics in Franceand farther afield.This week the supermarket Asda put out a poll claiming more than a quarter of British people planned to celebrate the day. The percentage may feel a little high, but the Radio 6 Music breakfast DJNick Grimshawannounced bright and early that a member of his team had taken the morning off to celebrate the moment.In Swansea, it never really went out of fashion. It is thought the city’s love affair with Beaujolais Nouveau Day began at the No Sign Wine Bar because one of its former owners, the exWalesrugby union captain Clem Thomas, used to have a house in France and would bring Beaujolais back to Wales.View image in fullscreenMolly Dowrick: ‘Some offices completely close for the day.

But what of those who like, or used to like, a cocktail? Those who enjoy the heady, medicinal kick of a spirit, but don’t want any of the booze?Spirit is so easily defined in alcohol terms, but what about when you’re not distilling something alcoholic from the ingredients? As it’s defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (the website; I don’t have one knocking around the house), a spirit is a “strong distilled alcoholic liquor used for drinking”. So, part of how I’m defining a non-alcoholic spirit will be first based on its strength and second those elements that need to be distilled to create it. (Non-alcoholic brandEverleafnotes, however, that extracting from specific ingredients can be most effectively done in different ways, either by distillation or by grinding an ingredient down.) I’d also argue that a spirit can be identified in how you choose to enjoy it: if it can be enjoyed with a mixer, it’s a spirit; and if it can be shaken or mixed into a cocktail or enjoyed on the rocks, it’s definitely a spirit. By all those definitions, I’m talking liqueurs, aperitifs and amaros here.Mother Root, a ginger, chilli and honey mix, is one of my absolute favourite drams to drink in any of those ways: top it up with soda water for an easy highball, or add a squeeze of lime to make a non-alcoholic Moscow mule. The fiery ginger is enough to perk you up in the morning and smack you out of a hangover, and I love it when ginger productsactuallytaste of ginger.Then there’s the herby citrusBotivo, whose success is testament to the growing popularity of non-alcoholic options. Pretty much every chic hotel bar and up-and-coming wine bar now stocks this smart yellow bottle, as are even some pubs. It’s just the thing to scratch the itch of a botanical spirit lover, and it works particularly well with anything elderflowery.I’m also very intrigued by a recent discovery fromSylva Labs– aged, non-alcoholic spirits made using British fruit wood and established by Ben Branson, the founder ofSeedlip(heard of ’em?). The first glance made me think of just-pressed apple juice, but when I took a swig the palate was smoky and forest floor-y. I couldn’t help but imagine it stirred into a Manhattan-style cocktail in lieu of whisky, perhaps with a squeeze of plum juice.Four nolo spirits that are worth a puntMother Root Ginger£28.95 (50cl) Sainsbury’s, 0%.

An unexpected stop on a trip to Iran in the 1970s gifted Thomas a chance meeting with a Persian doctor and his breakfast: fresh labneh with soft, still-warm lavash. It was a revelation. On his return, Thomas got to work creating a fresh cheese from goat’s milk (similar to chèvre) and from cow’s milk, marinated and preserved in oil, with an extra “t” to avert confusion with the Greek-style feta, that’s still being utilised by cooks and chefs right across the world.Persian fetta is a shapeshifter, capable of remaining both firm and steadfast when crumbled across the top of a platter or salad, and of yielding to a soft, velvety cream, enhancing all manner of dishes from pasta to pesto to whipped dips andschmears– and, of course, as a topping for that Aussie cafe staple, avocado toast.When cafe culture ground to a halt during the rolling Covid lockdowns, Persian fetta producers were left with bucketloads (literally) that would normally have been used by the city’s cafes, so instead they offered them to independent grocers and supermarkets. Stuck at home with my bucket of cheese, I’d plonk some into anything savoury I was testing – and I mean anything.In this recipe from my bookSalad for Days, I incorporate that fetta funk into a creamy Balkan white bean dip known aspapula, which I first came across viaOliaHercules. Adding cheese to the dip pumps up the flavour, and whip it into the kind of creamy bed we’ve come to see (and love) under medleys of roast veg, from modern restaurants and modern cooks (such as Meera Sodha ina recent Guardian recipe).Blanketed with strips of silky, crimson roast capsicum, this dish is packed full of beany, plant-forward protein that’s surprisingly substantial, whether you’re serving it for a decadent brunch, lunch, or light dinner, especially if it’s all mopped up with soft bread (lavash,pide, pitta or the like).If you can’t find butter beans, any tinned or jarred white bean will work. Putting the garlic inside the capsicum while it’s roasting helps to flavour the pepper and keeps the garlic from burning, but you could use a quarter-teaspoon of garlic powder instead. And if you can’t find marinated feta where you are, you can totally use a block of soft feta (such as a Danish-style one) for this, instead.Heat the oven to 220C (200 fan)/425F/gas 7. Grab four to six medium red peppers (I go with one per person), lop off the tops and then halve them lengthways. Pull out the seeds and pith. Oil the capsicum halves, then pop them cut side down on a lined tray, tucking four garlic cloves underneath. Roast for 35-40 minutes, until the capsicums are blistered and browning and the garlic is buttery inside.To make the papula, blitz 400g cooked and drained butter beans, with a tablespoon of sherry vinegar, 60ml olive oil and a good pinch of flaky sea salt, then add two-thirds of a jar of marinated fetta (or 200g soft Danish-style feta; reserve the rest of the block for garnish) and blitz again until smooth. Once the garlic is cooked and cool enough to touch, squish the flesh into the bean mixture, blitz again and season to taste.Once the peppers are out of the oven, cover them with a second (inverted) oven tray or a few sheets of foil, then leave for 15 minutes to steam and relax. When they are cool enough to handle, slip off and discard the skins, then slice the cheeks into thin slivers with a sharp knife.Wrap the soft bread in foil and pop into the still-hot oven to warm through while the capsicum cools.To serve, scoop the whipped papula on to a large platter in undulating waves. Arrange the pepper slices on top in bright red, glossy strips. Dress with the tray juices, sprinkle with a good handful of finely chopped parsley, then blob or crumble on the last of the feta. Sprinkle with some sweet or smoky paprika, a handful of roasted almonds (roughly chopped, flakes or slivers), an extra drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of salt flakes. Pop the warm bread nearby and encourage everyone to scoop and dip to their heart’s content.Alice Zaslavsky is a Guardian Australia food columnistExplore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkBeans, pulses and legumesFoodCheeseStarterSnacksVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Here are some of the best ways to react when stress hormones start coursing through your body ...Sarah PhillipsThu 20 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 00.01 ESTShareMost people contend with stress in some element of their lives. What can you do when you are overwhelmed by it and your coping mechanisms no longer seem to work? Here, psychotherapists share their techniques for managing in the moment, seeking help, and minimising everyday stress.Recognise the signs“When we are stressed, our body undergoes physiological changes as part of our fight or flight,” says Hannah Stebbings, an integrative therapist atPriory hospital Barnt Greenin Birmingham. “We get increased heart rates, and then the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline get released, and they flood our bodies.” This causes physical symptoms, such as headaches or issues with the digestive system, and then there is the emotional aspect: “You might notice that you’re feeling irritable, anxious, you’ve got low mood, lack of motivation: these are key signs that you are under a lot of stress.” This can mean people withdraw and avoid socialising, “or you might be a bit more snappy with your friends, partner, children, colleagues.”“Everyone experiences stress,” says Lauren Baird, a psychotherapist from Glasgow, “whether it is a boss that triggers you or financial stress. Even if you eliminate the stressor, you are still going to have stress hormones that course through your body and need to be discharged. What is important is how we respond.” She gives the example of her three-year-old having a tantrum, which causes her to feel stressed. If she can get out for a vigorous 20-minute walk, this will help her to feel better. “Dealing with the stressor, the problem itself, is different from dealing with the stress, which is the physiological response in your body,” Baird says. Stress that isn’t dealt with will live on in your body, she adds. “I talk a lot about nervous system regulation as a core foundation. People think stress has become a part of who they are, but they aren’t tuned into their bodies.”Know when to get helpView image in fullscreenTalking therapies can be accessed via your GP.Photograph: Natalia Lebedinskaia/Getty ImagesIf you feel overwhelmed by stress, it is important to get professional help, says Stebbings. “There are NHS talking therapies for anxiety and depression. These can be accessed via your GP, which is always a good place to start if you are ever in need of support. TheHub of Hopeonline directory created by the charityChasing the Stigmais a really valuable tool, signposting people towards relevant mental health services in their area. If someone is experiencing a mental health crisis and does not feel safe, they should call 999 immediately.”If you can’t access therapy, speak to a friendUnfortunately, therapy is not always accessible. If this is the case, find someone you trust to talk to. Perhaps a relative, friend or colleague, who is “willing to sit and have a coffee and a conversation: that will do wonders for your mental health,” says Niro Feliciano, a psychotherapist in Wilton, Connecticut.Aside from helping you to unload your worries, social connections also help us to de-stress, says Baird: “We are more isolated than ever, and we know that this causes significant stress. Being social creatures, we really need connection to thrive.”Focus on your breathView image in fullscreenActivate your parasympathetic system …Photograph: Tim Robberts/Getty ImagesWhen you are in a moment of intense stress, “breathwork is really important,” says Feliciano, who teaches the importance of longer exhalation for emotional regulation. This stimulates the vagus nerve, a key part of the parasympathetic system, which regulates involuntary functions like breathing and heart rate. “We have powerfulscientific evidenceto show that breathing affects emotion and it also frees up our centre of fear and aggression, the amygdala. It takes us out of that processing centre and brings us back into the prefrontal cortex, where we can logically think through things and we have better executive functioning. All of that shuts down when we’re stressed.”“The 4/7/8 breathing technique is a quick way of activating your parasympathetic nervous system, which is our soothe system,” says Stebbings. “Take a deep breath for four, hold your breath for seven seconds, then breathe out as if you’re blowing out candles for eight.”Tell yourself you are having a feeling“When we are stressed, the brain jumps to worst case scenarios,” says Stebbings. She uses a technique called “cognitive restructuring” with clients to challenge those unhelpful thoughts. When you have a negative thought, Stebbings advises to ask yourself, “What is the evidence for and against this thought?” and then reframe it by looking at it in a more balanced way. “Ask yourself, ‘What would you say to a friend if they were feeling like this?’”Something else Stebbings uses, including in her own life, is called “I’m having a thought that …”. “When we notice we are feeling stressed, we say to ourselves, ‘I’m having a thought that … I can’t cope’, for example. This small phrase lets you step back and it creates distance between yourself and the thought.”Make a list“Often, when people are stressed, they are trying to remember everything that they have to do and this wastes a lot of neuro energy,” says Feliciano. “When we prioritise what we see on a list, it feels a little less overwhelming than if we’re trying to remember those things, and then when we cross them off, we get a hit of dopamine, which affects our motivation and productivity.”Listen to musicMusic evokes emotion and can calm and alter mood by soothing our nervous system, says Stebbings: “Music serves as a powerful tool to reduce stress. We can listen to a song and it might take us back to a happy memory.” She also recommends listening to meditation music or a guided visualisation: “That can help to reduce stress rapidly.”Splash your face – or have a cold showerView image in fullscreenShock your body into a different state.Photograph: Anton Vierietin/Getty ImagesCold water can be helpful if you are feeling panicky to shock the body into a different state, explains Stebbings: “It activates the parasympathetic nervous system, so after the initial shock, your body naturally shifts into a calming mode, which slows down the heart rate and helps you to feel more grounded. Second, it breaks the stress cycle. Cold exposure gives the brain a strong sensory signal that can interrupt spiralling thoughts, worry and overwhelm.” You can also achieve this by holding an ice cube in your hand or splashing your face with water. You could even have a cold shower – Stebbings suggests building this up slowly, starting with a few seconds of cold, then gradually progressing to a minute or two. “Cold water therapy teaches your nervous system to cope with discomfort in a controlled way. Over time, it reduces stress sensitivity, increases emotional stability and gives you a reliable physical tool to calm your system when your mind feels overloaded.”Think about your gutWhat kind of diet can help to reduce stress? “Cut down on processed foods and sugar,” says Feliciano. “Eat the rainbow: fruits, vegetables, whole grains.” Women over 40 should look at their protein intake, she adds.“Balanced meals can really help to stabilise blood sugars and your mood,” says Stebbings. “Everyone thinks that serotonin is all in your brain, but your gut actually holds about 95% of your serotonin. What you put in your body is going to have an impact, because the vagus nerve is an axis between your mental health and your gut health.”Prioritise sleep hygiene“Sleep is like your body’s reset button,” says Stebbings. “You need to be getting seven to nine hours of sleep a night.” Try to implement a regular sleep routine to achieve this. “Go to bed around the same time. You need to have that consistent sleep routine, because poor sleep amplifies stress hormones.”Move or shake your bodyView image in fullscreenMoving releases endorphins.Photograph: DGLimages/Getty Images“I teach all my clients to actually meet the survival (fight/flight) energy where it’s at and give themselves a right good shake like a dog shaking off water,” says Baird. “This helps to release some of that pent-up stress.”“Moving releases endorphins,” says Stebbings. “Even if you just do a quick five minutes of star jumps, moving your body, shaking your body, just getting that movement, really promotes healthy emotions and reduces stress.”Consider your phone use“Screens and social media are part of the reason we are burning out quicker,” says Feliciano. “Because we get such high hits of dopamine from screens, the body is trying to bring it down to physiologically healthy levels, and to do that, it has to actually bring it quite low to compensate. In that low state is where we are experiencing more symptoms of anxiety and depression. I think that is why we’re becoming more reactive: we don’t feel like we have the strength or resilience to deal with things because there is a battle in our neurochemistry, and it’s related to our screen usage.”How can you get around this? “Put your phone on grayscale mode,” says Feliciano. “That will not give you the hits of dopamine that you want. I had some student interns do that, and one said, ‘I got mad, because all of a sudden it was boring.’ I said, ‘Well, we would call that withdrawal.’ I think a big piece of our mood regulation is setting those digital boundaries.”Bairdrecommends the screentimeapp Opal to limit phone usage. “It is also helpful to think about why you are scrolling. What purpose does that serve?” She says that people use phones, alcohol or food to distract from dealing with stressful emotions. When you have identified what you are scrolling for, you can look to create a healthier relationship with your phone. A good starting point is not having it in your bedroom at night, says Baird: “An hour before bed you shouldn’t be on your phone, in terms of the blue light and the impact it has on sleep. Realistically, I say to my clients to have absolutely no screen time half an hour before bed.”Be mindfulView image in fullscreen‘Be present in the here and now.’Photograph: Halfpoint Images/Getty Images“Instead of worrying about the past or thinking about the future, try to be really mindful and present in what you’re doing in the here and now,” says Stebbings.Ask yourself if you have made time for anything that you enjoy, says Feliciano. “And do you actually have the motivation to do those things? If I’m talking to someone and they’re looking at things in the past that have brought them joy, but there’s no desire for them in the moment, then we’re looking at something that may look more like clinical depression, in which case we need a bigger intervention.”Get creativeBaird says taking up a creative hobby is a brilliant stress reliever: “Art, music, writing, dancing in your kitchen – any kind of creative activity.” But, she warns: “It is really important that it is not about creating something that you can put out into the world; you’re not creating it for the purpose of achieving something. You’re just creating it for the process itself.”Have a laughView image in fullscreenSpend time with people who make you laugh.Photograph: Tim Robberts/Getty Images“Go see comedy, watch something that makes you properly belly laugh, or spend time with people who make you laugh uncontrollably,” says Baird, adding, “It’s got to be deep and genuine.” Sharing laughs with friends increases your connection with them and creates a physiological release that completes the stress cycle, she says.Set boundariesChristmas can be a fairly frazzling time of year. To avoid burnout, Feliciano, who has written a whole book –All Is Calmish: How to Feel Less Frantic and More Festive During the Holidays– on the subject, advises to ask yourself what are your priorities this season. “Once we have that list, it becomes a little easier to say no to the things that are either going to make us feel depleted, exhausted or resentful. Pick the three things you really want to guard and be present for,” Feliciano says, then decline anything that will threaten your enjoyment of them. This can be hard, she admits: “I still fight this. I’m a therapist, and I have all these tools, but the struggle is real. What people will be surprised at is that we can do less and still feel joyful. Actually, if we do less, we might even feel more joyful.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Thrown off barges at the end of the second world war and forgotten about, thousands of munitions have become matted together over the years. They form a rusting carpet on the shallow, muddy seafloor of the Bay of Lübeck in the western tip of the Baltic Sea.Over the decades, the Nazi arsenal was ignored and forgotten about. A growing number of tourists flocked to the sandy beaches and calm waters for jetskiing, kite surfing and amusement parks. Beneath the surface, the weapons decayed.A shore crab in a video taken by a submersible.Photograph: DeepSea Monitoring/GeomarWhen the first scientists went looking to see what they were doing to the ecosystem, “some of us expected to see a desert, with nothing living there because it was all poisoned”, says Andrey Vedenin, from the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt am Main, who led a team of scientists to catalogue for the first time what life is able to survive on underwater weaponry.What they found astonished them. Vedenin remembers his colleagues shouting with surprise when the submersible first sent the images back. “It was a great moment,” he says.Thousands of sea creatures had made their homes amid the munitions, creating a regenerated ecosystem more populous than the sea floor around it.This underwater metropolis was testament to the tenacity of life. “It is actually astonishing how much life we find in places that are supposed to be toxic and dangerous,” he says.More than 40 starfish had piled on to one exposed chunk of TNT. They were living on metal shells, fuse pockets and transport cases just centimetres from its explosive filling. Fish, crabs, sea anemones and mussels were all found on the old munitions. “You could compare it with a coral reef in terms of the amount of fauna that was there,” says Vedenin.Video footage of crabs, starfish and sea anemones on munitions on the sea floorThe munitions host a regenerated ecosystem of fish, crabs, sea anemones and mussels. ‘A lot of species that are otherwise rare or declining, such as the Baltic cod, are thriving,’ says Andrey VedeninAn average of more than 40,000 animals were living on every square metre of the munitions, scientistswrote in their paperon the discovery, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment in September. The surrounding area was much less diverse, with only 8,000 individuals on every square metre.It is ironic that “things that are meant to kill everything are attracting so much life,” says Vedenin. “You can see how nature adapts after a catastrophic event such as the second world war and how, in some way, life finds its way back to the most dangerous places.”What the researchers found in the Bay of Lübeck reveals a surprising truth about how underwater life can repurpose human debris.Map of the Baltic Sea, showing the Bay of Lübeck and a few German townsTypically“urban sprawl”is considered bad for nature, but underwater, the script can be flipped. This is because every day, an average of1m dumper trucksof rock, gravel, clay and silt are removed from the marine environment. These hard surfaces provide homes for corals, sponges, barnacles and mussels, as well as nursing grounds for fish.Before the war, this area of the Baltic Sea was full of boulders and rocky outcrops, but virtually all of them were removed for construction, to build homes and roads.Things that are meant to kill everything are attracting so much life … You can see how nature adaptsAndrey VedeninArtificial structures such as shipwrecks, offshore windfarms, oil rigs and pipelines can provide substitutes, replacing some of the lost habitat. This study shows that munitions could be similarly beneficial – the bloom of life on those in the Bay of Lübeck is likely to be repeated elsewhere.Between 1946 and 1948,1.6m tonnes of arms were dumpedoff the German coast. Thousands of people loaded them in barges; some were dropped in designated sites, others just thrown overboard en route. This is the first time researchers have documented how marine life has responded.View image in fullscreenThe seabed of the North and Baltic Seas off Germany are littered with munitions from the first and second world wars, such as shells once fired from German warships.Photograph: SeaTerraBut the phenomenon is not restricted to weapons. In the US, decommissioned oil and gas structures have turned into coral reefs; theRigs-to-Reefs programmeencourages authorities to leave the clean and stable structures underwater for the environmental benefits. Sunken ships from the first world war have become habitats for wildlife along the Potomac River in Maryland.These places become even more important for wildlife as the oceans are increasingly denuded by fishing, bottom trawling and anchoring. Sunken ships and weapons dump sites “essentially act as protected areas – they are not national parks, but almost any kind of human activity is prohibited”, says Vedenin. “Therefore a lot of species that are otherwise rare or declining, such as the Baltic cod, are thriving.”Bird migration is changing. What does this reveal about our planet? – visualisedRead moreAnywhere where military conflict has occurred in the past 100 years, surrounding seas are usually strewn with munitions, says Vedenin. Millions of tonnes of explosive material lie in our oceans.The locations of these munitions are poorly documented, partly because of national borders, classified military information and the fact that records are buried in historic archives. They pose an explosion and security risk, as well as risk from the ongoing release of toxic chemicals.In the 1990s, academics started warning about the“danger from the deep”, and the need to remove potentially explosive material. Pressure to remove the weaponry also came from a growing demand to use the seabed for something else, such as dredging or offshore infrastructure such as windfarms, cables, and oil and gas pipelines.A black goby (Gobius niger), which feeds on the small crustaceans, fish, molluscs and worms living on the munitions in the Baltic Sea.Photograph: DeepSea Monitoring/ GeomarAsGermanyand other countries embark on removing these relics, scientists hope to protect the ecosystems that have formed around them. In the Bay of Lübeck munitions are already being removed.“We should replace these metal carcasses left from munitions with some safer, some non-dangerous objects, like maybe concrete structures,” says Vedenin.He now hopes that what happens in Lübeck sets a precedent for replacing material after munitions removal elsewhere – because even the most destructive weaponry can become scaffolding for new life.View image in fullscreenTank tracks that have become home to coral off Asan beach, Guam, came from US equipment lost during the invasion of the Pacific island in 1944.Photograph: National Park Service via GuamFind moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsOceansThe aftermathSecond world warBiodiversityMarine lifeWildlifeConservationGermanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why was his reign of terror allowed to go on – and why hasn’t there been a public inquiry?Simon HattenstoneThu 20 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 04.53 ESTShareWhen I met Kevin Young in 2012 he was in his early 50s, handsome, charismatic, smart – and utterly broken. The moment he started talking about Medomsley detention centre he was in tears.Young was born in Newcastle, in 1959. At two, he was taken into care, and his parents were convicted of wilful neglect. At eight, at a school in Devon, he was sexually abused by the gardener. At 14, at St Camillus, a Catholic residential school in Yorkshire, he was sexually assaulted by the headteacher, James Bernard Littlewood. But none of this compared with his experience at Medomsley, a youth detention centre in north-east England.He was sent there in 1977, aged 17, after being convicted of receiving stolen property – his brother had given him a watch, the first he had ever owned. The police asked if he knew where it had come from. No, he said. Could it possibly have been stolen, they asked. He thought about it. Well, yes, possibly. He was sentenced to three months’ detention.For many young men, a short sentence became a life sentenceThe morning after he arrived at Medomsley, he was picked out by prison officer and caterer Neville Husband to work in the kitchen. Husband was a skilled predator. First, he checked Young’s files to see if he was likely to be visited by family. Second, he checked to see if he was a “reliable” victim. “A reliable victim is someone who has already been abused to the point where, if they do speak out, who on earth is going to believe them?” Young told me and my late colleague, theformer Guardian prison correspondent Eric Allison. “And who on earth is going to believe Kevin Young, the pauper’s son, who has been in and out of care, who’s a knife-wielding thug, a bully?” That is how a number of care home reports described Young, even though he told us he had been a quiet, over-obedient boy. “The truth is, nobody would have believed me.”Young was raped repeatedly, tied up and ligatured around the neck. “It was the worst of the worst. I thought I was going to be killed,” he said. “I was told by Husband that you could easily be found hanged at Medomsley, and that six boys had already hanged themselves that year.” It wasn’t true, but how was Young to know? He stayed silent.View image in fullscreenKevin Young, who was abused while in the Medomsley detention centre as a young teenager.Photograph: Gary CaltonHusband, who was married with one child, took Young to his own home, just outside the prison gates. “I was blindfolded and made to lie on the stairs. Then three or four others raped me as well. I could see them from the bottom of the blindfold. A rope was put around my neck and turned till I passed out. Husband was an expert at it. He was a big, stocky, powerful man.”On 17 June 1977, a day before his 18th birthday, Kevin Young was released and went straight to the nearest police station. “I explained to the officer that I’d just been released from Medomsley, where I’d been subjected to a constant series of assaults by one of the officers and others I couldn’t identify,” he said. “I showed him the marks on my neck where I’d been ligatured the night before. I was told it was a criminal offence to make such allegations against a prison officer because I was on licence. They were basically threatening to take me back to Medomsley, so I scarpered pretty quick.”When Husband retired from the prison service in 1990 he was awarded the imperial service medal, for long and meritorious service. In 1994, he was inducted as a minister by the United Reformed church. In 2003, he was convicted of 10 counts of indecent assault and one count of rape against five teenagers at Medomsley, including Young. Husband was initially sentenced to eight years in prison. In 2005, he was charged with four further offences and his sentence extended to 10 years. But he was released in 2009, having served barely half his time. A year later he died of natural causes.Last week, a special investigation by the prisons and probation ombudsman (PPO) for England and Wales, Adrian Usher, concluded he was “possibly the most prolific sex offender in British history”.View image in fullscreenThe late Eric Allison, former Guardian prison correspondent, who did groundbreaking reporting on the Medomsley scandal.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAllison and I first wrote about Husband and those he abused ina piece published 13 years ago. The headline was A true horror story: The abuse of teenage boys in a detention centre. But we didn’t know the half of it. Medomsley was run along military lines, with a “short, sharp, shock” approach to punishment. Detainees were often sent there for trivial offences, and physical and sexual abuse continued for three decades, on an industrial scale.After Husband was convicted, there was some coverage in the media – mainly local papers. But the story was soon forgotten. After all, these boys had been sent to a detention centre. It was presumed they deserved a short, sharp shock, if not quite as shocking as it turned out. When we wrote about three of Husband’s victims in 2012, it was the first time they had told their stories to a national newspaper. Each one told us they felt dead inside.Our story led to an investigation by Durham police known as Operation Seabrook, which lasted a decade, with 2,077 former inmates alleging abuse by Husband and others at Medomsley. Operation Seabrook led to Usher’s investigation, Operation Deerness, which considered how the abuse was allowed to carry on for so long and what opportunities were missed to stop it.When the Deerness report waspublished last week, all the British media covered it. Husband’s face was plastered across TV channels and newspapers. The findings were horrifying. There have now been 2,852 allegations of physical or sexual abuse at Medomsley. Of the 549 sexual abuse allegations, 388 were made against Husband, 33 were made against Husband’s colleague, “store man” Leslie Johnston, which leaves 128 allegations of sexual abuse against people unnamed.I had a request to meet a victim in person. He wanted to tell me that Operation Seabrook had saved his lifeBoys were not only abused at Medomsley, but taken to a local church, an amateur dramatics society and a farm to be raped by multiple people. Two boys died at Medomsley. A number of former inmates, known in detention centres as “trainees”, went to Durham police straight after their release to allege they had been sexually abused. In most cases, they were told not to make a formal complaint unless they wanted to find themselves back at the detention centre. Occasionally, allegations were handed back to Medomsley to investigate, and the institution always, unsurprisingly, cleared itself.The stories in the report are stomach-churning. Usher, a former police officer with decades of experience, was sickened. “I’ve never seen the level of damage that has been done to these, at the time, young men,” he told me. “Some of them have been unable to form human relationships, even friendships, never mind intimate relationships; have been unable to hold down jobs, have become agoraphobic and had a deep, persistent mistrust of authority and the state. For many young men, a short sentence became a life sentence.” The prison, the Ministry of Justice, the police and the Home Office are all held accountable in Usher’s report for failing to stop Husband and his fellow abusers.Yet the victims of Medomsley believe this report is a sop, and that it should not have been commissioned. They say that, however good a job the PPO has done, the report could never provide the answers they might get at a public inquiry, where witnesses can be compelled to give evidence under oath. Only with a public inquiry, they say, would they be able to find out the answers to their myriad questions about why the abuse was allowed to continue for three decades. At best, they believe the report is a small step towards justice. At worst, they believe it is a distraction.View image in fullscreenMedomsley detention centre in County Durham.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesMedomsley opened in 1961 and closed in 1987. It could hold up to 130 detainees. Detention centres were tougher institutions than borstals, which were founded on the principle of rehabilitation rather than punishment. Trainees were supposed to be aged 17 to 21, but the PPO’s report acknowledges it held boys as young as 14. There were 17 allegations of sexual abuse made to Operation Seabrook for the period between 1961 and 1969. Husband began working at Medomsley in 1969, and between that year and 1987 there were 532 allegations.Husband’s reign of abuse could easily have been stopped. Eight years before Young was detained, Husband was arrested at Portland borstal in Dorset,charged with importing pornography. The material included sadomasochistic images of teenage boys. Husband admitted showing the material to boys in his care, but argued that he was conducting research into homosexuality. The police took no further action. Details of that arrest were written on top of his employment record and followed him throughout his career. But Medomsley nonetheless employed him; he moved there the year of his arrest.In 1989, two years after Medomsley closed, Johnston, a close friend of Husband and a member of the same Freemasons lodge, was charged with sexually assaulting a trainee, Mark Park. He admitted to the assault and further admitted to gross indecency. He stated these acts included oral sex and mutual masturbation, but denied any acts of buggery. Park said he had been given to Johnston by Husband, but no action was taken against the latter. Johnston pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault. He was fined £250 and received nine months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years. It was another 14 years until Husband was convicted and 16 years until Johnston was imprisoned.Astonishingly, after Medomsley, Young managed to rebuild his life. He briefly joined the punk group Angelic Upstarts, then ran a number of successful businesses providing security for property. At one point, he told me and Allison, he was worth almost £2m. Then in 1996, 19 years after leaving Medomsley, he bumped into Husband. Young and his girlfriend were chasing a couple of store robbers in the centre of York, where Young now lived, when he skidded into a man of the church near York Minster. “He was there with his full carry-on, his big hat and all his gear. When I banged him in the chest, it knocked the wind out of him, and as I was falling backwards, his spit was coming down on me. I looked up and there he was. And in that split second I was back 20 years ago, with him on top of me.” By then, Husband was a minister. We asked Young how he was sure it was him? He said he could tell by the spit. “I could taste him. He spat all over me and humiliated me. He opened my mouth and spat into it time and time again.”After this, Young had a breakdown. He lost his money, his business, his girlfriend and his home. He started to drink and became addicted to drugs. He moved into a barn in the middle of nowhere, spoke to no one and gave up on life. Two years later, when he was living in a bedsit, the police tracked him down and put a note through his door asking if he would give evidence about the sexual abuse he had experienced at St Camillus. For months, he ignored the message, but eventually agreed to talk to the police. He told them that what had happened at the school was bad, but that Medomsley was far worse.View image in fullscreenAmong the Medomsley staff convicted were (from left) Christopher Onslow, Neville Husband and Alexander Flavell.Composite: Guardian Design;  North News; Tom Wilkinson; Owen Humphreys/PA;  Mirrorpix; Trinity Mirror/Getty ImagesThe police said they had been after Husband for years. He had recently been the subject of complaints about the abuse of boys and girls in his congregation while working as a minister at two churches in Gateshead, but the parents involved had not wanted to pursue the matter. When his office was later raided, sex aids were found in his drawers and images of child abuse on his computer. Husband often filmed his abuse. Young was taken to a safe house in York where he was shown a film on an 8mm projector of a teenage boy with a rubber covering over his head, being choked. It was him.Young’s evidence helped secure the conviction of St Camillus headteacher Littlewood (for cruelty and sex offences) and then of Husband in 2003. Although he became a leading campaigner against child sexual abuse, he never recovered. After Husband’s conviction, he and other victims sued for compensation, and the Home Office fought every allegation. At one point, a doctor was brought forward in court to claim Young was genetically predisposed to being abused. Young received £94,000 in 2009 to compensate for his suffering and lost fortune. He told us he had spent £40,000 fighting his case. When we interviewed him in 2012 he was living in a shed at the bottom of a friend’s garden.Hedied of cancer in 2021, aged 62, having been told the one thing he wanted, a public inquiry, wouldn’t happen. Despite the compensation, there had been no public apology to the abuse victims. In 2010, the then justice minister Jack Straw said: “The terms of the agreement did not include an apology.”Richard Hall was sent to Medomsley just before Christmas 1979, after pleading guilty to being carried in a stolen car. He was another classic Husband victim. His mother was a sex worker and his father a pimp, and he was briefly placed with foster parents in 1963 before moving from one care home to another. At 12, he had been in 15 homes, and frequently physically or sexually abused. Another “reliable” victim. A week after arriving at Medomsley he was tapped on the shoulder by Husband and told: “You are working for me.” The abuse began almost immediately.On one occasion, Husband was about to rape him when he was interrupted by the arrival of Hall’s friend, Martin Wasnidge, another young inmate. Hall was convinced Wasnidge was also abused by Husband; he once saw Husband groping him.When Husband was investigated, before his trial in 2003, Wasnidge was questioned by police as a possible victim. He denied being abused. During the trial, Wasnidge hanged himself in prison and Hall learned of his friend’s death as he stepped out of the witness box. The news left him guilt-ridden, because he was the one who had told police that Wasnidge had been abused. “If I hadn’t done that, he’d still be alive,” Hall said. He believed Wasnidge denied it because he was ashamed.Hall began to drink heavily after his release from Medomsley. At one point, he estimates he was drinking 24 cans of beer a day. By 2012, he was down to 12 cans a day, four days a week. He told us he thought about killing himself every day. One of the things he found most devastating was that staff at Medomsley knew about Husband and kept silent. “Some of them are still employed by the state, others are drawing their pensions,” Hall said. “Do they not feel any shame?”Last week, I texted him to ask how he felt about the report. “It’s a good, fair report, but we still need a public inquiry. I’m just glad the world knows what went on in that hellhole.” I asked if he would like to chat. He said he would rather not dredge it all back up because he was in a bad way.View image in fullscreenBoys at Medomsley would try to break their own bones to get away.Photograph: Elliot Michael/MirrorpixThe sexual abuse was so extreme at Medomsley that it is easy to ignore the physical abuse. But the PPO’s report documents the full horror. Sometimes detainees were assaulted by officers on their arrival at Medomsley and in the presence of police officers, usually for failing to address the officer as “Sir”. Detainees regularly arrived at the local hospital with broken noses, arms and legs. One boy had a shattered skull. Another presented with ruptured kidneys. A nurse became concerned after three detainees were admitted with nephritis, inflammation of the kidney usually caused by infection. She discussed it with a colleague and said all the boys had a “quiet demeanour”. The colleague explained that the kidney damage was not nephritis, but the result of rabbit punches to the kidney, saying it was common knowledge that staff were physically assaulting detainees.Boys would jump off walls, trying to break their bones so they would get admitted to hospital and away from Medomsley. In the report, one former detainee says: “I saw other inmates break their arms or legs … One would brace his arms against something and get other lads to kick his arm. I also saw lads jump off a bunk on to someone’s leg to smash it. I heard it break. When someone managed to break a bone, they were taken out and not seen again.”Two boys died in quick succession at the detention centre in the early 1980s. Eighteen-year-old Ian Shackleton, a diabetic with special educational needs who had been sentenced to three months, died in September 1981. David Caldwell, an asthmatic who couldn’t read or write, died in January 1982. Shackleton’s medication had not been sent with him to the detention centre and he was then prescribed a different type of insulin. Soon after, he fell into a diabetic coma, developed septicaemia, went into cardiac arrest and died. At his inquest, the coroner gave a verdict of misadventure, saying: “You should not blame anyone.”Caldwell was also 18 and sentenced to three months in Medomsley. On 8 January 1982, he said he had a sore throat and was given antibiotics. Later that day he took part in “organised sport” and was ordered to jog around a games area. Caldwell complained of being cold afterwards. There was snow on the ground. On 10 January, Caldwell took part in PE and was instructed to walk around the perimeter fence. Again, there was snow on the ground. The following day, Caldwell reported to the hospital officer with a bad chest. He was given medication and excused from physical activity. On 12 January, he was admitted to the hospital wing, diagnosed with an acute episode of asthma. That evening, he died. In February 1982, an inquest concluded that his death was a result of natural causes. His family said the death was due to neglect.Like the other men Allison and I met, Steve’s life had been reduced to Medomsley. He didn’t have the mental space to think of much else. He didn’t want to use his real name because he was ashamed of what had happened to him and thought neighbours on his estate would think less of him if they knew. He still wants to use a pseudonym today for the same reason. In 2012, he lived surrounded by CCTV cameras – seven of them. Today, the cameras have gone, but he’s still paranoid and agoraphobic.In 2012, Steve told us a horribly familiar story – a long line of care homes, different degrees of abuse, but nothing compared with Medomsley. He was sent there for stealing a coat from a car. “I know I did wrong, but it was a winter’s night and it was freezing. I didn’t break into the car – the window was open.” He was 16.He says Husband seemed different from the other officers – he was funny, friendly, and put them at ease. Then he abused them. And the longer the abuse went on, the worse it got. Steve says the sexual and physical abuse were inseparable. “He put my hand in a hot pidi – a metal pie dish – and pushed my hand down as he fondled me.” Did other officers see any of this? “He had a monopoly in the kitchen. You weren’t allowed to go in there. Officers had to ask him to go in.”Every officer knew about it. They joked about it and laughed about itBut he says the other officers knew what Husband was up to. “Nobody would say it was happening to them, yet it was the talk of the place. You’d get comments off the officers: ‘What have you been up to with Husband?’ ‘You’re one of his boys?’.” At Husband’s trial, one officer said: “Husband used to keep one boy behind in the kitchen at night. We always felt sorry for that boy.”Who was the governor when Steve was there? “Tim Newell. Any decent governor wouldn’t have allowed Husband to do half the things he allowed.” Such as? “Taking boys out of the gate. It just wouldn’t be done. Newell says he didn’t have a clue about the abuse, that it was the fault of other officers for not telling him.” Does he believe Newell didn’t know about it? “No! Every officer knew about it. They joked about it and laughed about it. And then there’s James Millar Reid, the governor who killed himself. He was the governor just before Newell.”Millar Reid was governor at Medomsley from 1976 to 1978, the period during which Kevin Young was abused. In 2013, Young told the Mirror: “I’m ­positive he was in the room when I was being [sexually] abused by guards.” At the beginning of September 2000, Reid was visited by detectives from Durham, who were investigating Husband. A few days after the visit, he went missing and his body was found in a wood in Stelling Minnis, near Canterbury. An inquest in February 2001 returned an open verdict. The cause of death was recorded as “unascertainable” as the body was badly decomposed.Like Hall, Steve started drinking heavily when he was released. One day he was watching the news when a story came on about abuse in a children’s home in Sunderland. He lost it. Everything went flying. He had never discussed the abuse with his wife. When he calmed down, he told her everything. Eventually, he went to the police station to report Husband, and got the answer he always feared. “‘We suggest you go home, put it behind you, because you can imagine the effect it will have on your wife and children should this get out on the estate where you live.’” Steve ignored the advice and took it to a higher police authority. Thirteen years ago, he told us that if there was a public apology, he hoped he might be able to move on.After Allison and I wrote about Medomsley, more victims went to the police. In 2013, Operation Seabrook was launched by Durham police. Seabrook was a major criminal investigation into the historic abuse at the detention centre, headed by Det Supt Paul Goundry. Before the launch, Allison and I went to meet him to find out more about the investigation and tell him what we knew.Seabrook became the UK’s largest police investigation into institutional abuse. By March 2014, more than 500 victims had come forward and Goundry was convinced he was dealing with something far bigger than the detention centre. “There is growing evidence to suggest there was an organised paedophile ring operating in Medomsley,” he told us. “This will form a major part of our operation and future discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service.” By March 2015, 1,123 men had contacted Operation Seabrook alleging sexual or physical abuse. Goundry told us two former prison officers had been arrested on suspicion of physical and sexual assaults and a further 14 former officers had been questioned.View image in fullscreenJohn McCabe as a young man.Photograph: Courtesy of John McCabeJohn McCabe had been sentenced to nine months in Medomsley for a robbery from a jewellery shop in 1983. He only discovered Husband had been sent to prison when he saw a TV news report in 2009 saying he had been released. McCabe then went to Glasgow police and gave a statement about being raped multiple times, by Husband and others. He was told his statement was consistent with those of many others, and that Husband would be charged.“At the beginning of 2010,” McCabe says, “a police officer phoned me and said: ‘John, I’ve got bad news, they’re not charging him.’ They said there are two parts to going ahead with a prosecution. One part is the evidence, which is absolutely brilliant and we can bring guys who’ve given similar testimony. The other thing is public interest, and it’s not in the public interest to prosecute him. I couldn’t fucking believe it. How can it not be in the public interest?” McCabe asked, but never got an answer. He felt as if he had been abused all over again. “I was gubbed – hugely depressed – for five months. Couldnae do a thing.” Later in 2010, Husband died.When Operation Seabrook launched, Goundry got in touch with McCabe, who is one of the leading Medomsley campaigners. Goundry told McCabe he needed assistance in investigating the paedophile ring. McCabe agreed to help. Officers from Seabrook took McCabe to a church in Shotley Bridge, near Medomsley. From the outside, it wasn’t familiar. But as soon as he got inside, he knew where he was. Although it had been decorated, he recognised the windows. He had been brought here on dark winter nights. “It was a car crash. The minute I walked in I nearly fainted. I went: ‘Get me out of here, get me fucking out of here. Fuck the investigation.’ It hit me like a brick wall.”McCabe was raped by Husband and another man at the church and at the local amateur dramatics society. Allison did some detective work alongside Gavin Engelbrecht, a journalist with the Northern Echo. Allison went to libraries in Durham and searched the local newspapers for cuttings about productions that rehearsed at St Cuthbert’s church hall in Shotley Bridge. Husband was a key member of the group, and directed plays there, sometimes casting Medomsley members of staff. Allison photocopied all the cuttings. “Eric sends me a load of photos,” says McCabe, “and lo and behold, there’s the guy. I got back to Eric straightaway and said: ‘It’s him.’ I was in pieces. I couldn’t believe it.”The man was arrested and McCabe identified him. But he was never charged. McCabe tells me that five different victims had identified five different perpetrators from the drama group. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) can only go ahead with a prosecution if it believes there is a greater than 50% chance of a conviction. If more than one person had identified an alleged perpetrator, there would be more chance of a jury finding them guilty. But with only the victim’s word against that of an alleged abuser, the CPS didn’t believe the cases would succeed in court. Again, McCabe was outraged. “Why did they need corroboration?” he asks. “Isn’t it enough to charge someone for repeatedly raping one boy?”View image in fullscreenDet Supt Paul Goundry, who led Operation Seabrook.Photograph: Claire McKie/ncjMedia LtdIn August 2015, Goundry wrote to him, saying: “Out of those who have come forward to date, 14 inmates reported abuse at Medomsley to the police shortly after being released. Out of these, five reported in Durham with one officer who was identified but he is now deceased.” Goundry said he believed the paedophile ring “could have come from a number of associations that Husband had – his church activity, drama group, homosexual connections, Medomsley work colleagues, masonic colleagues, potentially a mix of above”.Goundry went on to tell McCabe about a victim he had recently met: “I had a request to meet a victim in person, which I did on Tuesday. He wanted to tell me in person that Seabrook had saved his life. He had carried the burden all his life and the fact we had listened and believed him meant he was in the best place he had ever been in. I wish you could have been there, that one conversation made it worthwhile.” Goundry was passionate about the case, and clearly regarded McCabe as an important ally. “We still have a long way to go but we are on the home straight and I need you beside me,” he said.Then in October 2016, with no warning, Goundry quit Operation Seabrook. He wrote to victims saying he had taken up a new position “working with all the relevant statutory agencies, looking at how we support victims of sexual abuse … In order to take up this position, I have had to retire as a police officer.” McCabe was astonished. Goundry had promised to see the investigation through. Today, he remains convinced that what Goundry had discovered was too sensitive. “I managed to find a number for him two years later. I rang him and he rang me back. I said: ‘What the fuck happened to you?’ He said, ‘I was moved on.’”The Guardian invited Goundry to contribute to this article, but he did not respond.In 2019, the victims received another knockback when the independent inquiry into child sex abuse excluded Medomsley on the basis that most of the victims were over 18. Yet some are believed to have been as young as 14 and 15, and – though there was never any question of consent – the age of homosexual consent throughout the time Medomsley was operational was 21. Victims again called for their own public inquiry, to no avail.More than 100 men were arrested in connection with Medomsley. But ultimately the victims felt let down. Only five former officers were convicted and imprisoned for offences including assault, wounding and misconduct in public office. They were jailed for a combined total of 18 years in 2019. One of them was Christopher Onslow, a physical training instructor at Medomsley, who was sentenced to eight and a half years for misconduct in public office and physical abuse. The jury heard how he exploited his authority in a “sadistic and brutal fashion” between 1975 and 1985, including throwing rocks at an inmate on an obstacle course, causing him to fall 20ft and crush three vertebrae; beating a 17-year-old inmate who lost a 200m race because he had lost a £10 bet on him; and attacking a prisoner who tried to report abuse by Husband.When asked to comment on whether Goundry was moved because he was on the verge of uncovering a paedophile ring that would have exposed the police, the church and many establishment figures, a spokesperson for Durham police said: “Thousands of young men were let down by the authorities who should have protected them and continue to live with the trauma left by that abuse. Those victims were, and remain, our primary concern.“Due to the length of that inquiry, three different senior investigating officers had oversight of Operation Seabrook. After discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service, charges were authorised against nine former prison officers, five of whom were convicted of various offences relating to physical abuse. Had investigators identified further offences to an evidential standard, those cases would also have been put before the courts.”View image in fullscreenOperation Seabrook’s files.Photograph: Claire McKie/ncjMedia LtdDespite more than 100 witnesses alleging they had been sexually abused by men other than Husband and Johnston, only one man,Alexander Flavell, was found guilty of sexual abuse. In 2023, he was convicted of indecent assault and cleared of serious sexual assault in his absence (had the offence in question been committed today it would have been tried as rape). Flavell was deemed unfit to stand trial due to dementia, so he received an absolute discharge.The decade-long Operation Seabrook concluded after Flavell’s case. Early last year, Operation Deerness was announced. Usher told me his investigation was about “preventing the victims of tomorrow” and that he hoped it would provide “some level of closure” for the victims.Usher’s 200-page report concluded that the abuse was allowed to continue because other staff members colluded with their silence, police ignored or bullied detainees who reported abuse, and there was no scrutiny by the establishment, from the Home Office to the Board of Visitors (a group of local volunteers appointed as independent observers to monitor conditions inside the prison). In the report, he points out that there was no way for detainees to report the abuse to an independent body and says there still isn’t for victims of abuse in prison. Finally, he says the victims have never received a formal apology from any of the authorities tasked with ensuring the safety of the detainees while in prison. “The government, the Prison Service, Durham police all need to think about a public apology.”Usher pays fulsome tribute to the victims. “I hope that the victims see it is their effort, their bravery, their tenacity that has got the full story of what happened at Medomsley out into the public domain,” he tells me. His report seems exhaustive; the abuse documented in devastating detail. There is the victim forced to perform oral sex on Husband as he held a knife to the boy’s throat; the victim who described how Husband “put his hands around my throat and squeezed until I could hardly breathe”; the victim who said he can still feel the weight of Husband’s body as he was being raped.The report talks about the boys being taken off site to be abused at Husband’s house, the church, the drama group, a farm. It reveals that at least 47 incidents of sexual abuse were reported to staff, up to and including the governor. Usher refers to “a police officer who was an associate of Husband being a perpetrator of abuse”. The CPS was considering charging the police officer, known as Subject A, when he died in 2018. A medical officer known as “Doctor Death” used to tape an aspirin to the heads of detainees who said they were ill and make them run around the yard. He was not investigated by Operation Seabrook as he died before the investigation began. The report refers to a retired Anglican priest and convicted abuser who is thought to have abused a child at Medomsley, without naming the perpetrator. That reference is toGranville Gibson, who was convicted in 2016, aged 80, of sexual abuse dating back to the 1970s while he was the vicar at St Clare’s Church in County Durham.Prison officers, the clergy, police, doctors, the Freemasons. The abuse ran right through the establishment. Yet apart from a handful of prison officers, there have been no convictions.Usher insists, rightly, this was beyond his remit. His job was to find out why the abuse wasn’t stopped. And, to an extent, he has done so. He also insists his investigation did the same job a public inquiry would do. “I don’t think you will get a more comprehensive, detailed account of what happened than the investigation I’ve done. Wherever we found ex-members of staff we wrote to them. Some of them we did not find, and some will have chosen not to give evidence to me. If that small group of staff who did not come and talk to me had been compelled to appear before a public inquiry, they would in all likelihood have said they knew nothing about the abuse. If they’d said that to me it would have made no difference to the conclusions I have drawn. So I don’t believe a public inquiry would get any further than we have got. I think I have uncovered the truth about what happened at Medomsley and have faithfully represented that on behalf of the victims.”But the victims aren’t happy. Steve points out that the word paedophile is not mentioned once in the report, let alone “paedophile ring”. He calls the investigation a sop. “It is an investigation without any powers. There should have been some compulsion to give evidence instead of just saying: ‘Oh, come and tell us what you know!’ because they just won’t come. The report basically tells us what we know already. In fact, most of the things in there, we told them. This is just people telling instances of what happened to them. It’s not a public inquiry, where they can order people to come forward, instead of asking. At a public inquiry, witnesses are on oath so if they lie they can get done for perjury.”View image in fullscreenJake Richards, a Labour MP and minister for youth justice, in the House of Commons.Photograph: House of CommonsLast week, just after the report was published, the minister for youth justice, Jake Richards,described the abuseas a “monstrous perversion of justice” and said: “To the men who suffered such horrific abuse at Medomsley, I want to say again – I am truly sorry.” He added that the government would establish a youth custody safeguarding panel “to review how we protect children in custody today”. I ask Steve if he feels he can move forward now. “I’m 65, it’s too late for me to move on,” he says. “Saying sorry to us now sounds hollow. It means nothing.”McCabe points out that the report doesn’t even name the two surviving governors, Christopher Harder and Tim Newell, the latter a highly regarded liberal thinker in prison circles. “From what I have heard they weren’t even interviewed for the PPO’s report. Well, if Newell had been doing his job when he was governor I would never have met Husband and my life wouldn’t have been destroyed.” The PPO wouldn’t confirm to me whether or not Newell was interviewed.Newell, the governor of Medomsley from 1979 to 1981, was a friend of Husband’s and attended the drama group with him. In a report he wrote, he said Husband made “an outstanding contribution to the running of the establishment”. When Allison and I investigated Medomsley in 2012, Newell refused to talk to us.In 2014, he issued a statement to the BBCsaying: “If I had any suspicions about sexual abuse or abuse of any kind I would have taken action. If staff knew about the abuse taking place I am very concerned they let the abuse continue.”When I contacted Newell a couple of weeks ago through the Quakers publication The Friend, for which he writes, I received a message back within minutes from the Friend saying: “Hi Simon, Gosh, I heard back from Tim faster than expected. He writes: ‘Thank you, I’m reluctant at present to have such contact. Thanks for your consideration.’” Newell has never issued a public apology.McCabe says Operation Deerness has done little to satisfy him. In fact, he says there has been something belittling about the whole process. Despite being told he had been sent a copy of the report, it never arrived. “They couldn’t even be bothered to send it by special delivery. They sent it second class. That report contains incredibly personal details, and it may well have been posted through a neighbour’s door.” He points to some of the language used by Usher in the report. “Why does he keep referring to us as young men? We weren’t young men, we were boys. This is no different from any of the other investigations. It’s essentially the police and Ministry of Justice investigating themselves. We have always needed a public inquiry, and we still do. Halfway through the special investigation they put out one line saying anybody who was around the area where Medomsley detention centre was in the 70s and 80s is welcome to come down to the local arts centre for a chat and a cup of tea. That’s the kind of investigation this is.” He says a public inquiry would have allowed victims to ask any question they wanted through lawyers, and those responsible would have been made to answer under cross-examination. “In a public inquiry, there is no way governors could get away with saying: ‘I didn’t know because no officers told me, and therefore they’re to blame’.”When I say that Usher told me he hoped the report could provide “some level of closure”, McCabe laughs bitterly. “My wife died on 17 September 2016, and I’ve still not had time to grieve for her because of Medomsley. I’ve got three counsellors, and they’re just trying to get me to the stage where I can grieve for my wife.” He pauses. “One of my counsellors said to me: ‘What does closure look like to you, John?’ I said: ‘It looks like a coffin closing.’”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

But while he will host bilateral meetings with world leaders, he will not be able to meet Trump, who has said he is not attending after accusing South Africa ofracially discriminating against the minority white Afrikaner community.South Africa has responded byaccusing the US of “coercion by absentia”.‘We are privileged’: liberal Afrikaners reject Trump’s ‘white genocide’ claimsRead moreCyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, told the B20 business summit on Thursday: “We are sovereign countries. And we need to be treated as equals.“Our sovereignty needs to be respected. We need to sit around the table as equals and having the same share of knowledge, the same share of capability, without any bullying the other.”Asked about Trump, Starmer said: “Obviously President Trump set out his position. I think it’s really important to be there and talk to other partners and allies so we can get on with the discussions around global issues that have to be addressed.”Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping will also be absent from the summit.While South Africa and Russia maintain close ties, Putin is wanted by the international criminal court, to which South Africa is a signatory. Xi has skipped many international gatherings this year, delegating attendance at the Brics and Asean summits to China’s premier, Li Qiang.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They will have a chance to exchange further notes when they meet the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on the sidelines of this weekend’s summit.While Starmer works the international diplomatic circuit, his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is finalising a budget likely to include billions of pounds in tax rises, including a freeze on income tax thresholds. The prime minister and the chancellor decided last week to abandon a plan to raise income tax rates, leaving Reeves looking at other ways to raise about £20bn extra in tax revenue.Starmer said: “Obviously the details of the budget will come on Wednesday. It’ll be aLabourbudget with Labour values. It’ll be based on fairness.“We have to see this in the context of 16, 17 years now where we’ve had the crash in 2008, followed by austerity, followed by a not very good Brexit deal, followed by Covid, followed byUkraine, and that’s why we have to take the decision to get this back on track.“I’m optimistic about the future. I do think if we get this right our country has a great future.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerG20South AfricaBudget 2025LabourAfricaUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

South Africa’s government has vehemently denied the accusations and pressed ahead with its plans to host the first G20 summit in Africa. The two-day summit opens in Johannesburg on Saturday.At a press conference with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen and the European Council’s president, António Costa, Cyril Ramaphosasaid: “We have received notice from the United States, a notice which we are still in discussions with them over about a change of mind, about participating in one shape, form or other in the summit.“This comes at the late hour before the summit begins and so therefore we do need to … see how practical it is and what it finally really means. In a way we see this as a positive sign, very positive, because as I’ve often said, boycott politics never work.”View image in fullscreen‘Boycott politics never work,’ said the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa.Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPAEarlier on Thursday, Chrispin Phiri, a spokesperson for South Africa’s foreign ministry, had accused the US of trying to coerce the country, after media reported that a US diplomatic note sent toSouth Africasaid no final statement by G20 leaders could be issued without its presence.“Washington’s absence negates its role over the G20’s conclusions,” Phiri said. “But we cannot allow coercion by absentia to become a viable tactic; it is a recipe for institutional paralysis and the breakdown of collective action.”The note from the US embassy in Pretoria, sent last weekend, said the US would accept only a “chair’s statement” rather than a leaders’ declaration, according to AFP.The note read: “South Africa’s G20 priorities run counter to US policy views, and we cannot support consensus on any documents negotiated under your presidency. The US opposes issuance of any G20 summit outcome document under the premise of a consensus G20 position without US agreement.”South Africa’s priorities for its G20 presidency include improving debt sustainability for low-income countries and more finance for a “just energy transition” away from fossil fuels. It hasinvited an additional 22 countriesto the summit and tried to present itself as a mature champion of multilateralism, the global south and Africa.The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, said in Februarythat South Africa’s G20 themes of “solidarity, equality, & sustainability” amounted to “anti-Americanism”.The US, which is taking over the presidency of the G20 next year, has also criticised the forum’s expansion from its initial focus on global financial and economic issues when it was founded in 1999.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said at an Oval Office event: “We have whittled down the G20 back to basics … the G20 had become basically the G100 this past year. So it will be a concentrated group in Miami, seeing the best America has to offer, with American leadership.”View image in fullscreenSouth Africa’s priorities for its G20 presidency include improving debt sustainability for low-income countries and more finance for a ‘just energy transition’ away from fossil fuels.Photograph: Themba Hadebe/APIn a separate event on Thursday, Ramaphosa responded: “My retort is, no, we didn’t convene the G100; we have convened the G million, if you like, the G20 million.“Because if we are to create a world that is prosperous, a world that is caring, a world that is more equal, a world that is underpinned by solidarity, we do believe that it is important to involve the people who are going to be affected by the decisions that the leaders’ summit are going to take.”Ramaphosa alsotold reporters last weekthat he didn’t want to hand the G20 presidency over to an “empty chair”.“But the empty chair will be there, probably symbolically hand over to that empty chair and talk to President Trump and say, ‘Even though you are not here, I am now handing over to you the reins of chairing or being president of the G20.’ Because the G20 as an entity continues, whether they are here or not.”The G20, which includes 19 of the world’s largest economies and the European Union, traditionally issues a communique at the end of the leaders’ summit every year. Last year, Ukraine and its western alliescriticised the final statementfor not mentioning that Russia had invaded Ukraine.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsG20South AfricaTrump administrationAfricaDonald TrumpCyril RamaphosaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

These threats of violence were nothing but terrorist acts,” the judge had said earlier while convicting him.Kanu, 58, who had dismissed his legal team and represented himself during the trial, was earlier ejected from court for “unruly” behaviour. “Which law states that you can charge me on an unwritten law? Show me,” Kanu said before he was removed from the court. “Omotosho, where is the law? Any judgment declared in this court is a complete rubbish.”The Ipob leader was first taken into state custody in October 2015 and faced multiple charges, including treasonable felony. Eighteen months later, he was granted bail before disappearing until a controversial 2021extradition from Kenya, which his supporters described as an extraordinary rendition.Prosecutors had called for Kanu to face the death penalty.Kanu sought to revive the short-lived state of Biafra, which seceded from Nigeria in 1967, sparking a civil war during which up to 3 million people died.After its troops surrendered in 1970, Biafra, which comprised the old Eastern Region – most of which is today’s south-eastern Nigeria – was reintegrated into the country.Several secessionist movements have sprung up to protest against what they see as political and economic marginalisation of the region, rallying members of the diaspora to donate to the agitation for independence, including training militia in the region’s forests.View image in fullscreenNnamdi Kanu at the federal high court in Abuja, January 2016. In 2017, Ipob was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the Nigerian government.Photograph: Afolabi Sotunde/ReutersIpob, seen as the most consequential of these movements, relied for long periods on Kanu’s oratory on the London-based Radio Biafra as a tool of campaign. During Kanu’s time in prison, a splinter group emerged, the Biafran Government in Exile (BGIE), whose self-declared prime minister, Simon Ekpa, was sentenced to six years on terrorism-related charges by a Finnish court in September.Brother of British national held in Nigeria says UK has ‘turned its back’Read moreBoth groups have been accused of a campaign of terror in south-east Nigeria where militants regularly and violently enforce Mondays as “sit-at-home days”, banning business, schooling and other activity.According to the geopolitical risk consultancy SBM Intelligence, as many as 700 deaths have been linked to separatist militants since 2021, including a May 2024 incident where five soldiers and six others were killed in an ambush in Abia state. During the conflict, military personnel have also been implicated in multiple cases of human rights abuses.In 2017, Ipob was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the Nigerian government. Since then, Kanu has hired US lobby firms, includingone owned by the ex-congressman Jim Moran. Reports in Nigeria have tied those efforts to the designation of Nigeria as a “country of particular concern” this month by Donald Trump, whothreatened to attack Nigeriawhile citingunproven claims of a “Christian genocide”in the north.Before the final verdict, it emerged that Kanu had written directly to Trump claiming that a “Judeo-Christian genocide” was under way in south-east Nigeria.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The White House spokeswoman said that other countries are “lining up” to import American oil and gas. Meanwhile, Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the lone federal representative to attend the summit, said: “Trump does not represent the United States…“He represents the fossil fuel industry and specifically, his big billionaire fossil fuel, donors, when it comes to climate matters”.Thanks for joining us today.

It should be rejected as a tool of foreign policy.”The report, pulling back the cover on CIA attempts to kill the Cuban leader Fidel Castro and its involvement in the assassinations of Congo’s first post-colonial prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, and Gen René Schneider, the commander-in-chief of Chile’s armed forces, provoked a wave of revulsion. The following year, Ford signed the first of several executive orders expressly banning the agency and other US forces from trying to assassinate foreign leaders outside war situations.Peter Kornbluh, senior analyst with the National Security Archive, said highlighting the Church report’s historical significance had become more urgent in the context of the speculation surrounding Maduro, who the White House has accused of “narco-terrorism”.“Fifty years after the scandal of the revelations of the Church committee report, we’ve come a long way in the wrong direction, where we have US presidents who now seem to feel they can openly discuss assassination plots against foreign leaders,” he said.“We can’t have an honest and full discussion of the merits of assassinating the head of state ofVenezuelawithout going back and reading the Church committee report. People have forgotten what a scandal this report generated, and the discussion of morality and US foreign policy it created.“There was a public consensus of repudiation for this tactic of US foreign policy. It was deemed immoral, unethical and not in keeping with the character of the United States public.”At least 83 people have been killed in 21 US drone strikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since early September, as pressure on Maduro has intensified, with Washington offering a $50m bounty for his arrest.The justice department’s office of legal counsel has reportedly been tasked with drafting an opinion that could render any assassination of Maduro legally justifiable,according to the New York Times.The state department has announced it will declare the Cartel de los Soles, a shadowy cartel whose existence has been doubted by some drug experts but which theTrump administrationinsists Maduro heads, a terrorist organization as of 24 November.That could pave the way for assassination strikes on a similar legal basis as applied to the strikes on al-Qaida leaders, including Osama bin Laden, during the post-9/11 “war on terror”, and onQassem Suleimani, the senior commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, after the US designated the unit a terrorist group.Kornbluh said the 9/11 attacks changed public perceptions on whether assassinations – at least of terrorists – were acceptable.“If someone was designated a terrorist, they could then legitimately be taken out, and that is why you today see the Trump administration doing linguistic and legalistic somersaults,” he said.Applying it to Venezuela would violate the principles established by Church and may ill-serve US foreign policy goals, Kornbluh warned.“It doesn’t necessarily advance your foreign policy agenda to create instability and chaos in a country. Just because the Trump administration somehow finds a way to drop a drone bomb onNicolás Maduroin Venezuela doesn’t mean that his regime collapses necessarily.”Fulton Armstrong, a former CIA analyst for Latin America, said the principles established by Church’s report had been eroded.“Frank Church was the man who on the Hill did more to rescue [the] CIA from itself and demand transparency and accountability,” he said. “The ethics that Church in his sometimes clumsy ways, introduced into [the] CIA along with the levels of accountability and oversight – those things have have been reversed. And they are desperately needed.”Explore more on these topicsCIATrump administrationUS politicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s worried about those who are threatened by extreme climate events. That’s what moves him. He understands the climate crisis is a machine that worsens poverty and inequality.”Climate conferences are always games of three-dimensional chess as the world’s governments juggle priorities and haggle over commitments. But the prospect of Lula opening a new front for his campaign in Johannesburg adds an intriguing transcontinental twist.It would also lift the stakes. The G20 brings together more powerful world leaders than Cop, where negotiations are mainly conducted by ministers.There is certainly a need for more impetus. Eighty-two governments signed up to the roadmap on Tuesday, but they only account for 7% of global fossil fuel production. The roadmap has since been knocked backwards, with sources close to the negotiations saying that Russia, China, India and South Africa jointly had told the Brazilian Cop presidency they would not accept the plan.Divide over fossil fuels phaseout can be bridged, Cop30 president saysRead moreThe “like-minded developing countries” grouping, which includes coal and oil producers, has also expressed reservations. As a result, the Guardian understands the proposal has been stripped out of the latest draft of the main negotiating text. Others claim the roadmap is already roadkill.Nobody is entirely sure because the Brazilian presidency has gone into a secretive mode. Despite promising transparent “mutirão” collective negotiating, observers say the past day’s talks have mainly been behind closed doors with the hosts only showing portions of the text to each group of nations.There may also still be room for manoeuvre. In private discussions outside the presidency’s meetings, sources say Saudi Arabian and Chinese diplomats have shown openness to the idea of a roadmap as long as each country can choose their own pathway. India has reportedly been more hesitant.Less developed countries might also be persuaded to move if the European Union and other industrialised countries make a clearer commitment on finance. The EU has indicated that the roadmap is now a red line they are willing to defend, but they also have to be willing to pay.Throwing an extra level of complexity into the mix are the divisions within Brazil, where Lula’s scope for action islimited by a powerful petrochemical and agribusiness lobby.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The driving force until now has been Marina Silva, the environment minister, who persuaded Lula of the need for a roadmap and has pushed the idea in Belém. But the foreign ministry, represented by the Cop president, André Corrêa do Lago, is more cautious. Several sources told the Guardian they do not support the roadmap because of the risk of failure, and that they would rather focus on smaller, more easily achievable wins that could keep the multilateral process alive.The next version of the negotiating text was expected late on Thursday, but plans were thrown into disarray early in the afternoon when a fire broke out in the pavilion area of the conference centre. Delegations holding meetings in their rooms nearby were evacuated but the UN said no one was hurt.Firefighters controlled the blaze, but the entire venue had to be cleared from shortly after 2pm. The Guardian was told it was likely to be several hours at least before any delegates were allowed to return.The incident disrupted a carefully choreographed series of meetings between the presidency and the main negotiating groups.The Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis) had been scheduled to meet the presidency shortly before 4pm, but that was cancelled. The EU was due to hold a ministerial coordination meeting at 6pm prior to meeting the presidency at 9pm, but that timetable was thrown into doubt.The severity of the disruption at this stage of the talks is likely to make it impossible to stick to the Brazilian timetable, and may push the talks well into overtime.Explore more on these topicsBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaCop30Climate crisisFossil fuelsAmericasG20newsShareReuse this content"

But as many as 1,000 more are believed to still be living in the water.Under Ontario’s ministry of natural resources and forestry guidelines, fish can be euthanized through percussive stunning, electrical stunning or pithing.“The fact that we’ve had approximately 6,000 fish in this pond, in this year, is mind-blowing,” councillor Riley Brockington, who represents the area, told CBC News.“It’s just a number that’s difficult for me to wrap my head around.”Female goldfish produce large amounts of offspring, with a single mature fish able to lay more than 100,000 eggs.View image in fullscreenCelebration pond in Ottawa Central Park neighbourhood.Photograph: Google MapsCarleton biology professor Steven Cooke told the national broadcaster the actual population of the Celebration Park shoal could far exceed official estimates, speculating that there could be millions of tiny young goldfish in the pond, undetected.The scourge of goldfish – a species native to Asia and most commonly found in fish tanks – has become a growing problem as the fish are deliberately released by pet owners into increasingly warm waters.Goldfish can grow to immense sizes in large bodies of water, have few predators and reproduce rapidly. They displace native species and harm plant growth by churning up waters of ponds.Warming water temperatures from a changing climate have also created more hospitable environments for the populations as they spread through local waterways and into the Great Lakes.Authorities in theCanadaand the US have pleaded with aquarium owners to stop releasing pet fish into waterways. In Minnesota, officials removed nearly 50,000 goldfish from local waters. They warned that fish which might be only two or three inches long when they are released can grow to more than 1ft long.Shelby Riskin, an ecologist at the University of Toronto, said that stormwater ponds have increasingly become a breeding ground for the cast-off fish and present a challenge when trying to restore local ecosystems.“There are these flooded areas - and I’m thinking of one in [Toronto’s Don Valley] that can seem no larger than a puddle - and yet at certain times of the year it’s just filled with goldfish,” she said.The fish can thrive in turbid, oxygen-depleted environments, often outlasting and outcompeting local species.“You look and and just see the toxic vape packets floating by these animals. It often feels like that Jeff Goldblum quote from Jurassic Park – life really does always find a way.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasFishnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead of the empty wells farmers faced last year, this time their crops were washed away; roads turned into brown, swirling rivers; houses collapsed in the torrents; and 17 people were killed.Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most populous country, faces a paradox. Sometimes described as a sleeping giant, it is one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations, but most people do not realise it is also the sixth-largest greenhouse-gas emitter.Indonesia has experienced rapid economic growth over the past two decades, at an average of 5% a year since 1997. But this progress has been powered by carbon-intensive resources at a steep cost to the environment.View image in fullscreenPeople try to clean up their shop after severe flooding in Denpasar, Bali, in September.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyDeforestation, peatland drainage and the extraction and burning of coal have powered Indonesia’s development model, reshaping landscapes through timber, pulp and mineral excavation and palm-oil booms.Indonesiaproduces55% of the world’s palm oil, a sector that contributes 4.5% of GDP and employs more than 3 million people. More than 90% of Indonesia’s energy comes from fossil fuels; coal dominates, providing 70% of electricity, and the country remains the world’s largest exporter.Emissionsare high: Indonesia released an average of 1.5bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent annually in 2018–20, about 3.5% of the global total. Now the challenge is to decouple emissions from economic growth.First must come coal. But although there is a moratorium on new coal plants “on paper”, Putra Adhiguna, the managing director of the Indonesian independent thinktank Energy Shift Institute, said a loophole allowed new “captive” plants (power plants owned by single industrial users) to power nickel smelters and industrial projects.Researchshows captive-power capacity in Indonesia has more than doubled over five years, reaching 22.9GW in 2024 – more than 80% of which is from coal-fired plants and largely outside state oversight.Adhiguna said Indonesia must “dismantle its coal mindset”, which means removing the domestic price cap that keeps coal artificially cheap and blocks renewables from competing. “Indonesia’s renewable growth is really quite abysmal,” he said.The drive to become a global supplier of minerals such as nickel, vital for electric vehicles, might bring jobs and investment, but it also leads to deforestation and pollution in Sulawesi and Maluku and is mostly powered by coal.Then there is theland sector, which accounted for about 40% of Indonesia’s emissions until 2020, particularly from deforestation and peatland fires. Indonesia is home to 10% of the world’s remaining tropical rainforest and the largest area of tropical peatlands of any country – estimated to hold tens of billions of tonnes of carbon.View image in fullscreenA baby orangutan hangs in a tree in a tropical rainforest in Borneo.Photograph: Panther Media GmbH/AlamyIn 2015, during a severe El Niño that fuelled huge peatland fires, Indonesia’s carbon outputbriefly surpassedthat of the US. Deforestation rates have now fallen to their lowest in two decades, but environmentalists fear backsliding as the government pursues its huge food-estate programme which has cleared rainforest in Papua and Kalimantan and expands palm-oil biofuels under its B35 (35% palm oil-based biofuel and 65% fossil diesel fuel)and B40 (40% palm oil-based biofuel and 60% fossil diesel fuel) mandates.Satellite data this year shows new deforestation and fire hotspots in south Sumatra and central Kalimantan. Vast peat swamps – once waterlogged carbon sinks – continue to be drained for plantations, leaving tinder-dry material that burn and smoulder for weeks.View image in fullscreenIndonesian firefighters try to extinguish a peatland fire in Ogan Ilir, south Sumatra, in August 2021.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/GettyAnd yet climate change is hitting Indonesians hard.  “Bali was a place that rarely experienced flooding,” said Made Krisna Dinata, the executive director of the NGOWalhi Bali. “Now, we can no longer see or even predict when these seasons will come and go.”It’s a similar pattern across the archipelago, with increasing numbers of devastating climate-related disasters threatening food security and traditional ways of life. In urban areas, extreme heat is increasingly felt, while coastal regions face sea-level rise, coral bleaching and sinking land.Indigenous communities face exacerbated struggles, often lacking access to the government’s social and health insurance because their homes are situated in remote or forest areas.View image in fullscreenFires burn in a rainforest cleared to plant palm oil trees in Tripa, Aceh province in June 2009.Photograph: Robert Nickelsberg/GettyHow committed is the country to change? In September, the government released its second nationally determined contribution, targeting a 31.89% emissions cut unconditionally – or 43.2% with foreign support – by 2030, which goes 8-17.5% deeper than before.The plan is heavily reliant on land-use change, including restoring 2m hectares (5m acres) of peatlands, rehabilitating 8.3m hectares (20.5m acres) of degraded land and increasing renewables to 19-23% of the power mix. However, to meet those targets, Indonesia says it will need at least US$470bn (£360bn) in investment by 2030.Indonesian environmentalists have criticised the plan as not ambitious enough, while others argue execution will be the real test.Adhiguna said Indonesia might say it wanted to join the global shift to clean energy, but “policies and investments continue to lock the country into fossil-fuel dependency for decades to come”.Renewables account for less than15% of the energy mix, despite vast potential. The Just Energy Transition Partnership, a US$20bn pledge from wealthy nations to speed the phase-out of coal, has stalled in bureaucracy.“The key is to reinvest fossil-fuel profits domestically,” Adhiguna said. “Indonesia is making a boatload of money out of fossil fuel. That money needs to be reinvested in the country for greener opportunities.”He also said that as China, Indonesia’s biggest coal customer, shifts toward renewables, the country risks being left behind.For Indonesia, climate action is inseparable from fairness. The Indonesian government has long argued that countries with large historic emissions should bear greater burdens and that to transition away from coal and ramp up renewables it needs international investment and supportive frameworks.View image in fullscreenHouses along the banks of Ciliwung River in Jakarta, Indonesia, where people live in poverty.Photograph: Bagus Indahono/EPASisilia Nurmala Dewi of350.orgsaid while that was true, Indonesia also needed to do more at home. “We want to ask for energy transition money, we want to unlock that finance, but at the same time our policies are not signalling that we really want to transition,” she said.On forests, Indonesia has been involved in the UN’s Redd+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) programme. Billions were promised through partnerships with Norway and others, including up to US$110m to East Kalimantan. But progress has been uneven, hindered by disputes over land rights and verification.“The concept is good,” Tiza Mafira, Indonesia’s director at the Climate Policy Initiative, said, “but we need better governance and accountability. Forest protection cannot depend on short-term donor projects – it must be part of a long-term national strategy.”Indonesia is also expanding its carbon markets and pitching them to investors at Cop30. A voluntary exchange launched in 2023 has begun trading credits from forestry and energy projects, while a national emissions-trading system is being extended to power and industry.The road to Cop30At Cop30 in Belém, Brazil, to which Indonesia has sent more than 400 delegates, it is positioning itself as a voice for the global south – pushing for climate equity and fair financing. Officials will tout the new NDC as proof of ambition, even as domestic growth depends on coal, nickel and palm oil.The focus will be on affirming the 2030 forest and other land use (Folu) net sinktargetand highlighting its carbon-market potential to attract investors.View image in fullscreenHanif Faisol Nurofiq, Indonesia’s minister for the environment, speaks at Cop30 in Belém, Brazil.Photograph: Fernando Llano/APAdhiguna said near-term action was critical. The government’s emissions’ peak has already been pushed back to 2035, demanding faster cuts later. He hopes Cop30 will offer “clarity on the realisation plan for the president’s 100GW renewable targets”, alongside firm commitments to phase out coal and preserve rainforests.It will also be an opportunity to emphasise Indonesia’s position as the world’s third-largest tropical rainforest country after Brazil andthe Congo basin.For many in the global south, Cop30 will revive the debate over who pays. Indonesia’s negotiators are expected to push for expanded funding through the green climate fund and reforms to carbon markets to ensure local communities share the benefits.Mafira said loss-and-damage funding and the Baku-to-Belém roadmap, which aims to close the gap between the Cop29 target of $300bn annually and the envisioned $1.3tn in climate finance per year by 2035, were of huge importance. She said: “If that manages to get initiated, I think climate is back on the agenda of every developing country.“The failure of developed countries to put up the funding required has not been the death of climate action in developing countries, but it has been very effective ammunition for denying climate action, which we can do without.”Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaThe big emittersClimate crisisDeforestationGreenhouse gas emissionsAsia PacificConservationCoalnewsShareReuse this content"

In March, a home affairs director said foreign affairs had advised them not to release the transcript of Adeang’s interview to a Senate estimates hearing.The foreign minister, Penny Wong, explained this week that the translation notes had been “taken hastily” by an official who was not an accredited translator and were “for internal purposes only”.Adnan thought he’d served his time. But one night border force raided his home to deport him to NauruRead more“The government of Nauru has confirmed it will not provide any translation of the interview. I am informed the notes were taken hastily, for internal purposes only, by a staff member in the Australian high commission in Nauru who is not an accredited translator,” Wong said in a letter accompanying the release of correspondence.“The translation of Nauruan to English is the source of much debate in Nauru. As the government of Nauru has not provided its own translation, nor endorsed the above-mentioned notes as a true and accurate reflection of the interview, it would not be appropriate to release them and doing so would damage our bilateral relationship.”Australia’s deal with Nauru is expected to cost more than $400m in the deal’s first year, and about $2.5bn over the deal’s 30-year lifetime.One of the three men first announced for deportation – an Iranian refugee whose visa was cancelled after he was convicted of murdering his wife in the 1990s and who was placed in indefinite detention after serving his sentence – launched a challenge in the federal court against his removal.The man, known in the courts as TCXM, sought to avoid being offloaded to Nauru by arguing he had serious health conditions and was not afforded procedural fairness.The federal court judge dismissed the case and applied a suppression order over sensitive details of Australia’s arrangement with Nauru. The order includes the countries’ memorandum of understanding and the transcript of Adeang’s February interview in Nauru.TCXM’s appeal, which was moved to the high court, will be heard in December. But the transfer of other members of the NZYQ cohort remains opaque. Sources on Nauru say a number of people are being held in the RPC3 detention complex, but that they have not been sighted outside the centre.Successive Australian governments have imposed extreme secrecy around their offshore detention regime.The Howard government issued an edict that “no personalising or humanising images” should be taken of asylum seekers, while Scott Morrison, as immigration and prime minister, repeatedly told reporters “we don’t comment on on-water matters”.The Albanese government has repeatedly told the Senate it would not reveal the details of a multimillion-dollar “confidential bilateral agreement” it has signed with Papua New Guinea to hold asylum seekers and refugees formerly detained on Manus Island. “The release … could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the Australian government’s international relations,” the government said.This month, Adeang arrived in Canberra for a series of meetings with government ministers not previously declared by either government – as most visits by heads of state are – leading to speculation around a “secret” visit, amid controversy around Australia removing NZYQ members to Nauru, andAustralia’s contracts on the island.Explore more on these topicsNauruAsia PacificPacific islandsTony BurkeAustralian immigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Alice [Guo] was convicted along with seven other co-accused. Life imprisonment,” Torrevillas said, declining to name Guo’s co-defendants due to a confidentiality law.A spokesperson for the Philippine Anti-Organised Crime Commission told reporters in a group chat that Guo and three others had been convicted of “organising trafficking” inside the compound.Four more were found guilty of “acts of trafficking”, the spokesperson said.Guo, 35, wasarrested by Indonesian policein September 2024 after fleeing the Philippines.Although she was elected mayor of Bamban town, the site of the scam centre, a Manila court ruled in June that as a Chinese citizen Guo was never eligible for the position.The Chinese embassy on Thursday did not immediately return calls seeking comment.The transnational scam industry has ballooned in south-east Asia in recent years, with thousands of scammers estimated to be involved. Victims in the wider region were conned out of up to $37bn in 2023, according to a UN report, which said global losses were likely “much larger”.The centres flourished in the Philippines under then president Rodrigo Duterte after the government regulator was given the right to issue operating licences nationwide.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr announced a ban on offshore gambling operations amid mounting public fury over the Guo case in 2024, ordering foreign nationals working at the sites out of the country.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesAsia PacificScamsnewsShareReuse this content"

It questioned the timing of the ban and said it appeared aimed at suppressing scrutiny rather than correcting inaccuracies.The Samoa Alliance of Media Practitioners for Development (Sampod) described the ban as a disproportionate and harmful reaction to any concerns about media coverage.Sampod representative Lilomaiava Maina Vai said the government has clear channels to raise complaints and resolve disputes.“There are legal avenues and the media council process that can address concerns about reporting,” she said. “Banning and targeting one newspaper is ill advised because it restricts the public’s access to information and undermines the role of the media in a democracy.”The ban threatens to weaken accountability and risks encouraging hostile actions against journalists, Sampod said. The Pacific Freedom Forum and Journalists Association of Samoa also expressed concerns about the ban and its implications.TV, radio and online news outlets will continue to cover the prime minister’s briefings.The former prime minister Fiame Naomi Mata’afa, leader of the opposition Samoa Uniting Party, condemned the ban as a deliberate effort to silence scrutiny.She said no media outlet was barred during her prime ministership, regardless of whether coverage was critical. “Leadership requires openness, accountability and the ability to face difficult questions.”Fiame raised concern over the lack of transparency regarding the prime minister’s medical absence and the rise in online hostility targeting the Samoa Observer,which she saidrisked normalising intimidation.Former prime minister and leader of the opposition Human Rights Protection Party, Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi, also criticised the ban.“This is bad. If you think the information [in an article] is wrong, you will not get sick from it, it is an opportunity to correct it and to expand on the information.”Marieta said she was taken aback by the directive.“I have never been asked to leave a press conference before, and for it to be done like that, I had no choice but to stand up and walk away,” she said.“It made me sad to see how my role as a journalist was undermined at that point.”The ban has ignited a wider conversation about transparency, leadership accountability and media independence in the country.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

And disappointed it’s ended up like this,” foreign minister Justin Tkatchenko told Agence France-Presse after Australia ceded hosting rights to Turkey.Australia had been pushing to hostCop31next year alongside south Pacific nations which are increasingly threatened by rising seas and climate-fuelled disasters.From Australia to Turkey and, reluctantly, Germany: the tug-of-war over hosting Cop31Read moreBut Australia pulled the plug on its long-touted bid after Turkey, the other prospective host,refused to back down. It would have been the first time the region had hosted the UN’s premier climate summit.Turkey will host next year’s UN climate summit while Australia will lead the conference’s negotiations among governments, under a compromise deal taking shape in talks in Brazil, Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday.Minister Tkatchenko on Thursday criticised the entire Cop summit process as a waste of time. “What has Cop achieved over the years. Nothing,” said Papua New Guinea’s top diplomat.“It’s just a talk fest and doesn’t hold the big polluters accountable.”Pacific Island leaders have long criticised COP summits for marginalising their voices or offering limited practical solutions as they battle the mounting costs of climate change.They hoped that co-hosting duties could change that and raise awareness. But winning the COP hosting would also have drawn extensive scrutiny on Australia’s green record. The country has long profited from fossil fuel exports and treated climate action as a political and economic liability.The former prime minister of Tuvalu – which may become uninhabitable this century if planet-heating emissions are not constrained – said the decision showed “the non-committal of Australia to climate justice”.Tuvalu, a tiny nation of thinly populated atolls and reef islands, is among the world’s most vulnerable nations due to rising sea levels.“The Pacific countries should seriously remodel their relationship with Australia,” Bikenibeu Paeniu told AFP.He added it was not good enough that the Pacific region hosts a pre-COP event, while Turkey will host the summit.“What a miss but the Pacific will continue its fight no matter what.”Australia started walking back its bid earlier this week as leaders met in the Brazilian port city of Belém. Albanese had pledged that, if Australia did lose out, he would still look for ways to keep the Pacific’s plight on the agenda.Australia had pitched its bid as a “Pacific Cop”, done in partnership with low-lying island nations and emphasising their exposure to climate change and rising sea levels.The annual conferences are the world’s main forum for driving climate action.About 320,000 people in the Pacific were displaced by disasters between 2008 and 2017, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Nasa projects sea levels could rise by up to 15cmover the next 30 years.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsCop31Papua New GuineaCop30Asia PacificPacific islandsnewsShareReuse this content"

This scares me beyond words.”Kardell Lomas was so frightened of Traven Fisherthat she passed a note to staff at a support service, asking them to call police. She sought help from government-funded agencies more than 20 times before Fisher killed her.View image in fullscreenA family photo of Gail Karran, who recorded the savage attack that killed herGail Karran began to document her husband Bill’s abuseon a hidden audio recorder. She marked the assaults with an asterisk on her calendar. On the night she was fatally attacked, she had told police she was scared.Broken trust, a two-year investigation by Guardian Australia, has uncovered several domestic violence homicides in which victims’ fears do not appear to have been taken seriously by police.“People, women particularly, are experiencing domestic and family violence every day, and they are seeking help every day,” says Emma Buxton-Namisnyk, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales, who has reviewed more than 4,000 domestic and family violence-linked deaths.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“They are not getting the help that they are asking for. They are instead getting met with racist responses and harmful responses and responses that undermine their agency.”Police failures ‘extremely common’Studies in Queensland suggest almost half the women murdered by an intimate partnerhad previously been labelled a perpetrator of domestic violence by police.In September, Queenslandpassed new lawsthat allow police to issue year-long domestic and family violence protection notices, which women’s advocates say could amplify the problem of the “misidentification” of victims as offenders.View image in fullscreenThe Queensland Police Union president, Shane Prior, claims there is ‘no hard data’ to show officers misidentify victims as perpetrators.Photograph: Darren England/AAPThe head of the police union, Shane Prior, wrote to officer members saying “predictably, voices in the DFV sector have lined up against the use of [year-long orders] because they think you can’t be trusted to get it right”. He claimed there was “no hard data” to back up claims police misidentify victims.Kardell Lomas’s heartbreaking apology to police is a moment that should shame all Australians | Amy McQuireRead moreBuxton-Namisnyk says it is “extremely common” to identify problems in policing responses when reviewing a DFV death.“I remember very distinctly having one of my papers peer reviewed about domestic and family violence policing, and one of the peer reviewers said: ‘Isn’t there anything positive to say? Were there instances of good police conduct preceding domestic and family violence deaths?’“And I had a long, hard look at my materials and, quite honestly, there was not. It was the same story again and again … it would be harmful when women would call police and police wouldn’t respond … or they would respond and not do anything and they would leave.”The 100-day review of the Queensland police service (QPS) proposes walking back officers’ involvement in domestic and family violence matters. It says case management – essentially the process of helping to protect women who are going through the process of getting a domestic violence order –is not “core business”.47:41Broken trust: how police failed Hannah Clarke and other women they were supposed to protect – video“The perceived primacy of the QPS in dealing with the socially complex issue of DFV has compounded internal demand through more specialised training, administrative burden, compliance mechanisms and specialist functions,” the review said.“All the while, the treatment of underlying causes – something definitively out of the control of the QPS – remains a vexing issue for government and other agencies.”The same sentiment was repeated by a deputy commissioner, Cameron Harsley, who told Guardian Australia the QPS takes domestic violence “very seriously”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Few of these reforms have worked. Women continue to die at record rates.Several families who spoke to Guardian Australia for Broken trust were told by coroners that, because reforms had been enacted, there was no need for an inquest into their loved one’s death.Others are told nothing more could have been done.In 2012 the former state coroner Michael Barnes deliveredhis findingsabout the deaths of Paul Rogers, Tania Simpson, their five-year-old daughter, Kyla, and Simpson’s friend Antony Way. Rogers fatally stabbed Simpson and Way after breaking into his estranged partner’s home. He then killed Kyla and himself.The inquest detailed how a police officer did not consider the killer’s prior controlling behaviour to be domestic violence.View image in fullscreenFlowers left for Hannah Clarke and her three children after her estranged husband set their car alight.Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP“It is tempting to say that nothing could have been done,” Barnes said at the time.“But in my view that is not good enough. This was not an isolated case. On average, over the last six years, 24 people have died in Queensland every year as a result of domestic and family violence. Nearly half of all homicides committed during that period involve domestic or family violence.“There is no reason to believe that this terrible toll will diminish if we simply continue to do what we have been doing. More families will suffer the agonising loss of children, grandchildren, parents and siblings dying at the hands of those who should be their fiercest protectors.”Cameron Harsley retired from the role of deputy commissioner of the Queensland Police Service in SeptemberIn Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

It would add to the company’splans to build a 12,000ha solar farmat Powell Creek Station, south of Elliott, as part of its proposedAustralia-Asia Power Linkproject.The proposed development at Muckaty Station in the Barkly region would clear an estimated 50,000ha of land – the equivalent of about 25,000 MCGs – including habitat critical to the survival of the bilby, according to documents SunCable lodged with the NT Environment Protection Authority.The SunCable chief executive, Ryan Willemsen-Bell, said the company’s combined NT developments offered “a compelling proposition to attract global investment in an AI datacentre precinct”.Sun Cable: Mike Cannon-Brookes takes charge of ‘world-changing’ solar projectRead moreBut the scale of the Muckaty proposal has sparked concern from the territory’s peak environmental organisation, the Environment Centre NT (ECNT), which said the size was “simply gobsmacking and is possibly unparalleled in Australia, or for that matter the world”.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterA SunCable spokesperson said the company had been in talks with “global hyperscalers” – a term for companies that build and operate large datacentres for the provision of cloud computing services – during the past 18 months.The unnamed companies were seeking access to “low cost, low carbon energy solutions” that could supply first datacentre operations in the Barkly region by 2028 “and then scale to support increasing demands for next-generation AI infrastructure in the years following”, they said.Willemsen-Bell said SunCable could provide off-grid infrastructure that could reduce the impact of datacentres “on the delicate energy balance of the national electricity market”.“This is a pivotal opportunity for Australia to establish itself as a global leader in sustainable AI infrastructure, digital technology and green industrial development. Australia can lead – not be left behind,” he said.On Monday, SunCable reached an agreement with traditional owners and the Northern Land Council for the construction of the 12,000ha solar farm on Powell Creek Station.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company’s spokesperson said further studies in consultation with traditional owners would help inform the selection of smaller sites within the 50,000ha “area of interest”.Kirsty Howey, the executive director of the ECNT, said the environment group was particularly concerned “about the potential destruction of swathes of bilby habitat, one of Australia’s most iconic animals, as well as potential impacts on precious water resources in this arid region”.“We understand this project is primarily about supplying energy to industrial customers,” she said. “We are concerned that it won’t deliver energy security to communities in the Barkly region, who are experiencing chronic energy poverty and injustice amid worsening impacts of climate change.”Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems researcher at the University of New South Wales, said it was difficult to tell how much of the public discussion about potential datacentre demand for energy from Australian projects was just “hype”.“There’s questions about how much of this demand for datacentres is actually going to materialise,” McConnell said.SunCable’s spokesperson acknowledged the scale and said the company understood “large projects attract close scrutiny”.“The purpose of this process is to gather evidence, refine the project footprint and ensure responsible design before any decisions are made.”They said the company was committed to avoiding or mitigating effects of the project on the bilby and to “sustainable use of water resources”.Explore more on these topicsEnergyNorthern TerritorySolar powerRenewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

This is important,” Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine would issue no “rash” statements.“The number one task for everyone is a constructive diplomatic process with America and all our partners. It is vital to have stable support for our army and all our planned defence operations and deep strikes.”The cautious response from Ukraine’s presidential administration followed angry denouncements of the plan by some Ukrainian officials who called it “absurd” and unacceptable.According to reports, the sweeping 28-point proposal closely resembles demands made by Moscow soon after its full-scale invasion in early 2022. It was reportedly drawn up by Russian and US officials, with support from Trump. Kyiv was not consulted. One European diplomat said they learned of the plan only when they turned on the news.Ukraine mapIt envisages Kyiv giving up Crimea and the Donbas region, while the frontlines of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia would be frozen along the current line of contact. Ukraine would agree to limit its army to 600,000 personnel, a reductions of hundreds of thousands.European fighter jets would be based in Poland to protect Ukraine, but no Nato troops would be stationed in Ukraine and Kyiv would agree never to join the military alliance, according to the plan seen by Axios and AFP.No foreign troops would be allowed on Ukrainian soil, a condition that rules out a post-deal peacekeeping force led by the UK and France. But the US would provide unspecified security guarantees,according to Axios. In addition, $100bn in frozen Russian assets would be dedicated to rebuilding Ukraine. There would also be a path to reintegrating Russia in the global economy, including the future lifting of sanctions, according to the Associate Press.Ukrainian officials said the document amounted to the effective end of its existence as an independent country. It comes nearly four years after Russian troops tried and failed to seize Kyiv, and as efforts by the Trump administration to end the conflict remain stalled.Zelenskyy held talks on Thursday with a high-rankingUS militarydelegation, led by the army secretary Dan Driscoll.Driscoll – a former classmate of the US vice-president, JD Vance – arrived in Kyiv bearing important messages from the White House, US sources indicated. He is likely to travel to Moscow at the end of next week to discuss the plan with the Kremlin, they said.View image in fullscreenThe US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, left, met the Ukrainian defence minister, Denys Shmyhal, in Kyiv.Photograph: APAmerican diplomats said Donald Trump was trying to achieve peace “with an incredible sense of momentum”.His administration was pursuing an “aggressive timeline” with the Ukrainians to reach an agreement, they added, and wanted to achieve this in the “shortest possible” period. The White House said the plan was “good” for both sides, rejecting concerns that it echoes many of Moscow’s demands.After an hour-long, one-to-one meeting between Driscoll and Zelenskyy, the chargé d’affaires at the US embassy in Kyiv, Julie Davis, said: “We have witnessed today a remarkable pace of diplomatic activity. We are going to continue these efforts today and tomorrow and keep at this.”Officials in Kyiv were unimpressed. They said the proposal – reportedly drafted by Kirill Dmitriev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff – was a “provocation”, the aim of which was to stir up division and “disorientate” Ukraine’s allies,they added.“There are currently no signs that the Kremlin is ready for serious negotiations. Putin is trying to stall for time and avoid US sanctions,”said Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Ukraine’s foreign policy parliamentary committee.“It means capitulation, for Ukraine, for Europe and for America,” said Roman Kostenko, a Ukrainian commander and politician.View image in fullscreenKirill Dmitriev, a Putin adviser and ally, ‘has spun this plan at a time when Zelenskyy is weak’, said one western diplomat.Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersLast week, Trump named Driscoll as his new “special representative”. His mission to Kyiv included explaining the White House’s latest peace plan, as well as military meetings and discussions concerning battlefield innovation, a US official said. Two four-star generals travelled with him.Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special representative to Ukraine, has reportedly planned his departure, saying he would leave in January after a year in the post. Kellogg is regarded as being broadly sympathetic to Ukraine and has been consequently left out of direct US-Russian talks.The White House’s renewed push to force Ukraine to make significant concessions in pursuit of “peace” comes at a difficult time for Zelenskyy, who is embroiled in the biggest political scandal since he became president in 2019.His formerbusiness partner Timur Mindichandat least two government ministersare accused of involvement in a large-scale bribery scheme. Several deputies from Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party have called on the president to dismiss Andriy Yermak, his powerful chief of staff.One western diplomat said the Russians were seeking to take advantage of Ukraine’s domestic crisis.“It seems Dmitriev has spun this plan at a time when Zelenskyy is weak. The Russians are good at exploiting things,” they said. “It feels like every other Russian plan. I don’t think it’s going to fly with Ukraine.”The diplomat said the Kremlin’s demands concerning the Russian language were a “hook” it could later exploit. The proposal did not offer the kind of security assurances Ukraine would need from the US and its European allies for any deal to stick, they added.Europe calls for role in Ukraine talks amid reported US-Russian peace dealRead moreEuropean leaders meeting in Brussels said they had not been warned in advance about the latest White House initiative.The Trump administration no longer provided direct military aid to Kyiv, a fact that reduced its ability to impose a Moscow-friendly peace settlement on Ukraine, one source noted.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said Europe welcomed any efforts to achieve a long-lasting and just settlement of the war, but stressed: “For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.”Kallas said the Dmitriev-Witkoff proposal did not envisage Russia making any concessions. “We have to understand that in this war, there is one aggressor and one victim. If Russia really wanted peace, it could have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already some time ago.”The British government said it backed Trump’s desire to “bring this barbaric war to an end”.0:47Moment Russian missile strikes apartment block in Ukraine – videoBut it emphasised that “only the Ukrainian people can determine their future” and said Russia could end the fighting tomorrow by pulling out troops and ending its “illegal invasion”.US efforts to broker peace have hit roadblocks since Trumpmet Putin in Alaskain August. The US president subsequently imposedsanctions on Russia’s oil industry, in an apparent attempt to push Putin to the negotiating table.Trump said last month that he wasputting on hold his planfor a meeting with the Russian president in Budapest because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time”.In recent months Russia hasincreased its systematic attackson Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, plunging much of the country into darkness. On Wednesday it bombed several western cities, including Ternopil, where 26 people, including three children, were killed in their homes.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyUS militaryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We welcome all the meaningful efforts to end this war, but like we have said before, it has to be just and lasting. That also means that the Ukrainians, but also the Europeans, agree to this.”View image in fullscreenThe EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: ‘We haven’t seen any concessions on the Russian side.’Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty ImagesMinisters were solid and calm about the latest plan, Kallas told reporters after the meeting, “because we have seen this before, and because different peace plans cannot work if the Europeans and Ukrainians do not agree to this”.She stressed the EU would continue working on sanctions to increase pressure on Russia: “The EU has a very clear two-point plan: first, weaken Russia; second, support Ukraine.”The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, sounded a similar note. “All negotiations about a ceasefire, regarding the further peaceful development of Ukraine, can only be discussed and negotiated with Ukraine,” he said. “And Europe will have to be included.”The draftUS-Russian peace plan, which emerged in media reports on Wednesday, would require Ukraine to surrender territory and cede unprecedented control over its political and military sovereignty to Russia. It came after a massive Russian drone and military attack on western Ukrainekilled at least 26 peopleand injured more than 100 in their apartments.Jean-Noël Barrot, the French foreign minister, said peace could not mean capitulation. “The principle of peace must start with a ceasefire on the line of contact which will allow engagement in discussions on the questions of territories and security guarantees. That is what we have always said, that is what Ukraine has always said … But what we see today is that Russia andVladimir Putinare an obstacle to peace.”Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, who was expected to inform his counterparts about thesabotage attack on Poland’s railway networkthis week, said: “We commend peace efforts. But Europe is the main player, the main supporter of Ukraine, and it is, of course, Europe’s security that’s at stake. So we expect to be consulted.”“I hope it is not the victim that has restrictions on its ability to defend itself, but it’s the aggressor whose aggressive potential should be restricted,” he added.View image in fullscreenRadosław Sikorski, Poland’s foreign minister, said Europe’s wider security was at stake in any future peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.Photograph: Czarek Sokołowski/APMinisters were meeting as Russia’s parliament said that any “confiscation” of Russian assets by the EU should draw legal action against Belgium and Euroclear, the Brussels-based depository where most of the frozen sovereign wealth is held.The EU is stalled over a plan to use Russia’s frozen assetsto generate a €140bn (£123bn) loan for Ukraine, largely because Belgium is seeking further guarantees about legal risks.

She outlined three options to fund Ukraine, but made clear she favoured a reparations loan based on the Russian frozen assets.EU leaders are to discuss the plan at a summit next month, havingfailed to reach an agreementin October. Belgium argues that the EU plan lacks crucial details, such as what happens if Russia refuses to pay reparations to Ukraine, or how the risk would be shared if Moscow suedEuroclear. The Brussels-based securities depository houses around two-thirds of all Russia’s sovereign wealth in the west.What do we know about the reported US-Russian plan to end the Ukraine war?Read moreOn Thursday the Duma – Vladimir Putin’srubberstamp parliament– voted unanimously in favour of the resolution, according to a statement on its website. “The confiscation of Russian assets – no matter how artful the disguise – cannot be conceived as anything other than a violation of Russia’s sovereign rights,” it said. “Any infringement of Russian assets must draw an appropriate legal response, starting with claims for damages – with the demand for the seizure of property as a security measure – towards Euroclear and Belgium.”Euroclear declined to comment, but referred to an interview its chief executive, Valérie Urbain, gave to Le Monde earlier this month. Anything that remotely resembled confiscationwould be illegal, she told the paper: “We must be extremely vigilant,” she said, warning that Russia could take legal action.Kallas did not refer to the Duma vote directly, but said Russia was afraid of the reparations loan, suggesting that explained Moscow’s interest in the latest peace plan. “I think they are coming to the point where they are running out of money and they want to show outside that they are super strong ... but actually it’s not the case,” she said.In Brussels on Thursday, Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, voiced his government’s typical hostility to EU efforts to support Ukraine, saying it would be unimaginable to “send the money of the Hungarian people to a corrupt Ukrainian war mafia”. This is a likely reference tothe corruption scandal engulfing Ukraine’s government, which Budapest has seized on to bolster its anti-Ukraine stance.Explore more on these topicsEuropeEuropean UnionUkraineVladimir PutinUrsula von der LeyenRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Apoll last monthrevealed that more than 21% of those surveyed felt the Franco era was “good” or “very good”, whilea poll on Thursday for El Paísfound almost a quarter of Spaniards aged 18 to 28 felt that an authoritarian regime could sometimes be preferable to a democratic one.Inan opinion piecefor the online newspaper elDiario.es, Sánchez hailed Spain’s “almost unique” democratic progress over the past 50 years, saying the country had “gone from being a repressive dictatorship to being a full democracy, and from being a poor and isolated country to one that is prosperous and integrated in the world”.But the prime minister, who pointedly did not refer to Franco by name, also noted that “democracy didn’t fall from the sky”, adding that today’s freedoms had been secured by the determination and resilience of the Spanish people.“No democracy – including ours – is perfect,” he wrote. “Much remains to be done to forge theSpainwe want and that we can be: a place of more opportunity; more rights and less inequality. Being conscious of all that is what will help us move forward and improve. And that is why it is precisely now – when some idealise authoritarian regimes and cling to the nostalgia of a past that never was – that we must step forward in defence of a freedom that was wrenched from us for so many years.”The government has usedhistorical memory legislationintroduced three years ago to try to help Spain come to terms with its past. As well as redesignating the Valley of Cuelgamuros – previously known as the Valley of the Fallen,where Franco’s remains lay for 44 years– as a “place of memory”, it is compiling an inventory of the goods seized by the regime and is working to strip Spain of the last vestiges of Francoist symbols.View image in fullscreenThe Valley of the Fallen, now known as the Valley of Cuelgamuros, which once held the remains of Francisco Franco.

Reprisals continued well after Franco’s victory in 1939, and the bodies of more than 100,000 people killed during the war and in its aftermath are estimated to lie in unmarked mass graves.After the dictator’s death, Spain embarked on the transition back to democracy, holdingits first free election in 41 years in 1977andapproving a new constitutionin a referendum the following year.Explore more on these topicsFrancisco FrancoSpainEuropePedro SáncheznewsShareReuse this content"

InFrance,bandes dessinées,known as BD, are lauded as the “ninth art” and are popular among adults as well as younger readers.Announcing she was withdrawing €200,000 (£176,000) of public subsidies for the event until a shake-up in the way it was run, the culture minister, Rachida Dati, said on Tuesday she hoped the 2026 festival would nonetheless go ahead. She had invited those boycotting it to a meeting, she added.The culture ministry said on Wednesday it was hard to see it happening as scheduled in late January if the boycott was maintained. “Realistically, if there are no authors or publishers, it’s hard to see how the festival can happen in 2026,” a spokesperson said. “We are at a turning point in the history of the festival, which is in difficulty and in danger.”View image in fullscreenCancelling the festival would be ‘a catastrophe’ for the area in ‘an already fragile economic situation’, said the local MP, Caroline Colombier.Photograph: Yohan Bonnet/AFP/Getty ImagesThe row centres on the way the festival, first held in 1974, is managed and organised. It is run by a non-profit association but has been put on by the private company 9eArt+ since 2007.Franck Bondoux, the director of 9eArt+, announced he was stepping down last week after it was reported that a female member of staff had been fired after going to the police to report a rape during the 2024 festival.The woman’s sacking outraged writers, cartoonists and publishers. On Sunday, 285 female authors published a letter of support for her, and called for a “girlcott” of the festival on social media. Critics are also deeply unhappy with 9eArt+, claiming a lack of transparency in its organisation of the event. Bondoux has denied the allegations over his management.The boycott came after the company’s association with the festival was renewed beyond 2027. Among those who have threatened to stay away in 2026 are the prize-winning comic book authorsRiad Sattouf, Maus creatorArt Spiegelmanand last year’s winner of the grand prix of the city of Angoulême, Anouk Ricard.A letter signed by 22 former winners of the festival’s top prizes said: “It is high time to turn the page on 9eArt+ so the festival can regain the values that helped build its international reputation with new operators.”It had been hoped that Bondoux standing down would calm critics, but the French national publishing union, which represents 24 major publishing houses, said in a statement on Wednesday: “Given this large-scale movement [to boycott], which they understand, publishers believe the 2026 edition can no longer go ahead.”Caroline Colombier, the local member of parliament, said cancelling the event would be “a catastrophe” for the local area in what she said was “an already fragile economic situation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The woman has also taken her case to the Paris industrial tribunal to contest her dismissal, which she said was a consequence of the complaint.9eArt+ said it had fired the employee for “serious misconduct” shortly before the end of her probationary period due to “behaviour incompatible with the image of the company”.In February Bondoux told Le Parisien her dismissal was “in no way related to what may have happened in terms of an alleged rape. We were not aware of this when we decided to dismiss the individual.”He added: “The company did not fail in its obligations … Of course, we accept and hear the employee’s account of being raped, but these events took place outside the company.”Responding to criticisms of the management culture at 9eArt+, Bondoux said: “Who is talking about toxic management? An unsourced statement … If that were the case, action would have been taken by employees.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

InGazaCity, medical officials said two airstrikes killed 16 people, including seven children and three women.Israel said itlaunched the attacksafter its soldiers came under fire in Khan Younis on Wednesday, though they suffered no reported casualties. Hamas condemned the Israeli strikes as a “shocking massacre” and denied firing toward Israeli troops.Palestinians in Gaza said they felt as if the two-year war had never stopped. Officials in the territory say more than 300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes since the ceasefire.“My daughter kept asking me all night, ‘Will the war come back?’ Every time we try to regain hope, the shelling starts again. When will this nightmare end?” Lina Kuraz, 33, from the Tuffah neighbourhood, east of Gaza City, told Agence France-Presse.Mohammed Hamdouna, 36, who was displaced from northern Gaza to a tent in al-Mawasi, said the war had not ended. “The intensity of the death toll has decreased, but martyrs and shelling happen every day. We are still living in tents. The cities are rubble; the crossings are still closed, and all the basic necessities of life are still lacking,” he said.View image in fullscreenIsraeli airstrikes on camps in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, killed 17 people on Wednesday, hospital officials said.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersQatar, a key mediator throughout the two-year war, condemned the “brutal” Israeli airstrikes, saying they were “a dangerous escalation that threatens to undermine the ceasefire agreement”.On Monday the UN security council endorsed Donald Trump’s plan for Gaza, including the deployment of aninternational stabilisation forceand a possible path to a sovereign Palestinian state.Shelter and food in desperately short supply as Gaza braces for harsh winterRead moreHowever, huge challenges remain. It is unclear how Hamas will be made to relinquish its weapons, who will supply the troops for the new peacekeeping force, and how “full aid” will reach Gaza without Israel lifting many of its current restrictions on humanitarian supplies.Hamas is still holding the remains of three hostages, and Israeli military forces hold more than 50% of Gaza after withdrawing from some of their positions at the time of the ceasefire. The territory is now divided by the “yellow line”.Gaza’s health ministry has reported more than 300 deaths since the ceasefire came into effect, an average of more than seven a day. Each side has accused the other of violating its terms, which include increasing the flow of aid into Gaza and returning hostages, dead or alive, to Israel.The two-year war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 during a surprise attack into Israel in October 2023. More than 69,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the ensuring Israeli offensive and in strikes since the ceasefire. The bodies of thousands moreremain under the rubble.The new violence in Gaza coincided with a barrage of Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon on Wednesday. A day earlier, an Israeli airstrike killed 13 people in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh, the deadliest Israeli attack on Lebanon since a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict a year ago.Agence France-Presse andthe Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

In the UK, abouta quarter of older teenagersand up to a fifth of younger children have anxiety, depression or other mental health problems.In the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance says under-18s with moderate to severe depressioncan be prescribed antidepressants alongside therapy.But a new review of trial data by academics in Austria and the UK concluded that fluoxetine, sold under the brand name of Prozac among others, is clinically no better than placebo drugs in treating depression in children, and should therefore no longer be prescribed to them.The authors conducted a meta analysis of 12 large trials involving Prozac, published between 1997 and 2024, and concluded that fluoxetine improved children’s depressive symptoms so little as to not be considered clinically meaningful.“Consider the analogy of a weight-loss drug that is better than placebo at producing weight loss, but the difference is only 100 grams,” said Martin Plöderl, a clinical psychologist at Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg, Austria, and lead author of the study. “This difference is unlikely to be noticeable to the patient or their doctors or produce any difference in their overall condition.”The study, published in theJournal of Clinical Epidemiology, identified a “novelty bias” in early trials, which were likely to be more positive, while later studies fail to confirm these effects. It concludes that the potential risks of harmful side-effects of fluoxetine are likely to outweigh any potential clinical benefit.The most common side-effects experienced by children on antidepressants are weight gain, sleep disturbance and concentration problems. They can also increase suicidal ideation.Children detained under Mental Health Act held for hours in A&E departmentsRead moreThe authors also examined clinical guidelines in the US and Canada and found that just as in the UK, they ignored evidence that Prozac was clinically equivalent to placebo and continued to recommend its use for children and adolescents with depression.Mark Horowitz, an associate professor of psychiatry at Adelaide University and a co-author of the study, said: “Fluoxetine is clearly clinically equivalent to placebo in its benefits, but is associated with greater side effects and risks. It is difficult to see how anyone can justify exposing young people to a drug with known harms when it has no advantage over placebo in its benefits.“Guidelines should not recommend treatments that are equivalent to placebo. Many clinicians take the common-sense approach that we should seek to understand why the young person feels depressed and address the factors that are contributing to it.“Guidelines in the UK and around the world currently recommend treatments for children with depression that are not in line with the best evidence. This exposes young people to the risks of medication without any benefit over placebo.”The long-term effects of antidepressants in children and adolescents were “poorly understood” and research among adults showed risks included serious side effects that may be long-term and in some cases persist after stopping the medication, he added.Responding to the findings, a Nice spokesperson said: “Mental health is a priority for Nice and we recognise that depression in young people is a serious condition that affects each differently, which is why having a range of treatment options is essential for clinicians. Our guideline recommends a choice of psychological therapies as first line treatment options for children and young people with depression.“Nice recommends that children and young people with moderate or severe depression are reviewed by specialist teams. Antidepressants may be considered in combination with psychological therapy for moderate to severe depression in some cases and only under regular specialist supervision.”Prof Allan Young, chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Academic Faculty, said that the study should be interpreted with “caution”. “Clinical guidelines weigh many factors beyond average effect size, including safety, feasibility, and patient preferences. It is important that prescribed medication demonstrate consistent evidence and safety data,” he said.In the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.

But Kendall told the Guardian: “They know that if they don’t implement [and] use the powers that they’ve got in the act, they will lose the trust of the public.”Last week, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after viewing harmful online content, said he hadlost trust in the watchdog’s leadership.Kendall did not give her backing when asked about her own trust in the regulator’s leadership on Thursday.The tech secretary was speaking amid concerns that parts of the online safety regime are not expected to come into effect until the middle of 2027 – nearly four years since the Online Safety Act became law – and that, in the meantime, the speed at which the technological frontier is advancing risks outpacing government guardrails.Kendall said she was now “really worried about AI chatbots” and “the impact they’re having on children and young people”.The dangers have been highlighted by US lawsuits involving teenagers who took their own lives after becoming highly engaged withChatGPTand Character.AI chatbots, which they treated as confidants and advisers.“If chatbots aren’t included or properly covered by the legislation, and we’re really working through that now, then they will have to be,” Kendall said. “People have got to feel their kids are safe.”Ofcom’s chair, Michael Grade, is due to step down in April, prompting a search for a new leader. Dawes, a career civil servant, has been in post as chief executive for nearly six years. Ofcom declined to comment.View image in fullscreenMichael Grade will soon leave his role as chair of Ofcom.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesOn Thursday, the watchdog fined a “nudify” app £50,000 for failing to protect children from accessing pornography. Nudify apps typically use AI to “undress” uploaded photos.Kendall said Ofcom was “rightly pressing forward”. It was the second fine issued by the regulator under the act since it became law more than two years ago.Kendall was speaking in Cardiff at the launch of a new AI “growth zone”, which the government hopes will attract £10bn in investment and create 5,000 jobs on various sites stretching from the Ford Bridgend engine plant to Newport.The government said Microsoft was one of the companies “joining forces with the government”, but Microsoft said it was not making any new investment commitments.Ministers are also hoping to use £100m to back British startups, particularly in designing the chips that power AI, where the government believes the UK has a competitive advantage. But it may be tough to compete with the US chip manufacturer Nvidia, which this week reported it is making nearly $22bn a month.‘Enforced veganism’: Ofcom lets GB News flout accuracy rules, say climate campaignersRead moreOn Wednesday, a Labour MP alleged Microsoft hasbeen “ripping off” the UK taxpayer. The US tech company made at least £1.9bn from government deals in the financial year 2024-25.Asked if she agreed, Kendall praised Microsoft’s AI technology, as used in her own constituency to create school lesson plans, but said: “We’ve got to do more to make sure that we have got the right people in the room who know about those companies and can negotiate the best possible deal. I would also like to see more homegrown companies, particularly in AI.”A spokesperson for Microsoft said the NHS buys its services through a national pricing framework negotiated by the UK government, “ensuring both transparency and value for money” and that its partnerships provide “measurable benefits”.“The UK government chooses to spend its technology budget across a variety of suppliers and Microsoft is privileged to be one of them,” they said.In the UK, the youth suicide charityPapyruscan be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or emailpat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Instead, throughout the pandemic, Boris Johnson put his political reputation ahead of public safety.“He pandered to his critics when the UK needed decisive action.“In delaying lockdowns he made them longer, more damaging to the economy and less effective, he ignored scientific advice that didn’t fit his agenda, and he ignored the impact of his decisions on the front line, repeating the mistakes of the first wave and prolonging the second.”ShareUpdated at12.18 EST"

The industry’s move for increased access also marks an effort to increase jobs and US energy independence,according to the Associated Press.The federal government has prohibited offshore drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which extends fromFloridashores to portions of Alabama, since 1995. The ban stemmed from worries about potential oil spills.How a Texas shrimper stalled Exxon’s $10bn plastics plant | Shilpi ChhotrayRead moreWhileCaliforniadoes have some offshore oil development, there have not been new leases in federal waters for nearly 30 years, the AP said.A proposed schedule for petroleum leasing in federal waters includes up to 34 auctions from 2026 to 2031; these auctions include up to six sales off California’s coastline, 21 off of Alaska’s coastline, and two in the Gulf of Mexico’s eastern portion, Politico said. The sales inAlaskawould reportedly include a region that has never had oil drilling.The move reflects Trump’s dogged efforts to roll back former president Joe Biden’s efforts against global heating. Trump has described climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, and launched a National Energy Dominance Council to boost domestic energy production, with an emphasis on fossil fuels, AP noted.Trump has simultaneously thwarted renewable energy development including offshore windfarms. His administration has also axed billions in green energy grants, the AP said.California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, a Trump foe weighing a presidential run, rejected offshore drilling expansion, calling it “dead on arrival”.Offshore oil development has faced bipartisan opposition in Florida, where unblemished beaches and sparkling waters underpin the state’s $131bntourism industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It simply stated: “HHS [health and human services] has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.”The changes appear to be the latest example of Kennedy’s determination to impose his beliefs on the sprawling Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC. They also triggered severe backlash from scientists and advocates, with former and present CDC staff saying the updated page did not go through the normal, scientific clearance process.“I spoke with several scientists at CDC yesterday and none were aware of this change in content,” Debra Houry, one of a group of CDC top officials who resigned in August, told the AP.“When scientists are cut out of scientific reviews, then inaccurate and ideologic information results.”The move was also condemned by theAutismScience Foundation, an organization that initially gave a cautious welcome to Kennedy’s stated mission to investigate the causes of autism – a disorder that can manifest itself in speech difficulties and repetitive behavior – after his confirmation.“We are appalled to find that the content on the CDC webpage ‘Autism and Vaccines’ has been changed and distorted, and is now filled with anti-vaccine rhetoric and outright lies about vaccines and autism,” the foundation said in a statement.Aprevious versionof the page stated that “studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD). No links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.”Widespread scientific consensus and decades of studies have firmly concluded there is no link between vaccines and autism.Pediatricians fill vaccine messaging void left by CDC amid bad flu seasonRead more“The conclusion is clear and unambiguous,” said Dr Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a statement Thursday.“We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations.”The CDC has, until now, echoed the absence of a link in promoting Food and Drug Administration-licensed vaccines. A number of former CDC officials have said that what the CDC posts about certain subjects – including vaccine safety – can no longer be trusted.Dr Daniel Jernigan, who also resigned from the agency in August, told reporters that Kennedy seems to be “going from evidence-based decision making to decision-based evidence making”.Besides positing a link between vaccines and autism, Kennedy has subscribed to thebelief that the condition may be caused by pregnant people taking Tylenol, a suspicion pushed vociferously by Donald Trump, who has urged expectant mothers to avoid taking the over-the-counter drug.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationVaccines and immunisationRobert F Kennedy JrAutismHealthUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the relief dissipated, and technology stocks at the heart of the AI boom came under pressure.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.6%, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.8% in New York. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite closed down 2.2%.Earlier in the day, the FTSE 100 had closed up 0.2% in London while the Dax had risen 0.5% in Frankfurt. The Nikkei 225 had climbed 2.65% in Tokyo.Nvidia, now valued at some $4.4tn, has led an extraordinary surge in the valuations of AI-related firms in recent months. As firms splurge on chips and data centers in a bid to get a foothold in AI, fears of a bubble have mounted.While Nvidia’shighly anticipatedearnings exceeded expectations on Wednesday, as the chipmaker continues to enjoy robust demand, concerns persist around the firms using those chips to invest in AI, spending heavily and driving that demand.“The people who are selling the semiconductors to help power AI doesn’t alleviate the concerns that some of these hyper-scalers are spending way too much money on building the AI infrastructure,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth. “You have the company that’s benefiting it, but the others are still spending too much money.”Amixed jobs report on Thursday morning, which revealed healthy growth in the labor market in September but a slight rise in unemployment, also reinforced expectations that policymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely keep interest rates on hold at their next meeting, in December.Shares in Nvidia sank 3.2%.

And a previous estimate for jobs growth in August was downgraded – revealing an unexpected decline in the US workforce.bar chart of jobs growthThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revised down previous readings for July and August, which had already raised fears that growth in the labor market had stalled in recent months.The agency now estimates that theUS economyadded 72,000 jobs in July, down from 79,000, and shed 4,000 jobs in August, down from growth of 22,000.Trading on Wall Street was volatile. Boosted bystrong results from chipmaker Nvidia, US markets rose initially. The benchmark S&P 500 was up 1.7% during the morning session in New York, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.1%.However, the rally later fizzled as investor jitters resurfaced. By early afternoon the S&P was down 0.7% and the Nasdaq was down 0.9%. Nvidia was also down 0.9%.September’s jobs report was initially scheduled to be released in October, only to be delayed by the shutdown. ADP’s unofficial private sector jobs report for Septembernoteda loss of 29,000 jobs; itsreportfor October pointed to an increase of 42,000 jobs.The complete official jobs report for October will not be released, the BLS said on Wednesday, as a result of the prolonged shutdown, during which data collection and processing wasnot conducted. Official data on the number of jobs created or lost in October will be released alongside the full report for November, in mid-December, according to the BLS.With policymakers at the Federal Reserve due to convene for their latest interest rate-setting meeting in the coming weeks, Thursday’s data release strengthened expectations that they will probably sit on their hands and keep rates on hold.Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at OxfordEconomics, said: “The September jobs report may be backward looking but offers reassurance that the labor market wasn’t crumbling before the government shutdown. There is nothing in the data to warrant a change to our forecast for the Federal Reserve to leave rates unchanged at the December meeting.”Sagging job numbers incited Donald Trump tofirethe BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer in August, following a weak July jobs report, as Trump made baseless claims the numbers were “rigged” to make him and Republicans look bad.On Thursday, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democratic senator, said: “After sitting on it for weeks,Donald Trumpfinally released the September jobs report showing the unemployment rate is up. Businesses have announced a record number of layoffs, and hiring has slowed since Trump took office. It’s not surprising that he’s now refusing to release the October jobs report, despite the administration’s legal obligation to publish employment data each month.“Trump says he wants lower interest rates, but is withholding the very data the Federal Reserve needs to make that decision next month. And it’ll be working families who will pay the price.”Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment dataUS interest ratesUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The party finished about 21 points ahead of the Democrats when the seat was last contested, alongsideDonald Trump’s victory in the presidential election last November.Twelve months on, that lead has narrowed dramatically, according to opinion polls – and a challenger is attempting to build a “coalition of the pissed off” to overturn it altogether.With a special election scheduled for next month, Democrats have nominated Aftyn Behn, aprogressivestate representative in the district, as their candidate. As Trump’s approval ratingcontinues to fallamid cost-of-living concerns, she is attempting to stage the biggest challenge in a generation to Republicans in the district, and flip the seat for the first time since1983.“If you are dissatisfied, if you are not OK with what’s going on, then I’m your candidate,” Behn said. “If you think things are fine, I am not your candidate. If you are upset with the cost and chaos, I am your candidate.“We have been working to build a coalition of the disenchanted, a coalition of the pissed off, and I think it’s working to our favor.”After the resignation of the Republican representative Mark Green earlier this year, the party tapped Matt Van Epps, an army veteransupportedby several billionaires and publicly backed by Trump.Two separate pollsput Van Epps just eight points ahead of his Democratic rival.Van Epps did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the race, which amounts to a key test for the Democratic party and its ability to tap into voters’ indignation toward Trump amid persistent inflation and affordability concerns.Voters in Tennessee’s seventh congressional district seat, which comprises parts of Nashville, and middle and westTennessee, will head to the polls on 2 December. Early voting has begun.Ken Martin, the Democratic National Committee chair, hascampaignedwith Behn, and the DNC has been providing volunteers and phone bank support. Kamala Harris made asurprise appearanceat an event for Behn this week, her first event as a campaign surrogate since leaving office. Trump, meanwhile,hosteda tele-rally with Van Epps last week, and the Republican National Committee has devoted similar resources and funding to his campaign.‘Epicenter of the crisis’“Tennessee is a state that has bought and sold to the highest bidder, and politicians are doing that bidding,” said Behn. “My campaign doesn’t acceptcorporate Pac[political action committee] money. We are not bankrolled by special interests. Unfortunately, that is the legacy right now, which I’m trying to break.”Under Trump, the federal government “has not delivered on their promise of affordability”, said Behn. “And Tennessee is at the epicenter of the affordability crisis.“We have some of the most expensive housing and rent. It is one of the worst places for workers in the country. We’re hitting all these metrics that are making it nearly impossible to survive in the state, which is why I’m running.”Tennessee is 10th in the US states in Consumer Affairs’grocery cost burden rankings, which measure the share of income consumers in each state are required to spend on groceries. Housing has meanwhile become increasingly expensive across the state, according to the non-partisan policy research centerSycamore Institute, which attributed this to growing population, the Covid-19 pandemic, and a lag in home construction.Behn recently led acampaignagainst a push by Elon Musk’s Boring Company to build a high-speed underground tunnel for Tesla vehicles from downtown Nashville to the city’s airport. Despite vast localopposition, state Republicans circumvented local officials to unanimously provide the firm with access to state-owned land at no cost. Construction began last month.“Unfortunately, our government right now works clandestinely for the puppet masters rather than the people,” added Behn. “It’s a fight that I was willing to take, and I think it can be extrapolated to the broader resentment towards the billionaire boys’ club, and these multinational greedy corporations, selling us out and rigging the system in favor of themselves.”In Tennessee, Medicaid cuts under Trump and the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies areestimatedto increase the uninsured population in the state by 210,000 people by 2034, according to analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.At the same time, Trump’s tariffs are hitting the state hard, with areportby Pew Research finding last month that Tennessee is one of the states most vulnerable to tariffs, as global products contributed 21.9% of its gross domestic product in 2024.Van Epps has refused to participate in a debate with Behn ahead of the election. Her campaign has sought to create entry points for voters curious, or willing, to cross party lines. Behn has appeared on conservative talk radio shows and run a field campaign designed to knock on doors throughout the district, prioritizing voter contact in a state where turnout consistently ranksamong the lowestin the US.“We’re running one of the most competitive races the state has ever seen, and I think people really appreciate that,” claimed Behn. “As a state legislator, I have organized the most town halls of any one of my colleagues. I have open communication. I’m highly accessible and that is how I’ll be as this district’s next congresswoman.“Whereas you have my opponent who is hiding from the press, hiding from the people, and only speaking to select closed-door cadres of people,” she continued. “I think it speaks to the moment – how you have a fighter for government, transparency, accountability, who believes in everyone participating in our democracy, versus a closed-door, special-interest candidate, who only is beholden to a special group of people, of which most folks don’t have access to.”Explore more on these topicsTennesseeUS politicsHouse of RepresentativesDemocratsDonald TrumpTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both sides have blamed the other.‘Red cup rebellion’: striking Starbucks baristas urge customers to stay awayRead moreProminent politicians includingZohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, have backed the striking workers.Why are Starbucks workers striking?Since 13 November, unionized baristas at Starbucks have been on strike. More than 2,000 workers are now on the picket line across 65 cities around the US.The open-ended unfair labor practice strike was launched on Starbucks’ “red cup day”, which typically hails the start of the lucrative holiday trading season at the coffee chain.Starbucks and Starbucks Workers United, the union, have been bargaining over the chain’s first union contract. But these talks stalled over economic elements of the contract. Each side has blamed the other.Starbucks Workers United has also filed dozens of unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board throughout its organizing campaign, including one in December, alleging that the chain had failed to bargain in good faith, and undermined the representative status of the union.“I want Starbucks to succeed. My livelihood depends on it,” said Dachi Spoltore, a striking barista from Pittsburgh. “I know that Starbucks’ success has to include and prioritize people like me who make the coffee, open the stores and keep the customers coming back. We’re proud of our work, but we’re tired of being treated like we’re disposable.“That’s why we’re taking this major step. We’re confident and clear-eyed in what we need to win a contract and resolve the legal issues. We’re risking a lot: our jobs, our livelihoods, our economic security. This might be a game to Starbucks, but it isn’t a game for us.”How many Starbucks workers are in the union?Starbucks Workers United represents 11,000 baristas at more than 550 Starbucks stores. Its organizing drive has become one of the highest-profile unionization efforts in a generation in the US.The first Starbucks storevotedto unionize, by 19 to 8, in Buffalo, New York, in December 2021, setting the stage for a wave of mobilization that swept hundreds more stores across the nation.Starbucks had actively fought unionization for decades, insisting its stores would operate best when executives at the company were able to work directly with its employees.During a US Senate committee hearing in March 2023, its longtime CEO Howard Schultz defended Starbucks’ response to the union organizing campaign andrespondedto allegations of union busting by saying: “These are allegations, and Starbucks has not broken the law.”What has Starbucks said about the strike?Starbucks has blamed the union for the lack of progress in negotiations and claimed the strike hasn’t affected operations.A spokesperson for Starbucks, Jaci Anderson, said: “Despite Workers United’s efforts to cause disruption, more than 99% of our coffeehouses remained open and our partners [employees] delivered the strongest Reusable Red Cup Day in company history building on the previous Thursday’s holiday launch which was the biggest sales day ever for the company.“We anticipate a bright holiday season and are eager to welcome customers to enjoy their favorite holiday beverage and sit and stay in one of our 17,000 locations across the US.”Anderson expressed disappointment “that Workers United, who only represents around 4% of our partners, has voted to authorize a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table”, adding: “When they’re ready to come back, we’re ready to talk.”Any contract “needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners”, she said.What’s going on at Starbucks?Starbucks is under pressure to turn its business around.In October, the coffee chain issued a press release declaring that it had delivered sales growth for the first time in seven quarters. That growth was just 1%.A sharp rise in coffee prices and softening demand have hit the firm. Its shares have fallen 10% so far this year.It has also reshuffled its top ranks several times in recent years. Schultz, who built Starbucks over several decades as CEO, abruptly returned to the role in 2022 after initially stepping down years earlier. He was succeeded by Laxman Narasimhan the following year, who was ousted after 16 months and replaced by Brian Niccol, former CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill.Niccol has pledged to revive the chain’s fortunes,unveilingjobcutsand store closures as part of an internal plan dubbed “Back to Starbucks”.What’s the latest on the strike?Starbucks Workers United claims most of the 95 stores hit by the action have been forced to close due to insufficient staffing. The action is taking place across more than 65 cities.On 19 November, the unionset upa blockade at Starbucks’ distribution center in York, Pennsylvania, the company’s largest distribution center on the US east coast.The union is threatening to escalate the campaign, dubbed “no contract, no coffee”, by adding more stores if they don’t receive new proposals and make progress with Starbucks in contract negotiations.About 92% of Starbucks Workers United members voted to authorize an open-ended unfair labor practices strike, according to the union. “Union baristas are prepared to make this the largest, and longest strike in company history during the critical holiday season,” it said in a November memo.Why are politicians getting involved?Ahead of the strike, a wave of lawmakers –26 US senatorsand82 congressional representatives– signed letters to Niccol, the current Starbucks CEO, demanding that the company reach a contract with the union. No Republicans signed either letter.New York City’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani also weighed in. “Starbucks workers across the country are on an Unfair Labor Practices strike, fighting for a fair contract,” hewroteon social media. “While workers are on strike, I won’t be buying any Starbucks, and I’m asking you to join us.”Katie Wilson, mayor-elect of Seattle, where Starbucks is based, also made a similar call. “I am not buying Starbucks and you should not either,” she said at a Starbucks Workers Unitedrally, shortly after winning the close mayoral race. “Baristas are the heart and soul of this company, and they deserve better than empty promises and corporate union busting.“This is your home town, and mine. Seattle is making some changes right now. And I urge you to do the right thing.”Explore more on these topicsStarbucksUS unionsFood & drink industryCoffeeZohran MamdaniexplainersShareReuse this content"

Many of the messages indicated a friendship that lasted well into 2019. Contact only ceased shortly before Epstein was arrested in July of that same year.Trump signs bill to compel release of more Epstein documentsRead moreTheHarvard Crimsonwas first to report the news.Steven Goldberg, the spokesperson for Summers, told the newspaper that Summers, an economist and former US treasury secretary, was not scheduled to teach next semester, and that his co-teachers will take over the remaining classes of the current semester.Summers will also take immediate leave from his role as the director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, which he has led since 2011.“Mr Summers has decided it’s in the best interest of the center for him to go on leave from his role as director as Harvard undertakes its review,”Goldberg said.The announcement comes mere days after Summers announced that he would step back from public commitments in light of the resurfaced messages with Epstein but would continue to teach.In the emails, Summers appears to ask Epstein for advice on pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman that he describes as a mentee. In one message from 2018, Epstein refers to himself as Summers’ “wingman”.Donald Trump on Wednesdaysigned a billdirecting the justice department to release more files related to Epstein. In a Truth Social post, the president referenced Epstein’s friendship with Summers, as well as other high-profile Democrats.Earlier on Wednesday, Summersresignedfrom the board of the artificial intelligence company OpenAI. “In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,” Summers said in a statement. “I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress.”Summers has stepped down or been let go from multiple high-profile appointments in recent days, including board positions at the Center for Global Development, the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the Budget Lab at Yale, and the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution.Harvard earlier investigated its ties to Epstein, finding that the disgraced financier donated about $9m to the school between 1998 and 2008.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinLarry SummersnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood that the amendment would automatically come into force in the UK were it passed in the EU, and then it would be subject to negotiations, when a specific exemption could be carved out if it was in line with the agreement.TheFoodStandards Agency is understood to have told stakeholders that UK businesses would be subject to the new EU rules on plant-based labelling, if they were adopted.The“common understanding”between the UK and EU, which underpins the deal, states on labelling: “An exception could only be agreed if: (i) it does not lead to lower standards as compared to EU rules, (ii) it does not negatively affect EU goods being placed on the market in the UK.” Government sources said these clauses would be undermined if a labelling ban took place in the EU and was not adopted in the UK.A government spokesperson told the Guardian that ministers had made a choice to align in some areas where it made sense to do so in the national interest, but that details remained subject to negotiations.View image in fullscreen‘A sausage is a sausage. Sausage is not vegan,’ the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has said.Photograph: Jenner Images/Getty ImagesJoel Scott-Halkes, the head of campaigns at WePlanet, said: “The only confusion over plant-based food labelling in Europe is exactly which shadowy livestock lobby is behind it. There’s no genuine, citizen-driven demand to ban veggie burgers or sausages – just a meat industry push to protect its profit margins from a rising tide of dietary change.”The proposed law change has been controversial in Europe. The supermarkets Aldi and Lidl, Burger King and the sausage producer Rügenwalder Mühle said in a joint open letter that banning “familiar terms” would make it “more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions”.The labelling ban has been supported by the French meat industry, and a similar proposal has been discussed by the Italian government. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has said: “A sausage is a sausage.

There is a need for transparency and clarity for the consumer and recognition for the work of our farmers.”Riley Jackson, the associate director of commercial at the cultivated meat company Ivy Farm Technologies, said: “Consumers today are savvy and capable of making informed choices. We’ve had black bean burgers and veggie sausages on shelves for decades – formats people know, love, and thus understand how to cook.“At a time when our farming communities are under immense pressure – with 51% of UK farmers considering leaving the industry – we should be welcoming solutions that could increase revenue streams to farmers, not blocking them with red tape that has nothing to do with safety or consumer awareness. Let’s focus on raising all boats by building a strong food system, not building barriers.”A government spokesperson said: “We are focused on delivering an SPS deal that could add up to £5.1bn a year to our economy by cutting costs and reducing red tape for British growers, producers and retailers.

Sheannounces her departureas the world’s No 1-ranked skier, the owner of three overall World Cup titles and three distance globes, and a four-time Olympic medalist – including thefamous 2018 team sprint goldshe won with Kikkan Randall that marked the first Olympic title in US cross-country skiing history.Jessie Diggins: ‘Eating disorders are about control when you feel like you have none’Read more“It’s time to open the next chapter of my life and it’s going to be filled with so many things,” she said Thursday in a Zoom call from Finland, where she is preparing for the season opener. “I’ve been working very, very hard for a very long time and I love what I do and I love this team … but it’s time to open the next chapter of my life.”The 34-year-old from the tiny St Paul suburb of Afton (population: 2,951) said she is looking forward to spending more time at home after years of living on the road for seven months a year. “The hard work I don’t mind, although it can be really hard on your body,” she said. “But really, it’s the travel … it makes it quite hard to have anything close to a normal life. The time has come for me to get really excited about having a normal life.”She also revealed an ultra-endurance goal: running a 100-mile race. “It’s ironic to be like, yeah, I’m going to be done cross-country ski racing so I can go run a hundred miles on trails,” she said with a laugh. “But it really lights up my soul.”Since debuting on the World Cup circuit as a teenager, Diggins has amassed 79 podiums and 29 victories. She’s also won three overall crystal globes, cross-country skiing’s biggest prize, something no woman from outside Europe had won even once until Diggins in 2021. Hertrademark glitter-streaked cheeksand relentlessly upbeat demeanor helped turn her into one of winter sport’s most visible personalities, while her ability to plunge deep into what she calls the “pain cave” made her one of its fiercest competitors. She credits her Minnesota upbringing for instilling that fighting spirit. “Minnesota raises people really tough – tough but with kindness,” she said. “It was like, ‘Nope, it’s super cold out, no problem, just put an extra jacket on.’”Jessie Diggins, by the numbersBut Diggins’ legacy extends far beyond medals. Her openness abouther long recovery from an eating disorder, and her push to improve athlete mental-health support, have made her one of the most influential advocates in the US Olympic movement. “One of the legacy pieces that I’m leaving behind is how US Ski & Snowboard handles mental health and how they support people,” she said. “When someone says, ‘Hey, I’m struggling with an eating disorder,’ there is so much help available, because I was so open and shared everything along the way.”Diggins said Thursday the decision to retire emerged gradually rather than through a single dramatic moment. “It wasn’t an a-ha moment,” she said. “Over time, all of these other things in my life that are important to me started to out-value just ski racing.”The chance to devote more time to her husband, Wade, played a major role. “When you’re 20 years old and you’re not dating anyone, being on the World Cup is great,” she said. “But then over time you’re like, oh my gosh, this gets harder and harder, and all these other things started to out-value just ski racing.”She admitted she hesitated to go public earlier this autumn, especially after an FIS official prematurely leaked her plans. “I didn’t want to share it until I was ready to have everybody in on it with me,” she said. “Now I am.”With the retirement news now public, Diggins said she will approach Milano-Cortina differently than her previous Olympics. “Telling people, yeah, this is my last Games, it frees me to enjoy it,” she said. “Even if it doesn’t go perfectly, my career is this entire body of work. I just want to be present and enjoy every single day and every single race.”View image in fullscreenJessie Diggins leads a pack during the women’s 20km mass start free at the World Cup event in February at Falun, Sweden.Photograph: Fredrik Sandberg/TT NEWS AGENCY/AFP/Getty ImagesShe expects around 60 friends and family to attend, a stark contrast to the isolation of the Covid-compromised Beijing Games. “I want to be able to share it with them,” she said.Her goal for the season, she said, is simple: to savor it. “I get to say thank you every time I leave a race venue. It’s the last time you’re going to take my skis after a race and take my bib. That’s really special.”She still plans to race a full schedule, including the Tour de Ski, the seven-stage, nine-day series of races modeled after the Tour de France that straddles the New Year. “My body seems to enjoy racing quite a lot,” she said. “So basically doing as many as I can because it’s my last time. And why not?”Before signing off, Diggins reflected on what she hopes young athletes will take from her career. “Do the thing that you love and share it with as many people as possible,” she said. “And it’s OK to be super vulnerable. The amount of people that then become part of your story and part of your life, it’s incredible.”Explore more on these topicsJessie DigginsSkiingUS sportsUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026newsShareReuse this content"

Or couldn’t they deal with their loneliness? Or are they just making crazy noises because they have lost their minds already?”Becker had beensentenced to a two-and-a-half-year jail term. Amid his insolvency, he was found guilty of not declaring all his assets so that additional funds could be distributed to his creditors. The judge confirmed that his money was used, instead, to meet his “commitments to his children and other dependents, medical and professional fees, and other expenses”.He was taken from court to prison on Friday 29April 2022, the start of a bank holiday weekend, which meant he was confined to a cell as bedlam broke out around him. “That Friday night until the Tuesday morning when I finally was let out to speak to the Listeners [trusted prisoners who support new inmates] were the three most difficult nights of my life.“You can’t sleep because all of it is true. In jail people do kill themselves, people do harm themselves and people do go crazy. It’s the harsh reality when you have never been to prison and that’s what your lawyers don’t tell you before – maybe not to scare you. HMP Wandsworth is probably one of the toughest prisons in the UK so to be put in there was quite a shock.”On a Wednesday morning in Milan, having gained early release from jail when he was sent back to Germany in December 2022, Becker offers bracing and candid company. His grippingnew bookis an often harrowing, yet moving, insight into his time in prison and how he found calm after the tumult of his life until his mid-50s.Becker was awunderkind, who blew tennis open as a powerful teenager and went on to win six grand slam titles. But fame engulfed him and he made many mistakes. He allowed himself to be surrounded by people who told him how great he was and he listened to their flattering advice. Eventually, he paid a terrible price for his hubris.View image in fullscreenBoris Becker won his first of six grand slams at Wimbledon in 1985 but he was surrounded by yes men.Photograph: Steve Powell/Getty ImagesHis book, expertly ghosted by Tom Fordyce, makes us feel as if we are in prison alongside him. The first few days and nights were terrifying and Becker remembers thinking: “This is torture. Surviving it all is an impossibility. I’m in a cage with a bunch of psychopaths. I’m alone and I’m lost.”He suggests that “it’s easier said than done, but you have to find a way. Time is your enemy inside because the clock ticks very slowly. It’s 22 hours a day inside a tiny cell and that’s hard.”Becker adds that, “in hindsight, it was probably very good for me to stand still for a long time, and 231 days is quite a long time. To truly understand what happened to me before, to put the dance together of what happened, was a relief. But it doesn’t happen overnight.“You have to take real accountability and a cell life gives you that opportunity. I like to think I’m a pretty bright guy and eventually, you start thinking about the whys, ifs and whens of all that happened. Three years later, the reason I’m doing well is because I took full accountability for the good and bad I did.”The 57-year-old leans forward to underline his next point. “But whoever says a prison life is easy is lying. It’s a real punishment.”Becker makes it clear how large sections of life inside Wandsworth and HMP Huntercombe, the Oxfordshire jail where he spent most of his sentence, were essentially run by the prisoners.The prison system seems brokenand rehabilitation has to come from deep within an inmate’s own desire to change himself.“That’s a very important point you raise,” Becker says. “That’s why you have so many reoffenders, committing crime after crime after crime, so they’re inside for the second, third or fourth stint. So you have to really take a good look at yourself, be disciplined in your thoughts and find a [positive] conclusion. Then rehabilitation is possible – but it all starts with you.”Some aspects of prison can be positive and Becker stresses that his rehabilitation was enhanced by a benevolent warder, Andy Small, who persuaded him to take a course in stoicism. “It helped me and eventually, I became a stoic teacher myself where I could talk to inmates and try to rehabilitate some of them in the hope that, once they’re out, they stay on the straight and narrow. Andy was a very tough guy who ran the gym but he showed me how I could tell young prisoners my life story, about having everything and losing everything, and not be too down about it.View image in fullscreen‘You have to take real accountability and a cell life gives you that opportunity. Eventually, you start thinking about the whys, ifs and whens of all that happened.’ Boris Becker believes rehabilitation starts with the offender.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The Guardian“That was huge for me. Andy put his faith into me and I think I delivered. It’s the same now. I read lots of books and I recommend the philosophy of stoicism to people who have issues in the free world. It’s more important than ever with the trying times we live in.”Becker smiles and says: “I was a stoic without knowing it when I was playing tennis. I lived in the moment and I never really had difficulties with pressure on court. I always felt comfortable in my own skin when I was playing tennis. I used some of the stoic methods when I was a tennis player. I just didn’t know it.”He remembers some beautiful moments in prison. Becker coached Novak Djokovic to six grand slam final victories and so he was engrossed when watching Wimbledon on a small television in his cell in the summer of 2022. As Djokovic won match after match to reach the final against Nick Kyrgios it seemed as if his wing of the prison had become immersed in tennis.The final that Sunday afternoon was noisy as the prisoners banged on their cell door whenever Djokovic won another big point. Becker remembers that,after a pulsating four-set final, “I wasn’t afraid any more. And when Novak won, and raised his arms, I stood up and raised my arms too. As I did so, the noise along the wing broke out again, louder than ever before. The banging didn’t stop for 10 minutes. On walls, on doors. With cups, with chairs. It had taken me two weeks to educate them that this was my man, and now I realised. They had understood. I stood there and I cried.”His emotions were intensified by the fact that Djokovic had arranged tickets for Becker’s partner [and now wife], Lilian, and his eldest son, Noah, and they were in his box for every match. “I saw them ringside at every game,” Becker says, “and that’s what I call true friendship, that you’re not forgotten. I always thank Novak for this special memory.”If Becker wasstill coaching Djokovic todaywould they discuss the 38-year-old’s eventual retirement? “Look, I think he’s important for tennis today. He leads by example and shows the young players the amount of dedication you need to come to the top and then stay on top. He’s still chasing his 25th grand slam and reached all four major semi-finals this year and won two tournaments. Who are we to challenge Novak when to stop? I heard the other day that he wants to play at the Olympics in LA 2028. Let him. We need him.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So I’d never bet against Novak.”View image in fullscreenBoris Becker coached Novak Djokovic to six grand slam final wins during the three years they worked together.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBecker praises thebrilliance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. He is also amazed by their classy friendship and deep respect for each other when remembering how he was often at war with his bitter rivals Michael Stich,Andre Agassiand Pat Cash. “Well, it’s a little bizarre,” he says of the Sinner-Alcaraz bromance, “but they’re role models and it’s wonderful they have this chemistry on and off court. Our generation was different. We didn’t have any social media. We had different qualities. But, in this trying world, I really appreciate Jannik and Carlos’s behaviour. I talk to them, as they don’t shy away from conversations with us former champions.”Touchingly, Becker has also fully reconciled past differences with his old rivals. Stich wrote him a moving letter when he was inside and Cash, a fellow stoic, came to see him and talk about stoicism in prison. He is now friends with Agassi whom he calls “a brother from another mother”.When Becker turned 55 on 22 November 2022 he was locked up in Huntercombe. Each cell had a solitary kettle. But Becker had never made himself a cup of coffee before jail, let alone boiled a kettle in his pampered life. Before his incarceration he would just pop a capsule into his swish coffee machine. So he had to learn a very basic life skill inside.View image in fullscreenBoris Becker now lives in Milan.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianBut he was still stunned that three inmates had somehow obtained the ingredients to make him three cakes in their kettles for his birthday. “I still don’t know how they did it but they gave me a lemon cake, a chocolate cake and a carrot cake. It was very difficult to cook any decent food for yourself in your kettle, let alone bake a cake, but they did it. Normally you hope your loved one might give you a cake for your birthday or at a restaurant they’ll bring over a beautiful cake with candles. But to have three small cakes baked for me by other inmates made it one of the most emotional birthdays I’ve ever had.”How did they taste? “They tasted great and we all ate them.”He and Lilian now live in Milan and he is working hard, mostly covering tennis and football on Italian television. He is also finally free of all his debts and delusions and, having been through so much glory and infamy, Becker is suitably philosophical: “One of the features of stoicism is that you can’t predict the future. I’m trying hard to have a good life with my wife and my other family. Italy is a wonderful country and life’s good at the moment.”His weathered face lights up when confirming that Lilian will soon give birth. “You fall in love with a woman at the most difficult time in your life, which for me was in the spring of 2018 when my [second] marriage failed and I was insolvent and really struggling. But Lilian sticks with me through thick and thin, even though she doesn’t need to. She’s independent, she’s smart, she’s educated. Quite frankly, without her I wouldn’t be sitting like this now.”Becker pauses and shakes his head in wonder. “Now, to have our first child together in a couple of weeks is a Hollywood movie.

The NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny for the half-time show has attracted strong pushback from many on the right, who object to hiscriticism of Donald Trumpand US immigration enforcement.“I really respect Erika for all that she’s done, especially with creating a half-time show for America,” she said. “You know, children are young, they’re impressionable. Young women, young men and everyone, they just need someone to look up to.”NFL will not reconsider Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time show despite Trump backlashRead moreHunt framed her position through the legacy of her grandfather Lamar Hunt, one of the modern NFL’s founding fathers whocoined the Super Bowl name. She said the game was designed to be accessible to fans of all demographics. “When my grandfather named the Super Bowl, he intended it to be something children and families of all ages could come together and watch,” she said. “That football is the attraction and that it didn’t need to compromise its character or rely on cheap appeal to draw an audience.”She argued that the league has a responsibility to choose performers who reflect its long-standing identity. “Football is becoming the world sport, but, at its heart, it’s America’s sport built around family,” she said. “TheNFLhonors women, the military, this country, celebrates communities. So I think that whoever they select going forward for the half-time show needs to reflect those values more closely.”Turning Point USA, theinfluential rightwing college organizationco-founded by Charlie Kirk,announced in Octoberthat it would stage an “All American Halftime Show” during next year’s NFL championship game. The idea quickly gained traction among conservatives who objected to Bad Bunny’s presence at the game.Hunt also floated who she’d like to see on future half-time stages. “An artist like [country music star] Jason Aldean might make sense,” she said, adding: “I’d love to see Miss Taylor Swift up there sometime onceTravis [Kelce]is retired.”Her comments arrive as the league faces an escalating political dispute over its 2026 half-time headliner. Bad Bunny – a Puerto Rican superstar and US citizen who has been vocal in his criticism of aggressive immigration enforcement – addressed the uproarduring his Saturday Night Live monologuelast month, joking that everyone seemed thrilled about the booking, “even Fox News”. He also highlighted Latino contributions to the US and told viewers that if they didn’t understand his Spanish remarks, they had “four months to learn”.View image in fullscreenTavia Hunt, Clark Hunt and Gracie Hunt, from left to right, attend the NFL Honors at Resorts World Theatre before Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas.Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesThe backlash intensified after homeland security secretary Kristi Noem warnedthat immigration agents “will be all over” next year’s Super Bowland said only Americans should attend. Bad Bunny has said fears of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids influenced his decision to exclude the mainland US from his recent world tour.The NFL, despite the conservative outrage, made clear last monthit will not reconsider its selection. Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league is standing by its decision despite criticism from Trump and his supporters. The process, he said, is “carefully thought through”, and “I’m not sure we’ve ever selected an artist where we didn’t have some blowback or criticism. It’s pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.”Trump dismissed the performerin an interview on Newsmax, saying he had “never heard of” Bad Bunny and calling it an “absolutely ridiculous” pick by the NFL. But Goodell said the league chose him because of his extraordinary reach. “He’s one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,” he said. “That’s what we try to achieve. It’s an important stage for us. It’s an important element to the entertainment value.” He added that the NFL is “confident it’s going to be a great show”, calling it “a united moment”.Hunt closed her appearance Tuesday by describing what she sees as a broader cultural shift among young Americans. “I think our generation gets a bad rap, but I am so excited by this movement I’ve seen within this younger generation,” she said. “They are hungry for a deeper ‘why’. They are hungry for Jesus. November is global Bible month, and Bible sales are up.“And I’m just seeing this massive resurgence in young women, in young men, across college campuses getting baptized, sharing the Gospel and wanting to leave this world a better place.”Super Bowl LX will take place on 8 February at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LXBad BunnyNFLKristi NoemICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Kansas City ChiefsRoger GoodellShareReuse this content"

It is a particularly appetising draw for Craig Bellamy’s Wales, who are flying afterdefeating North Macedonia 7-1on Tuesday and are two home victories from a return to the most exalted stage.World Cup 2026 playoffs draw: Wales v Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czechia v Republic of Ireland, Italy v Northern Ireland – liveRead moreThe Republic of Ireland, fresh from an extraordinary week in whichTroy Parrott scoredall five goals in their wins over Portugal and Hungary, will feel quietly confident of a first finals spot since 2002. They must travel to face Czech Republic in the semi-finals but, should they muster further heroics in Prague, a home final against Denmark or North Macedonia lies in wait.Europe will send four teams to the World Cup through the playoffs, whose semi-finals will take place on 26 March before the finals five days later. Wales and theRepublic of Irelandhad been drawn from pot three after finishing second in their qualifying groups; Northern Ireland reached the playoffs via the Nations League and always looked destined for a more difficult semi-final from pot four.The other two pathways also produced enticing match-ups. Ukraine will face Graham Potter’s Sweden, the winners hosting whoever prevails in a semi-final between Poland and Albania. Slovakia or Kosovo will stage the fourth final against Turkey or Romania.The European draw was preceded by the one for the inter-confederation playoffs, which pit non-Uefa nations against one another. Jamaica will scent a chance to reach their first World Cup finals since 1998 after being matched with outsiders New Caledonia in the semi-finals, the winner of that tie facing top-seeded Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It’ll be the last season in the February-to-November model, with a shortened season planned for 2027 and then thenew summer-to-spring calendarfor the 2027-28 campaign to closer align with other global leagues.Inter Miami will open the season with five consecutive road matches, which presumably will allow for the finishing touches to be made to Miami Freedom Park – the team’s still-under-construction home near Miami International Airport. It’s not clear yet if there will be preseason or other matches at the stadium before the 4 April date.MLS executive who built a powerhouse faced allegations of sexist, racist and homophobic behaviorRead moreThe home opener for Inter Miami will be against Austin FC, a 7.30 p.m. start inside the new 25,000-seat stadium. Messi signed a three-year extension in recent weeks to remain with the team into 2028 and getting that deal done guaranteed that he – as the team long hoped – will be there for the start of their run at the new facility.Miami Freedom Park’s opening will start a planned run of three newMLSstadiums in a three-season span, with New York City FC’s Etihad Park set to open in 2027 and a new downtown stadium for Chicago Fire slated to open in 2028.There will be a nearly two-month break for the 2026 World Cup, with no matches scheduled between 25 May and 16 July.Among the final pre-break matches: a double-header on Fox on 24 May with Inter Miami facing Philadelphia followed by LAFC against Seattle.The MLS season will resume shortly before the end of the World Cup; MLS has some rivalry games scheduled for 16 and 17 July, prior to the third-place match on 18 July and the World Cup final on 19 July.All 510 MLS regular season matches next season will be available on Apple TV in more than 100 countries and regions, with no blackouts and – in a change – no additional subscription required. Some MLS matches will also be available on Fox networks in the US, along with TSN and RDS in Canada.There will be 15 matches on the season’s opening weekend, 21 and 22 February.

Building the team from scratch has entailed a frenetic work rate that the team principal, Graeme Lowdon, has compared to the Apollo moon landing. As F1 descends on Vegas this weekend, Cadillac know time is getting tight.At the final race of the season to be staged in the United Statess, with just over 100 days to go before they take to the track for the first time in Melbourne at the 2026 opener, Cadillac have come on in leaps and bounds but, in what must seem like a sisyphean task, they are aware there will never be enough hours in the day.The chief technical officer, Nick Chester, joined the nascent operation in March 2023 shortly after it was formed, when the team were without even an approved entry. He has been at its heart ever since and enjoys a wry smile when considering the ride.“You can have five minutes looking back at what you’ve done and go: ‘Wow, isn’t this fantastic what we’ve done in less than three years,’” he says. “And then the next minute you think: ‘Yeah, we’ve still got quite a lot to do.’”Chester enjoyed success at Renault in Fernando Alonso’s title-winning years of 2005 and 2006 and was in charge of technical direction at the new Mercedes Formula E team, but nothing has quite compared with the task of bringing the all-American Cadillac brand, a works entry backed by the parent company, General Motors, into F1.“Building an F1 team from scratch, when are you ever going to get a chance to do that?” he says. “It is like nothing else. In an established team you don’t get the opportunity to change cultural approach.”View image in fullscreenSergio Pérez is one of the big-name drivers who will be racing for Cadillac in 2026.Photograph: Federico Basile/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockWith every day that passes minds are more focused on the looming moment of truth in Australia and expectations are being managed. “You have to assume that any new team coming in is going to be last but simply getting on to the grid will be an achievement in itself,” Lowdon noted this year and while Chester echoed this he felt the team had a point to prove as well.“The first thing we want to show is that we should be there,” he says. “So that we turn up and we operate well. We want to show that we’re a proper team doing the right things on the track. Once we’ve shown we’re really credible, then we want to show progression after that.”In August they signed Sergio Pérez and Valtteri Bottas as their drivers for 2026, a pair notable for their invaluable experience in operating at the sharp end in two of the sport’s biggest teams, Red Bull and Mercedes, and Bottas reflected the mood of combative optimism. “Of course, we’re realistic,” he said. “There’s going to be a mountain of work to do, and it’s going to be probably a difficult start, because it is F1. But we’re not there to stay at the back. I believe with this structure, with this group, these people, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be able to get relatively quickly up to the pace and enjoy some success.”To that end recruitment has been in overdrive, with personnel now up to over 400 and planned to reach the target of 600 swiftly. Alongside their current base at Silverstone, the team are in the process of completing an HQ at Fishers in Indianapolis and there is the GM works in Charlotte, North Carolina, where they are building the facility to manufacture the new engine, set for 2029 – until then they will run Ferrari power units – and the Toyota wind tunnel in Cologne. It is a complex organisation, at odds with the trend in F1 for greater centralisation, and has prompted the new cultural approach to which Chester referred.“It’s highly modelled on the Apollo project,” said Lowdon shortly before the British GP in July. “We’re realistic, we know how difficult it is. The timelines, they’re super, super, super short. OK, we’re not putting a man on the moon, but it feels like it sometimes.”So they have adopted, rather than the usual hierarchical system, a flat management structure similar to that of Nasa’s, where there were a range of Apollo teams all working on different aspects of the project across a variety of locations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moving away from management approval for everything is so much cleaner and quicker.”The effectiveness of this nimble approach will be tested in the heat of competition next season and there is no little amount at stake for F1, too. Cadillac have taken on as their test driver the 25-year-old Californian Colton Herta, winner of multiple IndyCar races, with a view to him earning a seat and he will compete in F2 next season. Vegas is one of three races in the US where the sport has recently agreed a deal with Apple for the TV rights, but a successful Cadillac with potentially an American driver would probably offer exponential growth to the sport’s already burgeoning popularity here.Quick GuideToto Wolff sells part of Mercedes stake for £230mShowMercedes boss Toto Wolff has sold his 15 per cent stake in the Formula One team to American billionaire George Krutz. Wolff, who owns one third of Mercedes, will remain as CEO and team principal, and is in Las Vegas for this weekend's race.The 53-year-old Austrian is set to earn close to £230million from the sale in a deal which values Mercedes at £4.57bn - a record for an F1 team.Krutz, the 55-year-old CEO and founder of cybersecurity company Crowdstrike - which currently sponsors Mercedes - becomes a co-owner of the team through his acquisition of Wolff's minority interest making his share five per cent.Kurtz also joins the team's strategic steering committee alongside Mercedes group chairman Olla Kallenius and Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe.Wolff, who oversaw six of Lewis Hamilton's record-equalling seven world championships said: \"George's background is unusual in its breadth: he's a racer, a loyal sporting ambassador for Mercedes-AMG, and an exceptional entrepreneur.\"He understands both the demands of racing and the realities of building and scaling technology businesses. That combination brings specific insight that is increasingly relevant to the future of Formula One.\"Mercedes won eight consecutive constructors' world championships between 2014 and 2021. They are second in the standings with three rounds remaining. George Russell has won two races so far this year.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.For the moment simply living up to Nasa’s “Failure is not an option” adage may be enough for a startup team come 2026.“The people who’ve joined really want the challenge of a new team and doing the first car for a new team,” says Chester. “The level of enthusiasm, excitement, collaboration is brilliant. There are a lot of smiling faces around the factory.“No doubt there’s a few little wrinkles where people are feeling a bit tired on occasion but they’reenjoyingwhat they’re doing.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, Wright says some people are “frightened” of Bellingham’s success.Golden Goal: Jude Bellingham for England v Slovakia (2024)Read more“They cannot get to this guy. He is an achiever, he’s a winner, he goes out and does it,” Wright said on theStick to Football podcast. “They are trying to build something because England have qualified so easily. They need to have something else to pile on, on top of the narrative. I don’t think they’re ready for a black superstar who can move like Jude [Bellingham] is moving. They can’t touch him.“He goes out there, he performs, he does what he does. It’s too uppity for these people.“They all love N’Golo Kanté. He’s a humble black man, gets on with what he’s doing. But if you get a [Paul] Pogba or a Bellingham, and you get that kind of energy, that does not sit well with people. Someone like Jude frightens these people because of his capability and the inspiration he can give.“Because if you are outspoken, black and playing to that level and not caring, that frightens certain people. It’s a tiring exercise to speak about.”View image in fullscreenIan Wright has revealed that he got in touch with Jude Bellingham after the midfielder’s recall to the England squad.Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty ImagesBellingham was recalled to Thomas Tuchel’s squad for games against Serbia and Albania having been left out of October’s squad.Amid discussions about Bellingham’s place in the squad, Wright revealed that he messaged the former Birmingham player before he joined up with the group to warn him of what could happen.“I sent a message to Jude saying: ‘Be ready.’ Something was coming. It’s like a tsunami.

Ecclestone, who was F1’s impresario for four decades before he was deposed in 2017, suggested in 2023 that the sport’s executives were aware of the cover-up – which became known as Crashgate – before the 2008 campaign concluded. The 95-year-old Ecclestone, the FIA and Formula One Management are defending the claims.Last month, they asked the court in London to throw out the case, saying that Massa performed poorly at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, ultimately leading to him losing the championship, and arguing that the claim had been brought too late.In a written judgment handed down on Thursday, Mr Justice Jay said the case could go ahead. He said that Massa had “no real prospect of establishing that the FIA’s duties were owed to him”, but that “he does have a real prospect of proving at trial all the components of his unlawful means conspiracy”. “The same analysis applies to the inducement claim,” Jay said.In the ruling, he dismissed part of Massa’s claim, saying he had “reached the firm conclusion that it is clear that declaratory relief would not be granted in this case”.At a hearing in October, the court heard that as part of his claim, Massa was also seeking various declarations regarding the FIA’s conduct. Jay said: “In my judgment, Mr Massa is not entitled to claim declaratory relief for reputational or publicity reasons.“The present claim cannot, of course, rewrite the outcome of the 2008 drivers’ world championship, but if declaratory relief along the lines sought were granted that is how Mr Massa would present his victory to the world and it is also how it would be perceived by the public.“The second declaration is in the terms that were it not for the FIA’s breaches of duty, Mr Massa would have won the championship: in other words, that he should have won the championship. The FIA, as an international sporting body outside the reach of this court, could and would simply ignore any such declaration.View image in fullscreenFerrari’s Felipe Massa celebrates claiming pole position at the Marina Bay Circuit Park in Singapore in 2008.Photograph: David Davies/PA“That underscores its lack of practical utility, but the declaration comes too close in my view to impinging on the right of the FIA to govern its own affairs.”At the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, Renault stageda win for Fernando Alonsobyordering Piquet to crash, which brought out a safety car and meant Massa, who was leading the race for Ferrari, finished in 13th after his strategy was compromised. The following season, Piquet revealed he had been under instruction by his bosses to crash deliberately.Massa’s lawyers claim Ecclestone knew the crash was deliberate and that he and the FIA failed to investigate it. At the October hearing, Nick De Marco KC, for Massa, said in written submissions that the defendants could not “establish that Mr Massa’s claims have no real prospect of success”.Quick GuideToto Wolff sells part of Mercedes stake for £230mShowMercedes boss Toto Wolff has sold his 15 per cent stake in the Formula One team to American billionaire George Krutz. Wolff, who owns one third of Mercedes, will remain as CEO and team principal, and is in Las Vegas for this weekend's race.The 53-year-old Austrian is set to earn close to £230million from the sale in a deal which values Mercedes at £4.57bn - a record for an F1 team.Krutz, the 55-year-old CEO and founder of cybersecurity company Crowdstrike - which currently sponsors Mercedes - becomes a co-owner of the team through his acquisition of Wolff's minority interest making his share five per cent.Kurtz also joins the team's strategic steering committee alongside Mercedes group chairman Olla Kallenius and Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe.Wolff, who oversaw six of Lewis Hamilton's record-equalling seven world championships said: \"George's background is unusual in its breadth: he's a racer, a loyal sporting ambassador for Mercedes-AMG, and an exceptional entrepreneur.\"He understands both the demands of racing and the realities of building and scaling technology businesses. That combination brings specific insight that is increasingly relevant to the future of Formula One.\"Mercedes won eight consecutive constructors' world championships between 2014 and 2021. They are second in the standings with three rounds remaining. George Russell has won two races so far this year.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Adding that Massa had “a real prospect of succeeding on all of the grounds”, he said the matter should go to a full trial.David Quest KC, for Ecclestone, said Massa’s claims were “a misguided attempt to reopen the results of the 2008 F1 drivers’ championship”. John Mehrzad KC, for the FIA, said Massa’s claim is “torturous as it is overly ambitious” and “conspicuously overlooks a catalogue of his own errors”. Anneliese Day KC, forFormula OneManagement, said in written submissions that the claim would “fail”.Explore more on these topicsFelipe MassaFormula OneBernie EcclestoneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

We scored a great goal.”Chelsea v Barcelona: Women’s Champions League – liveRead moreIt is no secret that the Champions League is Chelsea’s white whale. “We all know there’s one thing missing for us,” Millie Bright told the Guardian the preceding week. The defender was on the bench here, Bompastor favouring a centre-back pairing of Naomi Girma and Nathalie Björn.Barcelona have been their perennial party poopers, deliveringheartbreak in the final in 2021before knocking Chelsea out in three back-to-back semi finals up to last season. Chelsea have just one win, but that hard-fought 1-0 victory against the Catalan giants in Spain was undone in London, and one draw in seven games against theBlaugrana.On a horrendously cold night the opening 15 minutes followed a familiar pattern, the visitors dominating possession and frustrating an unsettled home side with their aggressive press. It was the Blues’ goal against the run of play that triggered a more even encounter. The full-back Carpenter, playing in front of the right-back Lucy Bronze, collected the ball from Aggie Beever-Jones just inside the Barcelona half and raced towards the box unchallenged before she lashed it ferociously past Cata Coll. It was a blistering effort and the celebrations were wild, Chelsea taking a lead at home against Barcelona for the first time in four attempts.View image in fullscreenEllie Carpenter lashes the ball past Cata Coll to put Chelsea ahead.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAThe Carpenter-Bronze axis on the right was a potent one, as was the equally rapid combination of Alyssa Thompson and Sandy Baltimore on the left. They nullified the dynamic Barcelona forwards Caroline Graham Hansen and Clàudia Pina, keeping them busy by helping out their own full-backs as they struggled to contain the wide onslaught.The goal injected confidence into Bompastor’s side and they created the better chances of the half, but a Barcelona corner helped cancel out Carpenter’s stunning strike, the ball falling kindly for Ewa Pajor, who took a step to her left and fired in. It was the 36th Champions League goal for the Poland forward, who was a runner-up four times in the competition with Wolfsburg.Chelsea attempted to take advantage on the resumption of the game, Thompson trying her luck after a quick attack but she put her effort wide. There was a nervous energy after half-time, the home team’s inability to convert their superior number of shots on target while Barcelona dominated possession a worry as the clock ticked on.“If you want to be perfect you have to be clinical and that is something we are working on, we won’t give up on that aspect,” said Bompastor.There was an unusual pause shortly before the end of the first half, prompting nine minutes added on, when the live feed of the game went down and disrupted TV coverage and the VAR. The players tried to stay warm on the pitch until the action resumed.View image in fullscreenThe referee stops play before a technical issue delayed the Women’s Champions League tie for nine minutes in the first half.Photograph: John Walton/PAIt was Carpenter who attempted to alleviate the Barcelona pressure that dominated the opening 15 minutes of the second half much in the way it had the first, the former Lyon player breaking forward in a move that mirrored her run for the opening goal but this time her effort was low and wide of the far post.There was frustration for Chelsea in the 74th minute, celebrations cut short after Macario’s clinical header with her first touch after coming on in place of Beever-Jones was deemed offside, the margin extremely tight.There was further agony when Carpenter put the ball wide of the far post with just Coll to beat from close range on the right after receiving a backheel pass from Macario in a neat one-two.Quick GuideWCL roundup: Atlético thrash Twente as Bayern blow away PSGShowAtlético Madridmade it two wins from four in the Women's Champions League with a 4-0 thrashing ofTwente.The Spanish side opened the scoring in the 29th minute via a low, rifled shot from Amaiur Sarriegi before Júlia Bartel, Synne Jensen and Fiamma Benítez piled on the pain for their hosts. The win leaves Atlético ninth in the table and Twente languishing in 14th place.Bayern Munich, meanwhile, rose to fifth with a 3-1 victory atParis Saint-Germain. Linda Dallmann, Momoko Tanikawa and Jovana Damnjanovic found the net to inflict a fourth loss from four on PSG, who are now rock bottom.In the other match of the evening,OH LeuvenheldRomato a 1-1 draw at home.The visitors were well-placed to take all three points thanks to Evelyne Viens' slotted finish after 18 minutes, but the Belgian side were awarded a penalty for an off-the-ball foul after a VAR check midway through the second half and Jada Conijnenberg did the business from the spot.Will MageeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Chelsea were very stable and they pressed us. That meant the second balls were theirs,” said the Barcelona manager, Pere Romeu. “It was a good game. It’s very different to the last semi-finals as Chelsea matched all the players we had and that limited us.”The draw means Bompastor’s and Romeu’s sides remain two of the three unbeaten teams, the former earning a draw for the second time and the latter’s perfect start halted. They remain in good positions, Barcelona topping the table on 10 points and Chelsea in sixth on eight with two rounds of fixtures remaining.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenBarcelona WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

One tower will include a lift to Birmingham’s highest bar, offering city-wide views.The Birmingham chair, Tom Wagner, promised a “modern-day Colosseum” and “to create something unique and distinctive in one of this country’s greatest and sometimes overlooked regions … it will be overlooked no more.

Who covers the pitch but sees the penalty area as their kryptonite? Which defender loves one-v-one battles? Who prefers to shoot without taking a touch to settle themselves?Bruno FernandesMost shots from outside the box without scoringBruno Fernandes hasn’t had much luck from shooting outside the box this season. He has attempted 12 shots from range without success, coming closest in the draw at Nottingham Forest, with his low shot striking the foot of a post.The fact that only Kevin De Bruyne (15) has scored more goals from outside the box in the Premier League than Fernandes (14) since the Manchester United captain’s debut in February 2020 suggests his luck will change. Maybe it’s time for him to come off free-kick though; h has scored only three of his 60 shot attempts from free-kicks in the Premier League (5%), including two unsuccessful efforts this season.View image in fullscreenMichael KayodeLong throws into the opposition’s boxLong throws are back in fashion. That makes Michael Kayode even more important than usual, with the Brentford defender chucking more of them into the opposition’s box than any other player in the Premier League this season.Kayode has launched 54 long throws into the opposition’s box, eight more than second-placed Nordi Mukiele and 25 more than Chris Richards in third. More importantly, six of his long throws into the penalty area have led to a shot – four more than any other player – and two have led to goals.Igor JesusHighest xG without scoringIgor Jesus hasn’t had a problem scoring for Nottingham Forest in cup competitions this season. The 24-year-old Brazilian has scored five goals from 13 shots across the League Cup and Europa League, but the Premier League has been a more difficult proposition for him.He’s yet to score in 10 league games since joining Forest from Botafogo in the summer, despite having 13 shots. He is the player to have the highest expected goals figure this season without scoring (1.86). At least he isn’t the player with the most shots without scoring – that is Bournemouth’s David Brooks (16 shots, no goals).View image in fullscreenFlorian WirtzMost shot involvements without a goal or assistIt’s been a tricky start for Florian Wirtz. In 11 appearances, none of the 16 chances he has created have become assists, which is hardly on him, but he’s also recorded 12 shots without success. That’s 28 chances and no goals.Thierry Henry struggled at the start of his Premier League career – when he was also 22 and arriving from a different country – with only one goal and no assists in his first 12 appearances. But then things started to click and we know the rest.Jack GrealishExpected assists from open playJack Grealish tops the open-play assist charts with four, but sometimes assists can be misleading. In order to assess the true creative quality of a player’s passes, expected assists (xA) offers a deeper understanding of how likely a pass is to become an assist.xA is measured on a scale between zero and one, where zero represents a pass that will never result in an assist, and one represents a pass that the receiver would be expected to score from every single time. Grealish’s passes in open play this season have totalled 2.47 xA, higher than any other player in the division. Interestingly for Everton fans, another of their players ranks second in this metric: Iliman Ndiaye (2.40), just above Jérémy Doku (2.14) and Bukayo Saka (1.94).Erling HaalandFirst-time shots from open playErling Haaland has been in electric form, scoring 14 goals in the opening 11 games. What is more surprising is how often he takes first-time shots in open play. Of his 44 open-play shots this season, 26 have come without any prior touch (59.1%) and eight of his 14 goals have come with a first-time finish.That is more than any other player in the league, but only just. Jean-Philippe Mateta has had 30 shots in open play and 25 of those have been first-time attempts (83.3%).Carlos BalebaMost touches without one being in opposition’s boxEleven players have scored for Brighton this season, but don’t expect the midfielder Carlos Baleba to join that group soon. Despite having 371 touches in 11 appearances this season, none of them has come inside the opposition’s penalty area.That’s the most touches by an outfielder without any coming in the opposition’s box this season, 79 more than Axel Tuanzebe (292). During his time in the Premier League, Baleba had 3,230 touches, with only 19 of them in the opposition’s box (0.006%).View image in fullscreenOptaRyan SessegnonMost fouls without receiving a cardRyan Sessegnon could be considered the most fortunate player to not have entered the referee’s notebook as he has committed 20 fouls without receiving a single card, four more than Pape Matar Sarr (16) and five more than his Fulham teammate Raúl Jiménez (15). Going back to last season, none of Sessegnon’s past 25 fouls have seen him booked.At the other end of the scale, three players have committed fewer than 10 fouls but still been given four yellow cards this season: Álex Jiménez (five fouls), Tim Iroegbunam (six) and James Garner (eight).Jérémy DokuMost carries ending in opposition’s boxJérémy Doku has shown how dangerous he is when running with the ball at his feet, leading the rankings for chances created following a ball carry (11). There aren’t many players who can wriggle their way through tight spaces to create chances for teammates as well as the Belgian winger, and his ball-carrying ability has taken him into the opposition’s penalty area more often than anyone else.Doku leads the rankings for ball carries ending in the opposition’s box (72), with his tally 19 more than the next highest players, Jack Grealish and Cody Gakpo (53).View image in fullscreenJérémy Doku was sensational in City’s 3-0 win against Liverpool.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesMaxence LacroixBest one-v-one defender against dribblersOf players to have faced at least 20 dribbles, the Crystal Palace defender Maxence Lacroix has won the highest percentage of his tackles (87%), just above his central defensive partner Marc Guéhi (81.5%).Of defenders, Kieran Trippier has the worst success rate in stopping dribblers. The Newcastle full-back has won just 32.3% of his one-v-one battles, committing 10 fouls and seeing his opponent dribble past him on another 11 occasions.Granit XhakaDistance runSunderland have started the season brilliantly and few players have stood out more than Granit Xhaka. The 33-year-old has covered more ground than any other player in the Premier League this season, running 124.06km. Elliot Anderson is second (122.44km), with Xhaka’s teammate Noah Sadiki in third (122.33km).Igor ThiagoHigh pressures applied in the final thirdIgor Thiago endured a frustrating first season at Brentford. Hindered by injury, the forward played only 168 minutes across eight appearances in the league. Now fit, the Brazilian has become an integral part of Keith Andrews’s side. Only Erling Haaland (14) has scored more goals than he has (eight).He works incredibly hard off the ball too. He leads the rankings for high pressures applied across the whole pitch (609) but, more importantly for Brentford, he also leads the way when it comes to high pressures applied in the final third of the pitch (270).View image in fullscreenOptaEmiliano BuendíaMinutes played as a substituteEmiliano Buendía has been a handy option for Aston Villa off the bench. The Argentinian has played more minutes as a substitute than any other player (200), and his impact has made a difference. No player has been involved in more goals as a sub than he has (three: two goals and one assist). He also leads the rankings for shot involvements as a sub (11: six shots, five chances created) alongside Omari Hutchinson and Estêvão. In fact, he’s been involved in more goals as a sub (three in 200 minutes) than he has as a starter (two in 229 minutes) this season for Villa.This is an article byOpta AnalystExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueGuardian Sport NetworkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Amazon Prime confirmed it had retained the first pick of Tuesday matches in three major European markets in the new streaming deal sold byUefa.Sources with knowledge of the tender process say Paramount’s bid was considerably higher than the £1bn currently paid by TNT in what will be regarded as a successful auction for UC3, the joint venture between Uefa and European Football Clubs which runs the Champions League, and its new commercial rights distributor, Relevent Football Partners.Paramount Skydance is led by David Ellison, whose father, Larry Ellison, co-founded Oracle and is an ally of Donald Trump. It was reportedby Al Jazeerathis week that Paramount was preparing a $71bn bid for Warner Bros Discovery, which owns TNT Sports.In the context of a potential takeover TNT Sports’ long-term future as a stand-alone brand is unclear, but the broadcaster bid for UK rights it has held, initially in the guise of BT Sport, since 2013 and is understood to be disappointed to miss out. As it stands UK fans will require another subscription to watch the Champions League, with Paramount joining a growing portfolio of football rights holders that includes TNT, Sky Sports, Amazon and Dazn.Paramount’s deal would give it every Champions League game live in the UK other than the first pick of Tuesday night matches, which was auctioned separately to the five major European markets collectively for the first time. A collective arrangement was not reached but Amazon Prime will continue to have the first pick of Tuesday games in the UK, Germany and Italy from 2027.Amazon is understood to have beaten off competition from rival streamers, including Netflix and Disney+. Although it will have the first pick of fixtures there will be limits on how many times it can show each club.Canal+ will show all Champions League fixtures in France, with Movistar understood to have beaten off a strong rival bid from Paramount to retain its rights in Spain. Paramount is determined to break into the European market and its bids are a sign of increasing American interest in European football before next summer’s World Cup.Given the values of the winning bids accepted, Uefa is understood to be confident of securing a significant increase on the £2.9bn-a-year value of the TV rights in the current three-year cycle.The Champions League auction was the first tender process run for Uefa by the US-owned agency Relevent Football Partners since it replaced the governing body’s longstanding sales partner Team Marketing last year. UC3 and Relevent have introduced significant changes, including the pan-European streaming package and extending the rights cycle to four years.The bumper deals will be regarded by Uefa as vindicating the remodelled Champions League, with its extended league stage and a single, 36-team table.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Working on the almost certainly misguided assumption that all three nations win, Wales will then host Northern Ireland in a mouthwatering winner-takes-all eliminator, while O’Ireland will welcome Denmark or North Macedonia to Dublin to see who gets to compete in North America.

All four of those games are scheduled to be played in the Mexican cities of Guadalajara or Monterrey in March. And with that, as the final Geopolitics World Cup pathways were etched in bureaucratic bronze, the Zurich audience rose as one, not in a standing ovation for the dazzling complexity of the draw through which they had just snoozed, but because in a nearby hospitality suite the canapes, vol-au-vents and pre-packaged salmon mousse sandwiches were finally being unveiled.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Sarah Rendell from 8pm GMT for piping hot, minute-by-minute coverage of Chelsea 1-2 Barcelona in Women’s Bigger Cup.QUOTE OF THE DAYI was 34, I’d spent nine years at Arsenal and there had been a fair amount of discussions with the club.

None of the incumbents have played in the Premier League this decade, a rarity in the modern-day second tier where those in receipt of parachute payments tend to rule the roost. In fact, of the top 11, only seventh-placed Ipswich have featured in the past seven top-flight seasons.Preston are one of the few in that group never to have graced the Premier League, this their 11th consecutive Championship campaign. Unfancied and unfashionable in the current climate, they were widely tipped to struggle after a disastrous finish to last season, but under Paul Heckingbottom they sit fourth going into a crunch derby with Blackburn on Friday night and would rise to second with a win.The sense of drift towards the end of 2024-25 was striking. After a 1-0 victory at Norwich on 11 February, Preston won only one more league match. Four successive defeats in April dragged them into the relegation picture but theystayed up on the final dayby virtue of West Brom’s 5-3 win over Luton.View image in fullscreenPreston fans saw their team survive by the skin of their teeth last season but the mood is high this time around.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesThere is a contrasting feel now, with the wily Heckingbottom putting his imprint on the side a year after he replaced Ryan Lowe.“Last season was a really strange one, everyone knows what happened, but we still had the feeling this year we were way better than that,” said the defender Liam Lindsay. “The manager has been emphasising hard work on the training pitch, the feeling at the training ground has been really positive and I think he’s brought in some good personalities. Recruitment has been massive. The new guys have made a massive difference.”Preston’s rejuvenation has been achieved on a modest budget. Thierry Small joined after his contract at Charlton expired and has been a livewire at left wing-back in Heckingbottom’s 3-5-2. Odeluga Offiah cost a seven-figure fee from Brighton and has added physicality and consistency on the opposite flank. The goalkeeper Daniel Iversen, a fan favourite during two loans at Deepdale, was brought back from Leicester on a free. Preston have also made smart use of the loan market, particularly in midfield, where the skilful Alfie Devine and Harrison Armstrong – loaned from Tottenham and Everton respectively – have shone in creative roles. The forward Lewis Dobbin has also impressed on loan from Aston Villa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 2-0 away victory at Southampton this month was another statement to the rest of the division; the Lilywhites are not a soft touch this year. Heckingbottom and his drill sergeant, assistant manager Stuart McCall, have transformed them into a super-committed defensive unit but they are also easy on the eye, capable of playing fluent counterattacking football. The sense of unity extends to the supporters, who rapidly snapped up tickets for the battle with Blackburn.With the two clubs deprived of league games against their more traditional rivals (Blackpool for Preston and Burnley for Blackburn), this Lancastrian rivalry – a near constant in the Championship these days – has taken on extra meaning. Rovers, who finished last season in sparkling form under Valérien Ismaël and are slowly recovering from a sluggish start, can expect to step into a cauldron-like atmosphere. The Sky Sports cameras will be in situ. It will be an occasion to relish for Heckingbottom and his players.“It’s a huge game – they always are, these games,” said Lindsay. “Friday night under the lights at Deepdale, a sold-out crowd and we’re on a good run of form, but I guess so are Blackburn. We always back ourselves.”View image in fullscreenPreston’s Thierry Small (centre) celebrates with with Milutin Osmajic after opening the scoring against Swansea this month.Photograph: Lee Parker/CameraSport/Getty Images“I would be disappointed if we didn’t come and give our best,” said Heckingbottom. “We can’t guarantee the result off the back of it but you can guarantee the effort. It’s our job to try and put the players on the pitch with the belief we can go out there and carry out a performance that gives us three points. We try to attack the games and that’s us doing our part. The fans have responded with more [noise] at home.”A win would not only lift Preston into an automatic promotion slot, at least until Middlesbrough and Stoke play on Saturday afternoon, but also prompt a surge of optimism. After 15 games talk of the P-word at Deepdale has been tentative, but given the topsy-turvy nature of this season’s Championship, why not begin to believe?“You do usually get a couple of teams running away with it,” said Lindsay. “If you look at the top eight, you wouldn’t have predicted that, so it is quite open and it’s anyone’s game. I just don’t want to jinx it – it’s the old cliche of taking it game by game.”Explore more on these topicsPreston North EndChampionshipBlackburn RoversfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the end of the match, as had been the custom for several seasons, two players whose contracts had expired and who had just worn the club’s colours for the last time were honoured with a bouquet of flowers.“This is neither the situation of Mary Fowler nor that of the teammate mentioned in her book, both of whom were still under contract with the club until 30/06/2023 and to whom it would therefore have been rather insensitive for the club to offer a ‘farewell gift’.”In her book, Fowler said it was “quite well known” that she and her teammate would be leaving. “It wasn’t a secret that we weren’t happy there, so if anything it would’ve shocked people if we had re-signed,” she wrote.The club also investigated the alleged incident that occurred in the dressing room. It said after consulting with people who were present that day, no evidence was found to corroborate Fowler’s claims.“Had such incidents been reported and substantiated, the club would have taken all necessary measures immediately upon being notified,” Montpellier said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve both made mistakes. I made mine on a quiz show, he made his on a cricket field.”Ashes 2025-26: Guardian writers’ predictions for the seriesRead moreSmith’s acerbic response followed an interview with an online betting company when Panesar had urged England’s players to: “Say something like: ‘I don’t think it’s ethical that he’s the captain. I don’t think he played the game fairly.’ Really get into him and make him feel guilty about it. Make him feel like: ‘They’re probably right, I shouldn’t be here, I shouldn’t be doing this.’ This is where the UK media must also focus and put pressure. Use it as a way to help England. If it were the opposite, the Australian media would be all over it. They would have said, if it was any of the English players: ‘The cheaters have arrived.’ Right?”Asked whether he had seen these comments, Smith launched into an apparently prepared answer. “I’m going to go off topic here … Who of you in the room has seen Mastermind, and Monty Panesar on that? Any of you?” he asked a crowded press conference room.“Those of you that have will understand where I’m coming from. And those of you who haven’t, do yourself a favour because it is pretty comical. Anyone that believes that Athens is in Germany … that’s a start. [That] Oliver Twist is a season of the year, and America is a city, it doesn’t really bother me those comments.

I’m a lot more relaxed these days.”His reaction to Panesar’s comments also appeared to contradict his preferred approach to pre-Ashes hype. “It’s pretty standard,” he said, later in the press conference. “I’ve been involved in a few now and there’s always so many words said before the series.

Asked whether he had decided which bowler would share the new ball with Mitchell Starc Smith strongly hinted that he would prefer to bat first, saying: “We’ll see in the morning – or hopefully two mornings.” His preference for batting first comes as little surprise: that has been his choice in 17 of the 19 Tests where he has won a toss as captain, including the last 12 in succession.England are likely to confirm their starting XI after they finish their final training session on Thursday afternoon, having named a trimmed-down 12-man squad on Wednesday. “Everyone, including myself, including all the team, knows that the record of England over the history of Ashes series in Australia isn’t the best,” Stokes said. “But we’ve got the opportunity here over the next two and a half months to write our own history. We’ve come here with a goal, and that goal is to get on that plane in mid-January, returning to England being Ashes winners.”Australia XI: Jake Weatherald, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith (c), Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey (wk), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland, Brendan Doggett.Explore more on these topicsThe AshesAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamCricketAustralia sportEngland cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Both teams have won the NWSL Championship once before: the Spirit in 2021 and Gotham two years later. Washington are the likely favourites, but Gotham’s talent cannot be discounted.As we look forward to Saturday night in San Jose, here are a few key battles that could decide the game.Mary Fowler claims racist treatment at French club Montpellier after receiving bananas as leaving presentRead moreAnn-Katrin Berger (Gotham) v Aubrey Kingsbury (Spirit)Unless we find ourselves in a penalty shootout and either keeper takes one, these two won’t face strikes from one another. But their battle could be the most decisive of all.Both made player-of-the-match-worthy performances in the first round. Gotham upset the record-setting, first-place Shield winners, Kansas City, thanks to a massive seven-save performance from NWSL’s 2024 Goalkeeper of the Year, Berger. In Washington, Kingsbury saw the Spirit to a narrow victory against the post-season debutantes Racing Louisville with seven saves of her own across 120 minutes, then two more to secure the win in a penalty shootout.In the semi-finals, the pair faced fewer shots on target, but were called on to make highlight reel-worthy saves to send their teams to the final. An elite performance from either keeper could decide the championship.Emily Sonnett v Washington’s attacking depthBerger is the reigning goalkeeper of the year and is deservedly nominated again for 2025. But the fact that Gotham conceded the second-fewest goals (25) this season and claimed the second-most clean sheets is because their defence has been superb. Hats off to the veteran centre-back Emily Sonnett, who has had a superb year for club and country.The Spirit have an impressive cadre of players who are threats in front of goal; and Sonnett needs to coordinate their containment. With injuries limiting starts for some (such as Croix Bethune and Trinity Rodman, the latter of whom is still returning to full fitness and came off the bench late in the semis) Washington have five players with four or more goals this season (Gotham have three), while collectively accruing 42 in total – second only to Kansas City. Sonnett’s backline performance will need to be top notch to limit them, with the help of key players around her such as fellow centre-back Jess Carter.View image in fullscreenGotham’s Emily Sonnett focuses on defending a cross in the match against Houston Dash.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesTara McKeown (Spirit) v Esther González (Gotham)The Gotham coach, Juan Carlos Amorós, listed his top scorer, Esther González, as questionable in last week’s availability report, then started her in a1-0 win against Orlando. The Spain striker (whose four goals at the Euros made her the tournament top scorer) finished second behind Temwa Chawinga in this year’s Golden Boot race, with 13 goals in 23 games. Sunday’s semi-final was her first game in more than a month as she returns from injury, but the typically incisive striker hit a dry patch before that and hasn’t scored in her past five appearances. That said, González loves a trophy-winning goal. She scored the team’s deciding goal in their Concacaf W Champions Cup victory as well as in their 2-1 Championship win over Seattle in 2023. Washington’s Defender of the Year finalist, the USWNT centerback Tara McKeown, will need to be at peak performance to keep González at bay – not to mention Gotham’s other in-form goalscorers Jaedyn Shaw or Rose Lavelle.Gift Mondayand Rose Kouassi (Spirit) v Lily Reale (Gotham)This final sets up riveting tests along both flanks. One to watch pits the Rookie of the Year finalist Lily Reale against Spirit’s top scorer, Gift Monday, and the free-flowing Ivorian forward Rose Kouassi. Kouassi will be attacking from the right, where the young USWNT left-back has impressed this year for club and country. With the left centre-back Jess Carter also key to the equation, Reale will need to help limit Kouassi’s creative bursts that have been key to Gift Monday’s effectiveness in front of goal.Kouassi and Monday combined for two of the Spirit’s three post-season goals, with Kouassi (who clocked four goals and four assists in the regular season) providing the assist both times. According to Opta, Kouassi has set up Monday for six goals in 2025, which is the most since the dynamic duo of Yuki Nagasato and Sam Kerr in 2019. It’ll be a team effort to stop them but Reale’s effort on the left flank could be key to limiting that link-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Croix Bethune was named NWSL’s 2024 Rookie of the Year and 2024 Midfielder of the Year after tying Tobin Heath’s single-season assists record with five goals and 10 assists. She dealt with an injury earlier in the year, but has hit her stride in the latter half of the season, proving consequential with her elite vision and creative instinct and scoring the second of two goals in the team’s2-0 victorylast weekend. For Gotham, Jaelin Howell’s defensive presence can be formidable, while also providing an attacking threat of her own with four goals and an assist (making her Gotham’s third-highest scorer behind González and Lavelle). A big game from either player will have a huge impact in the middle of the pitch, with Howell’s ability to block Bethune’s progress into the final third a key contest.Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham) v ScepticsThe 20-year-old Frisco talent Jaedyn Shaw has had some ups and downs over the past few years for club and country. But the versatile midfielder/forward is hitting top form at the right moment for Gotham after joining the 2023 champions this summer. Amorós has used her in multiple positions across the post-season, and she has been key to both victories. Shaw scored the first of two goals against Kansas City as well as the stoppage-time winner against Orlando. The Spirit will have an eye on her, as Shaw seeks further vindication of her post-match comments after toppling Kansas City: “Underdog, my ass.”Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

But the university appears to still be using AI-generated materials to teach the course. This year, the university uploaded a policy statement to the course website appearing to justify the use of AI, laying out “a framework for academic professionals leveraging AI automation” in scholarly work and teaching.The university’s public-facing policieslimitstudents’ use of AI, saying students who outsource work to AI or pass off AI-generated work as their own are breaching its integrity policy and may be challenged for academic misconduct.“I’m midway through my life, my career,” James said. “I don’t feel like I can now just go away and do another career restart. I’m stuck with this course.”The Staffordshire case comes asmoreandmoreuniversities use AI tools – to teach students, generate course materials and give personalised feedback. A Department of Education policy paper released in Augusthailedthis development, saying generative AI “has the power to transform education”. A surveylast year (pdf)of 3,287 higher education teaching staff by the educational technology firm Jisc found that nearly a quarter were using AI tools in their teaching.For students, AI teaching appears to be less transformative than it is demoralising. In the US, students post negative onlinereviewsabout professors who use AI. In the UK, undergraduates have taken to Reddit to complain about their lecturers copying and pasting feedback fromChatGPTor using AI-generatedimagesin courses.“I understand the pressures on lecturers right now that may force them to use AI, it just feels disheartening,” one studentwrote.James and Owen said they noticed the use of AI in their Staffordshire course “almost immediately” last year when, during their first class, the lecturer put on a PowerPoint presentation that included an AI version of his voice reading off the slides.Soon after, they said, they noticed other signs that some course materials were AI-generated, including American English inconsistently edited to British English, suspicious file names, as well as “generic, surface-level information” that occasionally referred inexplicably to US legislation.Signs of AI-generated material continued this year. In one course video uploaded to the website, a voiceover presenting the material suddenly morphs into a Spanish accent for about 30 seconds, before switching back to a British accent.1:09Voiceover accent changes mid-lesson in alleged AI-generated course – videoThe Guardian reviewed materials from the Staffordshire course and used two different AI detectors – Winston AI and Originality AI – to scan course materials from this year. Both of them found that a number of the assignments and presentations had “a very high likelihood of being AI-generated”.Early in the course, James said, he brought his concerns to the student representative during a monthly meeting. Then, in late November, he aired them during a lecture, which was recorded as a part of the course materials. In the recording, he asks the lecturer to not bother with the slides.“I know these slides are AI-generated, I know that everyone in this meeting knows these slides are AI-generated, I would rather you just scrap these slides,” he says. “I do not want to be taught by GPT.”Soon after, the student representative on the course chimes in, saying: “We have fed this back, James, and the response was that teachers are allowed to use a variety of tools. We were quite frustrated by this response.”Another student says: “There are some useful things in the presentation. But it’s like, 5% is useful nuggets, and a lot is repetition. There is some gold in the bottom of this pan. But presumably we could get the gold ourselves, by asking ChatGPT.”The lecturer laughs uncomfortably. “I appreciate people being candid …” he says, then he changes the subject to another tutorial he made – using ChatGPT. “I’ve done this short notice, to be honest,” he says.Eventually, the course head told James that two human lecturers would be going over the material for the final session, “so you don’t get an AI experience”.In response to a query from the Guardian, the University of Staffordshire said “academic standards and learning outcomes were maintained” on the course.It said: “The University of Staffordshire supports the responsible and ethical use of digital technologies in line with our guidance. AI tools may support elements of preparation, but they do not replace academic expertise and must always be used in ways that uphold academic integrity and sector standards.”While the university brought in a non-AI lecturer for the last lecture in the course, James and Owen said this was too little, too late, especially because the university appears to have used AI in this year’s teaching material as well.“I feel like a bit of my life was stolen,” James said.Owen, who is in the middle of a career change, said he had chosen the course to get the underlying knowledge, not just the qualification – and felt it was a waste of time.“To be sat there with this material in front of you that is just really not worth anyone’s time, when you could be spending that time actually engaging with something worthwhile, is really frustrating,” he said.Explore more on these topicsStaffordshire UniversityUniversitiesHigher educationArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

More than 1 million people died at Auschwitz-Birkenau, most of them Jews. Zyklon B was the poison gas used to kill inmates in gas chambers.Infurther comments, Grok referred to “lobbies” wielding “disproportionate influence through control of the media, political funding and dominant cultural narratives” to “impose taboos”, apparently echoing a well-known antisemitic trope.Challengedby the Auschwitz Museum, the AIeventually back-pedalled, saying the reality of the Holocaust was “indisputable” and it “rejected denialism outright”. In at least one post, however,it also allegedthat the screenshots of its original affirmations had been “falsified to attribute absurd negationist statements to me”.View image in fullscreenElon Musk’s responsibility as the owner of X was key, said the president of the French Human Rights League, because the platform was not moderating even ‘obviously illegal content’.Photograph: Nathan Howard/ReutersHolocaust denial – the claim that the Nazi genocide was fabricated or has been exaggerated – is a criminal offence in 14 EU countries includingFranceand Germany, while many others have laws criminalising genocide denial including the Holocaust.Three French government ministers, Roland Lescure, Anne Le Hénanff and Aurore Bergé, said late on Wednesday they had reported “manifestly illegal content published by Grok on X” to the prosecutor under article 40 of France’s criminal code.The French Human Rights League (LDH) and the anti-discrimination group SOS Racisme confirmed on Thursday that they had also filed complaints against the first Grok post for “disputing crimes against humanity”.Nathalie Tehio, the LDH’s president, said the complaint was “unusual” because it concerned statements made by an artificial intelligence chatbot, thus raising the question of “what [material] this AI is being trained on”.Tehio said Musk’s responsibility as X’s owner was key since the platform was not moderating even “obviously illegal content”. SOS Racisme said X had “again shown its inability or refusal to prevent the dissemination of Holocaust denial content”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI from pre-training to post-training to inference.”The company surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in nearly every regard, as it has for multiple quarters in a row, a sign that the financially enormous AI boom is not slowing down. Nvidia reported $1.30 in diluted earnings per share on $57.01bn in total revenues, beating investor expectations of $1.26 in earnings per share on $54.9bn in revenue. Sales are up 62% year-over-year. The company reported $51.2bn in revenue from datacenter sales, beating expectations of $49bn. The company is also projecting fourth- quarter revenue of around $65bn; analysts had predicted the company would issue a guidance of $61bn.On the call with investors, Huang said that there were three huge platform shifts: a transition from general purpose computing to accelerated computing; a transition to generative AI and a transition to agentic and physical AI, eg robots or autonomous vehicles.“As you consider infrastructure investments, consider these three fundamental dynamics,” Huang said. “Each will contribute to infrastructural wealth. Nvidia … enables all three transitions and does so for any form or modality of AI.”Demand for the company’s chips continues to grow, he said.“AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As investors worry that mounting CapEx will force companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Nvidia continues to prove that datacenter scaling is not optional, but rather the central need for every tech business in the world.”Analysts and experts said that although they were largely confident Nvidia would beat Wall Street expectations, they were anxiously awaiting the earnings call for morenews on the status of industry demand for the firm’s AI chips.“There is still no doubt that Nvidia is far and away the leader for AI-focused chips,” David Meier, senior analyst at investment websitethe Motley Fool, wrote. “So, I expect revenue, margins, and cashflows to be pretty close to analysts’ estimates. But the valuable information is more likely to come from the commentary about where management sees its markets headed, whether it’s in the AI market or [a] new market the company is currently pursuing.”Shares in Nvidia have been down 7.9% in November after major investors dumped their stocks in the firm. Peter Thiel’s hedge fund,Thiel Macro, sold off its entire stake in the chipmaker in the last quarter. His holdings would have been valued at about $100m, according to a Reuters report. Softbank has also sold off its $5.8bn holdings in the company, further boosting fears of an AI bubble.Shares in Nvidia – which last month became the world’s first $5tn company – rose more than 5% in post-market trade, while S+P 500 and Nasdaq futures also soared. Asian markets also rallied on Thursday, following the news.However, SPI Asset Management’s Stephen Innes said: “Nvidia’s latest forecast has, for now, dulled the sharpest edges of the AI-bubble anxiety that had gripped global markets … But make no mistake: this is still a market balancing on a wire stretched between AI euphoria and debt-filled reality.”“I do not believe that Nvidia’s growth is sustainable long-term,” said Forrester’s senior analyst Alvin Nguyen. “AI demand is unprecedented, but if there is a market correction due to supply meeting demand or a slowdown in the pace of innovation/businesses getting used to the pace, I expect that the continued growth in Nvidia share value will slow down.”Explore more on these topicsNvidiaArtificial intelligence (AI)Quarterly resultsStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

Yuletide now seems to start roughly when Strictly does, and Black Friday kicked off around Halloween, judging by the landfill of exclamation-marked emails weighing down my inbox.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Black Friday is a devil worth dancing with if you want to save money on products you’ve had your eye on – and it can pay to start dancing now. Some of the Filter’s favourite items are already floating around at prices clearly designed to make them sell out fast. Other deals won’t land until the big day itself on 28 November, or even until the daftly named Cyber Monday (1 December).As ever, we’d encourage you not to buy anything unless you really need it and have the budget to do so – readour advice on how to shop smartly.We’ll keep this page updated over the next few days with more genuine Black Friday bargains on the Filter’s favourites, from Anker battery packs to KidiZoom cameras via the espresso machine you loved more than any other product this year.How we selected these deals (and excluded others)The key toshopping smarton Black Friday, Cyber Monday or any discount event is to know what you want – and we’re here to help you target the good stuff. We’ve tested thousands of products at the Filter in 2025 and warmly recommended hundreds of them, including many that have genuinely good Black Friday discounts.Instead of listing price cuts on all the products we’ve featured, we’ve focused on the things you’ve liked the most this year, and looked for deals that undercut their long-term average prices by a significant amount. Ideally, their Black Friday price will be their lowest of the year.We don’t take retailers at their word on discount size, either. Amazon may say it’s “70%” off the RRP, but we study the price history of every item using independent tools such asthe Camelizerto find out how generous a discount really is. If an item’s price has been all over the place in 2025, we’ll give the average price below instead of a “was …” price, so you can judge how good a deal it is.Q&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best early Black Friday deals on the Filter’s favourite productsThe best home dealsShark vacuum cleanerView image in fullscreenShark PowerDetect vacuum, £314 (was £549)£314 at Shark£314 at AmazonA vacuum cleaner that empties itself? Yes please, said our writer Andy Shaw in his roundup of thebest cordless vacuum cleaners– and you agreed, making Shark’s ingenious and powerful cordless cleaner one of your favourite products of the year. Vacuums that look after themselves don’t come cheap, and it’s great to see this one heavily discounted at Shark’s own website as well as at Amazon.The best robot vacuum cleanerView image in fullscreenEufy X10 Pro Omni, £499 (was £579)£499 at AmazonYou wait a lifetime for a self-emptying vacuum cleaner, then Black Friday brings you two at once. The Eufy X10 was named “best overall” by Stuart Andrews in his guide to thebest robot vacuums, and it’s already one of the fastest-selling items in Amazon’s Black Friday sale. Its price cut isn’t quite the 38% Amazon suggests, because it cost £579 throughout 2025, but this is still a legitimately good deal.Damp-destroying dehumidifierView image in fullscreenProBreeze dehumidifier, from £151.99 (was £189.99)£151.99 at Amazon£159.99 at ProBreezeThis “workhorse”, which “extracted moisture powerfully” in ourbest dehumidifierstest, has tumbled to its lowest price of the year (except for a few days in May, because no one buys dehumidifiers in May). If the recent cold snap gave you the condensation blues, here’s your chance to snap up the ProBreeze for a chunk below its average Amazon price of just over £180.Cuddly heated throwView image in fullscreenBeurer HD150 heated throw, £79.99 (was £84.99)£79.99 at AmazonBeurer’s “soft and sumptuous” fleece blanket was crowned “best throw overall” in our guide to thebest electric blanketsthanks to its ability to get toasty fast without using much energy. A fiver off is not a massive discount, but this is its cheapest recent price on Amazon, where it normally costs £84.99 – and other retailers still want over £100 for it. We’ll bring you any non-Amazon deals that emerge in the coming days.Google video doorbellView image in fullscreenGoogle Nest doorbell, from £119.98 (was £179.99)£119.98 at Amazon£129 at CurrysSort the cold-callers from the welcome visitors when they’re still metres away from your front door, with this outstanding battery-powered doorbell that crashes to its lowest price since Black Friday 2023. Andy Shaw named it thebest video doorbelloverall, but lamented that you also have to fork out for aNest Aware subscriptionat £80 a year to save recordings.Budget electric blanketView image in fullscreenSlumberdown Sleepy Nights electric blanket, king size, from £30.59(was £45.99)£30.59 (king size) at Amazon£34.20 at SlumberdownThis Slumberdown Sleepy Nights performed admirably inEmily Peck’s testing, heating quickly to a temperature that was comfortable to keep our reviewer warm through the night. It also has elasticated fitted straps to make fitment easy, and comes in a variety of sizes to suit your bed size. It’s the king-size one that’s been discounted.Subscription-free video doorbellView image in fullscreenEufy Security doorbell E340, £74.99 (avg £151.29)£74.99 at AmazonLots of video doorbells and home surveillance systems come with a recurring subscription to access some of their features, which you may wish to avoid. If so, then the Eufy Video Doorbell E340 was Andy Shaw’s pick in his testing of thebest video doorbellsout there. He liked the E340 precisely because of its dual camera setup to make keeping an eye on parcels a breeze, plus the onboard storage to stick it to cloud storage. Reliability of movement detection needed some work, though. At £75 from Amazon, it’s also at its lowest price ever this Black Friday from the big online retailer.The best kitchen dealsVersatile espresso makerView image in fullscreenDe’Longhi Stilosa espresso machine, £84.55 (was £89)£84.55 at AmazonThe promise of “ludicrously tasty” espresso and “perfect microfoam for silky cappuccinos and flat whites” proved so irresistible that this was one of the Filter recommendations you loved most in 2025. Our writer Sasha Muller was already wowed by its affordability in hisespresso machinestest, and it’s rarely discounted at all, so we’re not too sad to see it drop just a few pounds for Black Friday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Its compatibility, compactness and coffee impressed the Filter’s cuppa connoisseur, Sasha Muller, enough to be named “best capsule machine” in his bid to find thebest coffee machines.Ninja air fryerView image in fullscreenNinja Double Stack XL, £188 (was £269.99)£188 at Ninja£188 at AmazonIf you’re still holding out on buying an air fryer, here’s a rare chance to grab a big-name, big-capacity Ninja without the big price tag. Not quite so big, anyway. Rachel Ogden named the Double Stack XL “best compact air fryer” in her guide to thebest air fryers, but with its 9.5lL capacity and four cooking levels, this thing can cook alot. Still not cheap, but far below its average price of £229.The best blenderView image in fullscreenBraun PowerBlend 9, from £140 (was £199)£140 at Amazon£148.97 at John LewisYou can spend about £500 on a premium blender, but this superb model from Braun costs below £200 even at full price – something ourbest blenderstester, Rachel Ogden, could hardly believe when she named it “best overall”. Hold on to your smoothie, Rachel, because it’s now less than £150, and not just at Amazon.Tefal air fryerView image in fullscreenTefal Easy Fry Dual XXL, £119.99 (was £199.99)£119.99 at AmazonTefal is known mostly for its ActiFry tech, so when Rachel Ogden crowned the Tefal Easy Fry Dual XXL as thebest air fryer, it made sense. She found it to be a sublime all-rounder in her testing, handling both chips and frozen food very well. With an 11-litre capacity, it’s also Tefal’s largest dual zone air fryer, making it handy for cooking a lot of food for larger families when you need to. Its price of £104 at Amazon is its best ever.The best electric kettleView image in fullscreenBosch Sky Kettle, £64.99 (avg £85.38)£64.99 at John Lewis£64.99 at AmazonThe Bosch Sky Kettle isour favourite electric kettle– as Rachel Ogden noted in her testing, it wins because it is a “good all-rounder that will suit most people”. That’s down to a number of factors, including how easy it is to pour, plus strong build quality and generally decent boil time. For £65 (a return to its best ever price), that seems like a useful reduction.The best personal care appliance dealsSunrise alarm clockView image in fullscreenLumie Sunrise Alarm, from £29.99 (was £49)£29.99 at Amazon£37.49 at BootsOne of your favourite Filter recommendations of the year, this gentlesunrise alarm clockwill wake you up with kittens purring, birdsong, gently brightening light – or a plain old alarm sound if you prefer. It’s been around for a few years and saw a price hike in 2022 (cost-of-waking-up crisis?) before settling at just under £50 from most retailers, so this is a deal worth grabbing.Water flosserView image in fullscreenWaterpik Ultra Professional, from £59.99 (was £91)£59.99 at Amazon£73 at CurrysBlast the gunk from your gums without having to grapple with floss. The Waterpik Ultra is a countertop model so it takes up more space than the cordless type, but this gives it more versatility and saw it score top marks with ourwater flossertester Alan Martin. If you’d rather avoid Amazon, you can find it discounted by other retailers, albeit not by as much.The best IPL deviceView image in fullscreenPhilips Lumea 9900, £404.99 (avg £501.33)£404.99 at AmazonIPL (intense pulsed light) hair remover devices promise to banish stubbly regrowth without the pain of waxing and epilation – at a price. The Philips Lumea 9900, Lise Smith’s pick forbest IPL deviceoverall, has cost as much as £599.99 for much of the year, and occasional discounts rarely go below £450. Amazon’s current price shaves more than £40 off any other Black Friday deal we’ve found.The best beauty dealsA bargain beauty Advent calendarView image in fullscreenW7 Beauty Blast Advent calendar, £16.95 (was £19.95)£16.95 at AmazonAdvent calendars are a Christmas staple, and we’ve seen lots of brands try to put a different spin on them in the past – beauty Advent calendars are some of the most prominent. This W7 Beauty Blast calendar provides excellent value for money at a deal-busting £16.95 from Amazon, especially as it provides genuinely useful products for most folks. The likes of the eyeshadows, primers, lip balms and such are travel-size, but apart from that, Sarah Matthews had little cause for complaint in her ranking of thebest beauty Advent calendars.For more:Big savings – or big regrets?

But with so many websites being shouty about their Black Friday offers, the best buys aren’t always easy to spot. So before you splash the cash, it might pay to do some research – and look closely at the specification.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I know this may not be welcome advice. After all, the thought of drawing up a spreadsheet of memory configurations and pricing history might put a slight dampener on the excitement that builds as Black Friday approaches. But buy the right laptop today and you can look forward to many years of joyful productivity. Pick a duff one, and every time you open the lid you’ll be cursing your past self’s impulsive nature. So don’t get caught out; be prepared with our useful tips – and a roundup of the Filter’s favourite laptop deals.Before you make the jump, also be sure you really need a new laptop withour guide to making the most out of your existing one.How to find a genuinely good Black Friday laptop dealView image in fullscreenFind out what a laptop is really like to use to ensure it’s right for you.Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty ImagesDon’t sweat the CPUMany people get hung up on processor power, but this is the one thing you rarely need to worry about these days. Although new processor models come out with alarming frequency, almost any AMD Ryzen, Intel Core or Apple M-series chip of the past few years will be fine for everyday web browsing and office tasks. High-end models are only really needed for particularly demanding workloads; a quick trip to Google (or your AI chatbot of choice) will help you see how different processor models measure up.Plan ahead with plenty of RAM and storageEvery laptop needs a decent amount of memory. If the system is starved of RAM, then performance will be sluggish, regardless of the CPU’s speed. While Windows 11 runs acceptably in 8GB, a minimum of 16GB will help ensure that future updates continue to run smoothly. Some models are upgradeable, so you can start with a basic allocation of RAM and add more as your needs grow, but this certainly isn’t something you can take for granted.Laptop storage is also rarely expandable, except by plugging in a USB flash drive or an external SSD. That might be fine if your device will spend much of its time on a desk, but if you want to carry it around with you – not an unreasonable ask for a computer of this type – it’s a drag. So while a base-level 256GB SSD might suffice for home-working, consider stepping up to 512GB or even 1TB of internal storage, especially if you want to edit videos or play big 3D games. Look into battery life, weight and overall dimensions, too, if portability is a priority.Find out what it’s really like to useSome important considerations – such as the quality of the screen and keyboard – don’t show up on the spec sheet, yet these things are arguably just as important as the processor and memory. If the display is dim and blocky, and typing emails feels like pressing Scrabble tiles into a flannel, it will make day-to-day working more difficult.Since online retail doesn’t give you an opportunity to try tapping out “the quick brown fox” for yourself, the next best thing is to read reviews of other people’s hands-on experience. Pay particular attention to the model number, though: laptops often come in a few variants, including a high-end version that will usually get great reviews – and a more cheaply made model that can be flogged for a knock-down price on Black Friday.Is this a genuine special offer?The final thing to check is whether the bargain that’s flashing up on your screen is actually a deal at all. You can look up past prices for a vast range of items by going toCamelCamelCamel– yes, really – and either typing in a laptop model number or pasting in the web address of an Amazon product page. You may find that the heavily promoted Black Friday price is identical to last month’s standard price on Amazon. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad deal, but it signals that you probably don’t need to race to grab a once-in-a-lifetime bargain (we’ve made sure to list this price history on all the laptop deals below).Indeed, with Cyber Monday, pre- and post-Christmas sales, Easter specials, Amazon Prime Day, back-to-school offers and so forth, you’re rarely more than a few weeks away from the next big discount event – so don’t let the excitement of Black Friday encourage you into making a hasty purchase.For more, read the Filter’s roundup of thebest early Black Friday dealsQ&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us.

Its Intel Core Ultra 5 225H processor delivers solid performance, while 32GB of RAM and a hefty capacity 1TB SSD provide enough headroom for intensive multitasking and installing of all sorts of apps.A larger 16in Full HD+ resolution OLED screen displays high-quality output with deeper blacks, stronger contrast, and more accurate colours than standard IPS screens found elsewhere at this price. Up to 20 hours of battery life is a boon if you’re going to be away from the mains, too.Price history:not available, but this is the lowest price ever at Currys.A rare MacBook dealView image in fullscreenApple MacBook Air M2 13-inch£699 at John Lewis£699 at CurrysApple’s M2 MacBook Air is a couple of years old now, but the Apple Silicon chip inside continues to deliver oodles of power for anything from productivity loads to editing high-res video on battery power. It’s sleek, portable and stylish, although it lacks ports, so you may need to pick up a cheap USB-C adapter to supplement. The 13.6in Liquid Retina screen is sharp and detailed, while 18 hours of battery life is sure to keep you up and running for a couple of working days away from the mains.Price history:this is the lowest ever price.A decent everyday laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Aspire 14 AI£399 at CurrysFor basic working needs, this Acer Aspire 14 AI has everything you need at a wallet-friendly price. The Snapdragon X chip inside provides more than enough power for day-to-day tasks, plus it enables this laptop to last for up to 28 hours on a charge, which means battery woes can be pushed to the back of your mind. A RAM allocation of 16GB is handy for multitasking, and a 512GB SSD is a decent amount of storage at this price. The 14in 1,920 x 1,200 IPS panel is perfectly serviceable for productivity tasks, plus its 120Hz refresh rate keeps onscreen action zippy.Price history:not available, but this is the lowest ever price at Currys.A lightweight Windows laptopView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook A14£649 at John LewisMade from an innovative blend of ceramic and aluminium, this Asus Zenbook A14 is one of the lightest Windows laptops you’ll find, weighing in at less than a kilo. Not only is it super light, but a Snapdragon X chip alongside 16GB of RAM ensures enough grunt for productivity and multitasking.A 1TB SSD is handy for storing documents, apps, and more besides, while the 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED screen is compact and sharp. Asus also rates this laptop to last for up to 32 hours on a charge – while my tests put it at about 21 hours, I’ll happily take nearly three days of use away from the mains.Price history:not available.A budget Samsung laptopView image in fullscreenSamsung Galaxy Book4£299 at AmazonThe Samsung Galaxy Book4 is an attractive Windows alternative to similarly priced Chromebooks, offering greater software flexibility for getting work done. It includes an impressive range of ports for the price, with USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, microSD and even wired Ethernet in the mix. The Intel Core 3 processor will happily cope with everyday productivity tasks, and is supported by 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for storage.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A stylish model from SamsungView image in fullscreenSamsung Galaxy Book4 Edge£449 at John LewisThe Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge is a modern, plate-glass laptop for the same price as lots of more basic, older models in this early Black Friday melee. It features the same eight-core Snapdragon X chip as Asus’s option, plus 16GB of RAM; a 256GB SSD is a little low, though. However, what the Book4 Edge has on its side is a larger Full HD IPS screen, a full-size keyboard, and that it arrives in a dashing light-blue colour.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A bargain ChromebookView image in fullscreenAcer Chromebook Plus 515£235.99 at AmazonChromebooks have always been deemed inferior to Windows laptops, but you can now easily find genuinely capable budget options with few compromises. Acer’s Chromebook Plus 515 features a modest Intel processor with six cores that should prove sufficiently speedy for basic tasks, while its 8GB of RAM will allow you to have multiple Chrome tabs open without the device grinding to a halt. You also get 256GB of SSD storage for apps and light games, plus room for any local documents that aren’t in Google’s online suite. There’s also a handy 15.6in Full HD screen and a decent set of ports for this bargain-basement price.If you feel like you need the extra performance, you can step up to a Core i5 processor with an extra four cores for anextra £102 at Amazon.Price history:it was £12.79 cheaper in a deal this summer.A bargain LenovoView image in fullscreenLenovo IdeaPad Slim 5£449.99 at John LewisThis Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 is on a “reduced to clear” discount at John Lewis, giving you the chance to grab a bit of a bargain. It has everything you could want from a modern laptop: a compact 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED screen for dazzling results; an eight-core Snapdragon X Plus chip for zippy performance; and excellent battery life – Lenovo says the laptop can last for up to 20 hours or so on a charge, providing all-day working and then some. For multitasking and intensive tasks, 16GB of RAM provides plenty of headroom, while a 512GB SSD is fine for storage at this price.Price history:this was briefly cheaper in the summer.A powerful and portable ultrabookView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook 14£999.99 at AmazonThis Asus Zenbook 14 is a very capable choice. The Intel Core Ultra 9 285H processor with its 16 cores means it will be able to handle any tasks you throw at it, and 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD provide lots of capacity for multitasking and dealing with heavier, creative workloads. Elsewhere, the 14in 3K OLED screen is bright and delivers good detail, and a weight of just 1.2kg makes the Asus super portable. There’s a decent selection of ports, too –and its dark-blue chassis oozes class.If you don’t necessarily need the power of the Core Ultra 9 285H, and you’re happy with a slightly lower-end Core Ultra 7 model (which performs quite similarly in some tests) with 16GB of RAM, then that model is £799 from John Lewis, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A Zenbook with a high-resolution displayView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook S 16 OLED£1,229.99 at AmazonThe Asus Zenbook S 16 OLED is one of the most complete ultrabooks you can buy today, making no real sacrifices anywhere. The star of the show is the gorgeous 16in, 3K-resolution screen, which delivers superb detail and general sharpness. On the inside sits a 12-core Ryzen AI R9 HX 370 processor, alongside 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. There’s a decent set of ports and the casing is made from the same innovative ceraluminum material as the Zenbook A14 above, meaning it’s durable and stylish, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price, and it’s cheaper than lower-spec deals on the same laptop.A high-spec touchscreen LenovoView image in fullscreenLenovo Yoga Slim 7x£799 at CurrysThis Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x option provides a very rich set of specs for the price. The 12-core Snapdragon X Elite processor delivers both in terms of performance and efficiency, with the laptop rated to last for up to 24 hours on a single charge. Add to this a decent 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.Its compact 3K-resolution OLED screen displays plenty of detail in a smaller space, and up to 500 nits of brightness means images are sharp and vibrant. The Yoga Slim is also a touchscreen, giving you the flexibility to use it for more creative or design-type tasks. Go for the blue colourway to add some style to your workspace.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A portable Asus laptopView image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook S 14£599.99 at AmazonThe Asus Vivobook S 14’s portable form factor houses an eight-core AMD Ryzen 9 270 processor, plus 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, and should prove ample for general work tasks, whether at home or on the move. The 14in 1,920 x 1,200-resolution IPS panel might not be an OLED, but it’s still perfectly capable for what this laptop is designed for. The port selection here is also pretty good, providing decent connectivity for most people’s needs.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The eight cores and 12 threads of the Intel Core i5-13420H processor here deliver solid productivity performance, with room to step up to more intense workloads if the need arises. Elsewhere, 16GB of RAM and a capacious 1TB SSD are excellent for the price, plus there’s a decent port selection that includes USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, a microSD reader and more besides.Price history:this matches its lowest ever price.A compact ChromebookView image in fullscreenAcer Chromebook Plus 514£279 at AO£279.99 at AmazonA more compact mid-range Chromebook than the ones above, the Acer Chromebook Plus 514 is one of my favourites. The six-core Intel Core i3-1315U processor means there’s plenty of power on tap for web browsing and everyday tasks, while 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD allow for multiple tabs to be open and fulfil any of your storage needs. Add to this a decent 14in 1,920 x 1,200-resolution display, plus up to 13 hours of battery life to get you through the day.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A slim ultrabook with an OLED displayView image in fullscreenAcer Swift X 14 AI£1,199.99 at AmazonThe Acer Swift X 14 AI is a slim and powerful ultrabook, featuring a dazzling 14in 2,880 x 1,800 OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth and responsive on-screen action. Its AMD Ryzen 7 AI 350 processor can handle anything from productivity tasks to more intensive work, with Nvidia’s RTX 5050 GPU stepping up where extra graphical horsepower is required. Elsewhere, the port count includes USB-C, USB-A, microSD and HDMI, all present in a chassis that’s less than 20mm thick and 1.57kg in weight.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A two-in-one ChromebookView image in fullscreenLenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Duet£159.99 at AmazonThe Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Duet is a unique proposition in this list, offering a proper 2-in-1 device for both tablet and laptop-style duets, with the convenient and lightweight nature of ChromeOS to boot. It has an 11in Full HD+ resolution display, plus 128GB of eMMC storage for apps and games. The 4GB of RAM is a bit meagre, so you’re best to stick to basic web browsing, while its MediaTek Kompanio 838 processor should cope fine with casual work. It also comes with a stylus and a folio keyboard and kickstand case, and weighs just 510g, so is very easy to take on the go.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A lightweight LG laptopView image in fullscreenLG Gram Pro 17Z90TR£1,669.99 at AmazonLG’s Gram laptops have long been lightweight and slender choices in their size classes, and this 17in model is no exception, weighing in at just 1.479kg. It’s also just 14.5mm thick, but maintains a decent port selection with Thunderbolt 4-capable USB-C ports, USB-A and HDMI options.The 17-inch 2.5K resolution screen with 144Hz refresh rate is zippy and responsive, thanks to an Nvidia RTX 5050 paired with a powerful Intel Core Ultra 7 255H processor. In spite of this power, LG says this laptop will last for up to 27 hours on a charge, giving you several days of work away from the mains.Price history:this is a match for its lowest ever price.A larger-screen Windows laptop for under £500View image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook 16 X1605VA£479.99 at AmazonFor a larger-screen Windows laptop for productivity tasks and the odd bit of more intensive work, this Asus Vivobook 16 is perfect. Performance is decent, thanks to a 10-core Intel Core 7-150U processor, plus 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for your storage needs. The 16-inch 1,920 x 1,200 IPS screen is pretty standard at this price, but a lay-flat hinge makes this laptop great for collaborative working. You also benefit here from a full-size keyboard, while USB-C, USB-A, HDMI and a headphone jack make up the port count.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An upgrade on the Acer aboveView image in fullscreenAcer Aspire 14 AI£699.99 at AmazonThe Acer Aspire 14 AI is different to the model above: it comes running an eight-core AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 chip, with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, rather than the Arm-based Snapdragon processor. Display-wise, you get a 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED panel that delivers deeper blacks and stronger contrast and colour accuracy, and a good selection of ports. This model is a little more expensive than the other version, but I’d argue the expense is justified.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.Lots of power for the priceView image in fullscreenMSI Prestige AI Evo£899 at AmazonMSI’s Prestige Evo is a very powerful ultrabook for its price, offering Intel’s potent Core Ultra 9 288V processor with its eight cores and eight threads, plus 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for solid performance and decent storage. The iGPU inside this modern Intel chip is also strong for creative tasks, while the 13.3in 2.8K-resolution OLED screen is sharp and delivers good detail across a smaller area. The thin chassis and compact form are great for portability, yet don’t sacrifice too much on ports.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A lightweight 16in laptopView image in fullscreenLG Gram Pro 16Z90TS£1,029.99 at Amazon£1,149 at CurrysIn keeping with the portable laptop theme, this LG Gram Pro 16Z90TS provides one of the lightest 16in laptops you’ll find, delivering a good selection of ports and solid performance, with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Intel’s Core Ultra 7 256V processor with eight cores and eight threads, plus its potent integrated graphics, provide enough oomph for both basic workloads and more intensive tasks. It’s a shame the 16in 2.5K 144Hz panel isn’t OLED; but it’s a decent IPS screen – it’s responsive and delivers good detail. Lasting for up to 25.5 hours on a charge, you’ll get a few days away from the mains.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The best gaming laptop dealsAn Asus ROG for lessView image in fullscreenAsus ROG Strix G16£1,599 at AO£1,599 at VeryAsus’s ROG gaming laptops typically carry a premium, but this Strix G16 is one of the cheapest RTX 5070 Ti-powered gaming machines available right now. Pairing it with a 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 7940HX processor will yield very capable gaming performance at this laptop’s native 1,920 x 1,200 resolution.The display also has a 165Hz refresh rate for more responsive onscreen action. Modern AAA games can be a storage hog, but the 1TB SSD means there’s enough headroom for a good few here, while 16GB of RAM is enough for gaming loads.Price history:not available, but cheaper than the closest equivalent on Amazon.A mid-range gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Nitro V16 AI£1,089.99 at Amazon£1,099 at VeryAcer’s Nitro V16 is a strong mid-range gaming laptop, especially in this spec, which pairs an RTX 5070 graphics card with AMD’s eight-core Ryzen AI 7 350 processor. The setup delivers solid performance at 1080p and the laptop’s native 2,560 x 1,600 resolution – although the higher resolution may benefit from reduced settings and some upscaling. A 180Hz refresh rate makes for a smooth and responsive panel, and the laptop comes with a well-rounded port selection, too. Acer rounds off the package with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A sub-£1,000 gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAsus V16£799 at AmazonAt £799, the Asus V16 is quite a feature-rich gaming laptop, as long as you don’t mind its modest 1080p display. The 10-core, 16-thread Intel Core 7 240H processor paired with an RTX 5060 laptop GPU brings solid performance to the table, alongside the powers of Nvidia’s DLSS4 upscaler and the multi-frame-gen tech, if you want it. The 16GB of RAM will be good to run most modern games, with the 1TB SSD generous for storage. All of this helps to drive a large, 16in, 1,920 x 1,200-resolution, 144Hz-refresh-rate screen for a solid blend of detail and responsiveness. An array of USB-C, USB-A, HDMI ports and more deliver decent connectivity, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A high-performance gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAlienware 18 Area-51£2,899 at Amazon£2,998.99 at DellIf it’s averycapable gaming laptop you’re after, this Alienware 18 Area-51 is one of the strongest options you’ll find. A 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and Nvidia’s second-in-command RTX 5080 laptop GPU deliver the goods for gaming on its huge 18in QHD+ resolution screen. The IPS panel here is strong, too, with its super-high 300Hz refresh rate bringing impeccable motion handling. There’s 32GB of DDR5 RAM and a generous 2TB SSD. Sporting Alienware’s classic space-age looks, you’ll need some muscle if you plan to use it on the move – this laptop is big and bulky; but the extra room also means it arrives with an enviable set of ports.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An attractive Acer laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Predator Helios Neo 16 AI£1,599.99 at AmazonThe Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 AI is one of the best value gaming laptops in its price class – but it’s become an even stronger proposition with a £300 price cut. On the inside beats an RTX 5070 Ti GPU alongside the same beefy Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor as the Alienware option above to handle the most demanding of games on its 16-inch, 2,560 x 1,600-resolution screen. The panel’s 240Hz refresh rate delivers smooth motion, plus you also get 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Those looking for style as well as substance won’t be disappointed, as the Acer is quite a looker compared to other gaming behemoths out there. If price-to-performance is the name of the game, this is a candidate for the best we’ve seen this Black Friday so far.Price history:this is its lowest ever price, although it was only 1p more for a period in September.For more:How to shop smart this Black FridayHow to avoid bad Black Friday TV dealsThe best early Black Friday dealsExplore more on these topicsLaptopsThe FilterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And it may be that you don’t need a new TV at all – don’t let the Black Friday FOMO fool you. Read our guide tomaking the most out of the TV you already have.But if you are set on a new TV, the trick is to know what you want, and why, before you start shortlisting. Here we tell you everything you need to look out for, before rounding up some of the best TV deals in this year’sBlack Friday sales.Black Friday TV deals: what to look forView image in fullscreenSteer clear of the bargain aisle if you want your new TV to make a statement.Photograph: Pressmaster/Getty ImagesDesign is importantDesign counts. If you want that new TV to be a statement in your living space, stay clear of the bargain aisle – that’s where you’ll find cookie-cutter designs with flimsy plastic pedestal stands. If you’re not wall mounting, pay particular attention to the feet. Are they placed close to each edge? On a TV 55 inches and larger, that could mean you’ll also have to factor in new furniture just to accommodate it.Central pedestal stands are always the easiest to live with, and some models also have a swivel so that you can angle the screen to best suit your seating. It’s a little bonus well worth having.Think about when you’ll use itAre you buying a TV for everyday use, or do you hanker after a special screen for movies? If it’s the latter, buying an OLED will generally be your best bet. Unlike LED-based TVs, there’s no need for a backlight, because OLED pixels are self-emitting. This means when you dim the lights, black levels stay nice and inky and shadow detail is retained, giving your pictures cinematic depth. Conversely, LED models (be they LCD LED, QLED or Mini LED) tend to look their best in rooms with ambient light, and therefore make better daytime TVs.Connectivity countsDon’t just look at the front. The cheapest TVs you’ll see during the Black Friday sales will only offer three HDMI inputs at the back. This may be fine if you don’t plan on connecting much equipment, but it could prove limiting in the long term. Cheap televisions tend to offer poor audio, so one of those HDMI ports will probably be assigned to a soundbar. That just leaves two to share between games consoles, set-top boxes and Blu-ray/DVD players.View image in fullscreenMaximise gaming performance by playing at a higher refresh rate.Photograph: simpson33/Getty ImagesConsider what you need for gamingIf you plan to play video games on your new set, check to see if those HDMIs support a 120Hz high refresh rate. If you own a PlayStation 5 or current Xbox, you can maximise performance (and therefore improve your chances of winning against your mates) by playing at a higher refresh rate. These 120Hz-capable TVs also tend to offer VRR (variable refresh rate) and ALLM (auto low latency mode), acronyms that add to the gaming experience.Incidentally, if you buy a Sony Bravia, there’s a good chance it will also have PS Remote Play, meaning you can enjoy your PlayStation console while it’s not even in the same room as the TV.Of course, you can always play games on standard 60Hz TVs, and if you have an older console or just like casual family games, you’ve nothing to worry about.Don’t avoid last year’s modelsMany TV makers use Black Friday to offer cheap deals on older stock, to clear inventory. This is where you really can grab a killer deal, particularly at the mid-to-higher end of the market.For example, a 2024 LG OLED C5 55in screen has a sale price of £1,199. The 2025 G5 OLED, also on sale, still commands a premium of £1,599. Last year’s top models will still impress 12 months after release.Buying a well-reviewed older TV is almost always better than buying a newer model that’s been stockpiled to shift in volume during the sales.Not all HDR is worth havingIt’s worth bearing in mind that not all HDR (high dynamic range) TVs are created equal. While every 4K model sporting a Black Friday price tag will boast HDR compatibility, there can be huge differences in performance. Entry-level screens – typically those 50in models selling for little more than £200 – will invariably lack the brightness to make HDR programmes really shine. Indeed, in their attempt to make HDR details (such as bright street lights, fireworks, explosions and so on) pop, the rest of the show can look unnaturally dark. These HDR ‘lite’ TVs are actually better suited to non-HDR programmes, such as regular SDR (standard dynamic range) channels on Freeview, rather than streams from Netflix and Co.The good news is that HDR performance improves dramatically from the mid-range upwards, and is a real differentiator at the posh end of the market.Be aware also that HDR comes in different flavours. In addition to standard HDR10, there’s HDR10+, Dolby Vision and cleverly ‘Adaptive’ versions of each on top, able to react to the light levels in your living room. Film fans favour screens that offer Dolby Vision, but not every brand has it. Samsung is the most prominent outlier.Sound adviceFinally, listen out for audio. It’s a fact that thin, inexpensive TVs generally tend to sound awful. They lack bass and become painful when you crank the volume. But there are exceptions that could save you from shelling out on a soundbar.Samsung QLED TVs boasting object tracking sound (OTS) offer far better audio than you might expect, and tend to have innovative processing that can enhance dialogue and combat extraneous noise, making them great for family use. Meanwhile, Sony OLED TVs have a clever Acoustic Surface Audio sound system, which uses actuators on the rear of the OLED panel to produce impressive high-fidelity audio. And if you want the full home theatre audio enchilada, Panasonic’s best sets have a full 360-degree sound system with front, side and up-firing speakers tuned by sister brand Technics, able to produce convincing Dolby Atmos cinema sound.And here’s a closing tip. Even if your Black Friday bargain TV doesn’t have decent sound onboard, check to see if it passes a Dolby Atmos signal out over the e-ARC HDMI connection, because you can always add a great-sounding Dolby Atmos soundbar during the January sales.Steve MayQ&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best 4K TV deals this Black FridayAn affordable 55in TVView image in fullscreenHisense A6Q LED, 55in£299 at Argos£299 at AmazonFor such an affordable mid-sized TV, this Hisense A6Q ticks most of the boxes, with a 4K resolution and a pleasant complement of HDR standards (Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG) that can provide vivid highlights in supported content. Freely is built in to provide access to live and on-demand TV out of the box, with no aerial or set-top box required. For gaming, there’s support for Auto Low Latency Mode, although the refresh rate tops out at 60Hz (120Hz or higher is preferable for smoother onscreen action with recent consoles). Connectivity is limited to three HDMI 2.1 ports.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A bargain TCL TVView image in fullscreenTCL C6KSQD-Mini LED, 50in£349 at Argos£349 at AmazonThe TCL C6KS seems too good to be true, packed with higher-end features at a bargain-basement price. It’s a modest 50 inches, but its Mini LED panel is bright and sharp with 160 dimming zones, allowing for surprisingly vibrant and saturated images for a television at this price point. Its new HVA panel helps in providing more depth to its overall images, top. For this price, the fact that it supports HLG, HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision is excellent. Many TVs several times more expensive can’t say that.Gaming performance is fine – it’ll do up to 4K/60Hz with VRR and ALLM – although the lack of higher-refresh-rate output means it isn’t optimal for powerful home consoles or PCs. In terms of connectivity, there are three HDMI ports, one of which supports eARC to hook up a soundbar or speakers for improved audio. The Onkyo-branded system with this TV is surprisingly detailed, though – you may be able to get away with using it for some time before feeling the need to upgrade to separate speakers.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A quality Sony TV for a low priceView image in fullscreenSony Bravia KD55X75WL, 55in£499 at AmazonWhile this isn’t Sony’s latest and greatest option, it’s a quality telly for a great price. It’s a moderate size that should be good for most rooms, and HDR support is reasonable, with HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision all supported.This Sony TV also comes with four HDMI ports for inputs, plus support for eARC to connect a soundbar or supported speakers. For gaming, it has ALLM, a custom screen size setting, a black equaliser and an onscreen crosshair – features more commonly seen in monitors than TVs.Smart TV duties are handled by the familiar Google TV OS, providing good access to smart apps, and it bundles in 15 credits of Sony Pictures Core and a 24-month streaming package.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A bright Mini LED TVView image in fullscreenHisense U7Q ProMini LED, 65in£899 at John Lewis£899 at CurrysThis large, feature-rich Mini LED TV looks like a capable option for everything from games to films.There’s a rich set of HDR support (Dolby Vision and Dolby Vision IQ, plus HDR10+, HDR10 and HLG) and the Mini LED screen allows for some serious depth and searing brightness (Hisense claims a peak brightness of 2,000 nits).The integrated speakers provide up to 50W of power and support Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround standards. There are different sound modes to dig into, too, as well as different picture modes, so you can optimise image quality as you wish.It has four HDMI 2.1 ports with full support for 4K/120Hz gaming, so will play nicely with modern games consoles (and if you’re a PC gamer looking for a living-room monitor, you’ll be glad to know that refresh rate can be overclocked further up to 165Hz). Support for variable refresh rate and ALLM further enhances the gaming experience.Price history:not available, but this is its lowest ever price at Currys.An entry-level LG OLED for lessView image in fullscreenLG B5OLED, 55in£899 at John Lewis£899 at AmazonLG’s B5 OLED is the most affordable entry in the brand’s 2025 OLED lineup, adding a new processor, improved connectivity and an updated UI to last year’s B4 model.It comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports with full support for 4K/120Hz output, and also offers VRR and ALLM for gaming. In terms of HDR, the B5 supports Dolby Vision IQ, Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG and Cinema HDR, offering impactful highlights in supported content. It also comes with LG’s slick and easy-to-use webOS operating system, with a wide range of streaming apps, plus different picture modes. The 20W speakers support Dolby Atmos.If you want a larger version, the 65in version is currently£1,299 at AO.Price history:this is the lowest ever price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It provides you with plenty of screen real estate and Philips’ own TitanOS smart system for accessing smart TV apps.There is decent HDR support for such an affordable television, with HDR10 and HLG, plus compatibility with HDR10+, and it has three HDMI ports – one of which is an eARC port for soundbars. It also supports HDMI VRR and ALLM for gaming. With this in mind, though, its maximum refresh rate is 60Hz rather than 120Hz. Its 20W speakers also have Atmos support.What’s unique about Philips TVs is the presence of the company’s Ambilight system, which provides atmospheric lighting on the rear of the unit that projects on to the surface behind it. Aimed at reducing eye strain, this is also useful if you want to add a splash of colour to your room.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A smart Samsung OLEDView image in fullscreenSamsung S90FOLED, 65in£1,395 at Amazon£1,599 at John LewisThe S90F is one of the only QD-OLED TVs Samsung offers – combining the inky blacks and virtually infinite contrast of an OLED with the higher peak brightness of a QLED. It means this telly provides sublime image quality. HDR support consists of HDR10, HDR10+ and HLG; Samsung still isn’t supporting Dolby Vision.The four HDMI 2.1 ports are welcome, and offer support for proper 4K/120Hz gaming, with up to 144Hz for PC gaming. There is also support for variable refresh and ALLM, alongside Samsung’s Game Hub menu.Price history:this is its lowest ever price at Amazon.Sony’s best OLED TVView image in fullscreenSony Bravia 8 IIQD-OLED, 65in£2,199 at John Lewis£2,199 at CurrysSony’s Bravia 8 II is one of the best TVs currently available – with a price to match. The QD-OLED panel is 25% brighter than on the A95L model it replaces, with even sharper picture quality, not least with HDR enabled. There’s support for Dolby Vision, HLG and HDR10, and claimed peak brightness is a searing 4,000 nits.The Acoustic Surface Audio+ speaker system is widely well reviewed, providing surprisingly solid audio for a set of TV speakers. Gaming support is strong, too, with 4K/120Hz input supported over HDMI 2.1, plus VRR and ALLM. There’s even an ‘optimised for PS5’ mode that automatically optimises the TV’s settings when it detects that the PlayStation is plugged in. Unlike Samsung and LG’s flagships, however, there are only two HDMI 2.1 ports here (one of which is an eARC, if you did want to connect a soundbar).Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An LG mid-range TV for a little cheaperView image in fullscreenLG C5OLED, 55in£1,099 at John Lewis£1,099 at CurrysLG’s latest mid-range C-series model OLED offers an improved operating system and a new processor over last year’s C4. The new processor helps it to better upscale content to 4K than previous models, too, which is handy if you watch a lot of older and lower-definition content.There are four HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K/144Hz gaming (or up to 4K/120Hz on consoles), with VRR and ALLM supported on all of them. HDR support comes in the form of HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision, and this 55in model benefits from LG’s Evo panel for even stronger brightness.As you’d expect from an LG OLED, it comes with dazzling image quality with inky blacks, sublime contrast and wonderfully accurate colours that make viewing everything from games to movies a pleasure.Price history:it’s been available slightly cheaper but this is its lowest price at a mainstream retailer.A great mid-range Sony OLEDView image in fullscreenSony Bravia 8A OLED, 55in£1,299 at John Lewis£1,299 at ArgosThe Sony Bravia 8A was initially more expensive than the standard Bravia 8, but as pricing has settled, this A variant has become a more compelling choice. One of Sony’s 2024 TV models, it comes with an OLED panel that it claims is 10% brighter than its predecessor. HDR support comes in with Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG (no HDR10+). It also comes with Sony’s AI-enabled Bravia XR processor inside, plus the same Acoustic Surface Audio+ sound system for surprisingly decent audio. The Google TV operating system also provides a familiar experience.As an OLED, image quality looks to be rather excellent, and gamers should be decently happy with HDMI 2.1 support for 4K/120Hz output with VRR and ALLM. As with the other Bravia above, this comes with the caveat that HDMI 2.1 is supported on only two of this TV’s four HDMI inputs.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The small 42in smart OLED TVView image in fullscreenLG C5OLED, 42in£849 at Argos£849 at AmazonThis 42in TV is the most compact OLED you can buy in the current LG range, making it a dead cert if you’ve got a smaller room like me, or want to use this TV as a super-size monitor.There are four HDMI 2.1-enabled ports with 4K/144Hz capability (and up to 120Hz on consoles), plus VRR and ALLM support for gaming. There’s also solid HDR support with HDR10, Dolby Vision and HLG. LG’s new webOS 25 brings small upgrades, such as the ability to hide apps on the front screen, and it’s a reasonable smart TV system to use every day.It also comes with a new AI Magic Remote with what LG calls ‘AI buttons’ – voice controls and drag-and-drop functions.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The surprising Mini LED standout 65in TVView image in fullscreenTCL C7KQD-Mini LED, 65in£749 at CurrysTCL has become known for its more affordable, feature-rich televisions in recent years. The C7K is a shining example of this, providing excellent image quality at a modest price point for its 65in size. A particular highlight is its fantastic black levels, contrast and dynamic range, helped along by a bright QD-Mini LED panel with 1,008 dimming zones and a claimed peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits.It also has a full complement of HDR support, with HLG, HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision for impactful highlights. Gaming support is great, with two out of the four HDMI ports supporting 4K/144Hz HDMI 2.1 powers with VRR and ALLM. Plus, if you’re willing to drop the resolution down to Full HD from 4K, it can double the refresh rate to 288Hz. That’s a feature more typically found on a PC monitor than a TV, but if you have a powerful PC connected and want to maximise performance in high-refresh-rate games, then the C7K should allow you to do so.This new model also adds in a Bang & Olufsen stereo with 60W of power, replacing TCL’s previous collaboration with Onkyo, as well as support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundtracks.If you’re after an even bigger screen, the 75in version is£948 at AmazonandAO.Price history:it’s only £40 cheaper than it’s been at Currys all month, but it’s still its lowest ever price.A big-screen LG OLEDView image in fullscreenLG C4OLED, 77in£1,799 at AmazonLast year’s mid-range LG OLED, the C4 was the first LG C-series OLED to support native 4K/144Hz output over its four HDMI 2.1 ports – a boon for gamers. It also brings proper Nvidia G-Sync certification for one of its supported VRR standards.The presence of webOS 24 brings benefits such as a built-in Chromecast for easy wireless casting right out of the box, and the Alpha 9 processor brings AI smarts to enhance the clarity of onscreen dialogue and to bring even more channels of virtual surround sound. The internal 40W speakers have Atmos support to provide more cinematic audio in supported content.Price history:this is higher than it was during Prime Day – but only by 2p.For more:How to shop smart this Black FridayHow to avoid bad Black Friday laptop dealsThe best early Black Friday dealsExplore more on these topicsThe FilterThe FilterTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thankfully her AI ‘clankers’ will be limited to this cultural momentVan BadhamWhile a robot pop star may be novelty now, young people are maturing with a scorn for generic digital productsThu 20 Nov 2025 17.59 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 18.43 ESTShareXania Monet is the latest digital nightmare to emerge from a hellscape of AI content production. No wonder she’s popular … but how long will it last?The music iteration of AI “actor” Tilly Norwood, Xania is a composite product manufactured of digital tools: in this case, a photorealistic avatar accompanied by a sound that computers have generated to resemble that of a human voice singing words.Those words are, apparently, the most human thing about her: Xania’s creator, Telisha “Nikki” Jones,has said in interviewsthat – unlike the voice, the face or the music – the lyrics are “100%” hers, and “come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences”.Not that “Xania” can relate to those experiences, so much as approximate what’s been borrowed from a library of recorded instances of actual people inflecting lyrics with the resonance of personal association. Some notes may sound like Christina Aguilera, some sound like Beyoncé, but – unlike any of her influences – Xania “herself” is never going to mourn, fear, risk anything for the cause of justice, make a difficult second album, explore her sexuality, confront the reality of ageing, wank, eat a cupcake or die.Paul McCartney joins music industry protest against AI with silent trackRead moreShe’s just a clearly branded audio-visual delivery vehicle for a familiar vibe and, when Jones herself is dead and gone, her “poems” can be fed into the AI’s infinite reproduction machine to be regenerated and resung for ever and ever and ever …… depending on the terms in the commercial music contract which Jones just signed, on behalf of her creation, for $3m – after Xania’s songs hit 17 million streams in two months, started charting on Billboard and resulted in a bidding war.With the rapid adoption of AI into the process of culture-making, the sudden commercial viability of Xania and products like her arerestarting conversationsabout the intersection of capitalism, creativity and opportunity that are as awkward as they are ancient.Awkward because, for all the romanticisation of human artistry, AI creatures don’t exist because a secretive cabal of aspirational robot overlords have forced them into lives. Xania exists because Telisha “Nikki” Jones is a creative entrepreneur who saw a market opportunity and 17 million freakin’ people turned up to download it.“Is this the future of music?” asked Forbes magazine of the Jones deal – but, more pertinently, it’s the present and the past. The “familiar vibe” of recorded music loops and samples were used by commercial producers long before Apple started making them available on home computer desktop apps more than 20 years ago. One wonders what Beethoven would have made of the tech, given he borrowed ideas fromMozart… who borrowed fromBach… who adapted themes fromVivaldi.If you’re concerned the face fronting the tune is not the person who wrote the song, I’ve got some terrible news for you aboutWhitney Houston,Céline Dion,Britney Spears,Elvis PresleyandFrank Sinatra.Entertainment has ever been the art of reference and illusion… which is why artists’ concerns swirl around AI’s capacity not to replace their creativity but as a potential channel for their exploitation.Any technofearful Redditor still persuaded by the myth of individual creative genius needs to familiarise themselves with words like “editor”, “dramaturg”, “amanuensis”, “arranger”, “fabricator”, “director”, “studio assistant” and “producer”. It takes a lot of folks to make one artist –not even David Bowieran his show alone.And while Xania Monet may indeed be as immortal and unchanging as systems of digital storage and electronic retrieval allow, her appeal is as limited as the cultural moment she represents.AI slop tops Billboard and Spotify charts as synthetic music spreadsRead moreAs contexts shift, so does generational taste. Just ask the castrati – the high-voiced boy singers displaced when Enlightenment liberalism restored female performers to the stage.So while a disembodied robot pop star may be novelty now, young people are maturing with a scorn for the sameyness of the digital products that saturate the mainstream cultural experience, denouncing the ubiquitous AI slop as“clankers”, with the same disdain of the young people who once chose the Beatles over Dean Martin, then the Beastie Boys over Led Zep.As other countries join Australia and Denmark in restricting young people’s access to social media, that realm of generational experience will have even clearer cultural demarcations. As rumours of a return toanalogue funcontinue to spread, so it is likely that tastes inspired by in-person gatherings around music and art, the consumption of printed materials and the spectacle of, uh, slide nights and maybe even theatre (God help us) will grow.I congratulate Monet/Jones on realising their moment. The only future music makers can be guaranteed is that the times will have their own favourite sound … and that the kids who come after will borrow the bits that they like, and move on.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Yet officials there said Israeli strikeskilled 33 people, including 12 children, on Wednesday; Israel said its troops had come under fire. Another five Palestinianswere killed on Thursday. Hundreds have died since the ceasefire was declared. Even if the shelling stops, the destruction of Palestinian life will carry on as Israel continues to throttle aid, and the consequences of two years of war unfold. The World Health Organizationwarnedlast month that the health catastrophe would last for generations.Food remains in short supply. While displaced families shiver in flooded makeshift shelters, with many facing a third winter of homelessness, aid organisations say theycannot deliverstockpiles of tents and tarpaulins. Israel, which denies blocking aid, has designated tent poles as “dual-use” items that could potentially be used for a military purpose. Save the Childrenreportschildren sleeping on bare ground in sewage-soaked clothing.The Guardian last weekrevealedUS plans for the long-term division of Gaza into a “green zone” under Israeli and international control, to be redeveloped, and a “red zone” left in ruins; a US official described reunion of the strip as “aspirational”. This vision – with international troops essentially propping up Israeli occupation, and Palestinians drawn to those areas to escape squalor and chaos elsewhere – echoes disastrous US policies in Iraq and Afghanistan.This is the grim underpinning ofthe UN security council resolution this week, endorsing Donald Trump’s peace proposals. The “board of peace” looks like a colonial authority overseen by Mr Trump, and perhaps anchored by Tony Blair. Palestinian technocrats, somehow both domestically credible and acceptable to the US and Israel – a notable feat – would work beneath it. All this would be possible thanks to an international stabilisation force that the US hopes to see deployed by January. That would be a stretch even if countries prove truly willing to commit troops.The resolution improved on a draft text and won backing from the Arab world – and angry rejection from the Israeli right – by including references to a Palestinian state and Israeli withdrawal. Yet those references are couched inthe vaguest terms, as an unguaranteed reward for sufficiently good behaviour, rather than as a recognition of inalienable Palestinian rights. If all goes according to plan, “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. Israeli withdrawal would be based on standards and timeframes agreed by the military itself as well as the US and others. Countries have backed not what this text does meanbut what it might conceivably mean or become.Some believe that this is the best that can be salvaged from current circumstances, given Mr Trump’s presidency; others hope that it isjust possiblethat this unpromising start could allow something better to be forged. But it is hard not to conclude that for some governments, this is more about conscience-salving and reputation-laundering than the best interests of Palestinians. Germany has alreadyannouncedthat it will resume weapons exports to Israel. For Palestinians, “what looked like a forever war may be metamorphizing into forever misery”, the political scientist Nathan  Brown haswarned. Countries that were complicit in a genocidal war have all the more duty to demand better.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Her colleagues should have spoken upThu 20 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 09.02 ESTShareCatherine Lucey, who covers the White House forBloombergNews, was doing what reporters are supposed to do: asking germane questions.Her query toDonald Trumpa few days ago during a “gaggle” aboard Air Force One was reasonable as it had to do with the release of the Epstein files, certainly a subject of great public interest. Why had Trump been stonewalling, she asked, “if there’s nothing incriminating in the files”.His response, though, was anythingbutreasonable.It was demeaning, insulting and misogynistic.He pointed straight at Lucey and told her to stop doing her job.“Quiet. Quiet, piggy,” said the president of the United States.From what I could tell, none of her colleagues in the press corps immediately rose to her defense. Things just moved on – business as usual, in a sense.Pete Hegseth’s attempt to gag journalism is a resounding failure | Margaret SullivanRead moreAnd yet, if I were making a timeline of Trump’s use of the press as a punching bag, this moment would deserve a place on it. Maybe it was his pointing. Maybe it was his direct command, as if he were in charge of what a reporter is allowed to ask.Maybe – probably – it was the nasty name-calling, which is meant to put a reporter in her place in front of the world. Maybe – probably – it was the lack of protest from other reporters.This, after all, is life in Trump’s America. Consider just the past day or so.Trump celebrated the Saudi crown prince, who, according to a2021 US intelligence report, approved the killing of a Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. (The crown prince has denied involvement in the killing.) The US president gave him a hero’s welcome to the White House.Trumpinsulted and threatened ABC News and its fine reporter Mary Bruce, who also asked germane questions, about Khashoggi as well as the Epstein files. “I think you are a terrible reporter. It’s the way you ask these questions,”he said. He called ABC a “crappy company” and said its license “should be taken away from ABC because your news is so fake and it’s so wrong”.We’re supposed to be used to this by now.Clearly, the president’s fervid supporters must approve of this sort of thing; they seem to see it as a way the president is using his power and position to diminish the “elite”, who he has taught them to despise.But getting used to it is dangerous. We all get worn down. “What can you do?” shrug even the caring among us.But, for me, “quiet, piggy” somehow breaks through. It should be a bridge too far, not business as usual.Wouldn’t it have been something to see the entire press corps shout back at Trump, in defense of their colleague? Wouldn’t it have been something to see them walk away from the gaggle?Why didn’t they?“Because access beats out solidarity, every day of the week,” Bill Grueskin, a former Miami Herald and Wall Street Journal editor who is a professor at Columbia Journalism School,posted on Bluesky. If any members of the press corps had somehow managed to push back and defend their colleague, they undoubtedly would have been punished by exclusion from these press briefings.So, yes, the access problem.And I’m sorry to say, they also don’t push back because they’re so used to it. After all, it’s nothing new. It’s just an especially egregious example of what’s been going on for years.I’ve been watching these moves of Trump’s for a long time. I was the Washington Post’s media columnist during the entire first Trump term, so I got an up-close look at how he constantly disparaged the press and its representatives – especially women, and even more especially, women of color.Heoften clashed, for example, with Yamiche Alcindor, who then covered the White House for the PBS NewsHour, condemning her supposedly “nasty” questions. This year, hecalled Alcindor, who now works for NBC, “second rate” and demanded that she, too, “be quiet”. He publicly called April Ryan, a longtime White House reporter, “a loser”.Nothing changes – it only worsens – because Trump gets away with it. His stalwart supporters don’t seem to care. The members of the press corps may write a sternly worded letter (or not), but they normalize it, too, by their inaction.Will this “quiet, piggy” moment make a difference? Only for those who care about decency in public officials and in American society.Maybe that’s an old-fashioned notion. And I’m not sure there are enough of us who remember that it matters.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinesUS politicsBloombergcommentShareReuse this content"

But once he was inaugurated, he seemed to pay precious little attention to prices and affordability.All that changed, however, when inflation-weary voters thrashed Trump and the GOP on election day this month – within days, the Trump administrationlaunched a slapdash effortto focus on affordability. Unfortunately, the campaign is a hot mess: a pile of absurdity, contradictions, magical thinking, scapegoating and good ol’ Trumpian dishonesty, with Trump repeatedly blaring that“prices are down”.Two days after election day, Trump got his administration’s affordability drive off to a disastrous start when he said, “Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down … So I don’t want to hear about the affordability.”Musk could be paid $1tn. Nvidia’s worth $5tn. Yet America’s poor are struggling to eat | Steven GreenhouseRead moreWith those words, billionaire Trump – who spends a lot of time palling around with fellow billionaires – showed utter contempt for the millions of Americans who struggle with affordability every time they go the grocery store. Trump told them they got it all wrong. He told them that they shouldn’t bother him about the trivial issue of affordability when he has bigger things to worry about, such as, perhaps, his obsession with winning the Nobel peace prize. Trump in effect said: I don’t feel your pain.Trump’s statement about everything being “way down” was absurdly obtuse and dishonest. How in the world could every price be way down when his cherished tariffs were pushing up prices?Banana prices are up 6.9%over the past year, beef is up 14.7% andcoffee up 18.9%(in part because of the huge, punitive tariffsTrump placed on Brazil’s coffee and beef). Between January and September, prices rose in five of the six main grocery groups tracked in the Consumer Price Index, includingmeats, poultry and fish(up 4.5%);non-alcoholic beverages(up 2.8%); andfruits and vegetables(up 1.3%).Despite these numbers, Trump keeps pushing his big lie about affordability. Since election day, he has said there’s“virtually no inflation”,“prices are way down”and “it is far less expensive under Trumpthan it was under sleepy Joe Biden”. Trump said all this even though prices overall have unarguably risen since Biden left office. Right now, inflation isrunning at a 3% annual clip,which is 50% higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% goal. In another falsehood, Trump boasted that gas prices have fallen tonearly $2 a gallon, even though his Department of Energy says theyaverage $3.19.Hit in the head by reality (and declining opinion polls), some Trump aides evidently told the Maga king that his “prices are down” rhetoric made him sound dangerously out of touch with typical Americans, many of whom are angry about prices continuing to climb after Trump promised to bring them down. Trump’s advisers seized on one quick fix to reduce some prices: roll back some of Trump’s beloved tariffs. That sensible idea contradicted Trump’s absurd assertion thatnew tariffs wouldn’t raise prices for US consumers.With some tariffs being rolled back oncoffee, beef, tomatoes and bananasalong with other tropical fruit, Trump will no doubt trumpet to the world that he’s cut prices as soon as those foods start declining in price. That would be like an arsonist boasting that he put out a fire that he had started.When Trump spoke last Monday to a “summit” of McDonald’s executives and franchisees, he once again showed that he’s out of touch – with typical Americans and the truth. He said, “This is …the golden age of Americabecause we are doing better than we’ve ever done as a country.” He sought to calm angry consumers by adding: “Prices are coming down and all of that stuff.” That’s easy for a billionaire to say, but it’s hard for millions of Americans not to fret about prices “and all of that stuff” and not just because42 million Americans facedhaving their food stamps cut off and 24 million facehaving their health premiums soar, often by over $1,500 a year, because Trump and the Republican-led Congress will not extend Obamacare subsidies.Sorry, Mr President, but Americans strongly disagree with your claim that it’s a golden age. According to aPew poll in October, 74% of Americans think economic conditions are fair or poor, while just 26% think they are good or excellent. What’s more, according to aCNN poll last month, 61% of Americans say Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country”.Scott Bessent, Trump’s treasury secretary, recently contradicted Trump’s boasts of a golden age. Bessent said that far from booming, some parts of the US economy“are in recession”. The manufacturing sector that Trump vowed to save appears tohave contracted eight months in a rowand lost about33,000 jobs since January. Pointing to this economic weakness, Bessent called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – a move that would help affordability.Republicans are scrambling to reclaim affordability. Good luck with that | Judith LevineRead moreSeeing the huge public dismay about affordability, Trump has resorted to one of the oldest tricks in the book. He promised to, in effect, buy off disgruntled Americans, in this case, with “a dividend of at least $2,000 a person(not including high income people!)”. For many struggling Americans, that must sound like manna from heaven, but it’s unlikely that Congress, already alarmed about huge budget deficits, will enact that idea.Trump’s statement that the $2,000 won’t go to “high-income people!” feels like a confession that his “big, beautiful bill” gave far too much in tax cuts to the rich and too little to everyone else. It also shows that the public’s complaints are hitting home that Trump has become the president by, for and of the billionaires.Ina recent speech, Bessent said that the administration is “improving affordability” by holding down spending, noting that this helps hold down interest rates. But Trump’s proposed $2,000-a-person payment would undercut all that. It would increase federal spending and thereby push up interest rates and probably inflation, too, by putting more money in consumers’ pockets.In another supposed fix for affordability, Trump put forward the hare-brained idea of creating 50-year mortgages, with the notion that this would help reduce monthly mortgage payments. But the truth is that 50-year mortgages, compared with 30-year mortgages,would do little to lower monthly mortgage payments. They would often reduce payments by just $100 or $200 a month. The bad news is that 50-year mortgages would, as David Dayen has written, oftenmore than double the already huge amount of interestthat homeowners pay and would greatly slow their accumulation of equity.In their affordability campaign, Trump and his truth-challenged crew are yet again blaming Biden for the country’s economic problems, including rising prices. JD Vance said: “We inherited a disasterfrom Joe Biden,” while Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said, “Cleaning up Joe Biden’s inflationand economic disaster has been a top focus for President Trump since day 1.”This is absurd, untruthful rubbish.As I’ve written, Biden handed Trump a very strong economy, with inflation way down, economic growth strong and unemployment low. But Trump’s policies, especially his tariffs, have created an economic mess, pushing up prices and slowing GDP growth.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, says that22 states are already in recession, with theireconomies damaged by Trump’s tariffs. Zandi fears that if big states like California and New York tumble into recession, the US could slide into a broad economic slump. During recessions, consumers overall have less money to spend, and inflation typically declines. Unfortunately, with Trump’s much-ballyhooed affordability campaign likely to do little to hold down prices, his most effective “tool” in achieving increased affordability could prove to be pushing the nation into recession.That’s something that struggling Americans really can’t afford.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS economyOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

Thankfully her AI ‘clankers’ will be limited to this cultural momentVan BadhamWhile a robot pop star may be novelty now, young people are maturing with a scorn for generic digital productsThu 20 Nov 2025 17.59 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 18.43 ESTShareXania Monet is the latest digital nightmare to emerge from a hellscape of AI content production. No wonder she’s popular … but how long will it last?The music iteration of AI “actor” Tilly Norwood, Xania is a composite product manufactured of digital tools: in this case, a photorealistic avatar accompanied by a sound that computers have generated to resemble that of a human voice singing words.Those words are, apparently, the most human thing about her: Xania’s creator, Telisha “Nikki” Jones,has said in interviewsthat – unlike the voice, the face or the music – the lyrics are “100%” hers, and “come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences”.Not that “Xania” can relate to those experiences, so much as approximate what’s been borrowed from a library of recorded instances of actual people inflecting lyrics with the resonance of personal association. Some notes may sound like Christina Aguilera, some sound like Beyoncé, but – unlike any of her influences – Xania “herself” is never going to mourn, fear, risk anything for the cause of justice, make a difficult second album, explore her sexuality, confront the reality of ageing, wank, eat a cupcake or die.Paul McCartney joins music industry protest against AI with silent trackRead moreShe’s just a clearly branded audio-visual delivery vehicle for a familiar vibe and, when Jones herself is dead and gone, her “poems” can be fed into the AI’s infinite reproduction machine to be regenerated and resung for ever and ever and ever …… depending on the terms in the commercial music contract which Jones just signed, on behalf of her creation, for $3m – after Xania’s songs hit 17 million streams in two months, started charting on Billboard and resulted in a bidding war.With the rapid adoption of AI into the process of culture-making, the sudden commercial viability of Xania and products like her arerestarting conversationsabout the intersection of capitalism, creativity and opportunity that are as awkward as they are ancient.Awkward because, for all the romanticisation of human artistry, AI creatures don’t exist because a secretive cabal of aspirational robot overlords have forced them into lives. Xania exists because Telisha “Nikki” Jones is a creative entrepreneur who saw a market opportunity and 17 million freakin’ people turned up to download it.“Is this the future of music?” asked Forbes magazine of the Jones deal – but, more pertinently, it’s the present and the past. The “familiar vibe” of recorded music loops and samples were used by commercial producers long before Apple started making them available on home computer desktop apps more than 20 years ago. One wonders what Beethoven would have made of the tech, given he borrowed ideas fromMozart… who borrowed fromBach… who adapted themes fromVivaldi.If you’re concerned the face fronting the tune is not the person who wrote the song, I’ve got some terrible news for you aboutWhitney Houston,Céline Dion,Britney Spears,Elvis PresleyandFrank Sinatra.Entertainment has ever been the art of reference and illusion… which is why artists’ concerns swirl around AI’s capacity not to replace their creativity but as a potential channel for their exploitation.Any technofearful Redditor still persuaded by the myth of individual creative genius needs to familiarise themselves with words like “editor”, “dramaturg”, “amanuensis”, “arranger”, “fabricator”, “director”, “studio assistant” and “producer”. It takes a lot of folks to make one artist –not even David Bowieran his show alone.And while Xania Monet may indeed be as immortal and unchanging as systems of digital storage and electronic retrieval allow, her appeal is as limited as the cultural moment she represents.AI slop tops Billboard and Spotify charts as synthetic music spreadsRead moreAs contexts shift, so does generational taste. Just ask the castrati – the high-voiced boy singers displaced when Enlightenment liberalism restored female performers to the stage.So while a disembodied robot pop star may be novelty now, young people are maturing with a scorn for the sameyness of the digital products that saturate the mainstream cultural experience, denouncing the ubiquitous AI slop as“clankers”, with the same disdain of the young people who once chose the Beatles over Dean Martin, then the Beastie Boys over Led Zep.As other countries join Australia and Denmark in restricting young people’s access to social media, that realm of generational experience will have even clearer cultural demarcations. As rumours of a return toanalogue funcontinue to spread, so it is likely that tastes inspired by in-person gatherings around music and art, the consumption of printed materials and the spectacle of, uh, slide nights and maybe even theatre (God help us) will grow.I congratulate Monet/Jones on realising their moment. The only future music makers can be guaranteed is that the times will have their own favourite sound … and that the kids who come after will borrow the bits that they like, and move on.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Its handling of the assisted dying bill on Friday of last week, continuing this week, is all but unconstitutional. A bill passed by the House of Commons after years of public debate is beingblocked by a small group of peersunder the pretence of scrutiny. Their purpose is to kill the bill by filibuster and impose their religious or moral views on the free will of others. They want to deny Britons a freedom now common in many liberal nations across the western world.When the bill came to the Lords, just seven peers were responsible for 617 of 1,034 amendments now attached to it. They included a requirement that no one should be helped to die if they have been abroad in the previous year, or unless five doctors have assessed the application, or if a doctor has discussed dying with the patient (a so-called gag clause). Many amendments flatly contradict ones considered and rejected by the Commons. They pay no deference to thesupport for the billof what is now a clear majority of public opinion. The intention is not to scrutinise the bill, but to kill it by exceeding the four days allotted to it. Since it is a private member’s bill, the government has declined to help. It should now adopt it and force it through.Meanwhile, the issue remains high profile. A woman wasquestioned by the policeand investigated for 10 months, before the CPS declined to prosecute her, all for accompanying her husband, terminally ill and in agony, to the Dignitas centre in more civilised Switzerland. For her dedication and compassion, the British state – aided by a group of peers – treats her like a suspected criminal. As for doctors who, for decades, have privately helped people through this most painful of family crises, they tell me they dare not do so, for fear also of police intervention in what some peers regard as conspiracy to murder.This should take us back to the conservative elements in the Lords that attempted to oppose reforming governments of the 1830s and the 1910s. As for social reform, a Labour government under Harold Wilson in the 1960s found the courage and time topartly decriminalise homosexualityin England and Wales,permit abortion,reform the divorce lawsandend state censorship of the theatre, most of it driven by Roy Jenkins in his brief two years at the Home Office. Today’s Labour party seems far removed from that era of what was dubbed “civilising Britain”.The House of Lords is the only governing assembly outside the Muslim worldin which clergy can sit ex officio. It must be one of the few in which membership can be bought and is therefore blatantly corrupt. It defends its existence on the grounds that a few of its number are bright and, as Peter Hennessy puts it,“good chaps”. This is undeniable, but hardly the point. The Lords’ composition is indefensible and its powers anti-democratic.Second chambers are a good idea. If suitably composed, they can contribute to public debate, advise on legislation and serve on parliamentary committees and consultative bodies. They should not be able, as in this case, to overturn clear decisions reached by a democratic chamber. Least of all should they be free to impose their own moral views on the lives of British citizens.Of course safeguards must be in place to avoid abuse under any programme of reform. In the case of assisted dying, they can be studied in any of the countries that have already gone down this route to some extent. This includes such European states as Germany, Spain and the Netherlands as well as Canada, most of Australia and New Zealand and several US states. In none of them is suspicious or enforced suicide a serious issue, nothing calling for the often absurd “safeguards” raised in theHouse of Lords. State regulation should be to dignify and respect the freedom of individual choice, not deny it. The decision to end your own life must be the most personal and intimate of acts, shared above all with your loved ones. For peers to seek to make it a legislative and bureaucratic bunfight is obscene.In an alarming number of areas of social reform – justice, prisons, narcotics – Britain now trails the liberal consensus among western nations. The government should not funk the issue or leave it to private members. The same applies in the case of political institutions. It took Westminster until 1999 to initiate anend to the hereditary rightto sit in its parliament, a right still awaiting its termination. Meanwhile, the upper house remains in essence a retirement home for senior politicians and party donors. As such, it has predictably rendered itself immune to change by generations of ageing public figures. Its membership has soared tomore than 820.In 2016, the House of Lords’ constitution unit boldly declared the house would reform itself,starting with reducing its size. In the subsequent decade, it did nothing. This comedy is surely over. If Britain needs a second chamber of parliament – and I think it does – an outside commission should be formed and report at once. Meanwhile, the government should legislate to permit assisted dying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it also tells us something deeper about our responses to lossThu 20 Nov 2025 10.55 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 18.38 ESTShareOne of the last remaining fun things about the internet is getting to pass judgment on the goings-on in households that you would never hear about otherwise. OnReddit, for instance, there is a whole thriving sub for just this purpose called Am I the Asshole?, where people describe conflicts from their lives and ask strangers to adjudicate on them.This week,a story on the BBCthrew up a particularly juicy piece of other people’s businessthat has been sparking debates on Chinese social media. It starts in 2017, whenGui Junmin decided to cryogenically freeze his wife, Zhan Wenlian, after she died of lung cancer. She was the first Chinese person to undergo this procedure, which was paid for by a science research institute in Jinan, east China, that agreed with Gui to preserve his wife’s body for 30 years.Reports suggestZhan herself consented to the process before she passed away.But what has piqued the interest of nosy people across the world is the revelation that, in 2020, Gui began dating again. He now has a new partner, a woman named Wang Chunxia. People have asked: is this fair, to either woman? It would be quite a trip to be the wife: defrosted from the land of the dead,slowly working out what happened – and then discovering your husband found a new girlfriend in the time you’ve been on ice. The sheer social and ethical complexity of the situation would have me asking the doctors to stick me back in the freezer.My first reaction to the broad strokes of this story was: leave the poor guy alone. His wife is dead and he found love again a respectful number of years after her passing. This is no crime. But there are more confusing details. Gui apparently told the Chinese newspaper Southern Weekly that his new partner, Wang, was not the new love of his life. Their relationship was only “utilitarian”, and he was prompted to seek out a new live-in partner after he had a severe attack of gout that left him bedridden for a few days. A frozen wife is all well and good, but she’s not going to be much use on the chicken soup front if he gets unwell again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe Wang is delighted with this arrangement. Maybe Gui does love her, but doesn’t want to say so and dishonour his late wife’s memory. Who knows. But I find it a sad story all round, what little we know of it, because at the heart of this headline-grabbing tale is that very human inability to know when to let go. If you read around, you can find quotes from Gui saying he agreed to the procedure because he didn’t fundamentally believe that his wife was truly dead – that she had just gone somewhere to rest for a while. The fact that he has started a new relationship, whatever his motivations for doing so, suggests that the inexorable process of moving on has begun.All cryogenics strikes me this melancholy way, and to a lesser extent so do allbiohacking effortsto maximise human lifespan. It is, I think, no accident that the world’s major cryogenics labs, Alcor and the Cryonics Institute in the US, were both started by people who wanted to preserve their own loved ones. (There are an estimated 500 people cryogenically frozen worldwide, mostly in the US.) There is also a tragically doomed side to it: after all, there is no proof that it will ever be possible to bring someone who has been frozen back to life. Sure, the human race mayone day figure out how to do this. But it seems more likely to me that we won’t. Death is death. However long it takes you to get there, it is the non-negotiable end of the road.This stuff is hard. Of course it is. When someone you love is dying, it’s only natural to feel like you’d do anything to keep them around. Doggedly deferring these moments of painful loss or persuading yourself that these moments can be avoided with the aid of experimental science is a fool’s game. May Zhan rest in peace, may Gui find a nicer way to talk about his new girlfriend, and may my own eventual trip to the undiscovered country be a one-way ticket with no layover in an ice box.Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The room is full of the light of the afternoon sun. From the TV, there is the soft rumble of a stadium crowd then silence, followed by the distinctive knock of a cricket ball on wood. For a moment the crowd gets louder and the players on screen shuffle around, but nothing changes and a commentator’s sharp, low voice cuts through.I realise he’s watching the first Test of the Ashes. It’s 2023 and I’m visiting for the first time since Covid. I estimate it has been at least 15 years since I saw, or heard, a game of cricket. When Ponting, Warne, Gilchrist and McGrath lit up Australian screens. When my dad was still alive and I was young enough to be home when he’d watch it.Why Australia will win v why England can win: two Guardian cricket writers make their Ashes casesRead moreThe familiarity of the scene – the warm summer, the slow afternoon, the large head snoring – sends me back in space and time to the various back yards of our childhood. When Dad taught us how to pace out a bowler’s run-up, how to turn side on, lift your left arm straight up and look down the inside at the middle stump. The correct way to grip the bat, keep an eye on the ball and stay in your crease. The house rules that made the game exciting: six and out, one hand one bounce, tip and run.This summer, it is almost nine years since he died. Long enough for the sting of the loss to have numbed and for the family to have rearranged itself in a new dynamic. Long enough for the edges of him – a look in the eye, “Oh, hi darling” when you answer his call, the way chronic pain stilted his gait – to start to fade. But here I am, in Norway, remembering staying up late with him to watch Michael Bevan hit a four to win off the last ball in the 1996 World Cup.Sport was a big part of my childhood – I swam squad, I played goal attack – and often he was there on the sidelines. Shouting “steady” as I lined up for goal in a voice so deep and loud my coaches turned it into a joke. But as I hit my 20s, sport fell away. Studies, travel and partying took over and the captain-of-the-netball-team side of me went quiet. When he died, I was 27 and moving to London. The next year one of my brothers (the cricket watcher) followed me to Europe.Familylife was strange and strained; it turned out we couldn’t grieve together, so instead we grieved alone.But here was sport, a decade later, reminding me about things Dad had given us and things we shared: competitiveness, a love of winning and a respect for hard work, discipline and what it facilitates: skill, courage, grace under pressure.I’m at a conference in Copenhagen when Alex Carey stumps Jonny Bairstow and my brother and I are texting in delight – Ben Stokes the self-righteous, sore loser is too funny. By the time of the fourth Test, I’m in London and we’re both praying for rain. Of course, we lose the final Test and draw the series but we’ve found something, an ongoing dialogue that reaches across countries and continents. All the way across the sea.Australia target Joe Root as the England batter to ‘take down’ on eve of AshesRead moreLast summer, when Sam Konstas was smacking Jasprit Bumrah around the MCG on Boxing Day, I text, “Are you watching the cricket?”“Yes,” he shot back from the depths of winter. “It’s bonkers.”This past July I’m visiting while he starts paternity leave and we sit together, reading books to his baby girl, half-watching England versus India. Nervous about what an English win could mean for the upcoming Ashes. We’re gleeful the morning after Stokes embarrasses himself by pressuring the Indian batters to shake his hand and retire. Decreeing the lack of sportsmanship over coffee and quoting The Grade Cricketer podcast to each other:“How long do you need? An hour?”Most of us run away from our families when we’re young and spend some of our adult lives trying to find our way back. I did not expect sport, or more specifically cricket, to be a through-line I could follow. A place where Dad’s parenting and care still exists. Where he is still explaining how to protect the stumps or telling me to stop grumbling on the way home after a loss. It is a place with an abundance of reminders about his love for us and the way he taught us to be. With each series (and what is more exciting than the Ashes at home?) the place gets expanded with new memories forged from the old ones, new ways to make each other laugh and to remind ourselves (no pressure Pat Cummins et al) how fun it is to compete.Lucianne Tonti is a freelance journalist and author.

Why had I been so resistant?Thu 20 Nov 2025 07.07 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 08.44 ESTShare‘Aiyah, why don’t you bake?” my Aunt Julie scolded, her voice shrill with disbelief. “You should learn how to bake for the sake of your child! Your mother was such a good baker!” Her comment stung. I had always adored my mother’s youngest sister. As the only member of my family who also lived in Germany, we had a special bond.But here she was, chastising me for failing to be a good mother before I had even given birth. I contemplated the question from her immaculate kitchen, where I stood round, hormonal, in my second trimester of pregnancy and on the precipice of new motherhood. But I didn’t have an answer.Aunt Julie was right. My motherhadbeen an excellent baker. The best, really. The kind who baked after work late into the night just because someone asked for her melt-in-your-mouth pineapple tarts or pandan chiffon cake. She kept her recipes in a thick, blue-lined, leopard-print notebook filled with neat, girlish handwriting and yellowed magazine clippings. My aunts, her sisters and my father’s, used to call her regularly for instructions and she always obliged. My Aunt Joanne waxes lyrical about her butter cake to this day, remembering it in hushed tones of awe.My mother passed away when I was 18. Why didn’t I learn from her when she was still alive? The truth was, I didn’t think I could.Bakingrequired discipline – following instructions to the letter. It required a meticulous, attentive, precise personality like my mother’s. Instead, I was restless, rootless, impatient.In my 20s, I led a nomadic life, living in rentals with strict rules or on cruise ships, often without kitchens, let alone ovens. I preferred cooking by instinct, guided by scent and spur-of-the-moment whim, not measurements. My style wasagakagak– a Malay term for eyeballing it.I knew all this about myself, and I had always believed that I had nothing to prove. And yet Aunt Julie’s question lingered. I began to wonder: if I didn’t inherit my mother’s love for baking, did that somehow make me less of a daughter? What if my mother had also wished that I’d baked? That feeling of inadequacy, of being less than a perfect daughter, followed me into the first year of motherhood.My daughter had just begun to enjoy sweet treats and demanded more of them. So one afternoon, driven mostly by the urge to offer her healthy alternatives and partly to prove to Aunt Julie that I was capable of following instructions, I baked.I started with vegan blueberry muffins. Safe enough, I thought, because no eggs meant fewer ways to mess up. I wasn’t ready yet to beat anything into stiff peaks, whatever that meant. After a few successful batches and adding some simple foolproof cakes to my repertoire, I attempted peanut cookies for lunar new year – something I remembered my mother making. But the batter looked like peanut butter, far too wet. Did I add too much oil? Did I add too little flour? I looked at the wet lumpy mixture and wanted to throw the bowl away.The next year, when lunar new year rolled around again, I decided my daughter and I would bake walnut cookies. Growing up, lunar new year held significant memories for me. It meant days of round-the-clock feasting,angpao-receiving and meeting relatives, near and far. I wanted it to mean something for my daughter too, even if we were far from the land that I used to call home. I was determined to conjure some sense of that place, even if it meant baking yet another failed batch of cookies. By then, my daughter, a rambunctious toddler, had begun joining me in the kitchen from her learning tower. Unable to roll the dough into balls with her tiny palms, she made uneven blobs. We laughed at the mess in front of us.The oven warmed the kitchen as snow coated the ground thickly outside. The comforting scent of butter and sugar wafted through the hallways as my daughter licked the batter off her fingers. As I watched her tenderly, I suddenly remembered the joy of standing next to my own mother as she deftly dislodged the flower blossom pineapple tarts from the mould. Her presence was visceral, as though baking with my daughter had brought her back.Then the timer on the oven chimed and I pulled out the tray. Somewhere, something had gone wrong: the walnut cookies were gigantic – golf ball-sized monsters that stuck together like soft dinner rolls. We laughed. I told my daughter: “Youromawas a very good baker. But not mama. See? This is so ugly.” She smiled kindly back, as if she knew that how a cookie looks is beside the point. “Lecker!” she chimed. And they were. The cookies were hideous but delicious.I began to realise the truth behind Aunt Julie’s comment. It was not as barbed as it had appeared. She had only wanted me to remember my mother’s legacy. Far from trying to make me feel inferior, she was trying to illustrate to me the magnanimity of my mother’s love. And if it hadn’t been for her comment, I probably would never have pushed myself to pick up a whisk.But learning how to bake has been a profound experience. I came to realise I wasn’t just making cookies or cakes. I was learning how to mother. Mothering meant, for me, letting go; it meant that despite all the steps of a recipe that I could follow, I could never truly be in control of the outcome. Making a perfect cookie takes practice and care. Mostly though, as my own mother had, I was trying to recreate the feeling of warmth and homeliness through perseverance. It was never about precision, as I had initially thought, but about showing up for the ones you love, relentlessly, day after day. Baking was her language of love, her legacy, her masterclass. Maybe it will be mine too.These days, I am no longer afraid of combining eggs, flour and butter. My peanut cookies now turn out fine. So much so that this time, it was Aunt Julie who askedmefor the recipe.Ying Reinhardt is Malaysian writer living in GermanyExplore more on these topicsBakingWords that changed everythingParents and parentingChildrenFamilyFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

When she delivers her budget next week, though, those qualities will be hard to discern. The reason for that is simple but powerful. She has become hemmed in on every side byavoidably tight commitmentson taxation, spending and borrowing. Above all, however, she is hemmed in by Labour politics.It did not have to be this way. Reeves would have had a freer fiscal hand if she and Labour had not ruled out increasing all the three main personal taxes at the 2024 election – a choice the former Conservative minister David Willettsdescribed this weekas “catastrophic”. Reeves might also have won herself more elbow room, albeit at some political cost, if the new government had moved very decisively to say that, having studied the figures, the triple-tax pledge was in fact unsustainable.These, though, are might-have-beens. They were roads not taken. Instead, Reeves got the politics wrong. She waited until this month before belatedly starting to argue, albeit entirely correctly, that the tax pledge had to be broken if Labour was to fulfil its other commitments and to regain direction. Yet in little more than a week she had toabandon the ideain a humiliating retreat.The chief cause of the U-turn was the politics of the modern Labour party. With Labour already sliding in the polls, MPs revolted against breaking a manifesto pledge. They even startedplotting a new leadership. Party whips reported that an income tax rise would not pass the Commons, an event that could have brought the whole government down. As a result, Reeves caved.Where that now leaves the credibility of Reeves, her exceptionally difficult budget, Keir Starmer’s government and theLabourbackbenches will all become a bit clearer, limited measure by limited measure, next week. But the damage to all of them is serious – and the larger political lesson hard to miss. Starmer’s modern Labour party cannot agree about doing anything big, radical or different in domestic policy. Since it cannot agree, it is unable to govern well. It is not up to the job.The mishandling of the taxation issue is far from the only example. Equally pivotal wasJune’s backbench revoltagainst welfare reform, which came in the wake of Reeves’s similarly unpopular cuts to winter fuel payments. In both cases backbenchers showed their power on behalf of claimants, forcing two about-turns on government welfare spending plans. Even so,47 Labour MPs voted againstthe much-diluted welfare bill in July. Whether the plans were wise or not isn’t the main point here. The revolt itself mattered more. It sent the important message that this government could not deliver on welfare reform.This week there was a frisson on a wholly different policy issue. The home secretary wants totighten refugee policyinto a stronger deterrent to Channel migrants. In hermarathon defencein the Commons on Monday, Shabana Mahmood faced more doubters on the Labour benches than she did on the Tory or Liberal Democrat ones. The whips think the revolt is not big enough to upend the plans. But these are early days.The upshot is a Labour party that does not want to cut spending, but at the same time does not want to raise taxes either, and may yet have to be dragged unwillingly towards the voting lobbies when Mahmood’s measures come under the microscope. In other words, Labour is now an alliance of positions, interests and instincts rather than a party with a unifying direction or a leader who clearly articulates an overarching plan for government. As a result, Labour has become several small parties in one.Some of this is down to poor leadership. But not all of it. There has always been tension, even in Labour’s earliest years, between its working-class base and its white-collar and more ideologically driven supporters. More crucially, though, the old core Labour vote of the 20th century has simply disappeared, as has the industrial Britain that generated it. That old Britain will never be reassembled. Nor will that form of Labour vote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By 1997, when Tony Blair swept to power, the working-class share of Labour’s vote was down to 59%, while the middle-class share rose to 41%. In 2010, for the first time, white-collar Labour voters exceeded blue-collar ones.That new imbalance continues today. The essential fact is that Britain is significantly more middle class, better educated, more outward-looking and more liberal. Yet Labour still struggles to adapt to, never mind to lead, this intricate, nuanced and continuing change.“Why is the Labour party in a mess?” asked the social historian Gareth Stedman Jones in a 1984 essay. Among his answers, he said that the party was too comfortable looking back to the postwar Attlee years, it was too easily tempted by old forms of working-class politics, and it was neglecting the concerns and priorities of the emerging middle-class Labour electorate.More than four decades later, every single bit of that critique is still true. Only more so. Today, Labour expends a lot of effort trying to capture working-class Reform supporters. Yet it spends far less trying to retain the support of its middle-class progressive electorate – and indeed seems to enjoy berating them. When a party like this faces in too many directions at the same time, it seems sensible to ask: what, today, is the point of Labour?Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBudget 2025Tax and spendingRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

Tackling inequality in Britain will require much more far-reaching changesThu 20 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 07.29 ESTShareBy this time next week you will be digesting the budget, you lucky thing. Yet even before Rachel Reeves has commended a single damn thing to the house, her efforts have been written off as a “shambles”, from a “chaotic” government that is Labour in name alone. Which prompts the question: what is the leftwing alternative?Because there is one, on which agreement stretches from Labour backbenchers to many of their opponent MPs and far beyond. Whether you listen to Zack Polanski or Zarah Sultana, the TUC or the YouTubers, they all call for a wealth tax – stinging the rich to pay for schools and hospitals. Who could be against such a thing?Me, for one.I am all for making the wealthy pay their way and, as a creature of warm blood and soft tissue, I delight in anything that winds up some of the worst people. There must be merit in an idea that gets France’s Bernard Arnaultchuntering about“a clearly stated desire to destroy the … economy” – this from the plutocrat (estimated net worth: £139bn) who declared, “As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy.” Trust me, dear reader, this is a whole Radox bath of pleasure I am forgoing.But still, I can’t go along with the consensus emerging around a wealth tax. It is too much of a muddle, not just financially or economically but also politically. As with so many simple and shoddy ideas, it polls beautifully yet smacks of dishonesty. If the wealth taxers seriously want to tackle big money and vested interests, they are going to the gunfight not with knives, but toothpicks.Let us start with some context. Perhaps the best work in this field comes from the Wealth Tax Commission, which in 2020 gatheredwhat it called“the largest repository of evidence on wealth taxes globally to date”. Over 50 experts gave evidence, from economists to the former head of HMRC. The commission recommended “a one-off wealth tax” – in essence, a giant and sudden raid by tax inspectors on couples with over £1m in assets (which would include a lot of homeowning households in nice neighbourhoods, who may not count themselves as rich). That would raise £260bn, or the equivalent of hiking the basic rate of income tax by 9p in the pound.A whopping sum, raised with shock and awe. But that isn’t what you’re hearing about on TV and podcasts now. The far more modest proposals from the left include a 1% annual levy on assets over £10m recommended by the Greens in their latest manifesto. The Wealth Tax Commission estimated that an annual 1.12% levy on assets over £10m would raise £10bn – handy, but in Whitehall terms hardly life-changing. And, experts pointed out, such sums could be raised without manufacturing a new tax but simply by tweaking the existing levies on the wealthy. It would not surprise me at all if next Wednesday the chancellor made some of those tweaks.This isn’t much of a policy, it’s a pantomime – a pantomime of pseudo-radicalism in which the villains are some wankers on yachts and the solution is one simple trick, just like those dodgy internet ads used to offer. It just so happens it would yield about 1% of what the government spends in a year.Where a few years ago leftwingers would argue for the government to borrow more, today YouTube radicals such as Gary Stevenson act as if John Maynard Keynes had never been born. Without a wealth tax, the UK will soon go bankrupt,he warns– an unlikely thing to happen in one of the richest countries in the world, with its own money-printing press. “Traders are about to bring down the government,”he told Guardian readersin January. Ten months later, we await the excitement.If the Greens are serious about redistributing unearned wealth, they should widen their focus from Mr and Mrs Megabucks to well-to-do families across the country who, just by dint of being sufficiently old and/or lucky are sitting in houses that have rocketed in value since the late 90s. But chance would be a fine thing: next May, Polanski and his troops will be marching on inner-London councils such as Hackney, where an ordinary terrace housenow fetchesjust shy of a million pounds, over three times theaverage across England. Far easier to claim the problem is all a few billionaires. So why not go the whole hog and make the Greens the anti-billionaire party, with a charter to remove oligarch influence from our political parties, our thinktanks, our media?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs you can see, my worry isn’t the usual timorous one about how any tax on the super-rich will send them packing. Given how far the rich have had things their way over the past four decades, some evening up is in order. Concern over a deeply unequal society and a lopsided economy is where the wealth tax-ers and I start – but doing something about it requires deep-rooted changes to give more people a fairer share. Changes to the labour laws to encourage union organisation. Changes to corporations to give workers more of a stake. Vastly more social housing. The irony is that Labour leaders have flirted with such steps. Not just Jeremy Corbyn, but Ed Miliband and his call for “predistribution” – for citizens to have agreater share of assetsbefore tax. On that showing, the Labour party that went to the polls in 2015 was more economically radical than the Greens and Your Party are a decade later.I offer these criticisms I hope constructively, with only a soupçon of teasing. Polanski and Sultana aren’t the politicians talking aboutripping gold ringsoff the fingers of asylum seekers, conniving at the mass murder of Palestinians or cheering on the bulldozing of our planning system. In talking about wealth taxes, they have grasped an important political truth. The electoral future of a low-growth country like Britain doesn’t lie in promising voters that with some magic trick you can drive up GDP, but in accepting that the arguments that lie ahead are about the distribution of resources. That’s something the centrists on both the Tory and Labour benches have yet to grasp – which is why next week’s budget will be so painful.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025OpinionTax and spendingInequalityEconomicsThe super-richcommentShareReuse this content"

Gone, too, is the“republican front”spanning from the centre-right through president Emmanuel Macron’s centrists to the radical left France Unbowed (LFI), which stopped the far right from sweeping the board in a snap parliamentary election just a year ago. Under that informal pact, parties of the “republican arc” stood down in favour of the best-placed candidate among them to defeat the RN in the second round.That resulted in a three-way deadlocked parliament with weak, revolving-door governments that has cratered public trust in the mainstream parties and boosted the RN’s standing.Every week brings new evidence that the firewall between the mainstream centre right and the extreme right is breaking down as Les Républicains struggle for survival against a surge in voter support for the nationalist, xenophobic and Eurosceptic RN. Recentopinion pollsshow theRN has 35% supportor higher, whether their presidential candidate is Le Pen,currently barred from runningby a conviction for embezzling EU funds which she is appealing, or Bardella, the 30-year-old party president. None of the potential LR candidates scores even 10%, and backing for centrist contenders is also shrinking.LR is locked in a power struggle between Retailleau, who was riding high as a hardline interior minister until hebrought the governmentdown a few weeks ago, and Laurent Wauquiez, LR’s parliamentary floor leader. Other LR hopefuls, including northern big political playerXavier Bertrand,are also vying for the nomination.France’s political upheaval isn’t temporary - it’s a profound constitutional crisis | Pierre PurseigleRead moreBertrand is one of the rare Gaullists arguing against any deal with the far right. His line has little traction among LR members of parliament scrambling to save their seats, which may require at least a mutual non-aggression pact with Le Pen’s party. A handful of LR deputies, led by former party leaderÉric Ciotti, broke awayand cut such a deal with Le Pen at the last parliamentary election. Now, pressure for a “union of the right” is mounting – amplified by therightwing media empires of billionaires Vincent BolloréandPierre-Édouard Stérin.Leaders of Les Républicains are already vying with the far right in shrill rhetoric and proposals to curb immigration and deny benefits to new immigrants. As interior minister until September, Retailleau toughened conditions for immigrants to receive French nationality and campaigned against birthright citizenship. At present, children of immigrants born on French soil automatically become citizens when they turn 13 if they have resided in the country for five years.Mainstream conservatives keep putting out feelers to the far right.Wauquiez recently met Éric Zemmour, a radical anti-Islam crusader to the right of Le Pen, to discuss the idea of holding a presidential primary election open to all contenders from the centre right to the far right. The RN has no interest in such a contest because its own candidate is streets ahead in the polls, so a primary looks unlikely to happen. But raising the idea is a way of building bridges to the right of LR.The problem for Les Républicains is that, barring an electoral miracle, a “union of the right” will simply ease the hard right’s path to power. As Jean-Marie Le Pen liked to say, voters prefer the original to the copy. So LR would probably end up as a junior partner, either joining a government dominated by the RN, as its sister party Forza Italia has done in hard-right Giorgia Meloni’s administration in Italy, or propping up an RN administration from outside.While this manoeuvring is going on in Paris, LR is cuddling up to the far right in the European parliament in Brussels, where its group leader,François-Xavier Bellamy, voted for an RN censure motionagainst European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen over her support for an EU trade deal with South American countries. LR also voted with the hard right againstambitious EU carbon emissions target for 2040in a sign of converging hostility to climate-friendly policies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The centre-right European People’s party, to which LR belongs, is increasingly willing to push through its deregulation agenda with far-right votes when it cannot press the centrist and socialist groups into loosening environmental reporting requirements and liabilities for business. It did so in a13 November voteon corporate sustainability and supply-chain transparency rules.French conservative leaders insist that they want Le Pen’s voters, not her party’s leaders. But when faced with the choice of losing their remaining town halls or cutting deals with the RN in municipal elections next March, there is little doubt that LR will go for local agreements, even if that means the election of more RN mayors and councillors.If Les Républicains become the enablers of a hard-right takeover ofFrance, which rolls back citizenship and welfare rights and puts Paris on a collision course with the EU, this is likely to break the party and spell the end of the Gaullist legacy in French politics – as well as discrediting the party morally.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionMarine Le PenNational RallyThe far rightEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

It will undo youLucy ManganThu 20 Nov 2025 16.50 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 17.03 ESTShareThe travelling salesman used to be a stock figure – a centrepiece for jokes about man’s priapism, the untameable wanderlust of the peen once free of its domestic shackles. The Death of Bunny Munro, adapted from Nick Cave’s 2009 book of the same name by Pete Jackson and keeping all its bleak tenderness and unforgiving brutality, gives us the tragedy that lies the other side of any comic character worth its salt.Cosmetics salesman Bunny (Matt Smith, a brilliant and still underrated actor, plus the best Doctor of modern times, please send an SAE for my monograph on this subject) is out on the road, sampling another young lady’s wares, when we meet him. His wife, Libby (Sarah Greene, perfectly cast as a fierce, loving woman broken by depression and her husband’s choices) calls him. He dismisses her and returns to his sampling. When he returns the next day he finds that she has killed herself. They have a nine-year-old son, Bunny Jr, played by Rafael Mathé, who gives an absolutely wonderful, heartbreaking performance, treading the thinnest of lines between knowing everything and nothing about his father and about his own likely future. At first, Bunny Sr tries to palm him off on Libby’s mother (Lindsay Duncan), who, in a harrowing post-funeral scene, refuses. But when social services arrive to take the boy into care, Bunny’s pride or conscience is pricked. The pair light out of the window and head off on a road trip along the south coast, and a father-son bonding experience. Traditionally, these are good things. But Cave is not a traditional writer and this is not a traditional tale.When Bunny can charm his customers into buying his unguents and his promises, life is good. A bit of money and a lot of sex are all he needs to get by. Junior watches in nervous awe. If nothing else, his father’s antics are a distraction for the motherless boy from his grief. “She must have wanted to die,” Junior says to one of the many strangers he meets while waiting for his father to finish – uh – charming a customer. “That’s why it’s not so sad.” And if the child is managing with sunglasses instead of the eye cream he needs for his chronic blepharitis, well, that’s all part of the adventure.View image in fullscreenA fierce, loving woman broken by depression … Sarah Greene with Matt Smith in The Death of Bunny Munro.Photograph: Benedict Stenning/Sky UK, Clerkenwell FilmsGradually, of course, things fall apart. Bunny’s centre cannot hold. His simple but unassuageable appetites lead him further and further into trouble, and guilt too relentlessly tries to catch up with him. Bunny’s journey is interspersed with flashbacks to his youth, watching his own father – another Bunny, lest the egotistic circle be broken – neglect him in favour of finding women (“Fucking cool as cool,” Sr insists) and to moments of happiness with Libby before her depression, surely unrelated to her longing for him to stay faithful, set in. Junior has comforting visions of his mother, though she disappears when he decides to mimic his father cheering a stripper’s show in the pub – a moment that almost undid me.The Death of Bunny Munro is only six episodes long, and their run times vary between around 30 and 50 minutes. This is generally a mark of quality and confidence and Bunny Munro is a perfect example of why – there is no padding here, no eking out, nor desperate compressions. Each act of the story is given the time it needs, and should stand as an example to others who are tempted to bloat or stymie their narratives instead of exploiting the great advantage modern broadcasting has given creators by uncuffing them from rigid time frames and forced ad breaks.As a study in masculinity, in men handing on misery to men, deepening like a south coastal shelf as Bunny and son drive towards doom, it is as timely – for all, alas, that the book was written over a decade ago – as it is illuminating. The script and Smith do a pitch-perfect job of conveying the latent violence lying just underneath his and his cohorts interactions with women and how little the latter need to do to spark it. And they don’t ask for sympathy, only understanding, as they show Bunny as trapped as any rabbit in a snare by the lack of substance beneath his style and by the lessons he learned from his father before he was old enough to pick and choose between them. Maybe infidelity is in the genes but nurture is supposed to teach you to work against your flaws, not with them. Which way Junior – a sensitive, clever boy with an interest in the wider world that might save him – will go now that there is no mother to shelter him pulls you on through the darkening tale. The only hope you can cling to is that it’s set at a time before smartphones, otherwise the question would surely be settled before they’ve even cleared the window.The Death of Bunny Munro aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK and Binge in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMatt SmithDramaNick CavereviewsShareReuse this content"

It took place over the course of 12 months. At the start of 1989, they were just a local cause of excitement in Manchester, largely ignored by the traditional outlets for alternative rock in Britain. John Peel wasn’t a fan. The music press had barely mentioned their most recent single, Elephant Stone. They were barely able to fill even a more modest London venue such as Dingwalls. But by November they were huge. Their single Fools Gold had entered the charts at No 8 and their performance was the big attraction on that week’s Top of the Pops – a barely imaginable state of affairs for most indie bands in the late 80s.In retrospect, you can find any number of reasons why the Stone Roses cut such an extraordinary path, clearly attracting a far bigger and broader audience than usually displayed an interest in alternative rock at the time. They were set apart by their look – which seemed to align them more to the burgeoning acid house scene – theircockily belligerent attitudeand the skill of the guitarist John Squire, unashamedly virtuosic in a world of distorted thrashing downstrokes.But there was also the incontrovertible fact that the Stone Roses’ rhythm section swung in a way completely unlike anything else in British alt-rock at the time. There’s an argument that the melody of Made of Stone bore a distinct resemblance to that of Primal Scream’s old C86-era single Velocity Girl, but what the bass and drums were doing behind it really didn’t: you could dance to it in a way that you simply couldn’t to most of the tracks that graced the turntables at the era’s indie discos. You somehow got the impression that the drummer Alan “Reni” Wren and the bassist Gary “Mani” Mounfield had been raised on music rather different to the standard indie band set texts, which was absolutely right: Mani was a huge fan of the Byrds’ bassist Chris Hillman but his guiding lights were “good northern soul and funk”.The fluidity of his playing was the secret sauce behind the Stone Roses’ eponymous debut album: it’s him who drives the moment when I Am the Resurrection shifts from Motown stomp into loose-limbed funk, his octave-leaping lines that put a spring in the step of Waterfall. Sometimes the sauce wasn’t so secret. On Fools Gold, the focal point of the song isn’t really the vocal melody or Squire’s wah-pedal-heavy playing, or even the breakbeat borrowed from Bobby Byrd’s 1971 single Hot Pants: it’s Mani’s writhing, relentless bass. When you think of She Bangs the Drums, the first thing that springs to mind is the bass line.View image in fullscreenThe Stone Roses photographed in 1989.Photograph: Avalon/Getty ImagesIndeed, in Mani’s view, when the Stone Roses went wrong musically it was because they were insufficiently funky. Fools Gold’s underwhelming follow-up One Love was underwhelming, he suggested, because it “could have swung a little more, it’s a little bit rigid”. He was a staunch defender of their oft-dismissed second album, Second Coming but thought its flaws could have been rectified by removing some of the layers of Led Zeppelin-inspired guitar and “reverting to the groove”.He may well have had a point. Second Coming’s scattering of highlights usually coincide with the moments when Mounfield was really allowed to let rip – Daybreak, Love Spreads, the superb Begging You – while on its more turgid songs, you can hear him metaphorically willing the band to pick up the pace. His playing on Tightrope is completely at odds with the listlessness of everything else that’s happening on the track, while on Straight to the Man he’s audibly trying to inject a bit of pep into what’s otherwise some nondescript country-rock – not a genre one suspects anyone was in a hurry to hear the Stone Roses give a try.Primal Scream: Kill All Hippies – videoHis efforts were in vain: Wren and Squire left the band in the wake of Second Coming’s release, and the Stone Roses imploded entirely after a disastrous headlining set at the 1996 Reading festival. But Mani’s next gig with Primal Scream had an impressively galvanising effect on a band in a slump after the cool reception of 1994’s rock-y Give Out But Don’t Give Up. His sound became dubbier, heavier and more distorted, but the swing that had given the Stone Roses a point of difference was still in evidence – particularly on the low-slung funk of the 1997 single Kowalski – as was his ability to push his playing to the fore. His popping, hypnotic bass line is very much the star turn on the fantastic 1999 single Swastika Eyes; his playing on Kill All Hippies – like Swastika Eyes, a highlight of Xtrmntr, easily the best album Primal Scream had made since Screamadelica – is magnificent.‘No kinky saucepot shenanigans!’: Liam Gallagher and John Squire on their psychedelic resurrectionRead moreAlways an affable, clubbable presence – the writer John Robb once noted that the Stone Roses’ hauteur towards the media was invariably punctured if Mani “let his guard down” – he took the stage at the Stone Roses’ 2012 reunion concert at Manchester’s Heaton Park playing a customised bass that bore the legend “Super-Yob”, the nickname of Slade’s preposterously coiffured and permanently grinning guitarist Dave Hill. Said reunion failed to translate into anything more than a lengthy succession of hugely lucrative gigs – two new singles released by the reconstituted quartet served only to prove that whatever magic had existed in 1989 had proved impossible to recapture 18 years on – and Mani quietly announced his retirement in 2021. He’d made his money and was now more concerned with fly-fishing, which furthermore provided “a good excuse to go to the pub”.Perhaps he felt he’d done enough: he’d certainly made an impact. The Stone Roses were influential in a variety of ways. Oasis certainly took note of their swaggering attitude, whileBritpopas a whole was informed by a desire to break the standard commercial constraints of alternative music and reach a more mainstream audience, as the Roses had done. But their most obvious immediate effect was a kind of rhythmic shift: in the wake of their initial success, you suddenly couldn’t move for indie bands who wanted to make their audiences dance. That was Mani’s musicalraison d’être. “It’s what the bass and drums are for, aren’t they?” he once averred. “That’s what they’refor.”Explore more on these topicsStone RosesPrimal ScreamIndiePop and rockBritpopcommentShareReuse this content"

Lung cancer, specifically, at the moment – 50,000 cases of which are diagnosed each year in the UK and which is the most common cause of cancer-related death – but with the potential to prevent many more types in the future.That such a fantastic possibility is moving out of the realms of the fantastical is because of the progress that has been made understanding the body’s immune system and the work it does zapping (medical term) so many cells, probably on a daily basis, when they first start sending out signals that all is not well within their own bodies, and preventing them from multiplying. Until and unless, of course, the day comes when the signals are muted or missed and cancer results. Survival rates for the disease have doubled in the last 50 years, but diagnoses themselves are on the rise, so the race to defeat it continues without cease.The new understanding of how our bodies catch and clear so many potential disasters, however, means that there is now a known interval, a pre-cancerous stage which it is thought could last up to 10 years, in which we could intervene if we knew how.Enter, to all possible fanfare – though everything about her suggests she would eschew it – Prof Sarah Blagden. Who does know how, and is going to start intervening if she can just get the funding for the next clinical trial she needs to run.We meet some of the people under her care, including 68-year-old Trevor from Portsmouth who has melanoma with secondaries in his liver. His wife told him for a year to get his mole checked out. “I should have,” he says. “But this is life.” “Typical Navy man,” says his daughter, Katherine, not wryly. He is now part of the professor’s current trial. His immune system is being trained to attack the cancer cells that were once invisible to it. The growths on his liver are now static. In their consultations we are presented with the rare sight of the doctor looking happier than the patient. You can almost see the sense of triumph – so quiet, but sothere– beginning to build in her. It’s amazing.Prof Blagden’s ultimate goal is to develop a single vaccine that will prevent multiple types of cancer. That is what will help patients like Ella, who has Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which causes a mutation on a tumour-suppressing gene and means carriers have a highly increased risk of developing cancer, especially as children and young adults. Ella had a tennis ball-sized tumour removed from her adrenal gland when she was nine months old and had breast cancer resulting in a double mastectomy three years ago. She is still in her 20s. She is in one of Prof Blagden’s trial groups too, which is working on the potential seen in metformin (a drug usually connected with diabetes treatment) to turn down the particular cellular overactivity in LFS patients, and which could allow a repurposing that would further speed the creation of a multi-faceted vaccine.You could weep for the suffering, and also for the minds concentrating not just on alleviating but on banishing it. For Prof Blagden and her team’s extraordinary, intelligent vision (“I have a big idea … ” she says at the start of the film) and dedication, for all the research and researchers preceding her, for the uniting of people and the technologies they have built to defeat this single foe that kills so many of us and our loved ones.You could also weep, alas, for Prof Blagden’s attempts to secure funding. All the results she has so far are promising and her patients, she knows, so close to being helped in truly unprecedented ways. “I cannot imagine abandoning them at this point.” But her most recent application was refused. “I was just beside myself.” She is being interviewed by the film-makers at her desk when the email comes through. She breaks off to read the news. The funders have deemed her worthy. “This is … a really important pivot point in what we’re doing,” she says, which is Blagden-speak for “Come in, cancer, your time is fucking UP!”The film ends with her holding the first dose of vaccine in her hands, with the news that Ella is still cancer-free and on the new trial, and with Trevor hearing that he has no signs of any active cancer deposits any more. “In my wildest dreams, I didn’t expect that,” says Trevor. The professor just grins. She did, you see. She did.Cancer Detectives: Finding the Cures is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsDocumentaryTV reviewTelevisionCancer researchreviewsShareReuse this content"

You just can’t look awayAdrian SearleThu 20 Nov 2025 12.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 14.28 ESTShareSometimes a smaller exhibition is more effective than a full-blown survey.Bridget Riley: Learning to Seeat Margate’s Turner Contemporary brings us an invigorating and magical ensemble, juxtaposing 26 works from the 1960s to the present and shuttling between large canvases, studies and works painted directly on the wall. Learning to See concentrates the mind and sharpens the eye.Riley’s paintings come at you all at once. They arrest you and they still you. The longer you look, the more they reveal and the more they seem to change. As they ensnare you, the more rewarding they become. “How does she do that?”,might be a first thought. How are the colours ordered, what’s the logic of their construction? But there’re also the things they do to your nervous system, in that unknowable gulf between eye and brain, between perception and its after-image. The colour values of Dancing to the Music of Time (2022), a big wall drawing made originally for a museum in Canberra, go dun-coloured as you first approach, until each painted disc begins to glow with a silvery penumbra. Comparing colours, you can’t remember the last as you come to the next. I pinball back and forth, getting lost in the music. Angel, a smaller wall drawing, has discs whose stately turning alignments have the kind of brevity and apparent simplicity and inevitability of a few piano phrases by Erik Satie. It’s simple. It’s complicated. It’s mesmerising.View image in fullscreenDemanding attention … Bridget Riley in front of Dancing to the Music of Time.Photograph: Holger NiehausGetting up close and backing away, you can get ensnared by Riley’s systems and her logic. However analytical you might try to be, they continue doing things to you on a physical, phenomenological level. We are not accountants of the optical, and Riley reminds us that we are bodies in space, perceiving the world. Through the window on the balcony, there is a horizon between sea and sky. On the wall opposite, Riley’s horizons keep multiplying. Pin them down and they slip away.These are not eye tests. Riley makes you look, and not only at things she has painted. The 94-year-old artist makes you acutely aware of time lengthening and compressing. Where you stand or sit, how you approach and step back, how she makes you turn and raise or lower your eyes, and go from one work to another, all come into play. She makes you do it again and again, even as you stare at a single work. How alive she makes me feel. Those turning points and axes and intervals, those multiplying staves of colour which she orders, re-orders and repeats, generate both movement and a magisterial sense of implacable stasis.With its perfectly calibrated, wave-like rhythm, Arrest 3, from 1965, loses me in the same kind of optical conundrum as a pattern on a tiled Moorish floor. Streak 3 (1980), with its even more complex and dense curving coloured lines, flowing together and apart, pulls my eye over the swell of its cross-currents as the undertow drags me along.The close-packed verticals in Pharaoh, painted last year, are held in place by eight regularly spaced white pauses; moments where you hold your breath until, stepping away, you come up for air.View image in fullscreenA swell of cross-currents … Streak 3, 1980.Photograph: John Webb/© Bridget Riley 2025. All rights reserved. Courtesy of the artist.Riley’s recent Current paintings are like seeing a pattern of triangles through the distorting ripples of a glazed door. Larger triangles and serpentine rhythms proliferate, less on the paintings themselves than in the viewer’s mind. The two paintings titled Late Morning: one a broad canvas filled with horizontals (1967-8), the other (from 1978) with the filled tight verticals, have me finding bulges and falterings where none exist. I end up on my hands and knees, checking. Why are they named after a time of day? Does time sweep away toward the edges of the painting, the past receding to one side, advancing and brightening into an undefined future on the other? I’m lost in the incomprehensible middle of things.For much of her long career, it has been Riley’s belief that “as a modern artist you should make a contribution to the art of your time, if only a small one”. Riley’s contribution grows with time. She has been both singular and focused in her preoccupation with the acts of looking and of seeing. The two are not the same. Seeing can be a glimpse (what de Kooning once called a “slipping glimpse”), but Riley prolongs the glimpse and the slippage into prolonged and repeated acts of looking. She turns concentration into reverie and leaves me agape, wide-open and surprised. I can’t stop looking.Bridget Riley: Learning to See is atTurner Contemporary, Margate,22 November to 4 MayExplore more on these topicsBridget RileyArtPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

As the daughter ofSamuel Coleridge-Taylor, one of the most famous British composers of the early 20th century, Avril’s was a name enveloped in the long shadows of history.Earlier this year, I sat with these shadows as I prepared to makethe world premiere recordingof Avril’s 1936 piano concerto with the BBC Philharmonic. With its impassioned harmonies, soulful lyricism and valiant rhythms, Avril’s work will grant new listeners fascinating insight into how she – a wartime composer, born in 1903 – conceived of her world as a woman of colour.But here’s the thing about shadows. It can take a while to adjust, to see shapes as they really are, to distinguish truth from distortion, and I had been afraid to confront Avril’s past for a while.I had so wanted her to be her father’s daughter. In some ways, she was. The pastoral English palettes of Samuel’s influence can be heard in many of her works, including From the Hills (1934) and Sussex Landscape (1940). But you only have to look at the titles of her father’s compositions to see how he heard himself as not only a flag bearer of English Romanticism but a voice of the African diaspora.This was where father and daughter seemed to diverge.White America judged Samuel by the brilliance of his  music rather than the colour of his skinDuring his studies at the Royal College of Music, Samuel – the son of a Sierra Leonean father and a white English mother – started to lean into his African roots. When the African American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar came to London in 1897, the 21-year-old composer eagerly sought him out. He set Dunbar’s African Romances to musicand the following year used the poet’s words for an opera, Dream Lovers. Then came the choral piece that put Samuel on the map:Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast.Based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s The Song of Hiawatha,Samuel’s Hiawathawas an international hit, especially with African Americans who felt vicarious pride as white America judged Samuel by the brilliance of his music rather than the colour of his skin.Fame did not temper Samuel’s politics. In 1900, he attended the First Pan African Conference in London where he met the African American intellectual WEB Du Bois and witnessed a range of talks, including on the oppression of Black South Africans. He was an activist until the end. He maintained ties with early civil rights leaders such as Du Bois and Booker T Washington, delivered his own speeches on racial equality, and even discussed issues of racism with President Theodore Roosevelt during an invitation to the White House in 1904. As for his music,reminisced Du Bois, “he wrote his name so high as a creative artist that it cannot soon be forgotten.” He died in 1912, aged 37. But what would Samuel have made of his daughter’s decision to work in South Africa in the 1950s?“Daughter of Famous Composer gives OK to S African Bias,” ran a headline in the Black American publication Jet magazine. Apartheid “seems to me the right policy”, Avril told Jet. When pushed to clarify, she backtracked: she didn’t agree with apartheid “in principle” and it “should be allowed to work itself out, guided by well-meaning South Africans of all races”. Had Avril been more attuned to her father’s politics, or born in Jim Crow America, she might have thought twice about apartheid. But life had sheltered her.View image in fullscreenSamantha Ege and the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra recording the first album devoted entirely to the music of Avril Coleridge-Taylor.Photograph: Jason Dodd“I have a British passport,” she said, “and the officials never asked me questions about my race.” So, with her “porcelain-white” skin (as Jet put it) she floated among the Europeans, buoyed up by their praise for her late father. She gave a talk about her father’s music at the University of Cape Town and conducted the South African Broadcasting Corporation Orchestra in Johannesburg, programming the heroic third movement of her Piano Concerto, subtitled: “In remembrance of my Father.” Although a confident pianist herself, she never played as the soloist in her concerto. Instead, she always led as the conductor; and so the apartheid orchestra played under her baton.Avril hoped, in her own words, she “might bring a change”. But by 1954, things fell apart. Once officials learned of her African heritage, she could no longer stay in the country. Her British passport didn’t protect her, the British high commissioner advised her to leave or risk imprisonment. She returned to England, deeply ashamed as the magnitude of her naivety dawned. “The lesson was a hard one,” she lamented. Adding to her humiliation was the 1955 publication of her ill-fated Jet interview, a yearafterher unceremonious exit from South Africa.As I sat with these shadows, I sensed a familiar story. The story of being British until you’re not – one that calls to mind African-descended soldiers who fought on behalf of the British during the second world war and survived only to be denied their due compensation. And the Windrush generation, who built postwar Britain out of the rubble, but still face legal challenges around their relationship to the only place they’ve ever called home.Lenny Henry: ‘Classical music belongs to us all. Just look at Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’Read moreIn the aftermath, Avril thought of her father and the “tremendous faith he had in the coloured people of the world”. She wrote a piece called Ceremonial March (1957) for Ghana’s independence. Its commemorative overtones have much in common with her rousing In Memoriam: To the RAF (1945) and plaintiveIn Memoriam (1967), which she later dedicated to her brother Hiawatha on his death in 1980, as well as to her father.Samuel had gifted Avril with a sense of belonging in the world, and she took that to heart – for better andfor worse. She could have made life easier for herself in South Africa by concealing her own African heritage and the Coleridge-Taylor name. But she embraced all that she was, and this extended to her music. The Concerto movement dedicated to her father proceeds with bold symphonic colours that insist, “I am here.”If we are to hear the history of Black and mixed race Britain as it was, then we must sit long enough to see that the shadows of the past are nothing to fear if we intend to learn from them.Avril Coleridge-Taylor: Piano Concerto and Orchestral Works with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and John Andrews, is out on 21 November onResonus Classics.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicSouth AfricaBBC Philharmonic OrchestrafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or at least that was the myth. Now Sarah Lucas, toughest of the YBAs, is 63, her fried eggs and kebab are art history, and she’s besties with Maggi Hambling, 80, one of the last of the old-school painters. Lucas admires Hambling not just as an artist but a woman, and in Maggi the Maggi, she has created a loving, heroic image of Hambling’s face made entirely of cigarettes. Hambling returns the compliment with Sarah at Work which, like all her paintings here, is a slapdash mess. But it’s hard to pay much attention to Hambling’s daubs when your eyes are full of balloon breasts (by which I mean boobs moulded on party balloons), shiny red bums thrust in the air, floppy phallic ears and spindly pipe cleaner legs wearing shoes Lucas must have bought in bulk from a fetish shop.In the latest iteration of her Bunny sculptures, laughable yet tragic creatures that render the Playboy Bunny absurdly literal,Sarah Lucascreates orgiastic hilarity and aesthetic mayhem. Limbs, eyes, nipples are everywhere as these poor things pose on concrete chairs in a style you might find in an exclusive sex club, or a male fantasy of some such place. It’s the stuff of the manosphere’s wildest dreams, a lurid monument to hyped-up internet-driven porn. Yet furious feminist satire is just one dimension to Lucas’s extraordinary works.View image in fullscreenA dollop of moody marks … Wall of Water, Sunset by Maggi Hambling.Photograph: © Maggi HamblingShe and Hambling met, we’re told, at the Colony Room in Soho. But while it’s Hambling who was friends with its most famous frequenter Francis Bacon, it is Lucas who deserves comparison with him. Her splayed anatomically explicit bodies of the Bunnies are as desperate and universal as his eviscerated people in claustrophobic interiors. This prison of porn becomes an image of hell as startling as any Bacon painted: you laugh then you cry at these saucy horrors. A Cycoplean girl curled up in a corner peers pitiably at you from her collaged eye, a cigarette in a stumpy paw.But I would be lying if I said I spent this exhibition in soul-searching despair at the male mind. Instead I was thrilled by Lucas’ creativity. Once she mocked the proprieties of sculpture with readymades such asAu Naturel, that signified male and female with two oranges and a cucumber next to a tin bucket and a pair of melons. Now she makes complex, technically difficult sculptural masterpieces, such as Ooh La La that thrusts itself into your face as soon as you walk into Sadie Coles HQ.Crouched on a hard cold chair, glistening in shades of crimson, this outrageous erotic statue with shades of Allen Jones looks like it’s made of latex. In fact it’s cast in bronze, lacquered and painted – a sophisticated, crafty way to create something just as raw and vital as her early readymades. Where some of her generation have turned away from conceptual art or become self-parodies, Lucas has grown without betraying her roots: she combines art and truth in ever more stunning ways, with physical extremes, spectacular gyrations. One Bunny, collapsed on a chair with arms thrown all over the shop and two sets of balloons – which could be breasts or eyes – makes you see how she matches Picasso, eye-nipple for nipple-eye. In fact this appears to be a parody of his most furiously misogynistic painting, the1929 Large Nude in a Red Armchairin the Musée Picasso. Lucas translates the howl of this raging image of Picasso’s wife Olga into three dimensions and 21st-century sleaze. The two artists meet as fellow connoisseurs of the perverse and true. And Lucas is very funny, did I mention that?View image in fullscreenSarah Lucas and Maggi Hambling.Photograph: Steven HattonThere is a gulf between her and Hambling and it is not generational. Lucas is precise, witty and intelligent. Hambling’s works are none of those things. The first big canvas by her is, at first, impressively wild and turbulent – a semi-abstract dollop of moody marks – but somehow it curdles and slumps as you look, its freedom turns out to be mere mess, a pretence of energy. It was done in 2012, years before the well-publicised accident in which she lost a finger. And that sagging sense of futility only worsens. Hambling even shows her sculptures, which are as floppy and false as her paintings. It’s like an art fair where you might see art of wildly incompatible kinds and qualities lumped together – except here it’s not commerce but an emotional connection between the artists that has created this ludicrous juxtaposition. But if this friendship has helped to sustain the roll of artistic brilliance that Lucas is on, who am I to question it?At Sadie Coles HQ and Frankie Rossi Art Projects, London, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designMaggi HamblingSarah LucasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Paul KooikerAs she releases music from her upcoming soundtrack to Wuthering Heights, we count down the best of her frank, futuristic tracksByAlexis PetridisThu 20 Nov 2025 10.55 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Nov 2025 11.34 ESTShare20. Claws (2020)Such was the extent of fan involvement in the How I’m Feeling Now album that the title of Claws was decided by online vote. The opposite of the album’s more fraught depictions of lockdown, it celebrates being trapped with someone you love, although the clanking rhythm track adds a vague sense of unease.19. Taxi (2016)According to one fan database, there are 260 unreleased Charli xcx tracks lurking around online.Taxi, from the scrapped album XCX World, remains the most celebrated for a reason: the funny, snotty saga of a midweek blind date gone wildly out of control, it’s a perfect example of Charli and producer Sophie’s skewed approach to pop.18. Apple (2024)View image in fullscreenPlaying Glastonbury earlier this year.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/ShutterstockThe poppiest track on Brat – nearly binned midway through recording sessions – Apple’s earworm bubblegum melody carries a lyric about strained parental relationships and intergenerational trauma. It also went on to both spawn a viral TikTok dance craze and earn a Grammy nomination. The remix, featuring the Japanese House, feels sweeter still – and equally fantastic.17. New Shapes (ft Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens) (2021)It’s easy to view Brat’s predecessor, Crash, as Charli xcx trying to fit in with standard ideas about mainstream pop, rather than forging her own distinctive path. But its highlights are pretty high: New Shapes deploys bothChristine and the Queensand Caroline Polachek over a fierce take on 80s electro.16. Roll With Me (2017)View image in fullscreenSophie (left) and Charli xcx on stage in 2016.Photograph: Daniel Boczarski/RedfernsThere used to be a rule of thumb thatCharli xcxperversely released her best tracks not on her albums but her mixtapes. Listening to Roll With Me, you can see how that idea blossomed: producer Sophie provides relentless kick-drum thwack and sparse, super-spiky electronics, while Charli brings fabulous attitude-laden pop smarts.15. Nuclear Seasons (2011)If you’re looking for early evidence that Charli xcx was different, then this track from her debut EP, later to become the opener for her debut album, is a good place to start. The lyrics mix up relationship trauma, post-apocalyptic imagery and the suggestion that pop culture is a state of decay; the music reboots doomy 80s synth pop. It’s also insanely catchy.14. 360 (2024)“I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference, baby … I don’t fucking care what you think”: 360 is both the sound of the Brat era swaggering (or perhaps staggering) into view and a superb pop song, whether you opt for the original or the Robyn and Yung Lean-assisted remix.13. I Got It (2017)The Pop 2 mixtape sounded like Charli xcx and her collaborators trying to will a more interesting, provocative pop landscape into being: on I Got It, extravagantly foul-mouthed rapper Cupcakke, Brazilian drag queen vocalist Pabllo Vittar and pansexual shape-shifting US singer Brooke Candy do their thing over a minimal, thrillingly futuristic musical backdrop.12. House (2025)However you might have expected Charli xcx to follow up Brat, it’s unlikely that you expectedthis, from the forthcoming soundtrack to Wuthering Heights: a warped electronic homage to the Velvet Underground, filled with drones, shards of noise and a guest appearance from John Cale, which bursts into furious distortion-laden industrial noise at its climax.11. Club Classics (2024)Pop has hardly wanted for songs about nightclubs, but few of them have captured the small hours dancefloor’s manic sense of euphoria like Club Classics. It feels chaotic, relentless and artificially accelerated, and celebrates complete abandon: “Sweat marks on all my clothes … I wanna be blinded by the lights.”10. Gone (ft Christine and the Queens) (2019)View image in fullscreenChristine and the Queens (left) and Charli xcx performing on The Tonight Show in 2019.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesAnother Christine and the Queens collaboration, Gone improbably transforms the lyrical topic of crushing social anxiety – “I feel so unstable / I fucking hate these people” – into anthemic pop. There’s a powerful sense of catharsis about the way it explodes from brooding verses into a banging, exhilarating chorus.9. Backseat (ft Carly Rae Jepsen) (2017)Charli xcx andCarly Rae Jepsenonce drunkenly plotted to make an album together; their solitary IRL collaboration is marvellous. Thematically, Backseat feels like two different songs – one about a breakup, the other about the alienating nature of celebrity – perfectly joined by the chorus (“I’m alone”) and shifting, inventive electronic backing.8. Boys (2017)By latter-day xcx standards, Boys is musically and lyrically straightforward – a giddy reverie of lust set to a suitably daydreamy backing – but it’s utterly charming and joyful. Extra points for the video, which featured the lead singer of Vampire Weekend lurking among its parade of heavily muscled objects of desire.7. Anthems (2020)Written and recorded as Covid raged, its lyrics crowdsourced with fans online, Anthems perfectly captures those lockdown moments when the urge to, as Charli put it, “go out, blow off some steam, get fucked up” became overwhelming. If its sound is intense to the point of seeming a bit nuts, well, that’s how it felt.Charli XCX: ‘Labels are desperate for artists to be liked, otherwise you’re bad, evil and wrong’Read more6. Boom Clap (2014)Originally intended for former Disney star Hilary Duff (she rejected it), the song’s author turned Boom Clap into the highlight of her second album, Sucker, and her first US Top 10 hit. No wonder: it’s hugely catchy and impressively classy, the hooky chorus set amid chugging, pulsing synths – though she hates it now.5. Next Level Charli (2019)A paean to her fans, packed with references to her past work, the brilliance of Next Level Charli lies in the gulf between the music, which lulls the listener into believing they’re going to get a dreamy, 80s-influenced ballad, and the gobby, playground-chant stridency of the vocal: “In the rave – go for ever and ever!”4. Von Dutch (2024)View image in fullscreenIn Los Angeles, California, 2024.Photograph: Étienne Laurent/AFP/Getty ImagesYou could call Von Dutch a diss track – it’s rumoured to be aimed at FKA twigs – but it feels more like an infectious expression of self-confidence: someone who knows she has hit her imperial phase, and has created an irresistible, epochal pop single almost entirely out of grinding, revving noise to prove it.3. Vroom Vroom (2015)A step into the leftfield that got decidedly mixed reviews on release, Vroom Vroom now feels like the birth of Charli xcx 2.0, harnessing her songwriting skills to the skeletal, avant-pop sound of PC Music affiliateSophie. A decade ago it felt completely removed from mainstream pop trends; today it sounds incredibly prescient.2. Girl, So Confusing (2024)A different class to the usual pop-star-writes-prickly-song-about-fellow-pop-star fare, Girl, So Confusing is both an amazing song and a heartwarming saga. The original version depicted a fraught relationship with Lorde, accompanied by a synthesiser that fizzes and growls;the remixfeatured Lorde herself answering the criticisms and movingly explaining her own issues.1. Track 10 (2017)On the face of it, Track 10, from her mixtape Pop 2, is an unlikely list-topper. It’s a remix of a demo – eventually reworked into theLizzo-featuring 2019 single Blame It on Your Love– with what looks like a placeholder title. But it’s also a masterpiece: an epic ballad that’s both wildly experimental and genuinely affecting. The lyrics sound like a drunken confession from someone who can’t stop her insecurities destroying a relationship. Anyone else might have been inclined to play a song like that straight, but somehow, the overload of theoretically alienating electronics – glitches and distortion, wilfully excessive AutoTune, icy maximalist rave synths – only amplifies its impact.Explore more on these topicsRankedCharli xcxPop and rockChristine and the QueensCaroline PolachekSophieCarly Rae JepsenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A few months ago, the Fleetwood Mac singer and rock legend suffered an accident that forced her to postpone a string of tour dates, including this show in Brooklyn which was rescheduled from August to November. “I was airborne,” she recalls of the incident around five minutes after hitting the stage tonight. “I thought:‘Is it over?’” A voice at the back of the arena lets out an animalistic yell. “No!!!!”Wild-hearted hits: Stevie Nicks’ 20 best songs – ranked!Read moreIt’s a safe bet that everyone in the 17,000-capacity Barclays Center arena shares the sentiment. Tonight, a noticeably varied audience of fans has shown out for Nicks’s rescheduled date, ranging from witchcore-styled teens to longtime fans who retain a love for the 70s’ bohemian style as well as the decade’s social consciousness: the venue is sold out of veggie burgers.While Nicks hasn’t released a studio album of new material since 2011’s In Your Dreams, she hasn’t strayed too far from the center of pop culture since. In recent years, she’s regularly performed with Harry Styles,helped inspirea song on Taylor Swift’s zillion-selling The Tortured Poets Department, and had two Barbie dolls created in her honour. In 2019, she became the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, in an overdue corrective to initially sluggish critical recognition of her solo work. (She holds the record for the most Grammy nominations for female rock vocal performance without a win.)View image in fullscreenStevie Nicks at Barclays Center.Photograph: Sarah WaxbergAfter limbering up with some ballet moves and roaring that it’s time to get the party started, Nicks launches into a setlist spanningFleetwood Macclassics and choice cuts from her stellar 80s albums Bella Donna and The Wild Heart. On If Anyone Falls, she’s fired up as her muscular voice rises to a shout, while the storming centerpiece Stand Back comes alive with a throbbing motorik intro, synthy power-chords, and analog bits of kit that light up like a spaceship’s control room.The show is part musical performance, part An Evening With Stevie Nicks, with extended and sometimes self-deprecating anecdotes forming the evening’s tapestry. Before launching into a performance of the less-memorable recent single The Lighthouse, Nicks describesbeing invited to perform the song on Saturday Night Live. “Which I hadn’t been on since, I dunno” – she pretends to think about the year – “nineteen …hundred.” At other times, she’ll tell stories about her capes, regularly disappearing offstage to switch out one embroidered garment for another and rightly pausing to invite a little commotion for the look.There’s a similar looseness to Nicks’s commitment to building her songs into three-dimensional theatre. In a new version of her Rumours clapback to groupies, Gold Dust Woman becomes a brilliant 13-minute cacophony during which Nicks seems to play both the song’s narrator and the flirty hanger-on: during an extended guitar solo, she dances trance-like as if crafting a love potion, before bellowing a command for the witchy intruder to get out. With her lowered register, it would be pushing it to say that Nicks had never sounded better, but she’s majestically assured on Dreams, with her deepened register adding to the song’s ache.View image in fullscreenStevie Nicks at Barclays Center.Photograph: Sarah WaxbergMissing tonight are Nicks’s former live staples like Leather and Lace, Enchanted, and Sara, as well as well-streamed minor singles like Talk To Me and Rooms On Fire. It’s hard to exactly begrudge Nicks for focusing on the material she knows works as she makes her return to the stage, but a few deeper cuts would have been welcomed by diehards as well as freshened the setlist, which is essentially a curtailed version of her 24 Karat Gold Tour.Her sense of passion and play still burns bright. “Dance all night long,” Nicks tells the audience as parting words, after a stripped-down Landslide has brought the arena to a hush. “That’s probably what has gotten me to 77 years old. Dance on your way to the kitchen; dance on your way to watching TV; most of all, dance for me.” Her words are warm, whimsical and utterly sincere. She has more than earned her victory lap.Explore more on these topicsStevie NicksPop and rockNew YorkFleetwood Maclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, the actor who has since apologised for the “most atrocious cockney accent in the history of cinema” as chimney sweep Bert in the Disney classic has revealed he was in the running to play another UK icon on screen: James Bond.Speaking on theToday TV programme in the US, Van Dyke, who turns 100 next month, said that Bond producer Albert Broccoli approached him after his performance in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1968 to ask if he fancied being a successor to Sean Connery.“Would you like to be Bond?” Van Dyke recalls Broccoli saying, to which he replied: “Have you heard my British accent?”In press since, Van Dyke has credited his notoriously inaccurate attempt in Mary Poppins to an Irish dialect coach, while also suggesting that cast and crew, including Julie Andrews, should have flagged with him any shortcomings.Van Dyke continued by saying that he is still actively seeking acting work, saying: “I don’t want to [retire], I mean, it’s my life. I love it.”The star, who won three Emmys for The Dick Van Dyke Show, as well as a Tony award for Bye Bye Birdie, is promoting a new book, 100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist’s Guide to a Happy Life.Dick Van Dyke sorry for ‘atrocious cockney accent’ in Mary PoppinsRead moreThe star is a famously garrulous chatshow guest. In 2010, then 84, he recalled how he wasrescued from drowning by porpoiseswho pushed his surfboard back to shore after he nodded off on the waves.Three years later, he wasrescued from a burning car on the California freeway, and in 2023 came another close call, when he lost control of his Lexus in rainy weather and crashed into a gate.The actor who will become the next cinema Bond is still to be announced, after Daniel Craig’s departure and rights to the franchise being handed over to Amazon.Although Scottish, Irish and Australian stars have taken on the role, no American since Van Dyke is thought to have been in contention. Should he again fail to secure the role, Callum Turner, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Theo James are believed to be the frontrunners.This article was amended on 20 November 2025. An earlier version said Dick Van Dyke was approached to playJames Bondin the franchise’s first film; in fact, Van Dyke was asked about replacing Sean Connery in the role. Also, Julie Andrews was incorrectly described as being “London-born”. This has been removed.Explore more on these topicsDick Van DykeJames BondnewsShareReuse this content"

It doesn’t make me feel safe.”The singer said that when she was shooting her debut acting role in thecoming-of-age story Ish, in Luton, the mostly black and brown crew and cast became worried after rumours of a Tommy Robinson rally in the town.“We were wondering on one of the days whether it was safe to go into work because we heard that there would be mass protests in Luton withTommy Robinsonand his mates,” she said.When asked if the current situation was comparable to the 1970s when the National Front regularlyheld marches in immigrant areas, she said: “In my opinion it’s completely comparable. It’s terrifying … I am really, really concerned. It feels like we are entering a dark time.”Crookes’ Brixton performances went viral after a clip of her playing a cover of Sinéad O’Connor’santi-racism anthem Black Boys on Mopedssurfaced online.View image in fullscreenSinéad O’Connor died in 2023.Photograph: Jane Bown/The ObserverO’Connor wrote the song after the deaths of Nicholas Bramble, who was killed while being pursued by the police on a moped they assumed he’d stolen, and Colin Roach, a black teenager who died under suspicious circumstances whileinside Stoke Newington police station.The inside sleeve of O’Connor’s hit albumI Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got, which the song was on, also featured an image of Colin Roach’s parents protesting, alongside the caption: “God’s place is the world but the world is not God’s place.”While the song referenced police violence and racism, it also spoke to what O’Connor saw as the hypocrisy of political leaders, including Margaret Thatcher who was referenced in the song and had been accused offlirting with extreme-right rhetoricduring her rise to power.While introducing the song on stage in Brixton, Crookes said: “I don’t want to sing this song, but 35 years ago, Sinead wrote this and it’s still relevant and I feel like it’s probably necessary.”Crookes, who has Irish and Bangladeshi heritage, said the idea to play O’Connor’s song came after driving around Dublin with her cousins and seeingdozens of Irish tricolour flags, which are part of a nationalist, anti-immigrant movement.Anti-racist concerts can stop rise of the UK far right, says veteran activistRead more“I realised at that moment that this is an issue that’s happening in the west and it’s becoming more and more rife because of the big F, fascism, and the rise of the right,” she said.After the Dublin concert, where the song received an ovation, her team said she should play the song on every leg of her tour because it was “relevant everywhere in the UK”.Crookes said she was playing the song to encourage “solidarity” between communities directly affected by far-right rhetoric but also as a reminder to musicians to use their voices.“Maybe I’m singing that song as a small nod to my community to say we also have to take some responsibility and speak out,” she said. “I think my peers are definitely willing to talk about Palestine but when it comes to the big R word [racism], it’s a bit scary.”Explore more on these topicsFar rightSinéad O'ConnorTommy RobinsonIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

The actor stars in Ryan Murphy’s legal drama, which has received a string of zero-star reviews. In her appraisal,the Guardian’s Lucy Mangandescribed it as: “Fascinatingly, incomprehensibly, existentially terrible.” The series currently holds a 3% rating onreviews site Rotten Tomatoes.According to Close, the main issue was the choice to air the worst three episodes first. “I personally think that the first three episodes were the weakest,” she told Variety. “That was a tough way to start. I’ve seen all nine episodes, and I think it actually adds up to something.”She also spoke out in support of her co-starKim Kardashian, who plays one of a number of women who found a legal firm that deals with divorces in California. She says she had a good relationship with Kardashian on-set, at one point going to an alcohol-fuelled viewing of Close’s movie classic Fatal Attraction, which was organised by Kardashian’s mother Kris Jenner.“What surprised me was Kim’s seriousness of intent,” Close said. “She always knew her lines. She never was late. She always was prepared. She had no pretensions that she was a great actress, but she was smart enough to have people around her who she could learn from. If she was a big ego, or what I call a ‘life-is-too-short person’, I would have been unhappy, but she’s not.”Close also blamed the Kardashians’ reputation for part of the negative backlash. “The Kardashians would say this themselves, but not everybody likes them. They have an image.”Close has previously spoken of her love for the show. Duringa Guardian interview that questioned the quality of the writing of All’s Fair, she said: “I swear to God, I’ve seen all nine episodes and it’s pretty fucking good. It is what it is: it’s juicy and outrageous at times and touching.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionRyan MurphyGlenn CloseKim KardashiannewsShareReuse this content"

This week, lawyers for the accusers filed a motion to have two further accusers added to the lawsuit, both anonymously.The man, who worked as a car valet for Robinson, alleges that Robinson fondled himself in front of him, and tried to place the man’s hand on his genitals. Like the four initial accusers, the woman worked as a housekeeper, and alleges that Robinson tried to make her touch him while he was showering on numerous occasions.In a statement to Rolling Stone, Robinson’s lawyer Christopher Frost said the most recent accusers were “part of the same group of people who have conspired together against the Robinsons and are layering out their claims for maximum adverse publicity,” and called the lawsuit an “organised, avaricious campaign to extract money from an 85-year-old legend”.Robinson denied the allegations from the first four women, which included allegations of rape.His wife, Frances, is a co-defendant in the original filing, and is accused of labour violations, using “ethnically pejorative words and language”, and being aware of the alleged sexual assaults. The plaintiffs are seeking $50m in financial damages.After the initial lawsuit was filed, their lawyer Frost called the allegations “vile, false” and said they were “an ugly method of trying to extract money” from Smokey Robinson.Later in May, the Robinsons filed a $500m countersuit, alleging defamation and elder abuse, and describing “an extortionate plan to take everything” from them. They claimed they had been generous to the women, giving them gifts and funding dental treatment.Despite the serious allegations, Robinson has continued to perform since, including UK concerts at Love Supreme jazz festival and London’s Eventim Apollo during the summer.He is known for a string of hits he performed with his group the Miracles, followed by 24 albums as a solo artist. The most recent, What the World Needs Now, was released in April.Robinson also wrote a string of hits for other artists in the Motown stable, including My Girl and Get Ready for the Temptations.Explore more on these topicsSmokey RobinsonPop and rockSoulnewsShareReuse this content"

InFrance,bandes dessinées,known as BD, are lauded as the “ninth art” and are popular among adults as well as younger readers.Announcing she was withdrawing €200,000 (£176,000) of public subsidies for the event until a shake-up in the way it was run, the culture minister, Rachida Dati, said on Tuesday she hoped the 2026 festival would nonetheless go ahead. She had invited those boycotting it to a meeting, she added.The culture ministry said on Wednesday it was hard to see it happening as scheduled in late January if the boycott was maintained. “Realistically, if there are no authors or publishers, it’s hard to see how the festival can happen in 2026,” a spokesperson said. “We are at a turning point in the history of the festival, which is in difficulty and in danger.”View image in fullscreenCancelling the festival would be ‘a catastrophe’ for the area in ‘an already fragile economic situation’, said the local MP, Caroline Colombier.Photograph: Yohan Bonnet/AFP/Getty ImagesThe row centres on the way the festival, first held in 1974, is managed and organised. It is run by a non-profit association but has been put on by the private company 9eArt+ since 2007.Franck Bondoux, the director of 9eArt+, announced he was stepping down last week after it was reported that a female member of staff had been fired after going to the police to report a rape during the 2024 festival.The woman’s sacking outraged writers, cartoonists and publishers. On Sunday, 285 female authors published a letter of support for her, and called for a “girlcott” of the festival on social media. Critics are also deeply unhappy with 9eArt+, claiming a lack of transparency in its organisation of the event. Bondoux has denied the allegations over his management.The boycott came after the company’s association with the festival was renewed beyond 2027. Among those who have threatened to stay away in 2026 are the prize-winning comic book authorsRiad Sattouf, Maus creatorArt Spiegelmanand last year’s winner of the grand prix of the city of Angoulême, Anouk Ricard.A letter signed by 22 former winners of the festival’s top prizes said: “It is high time to turn the page on 9eArt+ so the festival can regain the values that helped build its international reputation with new operators.”It had been hoped that Bondoux standing down would calm critics, but the French national publishing union, which represents 24 major publishing houses, said in a statement on Wednesday: “Given this large-scale movement [to boycott], which they understand, publishers believe the 2026 edition can no longer go ahead.”Caroline Colombier, the local member of parliament, said cancelling the event would be “a catastrophe” for the local area in what she said was “an already fragile economic situation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The woman has also taken her case to the Paris industrial tribunal to contest her dismissal, which she said was a consequence of the complaint.9eArt+ said it had fired the employee for “serious misconduct” shortly before the end of her probationary period due to “behaviour incompatible with the image of the company”.In February Bondoux told Le Parisien her dismissal was “in no way related to what may have happened in terms of an alleged rape. We were not aware of this when we decided to dismiss the individual.”He added: “The company did not fail in its obligations … Of course, we accept and hear the employee’s account of being raped, but these events took place outside the company.”Responding to criticisms of the management culture at 9eArt+, Bondoux said: “Who is talking about toxic management? An unsourced statement … If that were the case, action would have been taken by employees.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

The woman was on the asphalt, zip-tied. He came over and zapped her, and then carried her like garbage and threw her in the back of the SUV.”The second video, he continued, showed “a Palestinian refugee camp inLebanonthat was bombed and 12 people died. And I kept thinking: they make a desolation and call it a ceasefire. Sometimes, as writers, we have to say: enough.”Alameddine’s speech on Wednesday night capped off a ceremony filled with politically potent victories. Many winners – like those in thepasttwoyears – used their speeches to reflect on the role of literature in the face of global tragedy.Bryan Washington and Rabih Alameddine among National Book Award finalistsRead more“It’s very difficult to think in celebratory terms about a book that was written in response to a genocide,” said Omar El Akkad, who won the nonfiction prize for One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This. The Egyptian-Canadian author’s bookis a treatiseon the western response to Israel’s war on Gaza.“It’s difficult to think in celebratory terms when I have spent two years seeing what shrapnel does to a child’s body,” he said. “When I know my tax money is doing this, and that many of my elected representatives happily support it.”El Akkad was one of three winners recognized by the first time by the National book award. Each of the five categories came with a $10,000 prize.The translated literature award went to We Are Green and Trembling by the Argentinian writer and first-time nominee Gabriela Cabezón Cámara, translated from Spanish by Robin Myers.“I’m gonna speak in Spanish because there are fascists who don’t like that,” Cabezón Cámara said to uproarious applause.Another first-time nominee, Daniel Nayeri, won the young people’s literature award for The Teacher of Nomad Land, the story of two orphaned Iranian siblings in the second world war.The poetry prize went to Patricia Smith for The Intentions of Thunder, a collection centered around the beauty and brutality of the Black experience in the US. She had previously been a poetry finalist in 2008 for her book Blood Dazzler.The ceremony, which took place at Cipriani Wall Street and featured a performance from Corinne Bailey Rae, also included the presentation of two previously announced lifetime achievement awards to Roxane Gay and George Saunders.Saunders, in a galvanising speech, called on the power of writing to dispel the myth of absolute power. “Bullies, autocrats, zealots … they always know. They’re completely sure,” he said.“But we artists … have an advantage over autocrats because [we’re] in that not-knowing state. This puts us in a less delusional relationship with reality. And the less delusion, the less suffering we cause.”The True True Story of Raja the Gullible (and His Mother) by Rabih Alameddine (Little, Brown Book Group, £22).

He is chaotic, lazy, resentful, entitled and given to getting drunk and spending money he hasn’t got. At the start of their marriage, Jane’s career as a writer and academic is on the up, while John – a visual artist and aspiring film-maker – has hit a professional wall. Time and time again, he insists they move cities for better work opportunities, which soon puts a spanner in his wife’s working life. It comes as no surprise that, after their son is born, Jane is left to do the parenting while her husband absents himself from his responsibilities.Voice actor Rebecca Lowman is the narrator whose seething, staccato delivery finds a natural home inSarah Manguso’s quietly livid prose. “My husband asked me why I was so much angrier than other women. It always made me smile,” Jane reflects. “I was exactly as angry as every other woman I knew.”But is John solely to blame for the couple’s troubles? As Jane chronicles one slight after another, all the while making excuses for them both, you begin to wonder about her collusion and self-deception in this unhappy setup. Manguso’s ultimate message is that, despite the best intentions, marriage makes liars of us all.Available via Picador, 6hr 7minFurther listeningFinding My Way BackMalala Yousafzai, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 8hr 56minThe second memoir from the Nobel peace prize-winning activist focuses on the aftermath of her attempted assassination by the Taliban, during which she navigatesfame, friendship, first loveand studying for a degree at Oxford.

Adapted by writer-director Dylan Southern from Max Porter’s novellaGrief Is the Thing With Feathers, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch who gives an honest and well-intentioned performance as a children’s author and graphic novelist. Living a middle-class existence in London, he is suddenly widowed; one of the movie’s off-target qualities is its refusal to specify the cause of death or even show us clearly what his wife looked like, which in real life would be unbearably vivid facts. Sam Spruell has a quietly sympathetic role as Cumberbatch’s brother.Left to look after their two young boys, he succumbs to a kind of breakdown, and hallucinates a giant nightmarish crow, which after a while the boys can sense too. The crow is derisively voiced by David Thewlis, and resembles the Ted-Hughes-ish illustrations Cumberbatch was working on. It sneeringly, ruthlessly mocks and jeers at his “sad dad” anguish; while everyone else is walking on eggshells around him, perhaps making things worse, the brutal crow jabs its beak into his psychic wound.The film has some cliches: the cartoonishly misjudged and intrusive gesture of sympathy by a school-gates mum, and the solo pushing of a trolley around a supermarket which morphs into a bad dream. The death-totem crow is not cliched, exactly, though it did remind me ofDaina O Pusic’s comparably unsatisfying film Tuesday, which offered a giant macaw as a symbol of death. But this special effects crow is, for me, not believable either as a symbol of grief or as a radically therapeutic way of challenging or working through it, and the film is itself is too flagrantly tasteful and sensitive to work as a horror movie. Quite simply: when the crow is off the screen, the drama starts to be involving and affecting. Once the crow is there, the film looks self-conscious.The Thing With Feathers is out now in Australia, on 21 November in the UK, and on 28 November in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsMax PorterBenedict CumberbatchreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jacob Richmond and Brooke Maxwell’s cult hit, which began life in a fringe theatre in Canada in 2009, has the spirit of the circus woven into its fabric. It arrives in London, quirks and all, in a wonderfully eccentric production directed by Lizzi Gee.A story about six high-school choristers sent spiralling to their demise from a rollercoaster is hardly the most conventional ground for an all-singing, all-dancing show. But as we travel with them into a space between life and death, where they are forced to compete for a second chance on Earth, the narrative gradually slips away from its morbid trappings and celebrates life.Led by a fortune teller, The Amazing Karnak (Edward Wu), who moves with the stiffness of a wind-up toy and towers above the stage, the teens are instructed to come forward, one by one, to make their case. What follows is a spectrum of musical numbers, with each contestant presenting a condensed version of their life story.Ocean (Baylie Carson), the squeaky queen bee, goes first with a song celebrating herself. Noel (Damon Gould) follows with a dreamlike fantasy of high kicks and corsets. Ukrainian rebel Mischa (Bartek Kraszewski) delivers a punchy rap. Ricky (Jack Maverick), who grew up mute, transforms into a sequin-wearing god in the 70s-inspired Space Age Bachelor. The nicest girl in town, Constance (a brilliant debut from Robyn Gilbertson), discovers her love for the world just as it’s too late. Jane Doe (Grace Galloway), who was decapitated in the crash and now wears a doll’s head, performs a haunting aria for the unknown person she might have become.Precipice review – horror on the Thames in a baffling musical dystopiaRead moreAfter a while, the structure begins to feel formulaic. With each character given only a fleeting moment in the limelight, there’s little time to truly get beneath their skin. Still, it’s easy to see why the show has picked up such a dedicated fanbase over the years. This is a genuinely unique musical and, with a few tweaks, it could soar.AtSouthwark Playhouse Elephant, London, until 10 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsSouthwark PlayhouseCircusreviewsShareReuse this content"

Only one of them, however, will strip down to his long johns as he sings I’m Too Sexy by Right Said Fred.At Liverpool’s Royal Court they do things differently. With his brushed back mane of silvery hair, Paul Duckworth’s Scrooge is not just miserly, he is also libidinous and foul-mouthed, not to mention being a hot shot on the harmonica.On top of that, he is actively corrupt. His colleague Jacob Marley has mysteriously disappeared and Scrooge, having doctored the will, stands to inherit his biscuit factory. The joke about Jacob’s cream crackers is the first of many a biscuit pun.View image in fullscreenFormidable vocals … Lindzi Germain, left, as Barbara in The Scouse Christmas Carol.Photograph: AB PhotographyMarley’s widow Barbara (Lindzi Germain) reckons something is afoot, which means, in this telling by Kevin Fearon, the ghosts ofChristmaspast, present and future are less the supernatural visitations imagined by Dickens and more a ruse to flush out Scrooge. His drunken sleep is disturbed by the Garston ghost busters, merrily squirting water into the audience from their proton guns and scaring him into coming clean.Surprisingly, the more the show pulls in its own wayward direction, the more the original asserts itself. Cross out the knockabout antics and the romantic subplots (turns out Scrooge and Barbara have history) and you are back to a wholesome message about generosity and community spirit. No harm in that, but the focus on rattling out the story does lower the joke count, especially as too often we get a swear word where we expect a gag to be.The exuberance of Mark Chatterton’s cast covers up the cracks. If they deserve better material than this, they are not going to let it show. Whether it is a doe-eyed Lenny Wood as Bob Scratchitt or a multitasking Keddy Sutton as everything from a housekeeper to a mayor, they all feed into a high-energy ensemble. Gluing the show together are the song-and-dance numbers powered by Ben Gladwin’s live band and Beverley Norris-Edmunds’ choreography, not forgetting Germain’s formidable vocals on the big ballads.AtRoyal Court theatre, Liverpool, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreChristmas showsLiverpoolCharles DickensComedy (Stage)ChristmasComedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

The latter’s uninhibited invention, he argues, has its roots firmly in the baroque with its improvisatory elements and enthusiasm for the dance.The album opens with Bach’s E major Prelude from The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1 (indeed, all the works here are either in E major or E minor, keys that the Icelandic pianist, who is synaesthetic, associates with different shades of green). Notes sounded with a delicate baroque detachment carry over into a diaphanous reading of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No 27 in E minor, Op 90, a work Ólafsson sees as a direct precursor of Op 109.A pellucid account of Bach’s final Partita provides a substantial palate cleanser, before Schubert’s rarely heard Piano Sonata No 6 in E minor – a work that in context seems indebted to Beethoven’s Op 90. The seamless slide into the long-awaited Op 109 is breathtaking. Not only does Ólafsson offer exceptional variety in his articulation here, it’s also one of the most purely beautiful accounts on record.Traditionalists may wince, but for those prepared to go along with him, Ólafsson opens up a transcendent vista on to a brave new world.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

What was remarkable, however, was the way the Finnish conductor drew out the groundbreaking qualities in some of the more conventional works. This was particularly apparent in the central movement of the Karelia Suite where the warmth of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra’s strings was underpinned by a folk-inflected harmonic pungency, or in the outer movements where intricate countermelodies that sometimes go unnoticed were revealed.It was good, too, to hear a selection of Sibelius’s seldom-programmed vocal works, especially inHelena Juntunen’s characterful performances. A compelling actor, she threw herself into three of the composer’s finest orchestral songs, her body contorting with emotion as the audience hung on her every crystal clear syllable. Baron Magnus, a lyrical ballad in which a gloomy nobleman dallies with a mermaid and (unusually) lives to tell the tale was exquisitely characterised. Juntunen’s stirring soprano was rich and creamy, her dramatic commitment absolute.View image in fullscreenOsmo Vänskä conducts the CBSO in Symphony. Hall, Birmingham.Photograph: Jonathan FerroComposed in 1913, the tone poem Luonnotar is an innovative masterpiece. Rooted in the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, it describes the creation of heaven, moon and stars out of broken duck eggs as they tumble from the knee of a pregnant nature spirit. Juntunen, returning to the platform in traditional dress, revelled in every aspect of its weird brilliance.Many have speculated on the meaning behind Shostakovich’s cryptic 15th symphony: the composer said little about it before his death. Vänskä adopted a brisk, puckish approach to the up-tempo movements, relishing the music’s neurotic tics. The percussion section in particular had a field day, and the orchestral playing in general was up a notch on the first half. Diaphanous textures and a sustained tension heightened the Chekhovian ache of the slower movements, the music drawing to a close at last with a ghostly death rattle and a hint of mocking laughter.AtBristol Beacon on 20 November.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicCity of Birmingham Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a good opportunity to think about how we might jazz up our non-alcoholic offering for friends and family who are trying to drink less, or not drinking booze at all.

But what of those who like, or used to like, a cocktail? Those who enjoy the heady, medicinal kick of a spirit, but don’t want any of the booze?Spirit is so easily defined in alcohol terms, but what about when you’re not distilling something alcoholic from the ingredients? As it’s defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (the website; I don’t have one knocking around the house), a spirit is a “strong distilled alcoholic liquor used for drinking”. So, part of how I’m defining a non-alcoholic spirit will be first based on its strength and second those elements that need to be distilled to create it. (Non-alcoholic brandEverleafnotes, however, that extracting from specific ingredients can be most effectively done in different ways, either by distillation or by grinding an ingredient down.) I’d also argue that a spirit can be identified in how you choose to enjoy it: if it can be enjoyed with a mixer, it’s a spirit; and if it can be shaken or mixed into a cocktail or enjoyed on the rocks, it’s definitely a spirit. By all those definitions, I’m talking liqueurs, aperitifs and amaros here.Mother Root, a ginger, chilli and honey mix, is one of my absolute favourite drams to drink in any of those ways: top it up with soda water for an easy highball, or add a squeeze of lime to make a non-alcoholic Moscow mule. The fiery ginger is enough to perk you up in the morning and smack you out of a hangover, and I love it when ginger productsactuallytaste of ginger.Then there’s the herby citrusBotivo, whose success is testament to the growing popularity of non-alcoholic options. Pretty much every chic hotel bar and up-and-coming wine bar now stocks this smart yellow bottle, as are even some pubs. It’s just the thing to scratch the itch of a botanical spirit lover, and it works particularly well with anything elderflowery.I’m also very intrigued by a recent discovery fromSylva Labs– aged, non-alcoholic spirits made using British fruit wood and established by Ben Branson, the founder ofSeedlip(heard of ’em?). The first glance made me think of just-pressed apple juice, but when I took a swig the palate was smoky and forest floor-y. I couldn’t help but imagine it stirred into a Manhattan-style cocktail in lieu of whisky, perhaps with a squeeze of plum juice.Four nolo spirits that are worth a puntMother Root Ginger£28.95 (50cl) Sainsbury’s, 0%.

An unexpected stop on a trip to Iran in the 1970s gifted Thomas a chance meeting with a Persian doctor and his breakfast: fresh labneh with soft, still-warm lavash. It was a revelation. On his return, Thomas got to work creating a fresh cheese from goat’s milk (similar to chèvre) and from cow’s milk, marinated and preserved in oil, with an extra “t” to avert confusion with the Greek-style feta, that’s still being utilised by cooks and chefs right across the world.Persian fetta is a shapeshifter, capable of remaining both firm and steadfast when crumbled across the top of a platter or salad, and of yielding to a soft, velvety cream, enhancing all manner of dishes from pasta to pesto to whipped dips andschmears– and, of course, as a topping for that Aussie cafe staple, avocado toast.When cafe culture ground to a halt during the rolling Covid lockdowns, Persian fetta producers were left with bucketloads (literally) that would normally have been used by the city’s cafes, so instead they offered them to independent grocers and supermarkets. Stuck at home with my bucket of cheese, I’d plonk some into anything savoury I was testing – and I mean anything.In this recipe from my bookSalad for Days, I incorporate that fetta funk into a creamy Balkan white bean dip known aspapula, which I first came across viaOliaHercules. Adding cheese to the dip pumps up the flavour, and whip it into the kind of creamy bed we’ve come to see (and love) under medleys of roast veg, from modern restaurants and modern cooks (such as Meera Sodha ina recent Guardian recipe).Blanketed with strips of silky, crimson roast capsicum, this dish is packed full of beany, plant-forward protein that’s surprisingly substantial, whether you’re serving it for a decadent brunch, lunch, or light dinner, especially if it’s all mopped up with soft bread (lavash,pide, pitta or the like).If you can’t find butter beans, any tinned or jarred white bean will work. Putting the garlic inside the capsicum while it’s roasting helps to flavour the pepper and keeps the garlic from burning, but you could use a quarter-teaspoon of garlic powder instead. And if you can’t find marinated feta where you are, you can totally use a block of soft feta (such as a Danish-style one) for this, instead.Heat the oven to 220C (200 fan)/425F/gas 7. Grab four to six medium red peppers (I go with one per person), lop off the tops and then halve them lengthways. Pull out the seeds and pith. Oil the capsicum halves, then pop them cut side down on a lined tray, tucking four garlic cloves underneath. Roast for 35-40 minutes, until the capsicums are blistered and browning and the garlic is buttery inside.To make the papula, blitz 400g cooked and drained butter beans, with a tablespoon of sherry vinegar, 60ml olive oil and a good pinch of flaky sea salt, then add two-thirds of a jar of marinated fetta (or 200g soft Danish-style feta; reserve the rest of the block for garnish) and blitz again until smooth. Once the garlic is cooked and cool enough to touch, squish the flesh into the bean mixture, blitz again and season to taste.Once the peppers are out of the oven, cover them with a second (inverted) oven tray or a few sheets of foil, then leave for 15 minutes to steam and relax. When they are cool enough to handle, slip off and discard the skins, then slice the cheeks into thin slivers with a sharp knife.Wrap the soft bread in foil and pop into the still-hot oven to warm through while the capsicum cools.To serve, scoop the whipped papula on to a large platter in undulating waves. Arrange the pepper slices on top in bright red, glossy strips. Dress with the tray juices, sprinkle with a good handful of finely chopped parsley, then blob or crumble on the last of the feta. Sprinkle with some sweet or smoky paprika, a handful of roasted almonds (roughly chopped, flakes or slivers), an extra drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of salt flakes. Pop the warm bread nearby and encourage everyone to scoop and dip to their heart’s content.Alice Zaslavsky is a Guardian Australia food columnistExplore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkBeans, pulses and legumesFoodCheeseStarterSnacksVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"
