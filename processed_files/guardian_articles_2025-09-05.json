But the real crisis for Starmer may have only just begunJonathan FreedlandFrom the outset her role has been crucial, and her fall will exacerbate all the doubts about the PM and his ability to keep Labour in powerSign up for our new weekly newsletterMatters of Opinion, where our columnists and writers will reflect on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading and moreFri 5 Sep 2025 10.42 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareAgovernment that was already reeling has sustained another massive blow. Elected in a landslide slightly more than a year ago, Labour hit the midterm blues within a few months, currently has the poll numbers of an administration in its dying days – and has now witnessed ascandal and resignationclose to the apex of power.Perhaps the many New Labour veteransnow installed in Downing Streetwill be reassuring Keir Starmer that the storm of Angela Rayner’s departure will pass, reminding him that the Blair cabinet saw theexit of one Peter Mandelson– also over his homeowning arrangements, as it happens – similarly early in the first term, but paid no electoral price. And yet, the prime minister has only to look at the economic numbers and his own popularity ratings to know that this is not 1998 and he is no Tony Blair.Accordingly, Rayner’s decision to quit as both deputy PM and deputy leader of theLabourparty will hit hard, further wounding a government that has been struggling since almost the moment it took office.At its most basic, a resignation always damages an administration’s reputation for competence. It allows opponents to charge, and voters to fear, that things are unravelling, that at the top there is chaos rather than order. No 10 will hope that the Friday afternoon reshuffle – with David Lammy succeeding Rayner as deputy PM and Yvette Cooper replacing him as foreign secretary – will look decisive and even be rejuvenating. But personnel changes forced by scandal hardly fit the image ofa prime minister whose main offer to the country was technocratic calm, as an antidote to the Tory dysfunction embodied by Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.The specific circumstances that led Rayner to quit make things worse. They recall the headlines that dogged Labour from the start, when senior ministers – including Starmer – were having to explain why they had taken free stuff, fromnatty clothes to tickets to see Taylor Swift. Again, those revelations undermined Labour’s promise to clean the Westminster stables of the sleaze that had malodorously piled up in the Johnson era.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner and Keir Starmer at the Labour party conference in Brighton in September 2021.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThere will be plenty ready to argue that there is a world of difference between Rayner’s actions and those that shook the last government, but it will do little good. A senior minister paying £40,000 less tax than they should have will strike too many voters as proof of what the cynics always, and untruthfully, say – that every last politician is either a hypocrite or more concerned with lining their own pockets than serving the public good.That line of attack damages all politicians, but it hurts this government especially. Starmer does not have oratorical gifts or charisma; for a long time, his defining feature was a kind of boy-scout image of probity. As a former chief prosecutor, he cast himself as the un-Boris: the unexciting goody-goody who would ensure that the rules were obeyed. Any rule-breaking on his watch breaks that perception – bad news when that perception is pretty much all he’s got.Still, that is to map only some of the crater that has been left in the Labour landscape by this bombshell. The gap left by Rayner’s resignation is deeper because of who she is and what her elevation in the party meant.Famously, John Prescott played a very particular role for Blair, acting as an emissary to an often suspicious party, a character witness vouching for his boss to traditional, working-class supporters especially. (As vice-president, Joe Biden performed a similar role for Barack Obama.) By rights, Starmer should not have needed such a lieutenant: the son of a toolmaker is from a working-class background himself. But, for whatever reason, the PM does not present that way. Much of contemporary politics is about vibes, and Sir Keir has a vibe that does not match his backstory.Rayner, whose life experience makes her a rarity among practitioners of Westminster politics, filled that space. You’d speak to Labour canvassers awed by her ability to connect with voters on the doorstep, working-class women especially. One told me how Rayner confessed to a woman that the paving stones of her garden path were cleaner than the tiles in Rayner’s kitchen: the voter beamed. Moderators of focus groups notedhow voters warmed to Rayner for being herself. To them, Rayner had that most precious commodity in politics: authenticity.But this was about more than mere presentation. How many national politicians could speak of the girls who fell victim to grooming gangs and credibly say: “That could have been me”? For some in Labour, Rayner embodied the party’s ideal, even its promise, on social mobility: to nurture a country where “someone like Angela Rayner can become deputy prime minister, where we have a talent pool broader and deeper than Eton College,” as one colleague puts it. Others in Labour are convinced that the long-running and relentless scrutiny by therightwing newspapersof the deputy PM proves that there are some who, with equal passion, don’t want to live in a country where “someone like Angela Rayner can become deputy prime minister”.So a cabinet light on gifted communicators and a government short of politicians capable of speaking to Labour’s historic constituency has lost someone who is both. That leaves a large vacancy to fill.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer can reshuffle his cabinet, but the post of deputy leader is decided by party members. Unless Starmermoves to cancel it– or unless Lammy’s appointment effectively forestalls a contest, by paving the way for the latter to run unopposed – thatmeans an internal election at a moment of vulnerability for the leadership. An argument over the party’s direction that has been rumbling inside Labour for months will now burst into the open, given the focus and sharpness that can only come in a choice between individuals.Should Labour continue to chase the so-called hero voters of the pro-Brexit red wall cherished by the Downing Street chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, fighting Reform UK – which gathers for its party conference this weekend buoyed by polls showing iton course to be the largest party at the next general election– on the turf of immigration and the like? Or should it look to its left, staunching the flow of onetime Labour supporters now defecting to the Greens, the new, unnamed party of Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana or assorted independents? This is a debate that Starmer has so far been able to keep the lid on. Rayner has just blown it right off.Blair withstood that first Mandelson exit in part because the government and the economy were riding high. But it was also because Mandelson’s communications skills were not indispensable. The PM himself was no slouch in that department and, more importantly, the entire government knew what story it was telling. If Rayner’s resignation inflicts much greater damage, that’s not wholly down to either her biography or her ability to speak human. It’s because this government is not telling a story compelling enough to transcend the inevitable bumps and skids that happen to every administration.This autumn there will be two opportunities to address that, in the form of the Labour party conference and the budget, now set for 26 November. If Starmer and his ministers do not seize both of them, then that will be a failure more culpable than any underpayment of stamp duty – and its consequences will be far more grave.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

But the highs it hits are proof that this neglected form of comedy has plenty of life left in itRachel AroestiFri 5 Sep 2025 17.35 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 17.36 EDTShareIt has been 15 years since That Mitchell and Webb Look left our screens, but it’s still hanging around like a funny smell. Inexplicable quiz Numberwang springs to mind every time a ludicrously complex gameshow airs; hyperbolic football coverage invariably evokes the show’s Sky Sports parody – “there is still everything to play for … and for ever to play it in!” – even for the broadcaster itself, which recently recreated the skit for promo purposes. It has never been easier to run into the duo online: the SS officer tentatively asking his skull-festooned colleague if they could possibly be “the baddies” has had a second life as a Trump-era meme. Then there are the ones that have seared themselves on to my memory for no apparent reason, like the sketch in which a swaggering marketing team workshop new ways to sell toothbrushes (they can also clean your tongue!).‘You’re finally dressing your age, David!’ Mitchell and Webb on age, arguments and their big comebackRead moreArriving just as Peep Show was taking off, That Mitchell and Webb Look didn’t quite reach Fast Show levels of ubiquity, but it was clever, memorable and distinctive enough to infiltrate the monoculture. It was also part of sketch comedy’s last hurrah. The genre’s 00s TV heyday wasn’t always edifying (see the social poison pedalled by Little Britain and Bo’ Selecta), yet its almost total eradication – a sketch show hasn’t been Bafta-nominated for over a decade and there is no longer any category that could feasibly accommodate one – has robbed us not only of a particular source of joy, but an important mechanism for digesting the world.The return ofDavid Mitchelland Robert Webb, now in their early 50s, is perhaps not what those yearning for a new wave had in mind. Still, the self-deprecating title – Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping – precludes any saviour narrative, and they’ve chivalrously held the door open for some fresher faces, including actor Kiell Smith-Bynoe and standups Stevie Martin, Krystal Evans and Lara Ricote.View image in fullscreenWith fresher faces … David Mitchell, Lara Ricote,  Kiell Smith-Bynoe, Krystal Evans and Robert Webb.Photograph: Channel 4The duo remain front and centre, however – and it is comfortingly surreal to see them side-by-side again. In fact, from the quirky animated title sequence to the pair’s trademark strain of pedantically logical observational comedy, the whole endeavour feels very 00s. It’s easy to imagine the show’s opening sketch – about a group of 18th-century poshos who can’t see the advantages of a toilet over defecating in a pot and chucking it out the window – airing 20 years ago. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, especially considering the duo were never exactly bleeding-edge in the first place: Mitchell’s whole shtick is bewildered fogey, while as Peep Show’s Jez, Webb will always be synonymous with the tragically misguided pursuit of cool. Few comedy double acts are better placed to cruise into middle-age.That toilet sketch is a decent premise nicely realised. Yet its follow-up – about the changing demands of airport security – is a better idea executed with an energy so cartoonish, shouty and bewigged it wouldn’t have seemed out of place in Little Britain. It is a truth universally acknowledged – even by Mitchell and Webb themselves, who riffed on the topic in their original series – that sketch shows are hit-and-miss. Why, I don’t know – because humour is subjective? Because nobody has ever had enough good ideas to burn through 10 of them in 30 minutes? Or, as Mitchell wryly put it, because “if we didn’t perversely include about 50% deliberately unamusing material” people would be driven to find other faults with them?Whatever the reason, it does feel fairer to focus on the show’s successes rather than its failures. And after a questionable start, there are some real highs. Precisely which programme Sweary Aussie Drama is parodying is unclear, but this expletive-riddled soap about a family of potty-mouthed farmers makes me laugh a lot. So does a skit about horror fans delighting in their disturbed psyches in post-screening vox pops, as well as a gameshow parody called Hot Seat, essentially musical chairs trussed up as a shiny floor format.View image in fullscreenDavid Mitchell as Prince Andrew.Photograph: Channel 4At its best, this series makes a very convincing argument for why we needed sketch shows in the first place. There are certain comic observations about the modern world that don’t fit anywhere else: a great skit about a drama chronicling the making of the two (real) competing TV dramatisations of Prince Andrew’s Newsnight interview being a case in point.From Morecambe and Wise to Smack the Pony, you used to be able to trace the history of British comedy, and culture, in TV sketch shows. Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping isn’t novel or timely enough to carry that torch – but it is proof this criminally neglected genre still has legs.

You certainly need to be. After navigating a half-hour queue to get through security, a group of us were told we needed to go back outside, walk 10 minutes and then go through security again to reach the media centre.Which would have been fine except the staff at the new entrance had been given instructions not to admit the media, and told us to go back to where we had started and queue for security a third time. The theme for this year’s Reform party conference is “Ready for government”. It would have been nice if they were ready for their own conference first. Piss ups and breweries.Still, Reform can’t prepare for every eventuality. Labour couldn’t have come up with a better way of derailing the opening day of Reform’s conference if they had tried. The downside was that it came at the cost of Angela Rayner’s enforced resignation. Many hacks were already on the train back to London before the Reform show had even started. In hindsight, the Labour spinners might have preferred to letNigel Faragetake centre stage on the news bulletins.The derangement had clearly hit the running times. The main stage speeches were supposed to start at noon, but by 12:20pm there was no sign of anyone. Perhaps they were hoping the hall might fill up. Reform might attract 6,000 delegates, but many find better things to do than listen to speeches from the supporting cast. Nige tries to pretend Reform isn’t a one-man band but he’s kidding no one. People don’t care about Richard Tice, Zia Yusuf and the other nobodies. It’s all about Nige. And he wouldn’t have it any other way.EnterDavid Bull, the party chair and daytime TV minnow. Brexit was the happiest day of his life, he began. Maybe he should keep quiet about that. Nige has been trying to distance himself from that disaster for a while now. He then went through a few Reform greatest hits. Immigrants. Boo. Woke. Boo. Net zero. Boo. Make Britain Great Again. Hooray. All this from a man who recently went on TV to say he had been strangled by a ghost. You can’t buy that level of levitas.0:34Andrea Jenkyns performs self-written song Insomniac at Reform UK conference – videoHold my beer, said Andrea Jenkyns. Coming on stage in a purple sequined jump suit with a giant union flag and singing the self-penned Insomnia. No one should have been made to endure this. Once seen it can never be unseen. She then went on to slur her words as she boasted about how she had got rid of both Theresa May and Rishi Sunak. Parading disloyalty would be a theme of this conference. Nige beware.Then the man himself. The charlatan’s charlatan. The establishment man posing as the voice of the people. But no one in Birmingham cared. For them, Nige can do no wrong. They don’t care if he’s a fraud. Because he’s their fraud. He is forgiven anything. Every day a tabula rasa. The fact he contradicts himself and changes his mind on a regular basis is of no bother. That’s just Nige being Nige. For his opponents he is a nightmare. An ever-moving target.Nige was meant to be on at 4.10pm. But in a sign of Rayner-induced panic, he was bumped up the order. Never mind the hall was nearly empty on one side. Anything to get the broadcasters attention. Even if it meant effectively ending the day’s schedule before it had really started. Lee Anderson and others would be no more than an afterthought. Perhaps it made no difference.Amid pounding music, dry ice and pyrotechnics, Nige appeared on stage through an arch like a TV evangelist. He began with a takedown of Rayner’s £40,000 tax avoidance. Unbelievable. So what if he has his own arrangement toavoid paying a higher rate of taxon his TV earnings. Do as I say, not as I do. The march of Reform. No mention of the attrition. The denouncement of Britain as an authoritarian state. Just seconds before he proposed an entirely unelected and unaccountable Reform cabinet. A cry for free speech. Forgetting he had banned some journalists from attending the conference.View image in fullscreenNige rushed on stage because Mad Nads was not having a good day and he needed a drink.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyThen a break. The appearance ofNadine Dorries. Mad Nad was not having a good day. She could scarcely manage a coherent sentence. “You’ll never take me alive,” she mumbled. “Loyalty in a political party is everything.” From a woman with disloyalty running through her veins. She loves only Boris. Her whole career, the victim of The Plot. A woman in mourning for the peerage that never came her way.Nige rushed on stage before Nads could embarrass herself any further. He needed to get things wrapped up. He could do with a drink. A bit of culture war. Promises to stop the boats in two weeks flat that he would never be called on to keep. All he had offered was anger. But that was enough. The crowd loved it.Back in London, Keir Starmer was completing a reshuffle that was as good an admission that every minister had been shit so far. An endorsement of failure. Meanwhile Nige was saying he would be prime minister in two years’ time. Job done. And maybe he was right. If so, Labour and the Tories would have no one to blame but themselves.Explore more on these topicsReform UKThe politics sketchNigel FarageNadine DorriescommentShareReuse this content"

Singer Brett Anderson suggests that if 2022’s Autofiction – their best post-reunion album until now – was their punk album, Antidepressants is its post-punk sibling. Influences such as Magazine, Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees feed into edgier but otherwise trademarkSuedeguitar anthems. Helmed again by longtime producer Ed Buller, Richard Oakes’s killer riffs maraud and jostle, Anderson’s moods run the gamut from impassioned to reflective and the rhythm section brew up a right old stomp.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for AntidepressantsThe 57-year-old singer has spoken about his keenness to not be seen as a heritage act and to attract younger audiences. Antidepressants is no throwback. It’s thoroughly postmodern. The eerie background noises and sonic atmospheres chime perfectly with Anderson’s lyrics about what he calls “tensions of modern life, the paranoia, the anxiety, the neurosis” as the band extol the virtues of connection in a dislocated world.Glorious openerDisintegrateinvites us to embrace mortality and decay (“Come down and disintegrate with me”). Other songs reflect from a midlife perspective on subjects such as humanity’s transient beauty, breakdowns, toxic relationships or societal dependence on medication. There’s a darker energy altogether on the funereal June Rain, a “vignette of a damaged person” in which Anderson, in character, desperately but movingly concludes: “So I close my eyes and walk into the traffic flow.” Great 10th albums by any artist are rare jewels indeed, but this is a late career triumph.Explore more on these topicsSuedePop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s currently in the form of its life and clocking up record ratings. Not bad for a cartoon about four potty-mouthed Colorado schoolboys.NSFW sitcom South Park might have been been on air since 1997, but it has never been more relevant. In an era when satirical talkshows are being axed, Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s creation fulfils a vital function as it mercilessly mocks both sides of the political spectrum. Written and made the week of transmission, it has been able to incorporate topical stories and hold power to account. No wonder parent company Paramount recentlywon a $1.5bn bidding warfor a five-year, 50-episode deal.South Park’s no-holds-barred approach to hot-button issues has made it the most controversial American comedy of all time, animated or not. Here’s our potted history of its scandals, rated in order of explosiveness.15. Meghan and Harry’s privacy pleas (2023)View image in fullscreenThe Worldwide Privacy Tour, 2023.Photograph: Comedy CentralRoyal feathers were ruffled by this slice of Sussex baiting. The Prince of Canada and his wife embark on a “Worldwide Privacy Tour”. When their private jet lands in South Park, they wave “Stop looking at us!” placards. The prince plugs his tell-all memoir, titled Waaagh, with monarchy-bashing interviews. Described in the episode as “sorority girl, actress, influencer, victim”, Meghan Markle was reportedly “upset and overwhelmed”. Rumours swirled that the pair were planning legal action. A spokesperson dismissed this as “baseless, boring nonsense”. Bit rude.Donald Trump is having a lovechild with Satan: South Park sets up future chaosRead more14. Steve Irwin’s fishy fate (2006)When Satan throws a Halloween party in Hollywood, Australian naturalist Steve Irwin is among the celebrity guests. The croc-hunting cult hero was depicted with a stingray barb through his chest, having died in that manner just two months before broadcast. Fans slated it as “grossly insensitive timing”. Irwin’s widow Terri said she was “devastated by Steve being mocked in such a cruel way”, worrying that their children could one day see it.13. The ‘kick a ginger’ craze (2005)View image in fullscreenGinger Kids, 2005.Photograph: Comedy CentralHitler allegory Ginger Kids sees Cartman wage war on red-haired people. When Kyle tricks him into thinking he’s caught “gingervitis”, Cartman switches sides and rallies them to rise up as a master race. Cue real-life controversy when the storyline inspired the infamous “National Kick a Ginger Day” meme. Actual violent attacks included one treated as a hate crime in Canada and bullying at a Rotherham school. Copper-topped troubadour Ed Sheeran joked that the episode “ruined my life”.12. Isaac Hayes’s resurrection (2006)View image in fullscreenIsaac Hayes in The Return of Chef, 2006.Photograph: Comedy CentralSoul legend Isaac Hayes voiced Chef for nearly a decade, serving up home-spun wisdom and crooning about chocolate salty balls. Following the Trapped in the Closet episode (more of which shortly), the Scientologist singer resigned in protest. In retaliation, the next season sees Chef return to South Park after travelling the world with the cult-like “Super Adventure Club”, which brainwashes members into child abuse. Chef’s dialogue was spliced from old episodes, hence the uneasy spectacle of Hayes singing about “making love” to the kids, before soiling himself. Poignantly, Hayes’s sonlater claimedthat his entourage made the decision to quit on Hayes’s behalf, with the man himself unable to speak after a stroke.11. Holy inappropriate (2005)Religion is one of the show’s regular targets, and the Bloody Mary episode was particularly inflammatory. When a statue of the Virgin Mary begins “bleeding out its ass”, the pope dispatches a cardinal to decide if it qualifies as a miracle. Catholic campaign groups in the US, New Zealand and Australia declared it “disgusting”, demanded apologies and unsuccessfully lobbied for it never to be rerun.10. King of pop dethroned (2004)View image in fullscreenMichael Jackson in The Jeffersons, 2004.Photograph: Comedy CentralFive years before his death, Michael Jackson got the South Park treatment. When eccentric millionaire Mr Jefferson moves into a local mansion with a funfair in the garden, the kids investigate whether he is a child abuser or the victim of society’s prejudice against rich Black men. When caught sleeping in Stan’s bed, Jefferson pays off his parents to keep quiet. He dresses as Peter Pan, dangles his son over a balcony and at one point his surgery-addled face falls off. Subtle.9. Great brawl of China (2019)Having already rattled China’s cage with its depiction of the Dalai Lama and deliberate deployment of Asian stereotypes, the episode named Band in China proved the last straw. It took aim at Hollywood’s expansion into the lucrative Chinese market, despite the country’s strict censorship and repressive political regime. Mickey Mouse’s presence made it clear that Disney was one target. In response, the Chinese government banned the show entirely – scrubbing it from streaming and social media platforms – which only proved Parker and Stone’s point. The unrepentant pair issued asarcastic apology, comparing President Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh and saying: “We too love money more than freedom and democracy … We good now, China?”8. Green around the gills (2006)View image in fullscreenAl Gore gets an apology in the episode Time to Get Cereal, 2018.Photograph: Comedy CentralSouth Park has repeatedly mocked the concept of climate change. Its denialism peaked with ManBearPig, in which Al Gore lectures children about a mysterious new environmental threat: a cryptid described as “half man, half bear, half pig”. The show was slammed as “irresponsible” for equating eco-warnings with scares about mythical monsters. Twelve years later, it reverse-ferreted by having the boys realise that ManBearPig actually did exist and grudgingly apologise to Gore. “Time to get cereal”, indeed.7. Toilet humour (2001)The fifth season opened with the profanity-packed It Hits the Fan. When a character says “shit” on a TV cop drama called, well, Cop Drama, it normalises the swearword. This brings on a plague that makes citizens vomit up their intestines, while awakening the ancient Knights of Standards and Practices. The episode parodied CBS medical soap Chicago Hope, which broke ground two years before by having actor Mark Harmon say “shit” for the first time on network TV. South Park went way further, dropping the s-bomb 162 times, averaging once every eight seconds – handily totted up by an onscreen counter. Comedy Central received 5,000 complaints.6. If you tolerate this … (2002)View image in fullscreenThe Death Camp of Tolerance, 2002.Photograph: Comedy CentralMany rate The Death Camp of Tolerance as one of the all-time great episodes. In a typically outrageous storyline, teacher Mr Garrison tries to get himself sacked for being gay so he can launch a $25m anti-discrimination lawsuit. When he inserts Lemmiwinks the class gerbil somewhere intimate, pupils protest. Paranoid they are homophobic, parents send them to Tolerance Camp, where Nazi-esque guards force them to draw pictures of “people of all colours and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow”. Lemmiwinks’s journey through Mr Slave’s rectum became a Hobbit spoof. You shall not pass.5. Slur causes a stir (2007)Inspired by Seinfeld star Michael “Kramer” Richards’s offensive outburst the previous year, With Apologies to Jesse Jackson satirises both racism and meaningless mea culpas which fail to address the underlying issues. When Stan’s father Randy uses the N-word on Wheel of Fortune, a national scandal erupts. Seeking forgiveness, Randy kisses the backside of Rev Jesse Jackson, AKA “the Emperor of Black People”. The uncensored epithet is uttered 42 times. Black communities and civil rights organisations praised this nuanced take on hate speech.4. Too cruel for school (2018)Season 22 begins with gunfire ringing out at South Park Elementary. Yet the staff and students calmly carry on as if school massacres are an everyday event – because in the US they are. As metal detectors are installed and hall monitors armed with rifles, authorities still fail to address the root cause. It aired soon after similar shootings in Parkland and Santa Fe claimed 27 lives. As a takedown of desensitisation to gun violence, the daringly dark Dead Kids was incendiary stuff.3. In bed with Satan (2025)View image in fullscreenSermon on the Mount, 2025.Photograph: Comedy CentralThis summer’s season premiere came out swinging with Sermon on the Mount, satirising Trump’s attacks on free speech by having the president sue the entire town of South Park. Biting the hand that feeds, it also lampooned Paramount’s capitulation to him. He is painted as a predatory tyrant, overcompensating for his micropenis. He hops into bed with Satan, who lambasts Trump about the Epstein files. It sparked a Maga-hatted backlash, while the furious White House said the show “hadn’t been relevant for 20 years”. Itdoubled downa week later with savage anti-deportation episodeGot a Nut, telling conservative critics to “#eatabagofdicks”.2. Hubbard in the cupboard (2005)View image in fullscreenTrapped in the Closet, 2005.Photograph: Comedy CentralSouth Park’s most notorious instalment, Trapped in the Closet, uses the ludicrous R Kelly opus to take aim at A-list Thetans Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Scientology is skewered as “a big fat global scam”, and it animates in unsparing detail the alien lore at the heart of L Ron Hubbard’s religion – accompanied by the onscreen caption “THIS IS WHAT SCIENTOLOGISTS ACTUALLY BELIEVE”. Because the church is so litigious, everyone who worked on the episode is credited as John or Jane Smith. Conspiracy theories abounded that transmission was delayed at Cruise’s behest to avoid overshadowing Mission: Impossible III (also produced by South Park’s parent company Paramount). What’s beyond dispute is that Parker and Stone threatened to quit if it wasn’t aired. Hail Xenu!1. Prophet and loss (2006)View image in fullscreenThe episode 200, 2010.Photograph: Comedy CentralPotshots at Mormonism and Catholicism caused a kerfuffle but were a storm in a teacup compared to Cartoon Wars. With Islamist extremists increasingly angered by satirical depictions of the prophet Muhammad, South Park weighed in. When citizens hear that rival series Family Guy is breaking the taboo, they literally buried their heads in the sand to avoid seeing it. The boys embark on a mission to get the episode pulled – Kyle because he fears terrorist reprisals, Cartman because he just hates Family Guy. Paramount censored the scenes anyway, covering them with a black title card, citing concerns for public safety. Parker and Stone condemned the move as hypocritical. When they revisited the topic in 2010, mentions of Muhammad were bleeped out, as was Kyle’s closing speech about the perils of giving in to violent threats. A radical Muslim blogger still wrote that he prayed for Allah to kill the show’s creators and “burn them in Hell for all eternity”. The Simpsons’ next chalkboard gag saw Bart write: “South Park, We’d Stand Beside You If We Weren’t So Scared”. The episodes remain banned on streaming services to this day.South Park streams on Paramount+ onWednesdays in the US andThursdaysin the UK.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionAnimation on TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And I don’t just mean to fry things. I use it to steam, simmer, roast, toast, grill and bake things, too.

Ceramic has often been held up as thebest non-toxic alternative to problematic non-stickand to be sure, when new, these coatings are quite superbly non-stick. However, manufacturers’ claims that increasingly popular “quasi-ceramic” coatings are “non-toxic” are coming underscrutiny in the US. With that in mind, if sustainability and avoiding toxicity are top priorities for you, it may in fact be best to rethink how much you need non-stick.At a glanceBest frying pan overall:Netherton spun iron chef’s pan£88.60 at Netherton FoundryBest budget frying pan:GreenPan Essence28cm, £45 at Green PanBest ceramic frying pan:ProCook Elite Tri-Ply ceramic-coated frying pan£60 at ProCookBest luxury frying pan:Le Creuset 3-ply stainless steel uncoated frying pan£149 at Le CreusetBest cast-iron frying pan:Le Creuset cast-iron round skillet£99 at Le CreusetWhy you should trust meI’ve researched, written and recipe tested – and eaten – for the Guardian’s food desks for more than a decade. I’m also a compulsive home cook and baker, and routinely feed large groups of people using whatever cookware – and whichever ingredients – I have to hand. In other words, I’m not fussy or precious, and I can make anything work.At home, I have a kitchen the size of a postage stamp (imagine what fun it’s been having 12 extra frying pans for several months), so I don’t have the space, let alone the money, for anything unnecessary or trendy. About 90% of my kitchenware is thrifted, so when I do buy something new, I want it to be simple, well made and long-lasting: in sum, worth every penny.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach of the 12 pans was used at least five times for various dishes.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI gathered 12 of the most highly recommended and popular frying pans,then used each one at least five times, making the kinds of things I usually make in my Le Creuset: a batch of pancakes; a salted caramel; scrambled egg; slices of tofu floured and fried in oil; and some bacon or pork marinated in a sticky marinade. After this, I narrowed my selection down to the four best and carried on using them for daily cooking.After testing, I can now safely say my go-to Le Creuset, which weighs 2.4kg, is one of the heaviest around. Doing this test was like wearing trainers after a decade of only Dr Martens; I’ve felt gravity-defiant, newly untethered, as if cooking a foot off the floor. This unburdened feeling is something any new kitchen tool should make you feel, but it’s not easy to get such a purchase right, particularly in the age of small kitchens, tight budgets and forever chemicals.The frying pans sourced for this article are either being sent back to the manufacturers or donated toLuminary Bakery, a social enterprise in north London.

They’re not just PTFE- and PFOA-free: they contain no such chemicals at all.Specialists will tell you the performance of iron cookware only improves over time, but I found this pan (handmade in Shropshire) to be excellent from the word go. Its heat distribution is beautifully even, it’s more non-stick than the other spun-iron pans I tried, and it’s low maintenance – you can use metal implements without worrying about the coating cracking or scratching.Why we love itIn terms of sustainability, Netherton is transparent about the provenance and composition of its materials and its fabrication processes. These pans are made from 99.1% spun black iron, pre-seasoned with edible flax oil. In other words, while research is constantly finding new chemicals to be wary of, there simply isn’t any coating to worry about here. While the exact composition of the metals used in the world’s bigger iron foundries is often hard to ascertain, Netherton can be clear and precise.I had heard that wrought iron wouldn’t be optimal for the first few uses, but right from the start, nothing stuck too much to this pan. I didn’t feel nervous about scraping, scratching or in any way harming the surface. I could simply get on with making food.There’s no maximum temperature. The pan is suitable for all hobs as well as open fires and range stoves. You can buy anoven-safe variantor opt for the version with a wooden handle for greater comfort.Pans in the chef’s pan range have deep sides and a gently curved profile, whilethe frying pan rangehas sloping sides and an angular profile. I tried one of each, and both were easy to get food in and out of. At 1.45kg this pan is considerably lighter than cast iron.Cleaning it was easy, too – warm water and a bristle brush quickly did the trick. I then dried and heated the pan on the stove to ensure it was humidity free.Netherton gives customers extensive aftercare instructions, not just on daily care but also on how to re-season the pans at home with flax oil. I’ve done this with an old pan and it really works (it was the most excited I’d been in the kitchen since I learned how to perfect a Swiss meringue). Finally, the foundry will, for a fee, take a look at any old pan you’ve bought from them and restore it.It’s a shame that …you can get the pan with wooden handles, for greater ergonomic use, but those accessories are not oven-proof.Sizes available:18cm,23cm,28cmLid available:various sizes from £32.80Oven safe:yes (the versions without the wooden handles)Dishwasher safe:no, handwash onlySuitable for induction:yesGuarantee: two years, against faulty materials or poor workmanship, from date of purchase, provided the product has had only domestic use and care instructions have been followedBest budget frying pan:GreenPan EssenceView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian28cm, £45 at GreenPan24cm, £39.99 at LakelandThis pan obviously stands out for its affordability. It can go in the dishwasher and the oven, but only to 160C – that’s very low, which gives me pause. The screwed-on handle appears to be made from a phenolic stay-cool material.Inside, it’s coated with a Pfas-free Thermolon ceramic non-stick coating, “enhanced with diamond”, according to the blurb. I don’t understand what that means, but it is pleasingly non-stick, with good heat distribution.Made from forged aluminium (the blurb specifies that the vessel contains at least 65% recycled aluminium), the 30cm version I tested weighs just over 1kg;the 26cmwill be lighter. This makes it easy to wield, but it also feels a little cheap.It’s a shame that …despite washing thoroughly beforehand, this had such a strong smell when I first heated it up that I had to bin three pancakes. This happened with the other GreenPan pan I tested too. Combined with the cheap feel, that made me hesitant about the pan’s overall material composition – and its longevity.Sizes available:20cm,24cm,26cm,28cmLid available:noOven safe:to 160CDishwasher safe:yesSuitable for induction:yesGuarantee:24 months against manufacturing and material defects, if the appliance is used according to care instructions onlyBest ceramic frying pan:ProCook Elite Tri-Ply ceramic-coated frying panView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian£60 at ProCookA light but reassuringly sturdy affair, this pan stands out thanks to its pleasing build quality and relatively affordable price.Why we love itIf ceramic-coated is the way you want to go, this feels like the most robust option, without the price being exorbitant. It’s a heavy-based pan composed of a stainless steel exterior and thick aluminium core; its handle is one of the most comfortable to hold, with a lovely satin finish and a nice, rounded design.Crucially, the Pfas-free ceramic coating inside feels highly durable. Indeed, while nylon, silicone or wooden utensils are recommended, the instructions state that you can also use metal utensils. As with all ceramic coatings, ProCook adds the caveat that the “cookware will naturally lose its non-stick release over time, accelerated through high-temperature cooking, metal utensil use and dish washing” – in other words, through normal use.That said, this was the only ceramic pan that didn’t have any tiny nicks in the coating after three weeks of constant use. Cooking and cleaning were all so easy; nothing stuck at all. So if I were going to spend money on a ceramic-coated pan, this is definitely the one I’d go for.It’s a shame that …contrary to other ceramic pans that have stainless-steel rims, this one is coated with ceramic right to the edge of the rounded, rolled pan rim. The lid you can get for it, meanwhile, is rimmed with stainless steel, so I wonder about the wear and tear that using both together would result in over time.Sizes available:22cm,26cm,30cmLid available:various sizes of Elite lids from £10Oven safe:to 260CDishwasher safe:yesSuitable for induction:yesGuarantee:25 years, with the following caveat: “‘Wear and tear’ and commercial use are not covered under this guarantee.

I tested the 24cm pan, which weighs just over 1kg and features no coating at all: just a three-ply composition of two layers of stainless steel and an aluminium core.Why we love itI found this pan so lightweight and easy to wield. The handle is solid and comfortable, and the whole pan feels reliable. I could move it around the hob and work surface easily, yet didn’t fear for its integrity at any point.It can go in the oven to 260C as well as the dishwasher and the freezer. It can also withstand pre-heating over medium heat without anything in it (if you want to sear meat, for instance), although it doesn’t like salt directly on the surface; instructions specify to add salt to the cooking liquor instead.You can use metal utensils, but with care: I found the surface quickly accrued marks from simply being used and moved around or hung up in the kitchen. However, these don’t signify any worrisome damage: the cooking surface remained beautifully smooth, and there’s nothing to chip or scratch off because there’s no coating.It’s suitable for all hobs and distributes the heat evenly. The surface isn’t non-stick in the eerie way new ceramic is, but neither egg nor burned marinade stuck in my tests. It’s a doddle to clean.It’s a shame that …it’s so expensive, despite being one of the smaller pans. Its durable nature makes it a sound investment if you can fork out the initial cost.Sizes available:20cmand24cmLid available:various sizes from £22Oven safe:up to 260CDishwasher safe:yesSuitable for induction:yesGuarantee:lifetime, against “faulty workmanship and/or materials when the product is used in normal, domestic conditions and in accordance with the care and use instructions provided.

And unlike the brand’s other ranges, these are still made in France using hundred-year-old sand-casting processes. I’ve used my 26cm pan for years, and it’s an absolute workhorse. Looked after properly, it really will last for ever.Why we love itIt’s a classic. This skillet is enamelled inside and out – and comes in the kinds of colours Le Creuset has flooded posh kitchens with for decades: a Nectar yellow that is brighter and more mustard than Marilyn Monroe’s favourite Elysée; three shades of blue (Nuit, Deep Teal and Azure) that riff on Elizabeth David’s favourite Gauloise blue; the OG lava orange. But looks aren’t all it’s got.Cast iron is a joy to cook with. Thicker than wrought iron by default, it takes longer to heat, but it also retains the heat well, which makes it slower to cool down. Once heated up, you can turn the gauge right down for a slow simmer or braise. I love using mine to steam veg or slowly scramble eggs, toast sandwiches or fry sausages – I’ve never come across a dish I couldn’t use it for.The cooking surface becomes more non-stick with time, as the patina builds up, so it’s best not to use much soap when washing – hot water is all you need. Enamel, of course, can chip. However, mine has come through a decade of heavy daily use with metal implements almost entirely unscathed: it feels like the best £100 I’ve spent in the kitchen.It’s a shame that …it’s so heavy: this isn’t a good choice if you have weakened wrists.Sizes available:16cm,20cm,23cm,26cmLid available:various sizes from £22Oven safe:260CDishwasher safe:yesSuitable for induction:yesGuarantee:lifetime, against faulty workmanship and/or defective materials, so long as the item has been used according to care instructions, in domestic conditionsThe best of the restView image in fullscreen“You can make everything with it”: the Our Place Always Pan 2.0.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianOur Place Always Pan 2.0 with lidView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian£125 at Our Place£125 at AmazonBest for:an all-rounderIf I were buying my student godson a new thing for his kitchen, I’d be sorely tempted to get him one of these: you can make everything with it. It’s big and deep, though, so more of a saute or casserole pan than a pancake fryer.I tested the standard size. It has a snug, self-basting lid, and comes with a wooden spatula (which I didn’t need) and a nesting steamer basket, which I really loved. I achieved nice, crispy-edged fried eggs, and making fried rice didn’t leave the crust that it usually does on my cast-iron pan. Even after cooking pork, I could basically just wipe the pan clean.It’s a lightweight pan, too, at 1.3kg (without the lid). It’s made from recycled aluminium, painted on the outside and coated with a quasi-ceramic layer on the inside. The manufacturer states that the pans are made “without Pfas (including PTFEs and PFOAs), lead and cadmium”.It didn’t make the final cut because …I’m not convinced its beautifully non-stick surface will last as long as anything costing this much should. By week three of regular use, there were tiny scratches in the paint on the rim of the lid and of the pan.The maximum oven temperature of 230C is relatively low. And the care instructions specify not to use metal utensils, to avoid anything abrasive and to only use low to medium heat. In my experience with coated cookware, it’s not just scratches that cause problems but prolonged, repeated exposure to high temperatures.Sizes available:mini (21.6cm);standard (26.7cm);large (31.8cm);lid available:lid included;oven safe:to 230C;dishwasher safe:no, handwash only;suitable for induction:yes;guarantee:three years, against defects in material or construction, when used as instructedJoseph Joseph Space folding handle ceramic non-stick frying panView image in fullscreen£59.50 at Joseph Joseph£84.99 at LakelandBestfor:a small kitchenThis Joseph Joseph pan isgreat for simple cooking in a kitchen where space is at a premium. Being able to fold the handle is a great storage solution.Inside, the pan is coated with non-toxic, non-stick ceramic, free from PTFE, Pfas, PFOA, lead and cadmium. The overall design is elegant. And, while it’s shallow and aluminium, it has a pleasingly solid heft to it; it didn’t feel cheap. It was easy to cook with and easy to clean.It didn’t make the final cut because …I tried the 20cm version, which I found unbalanced on the metal support grid of a gas hob: the folding handle was heavier than the shallow pan itself. However, on the solid flat surface of an electric or induction hob, it was fine. And the bigger the pan, the more balanced it is likely to be.Sizes available:20cm,24cm,28cm,30cm;lid available:no, other than the 28cm, which comes with a lid;oven safe:to 232C;dishwasher safe:“dishwasher safe but hand washing recommended to prolong performance”;suitable for induction:yes;guarantee:24 months against manufacturing and material defects, if the appliance is used according to care instructions onlySolidteknics iron skilletView image in fullscreen£110 at Solidteknics£110 at Big Green EggBest for:outdoor cookingThis is truly a pan made for life. Made from a single sheet of iron, handle and all, there are no trivets or other attachments to come loose – and I love that the hole for hanging it up is a cutout of the map of Australia.As with other wrought-iron pans, it felt solid and durable. I could fry up everything with no fear of damaging the surface in any way. The metal has a pleasing matt feel to it, too.Conversely, it’s pretty heavy (I tested the 26cm version), and the handle is long. This is obviously a good thing when cooking over fire, but I tested two different sizes, and even the smaller one was hefty.As with all cast and wrought iron, you also need to ensure it’s completely dry before storing.It didn’t make the final cut because …the natural rice bran oil pre-seasoning isn’t great. Even after testing all five dishes, I had to scrub the pan clean. This will take a good amount of regular use to build up a better patina, so that things don’t stick.Sizes available:18cm;20cm;24cm;26cm;30cm;lid available:no;oven safe:yes;dishwasher safe:no, handwash only;suitable for induction:yes;guarantee:Multi-century warranty, built to last and be passed downWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘Let your pan cool before washing; cold water on a hot pan will cause even solid iron to buckle.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianWhat to look for in a frying panThis is largely determined by how you tend to cook and what kind of storage you have in your kitchen. If you have plenty of space, you might want different pans for different uses – and you’ll find them. But if, like me, you’re as short on space as you are on mental bandwidth, you probably want an all-rounder.Think carefully about your needs – and also, your funds. Quality cookware isn’t cheap; even my favourite budget pick costs upwards of £45 (from its manufacturer), which is high for my liking. But if we all buy cheap pans that need replacing every 18 months, the sheer tonnage of discarded pans would surely be enough to rival the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. As such, it’s important to see this as an investment.Make sure you’re buying something that won’t require a care regime unsuited to your daily habits. Will you be able to deal with a high-maintenance ceramic pan that can be easily damaged by metal utensils, stacking or overly hot ovens, or do you need an indestructible iron skillet? Can you hang it from a rack, or do you need to stack it with others – and if the latter, will you be bothered to use pan protectors? If neither works for you, Joseph Joseph’s folding-handle pans might well be the only option.Then consider what your priorities are. I’ve focused on Pfas-free pans her. However, within that range, there are multifunctional ones (for frazzled cooks who want one go-to pan), instantly non-stick ones (for easy cleaning), light ones (for gentle handling), heavy-duty ones (for energetic cooks) and endlessly repairable ones (for waste-averse cooks).One final thing to note: read the small print on the warranty before making a purchase. Some of the pans in this list have major caveats in their guarantees, such as shorter warranties for the coating of the pan and stringent requirements on correct usage.What are forever chemicals?Pfas, AKA per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, is an umbrella term for a large group of chemicals favoured in the production of cookware and other domestic products for their robust, non-stick properties. They’re called forever chemicals because they do not degrade but instead accumulate in the natural environment, including within our bodies. Some, though not all, now have another qualifier: PBT, short for “persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic”.Read aboutthe impact of these chemicalsand you quickly realise that research is still in its infancy. Manufacturers have been using them for decades, but our understanding of what they all do, and what to do about them, appears patchy at best.How to look after your panI would recommend paying careful attention to your pan’s care and usage instructions. But as a good rule of thumb, always warm up your pan slowly, and unless it’s cast or wrought iron, always add oil or another liquid rather than heating it on empty.Make sure to use it on an appropriately sized burner or ring, particularly when using gas. Not all materials have the same heat conductivity, so marrying the ring to the size of your pan will be more efficient.Also, be mindful of any maximum temperatures specified. Hobs, of course, are not like ovens: many simply have “low” to “high” settings, or, at best, numbers, but quite what temperatures these actually correspond to is surprisingly difficult to find out. For something like a tin-lined copper pan, this matters because tin has a low melting point of 210C.Of course, a copper pan is one for professionals – you really need to know what you’re doing, and be able to afford the eye-watering costs. But understanding temperatures is just as important for pans with coatings. All have an upper heat limit, above which the materials used will begin to denature and the pan will be spoiled. So be careful to pay attention to the recommended heat limits on the hob. The same goes for domestic ovens, which often allow temperatures as high as 280C-300C. Beware your oven-safe pan’s upper limit: some can’t withstand anything above 160C.Sudden temperature changes are also a big no-no. Let your pan cool before washing; cold water on a hot pan will cause even solid iron to buckle.Anything with a coating usually has instructions specifying that it shouldn’t be used with metal utensils, harsh scourers and abrasive cleaners. And actually, with care, the latter aren’t necessary anyway. Some, but not all, of the pans here are dishwasher-safe, but none of the best pans were ever difficult to clean, even of sticky burnt meat.Several brands unhelpfully say the pan is dishwasher-safe, but that hand-washing is recommended to ensure the pan’s longevity. I’ve taken that to mean that, really, you shouldn’t use the dishwasher at all. Where a pan is all metal, be sure to dry it thoroughly, heating it on the hob gently to get rid of all moisture, then hanging it from a rack to store. Never put a pan away wet.Dale Berning Sawa is ajournalist focusing on arts and culture and food.

David Lammy moved to the justice department and will also become deputy prime minister.Mahmood, who has impressed across Westminster for her political skills and policy grip to the extent she is now regularly tipped as a future Labour leader, will now play a significant role in the government’s survival as she battles to get a grip of small boats and asylum hotels.The hand of Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister’s chief of staff, was seen across the reshuffle. Labour figures suggested it was a further move to the right. With the departure of Rayner, Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, becomes one of the few cabinet members on the party’s soft left still in post.Pat McFadden, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, is to take over Rayner’s housing and communities brief as part of a revamped, growth-based department also taking in the skills remit formerly held by the Department for Education.In what was largely a shuffling round of jobs between existing ministers, Liz Kendall, who was the work and pensions secretary, has taken over as science and technology secretary from Peter Kyle, who becomes trade secretary. He replaces Jonathan Reynolds, who becomes chief whip.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ian Murray, removed as Scottish secretary, also left government. He was replaced by Douglas Alexander, who served as a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.As the prime minister began reshaping his cabinet team, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, was confirmed as staying in place early on, as Downing Street sought to reassure the markets that the economy was in safe hands.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, John Healey, the defence secretary, and Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, were among the few ministers to stay in their posts.Rayner had referred herself to the ethics adviser after confirming she would have to pay more stamp duty because she had incorrectly paid the lower rate on the flat in Hove.She had classified the flat as her only property despite spending much of her time with her children at the family house in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.Months before the Hove purchase, she had put her stake in the Ashton house into a trust set up in 2020 to manage a payment to one of her sons, who after a “deeply personal and distressing incident” as a premature baby had been left with lifelong disabilities.Because her son is the beneficiary of that trust and is under 18, Rayner was still counted as having a financial interest in it for tax purposes.However, when she bought the Hove flat, she declared she did not have an interest in any other property, allowing her to pay the lower stamp-duty rate of about £30,000. The higher rate would have been an estimated £70,000.Though she claimed to have received written tax advice before completing her purchase, saying she was entitled to pay the lower amount, Rayner’s conveyancersaid on Thursdayshe had not provided any such advice.Explore more on these topicsLabourAngela RaynerKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

His remarks, after all, followed a difficult summer during which Labour vacated the pitch to Reform UK and ahead of what is likely to be aneven more turbulent autumn.With Starmer desperately needing to show he could get a grip on government, the rest of his big reset week could not have gone more badly. The departure ofAngela Rayneras his deputy is the most serious blow yet for the already beleaguered prime minister.Angela Rayner resigns – Today in Focus ExtraRead moreIn interviews, Rayner often described Starmer as “the yin to my yang”, explaining how the odd couple of British politics may not have run on a joint ticket for leader and deputy, but they were so complementary they might as well have done.She was everything that Starmer is not. Politically intuitive. A powerful communicator. An authentic working-class voice. Savage Reform attack dog. Popular with MPs, members and unions. Party fixer. Despite a sometimes bumpy relationship, Rayner’s absence will be keenly felt.Nobody in Labour – including Rayner herself – felt there was any other option for her than to go. Even had she not beenfound to have breached the ministerial code, it was untenable that a housing secretary who had failed to pay the right amount of stamp duty could stay in post.Starmer has always been clear there would be no special treatment. “People will only believe we’re changing politics when I fire someone on the spot. If a minister – any minister – makes a serious breach of the rules, they will be out. It doesn’t matter who it is, they will be sacked,” he told his biographer Tom Baldwin before the election.Rayner is the fifth and by far the most senior minister to beforced out of officeas a result of wrongdoing since Starmer came to power. She was also the most vocal critic of the Conservatives during their many scandals. “One rule for them, one for everybody else,” she used to cry. Now that refrain is being redirected towards her.While Labour’s attempts to prove itself more ethical than the previous administration have already been bruised by controversies including over freebies, perhaps the most serious impact of this latest row is that it will reinforce the corrosive view held by many people that all politicians are in it for themselves.Her departure also creates an even greater political headache for Rachel Reeves as she plans her autumn budget. With the Treasury struggling to find up to £40bn to balance the books, the option of imposing a new property tax on more expensive homes, or any wider change to property taxes, becomes a harder sell.With Labour’s general secretary confirming there will be an election to replace Rayner as deputy leader of the party, the prime minister’s attempt to reset his government will be overshadowed by the internal drama of the race.Worse than that for Starmer, the membership is likely to pick somebody on the left of the party who promises to push him to stick to Labour values, and who could then potentially cause divides among MPs, encouraging rebellions.Nor is there any guarantee Rayner will go quietly. Even in office, she always found a way of letting it be known when she thought Starmer should go further – including on welfare and wealth taxes. Unencumbered by the restrictions of office, she may not hold back.Whether she creates an alternate power base on the backbenches – a red queen across the water – depends in part on how secure she thinks the prime minister is, and if she believes he will stay in post until the next election, or if she could get a shot at the top job.Leaving office having broken the ministerial code but with the ethics watchdog saying she had “acted with integrity and with a dedicated and exemplary commitment to public service”, potentially leaves the door open for a comeback, and she remains a powerful figure within Labour.Nevertheless the controversy is deeply damaging for Labour, which is lagging behind Reform UK in the polls. At his conference in Birmingham,Nigel Farage could not hide his delightat the departure of his most dangerous opponent from the political frontline.By immediately bringing forward amajor cabinet reshuffle, orchestrated by his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, Starmer has sought to make the best out of a terrible situation. Westminster will be momentarily distracted by the changes to his top team, but it is Rayner’s exit the public will notice.The open speculation among his own backbenchers, many of them from the new intake of MPs, about whether he can last the course until the next election, will intensify. The budget and next spring’s local elections, when Scotland and Wales are up for grabs, become moments of intense peril.“Keir might want to focus on phase two of his plan to change the country,” says a veteran Labour figure. “At this rate, though, he’ll be lucky if he makes it to phase three.”Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerKeir StarmerLabourStamp dutyReform UKPropertyanalysisShareReuse this content"

His position is untenable. Rishi Sunak must dismiss him from his cabinet.”Her comments were similar in 2018, when Jeremy Huntreceived a discount when buying seven flatsfrom a Conservative donor. “Jeremy Hunt avoids £100,000 stamp duty by exploiting Tory tax loophole & buying flats in bulk,” she posted on X.Rayner’s effectiveness as a campaigner, communicator and scourge of the Tories made her an invaluable asset to Keir Starmer, but it also left her particularly vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy as her own tax scandal unfolded this week.So when Laurie Magnus found on Fridayshe had breached the ministerial code, the deputy prime minister felt she had little option but to follow the advice she often gave to Conservatives, and resign.“I accept that I did not meet the highest standards in relation to my recent property purchase,” she wrote in her resignation letter.Starmer and his deputy have always been an odd political couple.Both had difficult upbringings: Starmer was the child of an ill mother and an emotionally detached father, while Rayner was the daughter of a mother with chronic depression andhad her first child aged 16.But whereas Starmer responded to hardship by developing a tough exterior and immersing himself in his work, Rayner became a gregarious and energetic trade union representative, whose emotional openness is a key part of her political success.View image in fullscreenRayner at a protest with RMT union members outside parliament in London in 2022, after the sacking of hundreds of British P&O Ferries staff.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAAnd while Starmer is known for his sober style, both in clothing and behaviour, Rayner cuts a more colourful figure, with her bright power suits and willingness to be pictured with a glass of wine in hand.The two were forced together by the vagaries of theLabourparty constitution, elected on the same day but in separate ballots as leader and deputy leader.While both came from the party’s soft left, Rayner was always seen as more authentically of the left, in part because of her trade union background. Their relationship was also made awkward by the fact Rayner shared a flat with Starmer’s defeated leadership rival Rebecca Long-Bailey.“Theirs was an arranged marriage; they have both admitted they are an odd couple,” said Luke Sullivan, Starmer’s former political director. “But they also both see and value each other’s strengths.”Whatever the mutual respect, it was badly damaged in 2021, when Starmer attempted to demote his deputy in a shadow cabinet reshuffle after a disastrous byelection loss in Hartlepool.Rayner called his bluff, pointing out that she would retain power as elected deputy leader of the party – a title he has never been able to take from her. She emerged from that struggle with a beefed-up role shadowing Michael Gove as shadow minister without portfolio.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Angela Rayner in May 2025.Photograph: Chris Jackson/APThat tussle proved a turning point in the relationship between the pair. Having proved her political smarts, Rayner went on to win over the Labour leader with her ability to communicate with ordinary voters, as well as to smooth relations with upset members of the parliamentary party.As the election neared, her northern working-class roots and plain speaking proved a boon with the kind of “red wall” voters Starmer was desperate to win back from the Conservatives.“I love general election campaigns,” shetold the Guardianat the time. “Parliament is school to me, that’s where you need to do your revision and your homework, whereas being on the road for me is like playtime.”Once Labour was in power, Rayner proved she had another political skill – as a deft legislator. Even though she was put in charge of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, she kept responsibility for her personal project of improving workers’ rights.In what is likely to prove a bittersweet moment for the departing cabinet minister, herworkers’ rights billis due to pass its final stage in just over a week.She also managed tosecure nearly £40bnfor social housing over the next 10 years from the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as part of a spending review that left several other minister disappointed.View image in fullscreenStarmer and Rayner visiting a construction site in Cambridgeshire in December.Photograph: Getty ImagesMeanwhile her importance to Starmer as his representative to his own backbenchers was proved in July, when sheled negotiations with rebelsover the welfare reform bill. In the end Starmer allowed her to reach an agreement that the bill should be gutted of its main proposal without even Reeves able to stand in the way.As the row about her stamp duty arrangements broke over the past two weeks, Starmer went out of his way to defend his deputy.She sat beside him at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, during which he declared: “I am very proud to sit alongside a deputy prime minister who is building 1.5m homes, who is bringing the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights for a generation, and has come from a working-class background to be deputy prime minister.”Some in No 10 worried, however, that the prospect of keeping a housing secretary in place even after she had been found to have underpaid her housing taxes was too much of a political liability. “It does not look great,” admitted one.Angela Rayner’s departure is an old-fashioned scalp for the rightwing pressRead moreBut they also knew the alternative was to relegate Rayner to the backbenches, where she was likely to become a voice for the disenchanted left of the party and a focal point for any future rebellions.In the end nothing but a full bill of clean health from the prime minister’s adviser on ministerial standards would have saved her career. Without that, her resignation on Friday seemed inevitable, leaving the prime minister without a deputy, without a housing secretary and without one of his stronger electoral assets.His sorrow in losing an unlikely but important ally was conveyed in his letter back to Rayner – written, unusually, by hand.“You have been a trusted colleague and a true friend for many years,” he wrote. “I have nothing but admiration for you and huge respect for your achievements in politics.”Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerLabourprofilesShareReuse this content"

It also represents an old-fashioned scalp for the press, elements of which have been poring over her finances and living arrangements for more than a year.The frustration among Rayner’s friends is that she had already survived waves of stories aimed at derailing her political career. However, they say her admission that she did not pay the correct stamp duty on the purchase of a Hove flat, which some see as a maddening own goal, gave her opponents a clear opening.The Telegraph was already claiming victory on Wednesday, reliving how it had exposed crucial details of theLabourdeputy leader’s tax arrangements on the flat purchase at the end of last week.It followed Rayner’s lengthy admission that an error had been made, which she said had comeafter incorrect advice. However, her statement also revealed complicated personal circumstances that included a court order, a divorce, shifting living arrangements and a trust set up to support her disabled son.View image in fullscreenRayner arriving at Labour conference in Liverpool last year with Keir Starmer.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesThe error was exposed after a previous attempt to draw attention to Rayner’s housing arrangements failed to dislodge her. The Mail on Sunday pursued Rayner last year with allegations she had avoided tax on the sale of a former home. After demands from Conservative MPs, the case was examined by Greater Manchester police, which cleared her of criminal wrongdoing. Soon after, HM Revenue and Customssaid she owed no tax.It was the Mail on Sunday that also first reported Rayner’s acquisition of the Hove flat, stating she had added it to her “burgeoning property empire”. The Telegraph’s crucial development came days later. Rayner says the Hove property is the only one she owns.By then, the Sun had nicknamed her “three pads Rayner”, echoing the press’s treatment of John Prescott, who – like Rayner – was a Labour deputy prime minister handed high office for his ability to keep a significant slice of the union movement onboard. Prescott waslabelled “two Jags”by the press after he used two Jaguar cars – one that he owned, the other a ministerial car.Coverage of the Rayner row has since spread well beyond the rightwing press. The extent of her admission was enough to lose her the support of some media figures who had been sympathetic. James O’Brien, an LBC radio host who describes himself as a liberal, had said she could no longer survive as housing secretary.In recent days, Rayner and those close to her have found themselves at the centre of a classic media feeding frenzy, with her partner’s work and associations also examined closely. More stories have appeared in the traditionally rightwing press: one questioned the valuation of her family home in Ashton-under-Lyne; another accused her of planning to find a safer seat, based on a claim by a Reform MP.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Mirror’s front page called it “crisis point” for Starmer’s deputy. It followed a statement from the conveyancing firm Rayner used to complete her purchase of the Brighton flat, stating it did not offer her tax advice.While Rayner is the most high-profile figure to depart under Starmer after media scrutiny of her private affairs, she is not the first. It is less than a month since Rushanara Ali, the homelessness minister for England,resigned after reportsshe evicted tenants from a property she owns then re-let it for £700 more a month.Despite the attention on Rayner, there has also been some sympathy for her in the pages of the Telegraph. Its tax columnist, the retired accountant Mike Warburton, said he, too, had been unaware of the rules Rayner had broken. “No, I am not going soft in the head and I do not want to get involved in the politics, but this is an example of one of my overriding themes: ourtax rules are far too complicated,” he wrote.“The fact is, the stamp duty rules are very complex and I have to admit that last week when I was asked about this I had not appreciated how the trust complicated matters. I can therefore understand that others can become confused. In my view we need a complete overhaul of our complex tax rules. Stamp duty would be a good place to start.”Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

You cannot come here illegally and stay: we will stop the boats within two weeks of winning government.”Keir Starmer and his predecessor, Rishi Sunak, have both struggled to stop dangerous crossings amid rising public anger on the right about the housing of those seeking asylum in hotels and charities calling for safe and legal routes for refugees.The Reform leader said he had brought forward his speech by three hours to address the fact that the government was in crisis. He walked on stage to rock music and fireworks, with a break in the middle of his speech for the former Tory cabinet minister Nadine Dorries to talk about her defection.She said the government was showing it could not manage the economy and that Labour was “fracturing and dividing into two”. Dorries added: “We are in deep trouble and you can’t look at either of the two main political parties up till now to save the country.”Farage and Dorries were preceded by the former Tory MP and new mayor of Greater Lincolnshire Andrea Jenkyns, who came on stage in a sequined blue jumpsuit bellowing out a pop song she wrote herself called Insomniac. She told the audience that they were like the “insomniacs” alert to the UK’s problems when the rest of the country was “sleepwalking” into decline.0:34Andrea Jenkyns performs self-written song Insomniac at Reform UK conference – videoReturning to the stage, Farage urged the audience to “make Britain great again” and spoke about a range of policies, in particular culture wars talking points – but did not mention the NHS, housing or transport.Farage praised thespread of St George’s cross and union flagsacross lamp-posts, which critics have said are inflaming tensions and making migrants feel unwelcome.The Reform leader said every flag placed in view was a way of “sticking two fingers up at the establishment” and saying “we have had enough”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Security also tried to prevent journalists from filming and taking pictures of their handling of the episode.One of the protesters had shouted at Farage that he was not a man of the people. As the woman was carried out, the Reform leader said: “Go easy, she’s clearly got some anger management issues.”Yusuf told a fringe event at the conference that recent Labour attacks on Farage for being “unpatriotic” were similar to the “Russia-gate controversy” in the US around claims that Trump was effectively an agent of the Kremlin.“I think those sorts of attacks are going to ramp up,” Yusuf said. “They have kind of realised they can’t beat us on the arguments. They have just given up on their ability to stop the boats.”Yusuf also said that Tommy Robinson “deserves some credit” for raising the issue of grooming gangs – although he was clear that he would never be allowed to join Reform.His tone was at odds with Farage’s, who has made clear his rejection of Robinson’s far-right activism and as a result fell out with US billionaire Elon Musk and two former senior Reform figures, Ben Habib and Howard Cox.A Labour party spokespersonrejected Farage’s criticisms, saying: “Nigel Farage could have used his conference speech to offer more than just anger without answers and to say more than just ‘don’t know’ to the problems facing the country. He didn’t. It was the same old parade of complaints we’ve heard before.“His answer to the charge that Reform is a one-man band was to unveil one of the faces of failure from the last Tory government, Nadine Dorries. Farage has proven again today that he is incapable of acting in the best interests of Britain.”Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKAngela RaynerLabourGeneral electionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The concern for government is that the evidence becomes a widely believed charge sheet against ministers as Israel resists all compromise in its fight against Hamas.Among the allegations made were that:RAF pilots flying from the UK Akrotiri airbase in Cyprus systematically shared intelligence in real time with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but not with the international criminal court.No 10 failed to provide the support requested by lawyers actingfor James Henderson, the British World Central Kitchen aid worker killed by the IDF on 1 April 2024, leaving them reliant on an IDF internal investigation, with a coroners’ inquiry still as long as two years away.Britain provided no support to the chief prosecutor at the international criminal court, Karim Khan, after the US government imposed sanctions that led a British bank to close his account, “so emboldening those who seek to dismantle international accountability”.The UK trade department continued to allow the import of products from Israel-occupied territories after the international court of justice in July 2024 ruled in an advisory opinion that the occupation was unlawful.Forz Khan, a lawyer acting for the family of Henderson, said: “The Henderson family want to know what the full picture is. He went out there in good faith, yet he was for some unknown reason murdered, picked off in a military fashion. An internal IDF investigation found that it was a mistake. Our case is that it was a deliberate murder.”Khan also claimed that when the Henderson family were finally given a meeting with ministers, their lawyers were prevented from attending.Henderson was killed when an Israeli airstrike targeted a clearly marked vehicle. The Israeli inquiry led to the dismissal of two officers. An inquiry by the IDF found a drone operator mistakenly targeted the convoy after thinking it had been taken over byHamasgunmen.Some of the most damaging evidence was given by Charlotte Andrews-Briscoe, a lawyer acting for the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq in the UK court challenge into the handling of arms exports controls toIsrael.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the UK government had examined 413 cases, and lawyers had found the only possible violation of international law involving World Central Kitchen.“That meant, 11 months into this deadly war, the UK government had not found a single incident that exclusively killed Palestinians and had been a possible violation of international law.”The Israeli government says it does not target children or civilians, but says its task is made harder by Hamas, which carried out the 7 October 2023 attacks and still holds Israeli hostages, embedding itself among the civilian population.Mark Smith, a diplomat whoquit his Foreign Office jobover the UK’s refusal to stop selling arms to Israel in August 2024, said civil servants who challenged the IDF’s methods were routinely pressed to tone down their findings “so it sounded less bad”.“Thousands of conversations within the walls of the Foreign Office on the most controversial aspects of our arms sales policy will never be seen by the public [and] never be put to a court because they were held in person,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGazaJeremy CorbynMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

But many European countries, including Germany, Spain and Italy, have refused to provide troop commitments.Even among those who are willing to deploy troops, initial suggestions earlier this year of a peacekeeping mission that could police a ceasefire line was quickly scaled back to a “reassurance force” that would be stationed far from the front and provide training rather than combat assistance.On Thursday, Macron announced that 26 nations had pledged to provide postwar security guarantees to Kyiv, which would include a land, sea and air presence. “The day the conflict stops, the security guarantees will be deployed,” Macron said, during a joint press conference withVolodymyr Zelenskyyat the Élysée Palace in Paris.Speaking in the western Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod on Friday, Zelenskyy suggested the plans would involve a significant western force stationed in the country. “It is important that we are discussing all this ... it will definitely be in the thousands, not just a few,” he said, after meeting the European Council president, António Costa.However, Putin knows that western countries are unwilling to go to war overUkraine, and his threats on Friday look designed to further spook European capitals on the escalatory dangers of committing troops.Trump has vacillated over what support the US may provide for such a mission. At a meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders the day before he met Putin in Alaska last month, he appeared to promise some kind of US involvement but many are still blurry on the details.On Friday, NBCreportedthat the US could be willing to take the lead monitoring a demilitarised buffer zone around the frontlines after a ceasefire, with ground troops possibly provided by non-Nato countries.But all such plans are highly hypothetical and rely on Moscow and Kyiv agreeing to a deal to end the war, which does not currently appear to be close. Trump has set a number of deadlines for progress to be made towards peace but all of them have passed with little result. After meeting Putin in Alaska, Trump said he hoped the Russian president and Zelenskyy would meet one on one, followed by a three-way meeting.Zelenskyy has long said he is willing to meet Putin, but the Kremlin has prevaricated and said the conditions are not yet there for a meeting. On Friday, Putin said it would be “practically impossible” to reach an agreement with Ukraine, rendering a meeting pointless, but claimed he was open to meeting anyway, as long as Zelenskyy travelled to Moscow. “I said: I’m ready, please, come, we will definitely provide working conditions and security, a 100% guarantee,’” he said.“We are ready for any kind of meetings. But we don’t feel that Putin is ready to end this war,” said Zelenskyy on Friday, without directly addressing whether he would be prepared to travel to Moscow.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaEuropeEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Some legal expertsquestionedwhether the strike was lawful under international law.The combination of aggressive military action and symbolic rebranding goes in contrast with Trump’s repeated claims to be “the anti-war president” who campaigned on promises to end conflicts and avoid new wars. Trump said during the signing of the order that his focus on strength and trade has improved America’s position in the world..Trump has argued the original name betterreflects military victoriesand honestly represents what the department does.

The man was arrested a little more than a fortnight later, but then released while officers investigated. Police said Sheryl Wilkins died in north London on 24 August. The same man, aged 40, was arrested over both deaths on Thursday.Detectives are investigating how the suspect and the two women might have known each other. One line of investigation is that the two women were sex workers. Police do not know if the women knew each other.DCI Neil John, who is leading the investigation, said: “My sympathy goes to the family and friends of both victims, who have been updated on this development and continue to be supported by specialist officers.“No woman should feel unsafe in our city, and we know this news will cause concern across communities. Our investigation is continuing at pace and remains a priority. I urge anyone who has information relating to either incident to contact us as soon as possible.”Police have not named the man who has been arrested. In March officers responded to reports of an unresponsive woman in a building in Aylesbury Estate in the Walworth area of south-east London.Emergency workers fought to save her but the 53-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene. She was identified as Trujillo.Officers launched an investigation after the cause of her death could not be determined during a postmortem examination. That led police to arrest the man on suspicion of murder 15 days later, on 1 April. “He was released under investigation while extensive inquiries continued,” officers said on Friday.On Sunday 24 August, the second woman was found unresponsive more than seven miles from the scene of Trujillo’s death, in High Road in Tottenham. The 39-year-old was identified as Wilkins and pronounced dead at the scene.Again, police launched an investigation when no cause of death could be determined during a postmortem. The man was arrested on 4 September on suspicion of murdering Wilkins, and rearrested on suspicion of murdering Trujillo. He remains in custody, police said on Friday.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

All of the offences took place at the home of a third girl whose father was friends with Alford.The former actor, who played Billy Ray in the ITV drama London’s Burning and Robbie Wright in the BBC children’s series Grange Hill, bought £250 worth of food, alcohol and cigarettes from a nearby petrol station in the early hours of the morning, including a bottle of vodka, which the victims subsequently drank.Alford then had sexual intercourse with the 14-year-old girl in the garden of the home and later in a downstairs toilet, and inappropriately touched the 15-year-old girl as she lay half asleep on the living room sofa.During the trial, jurors heard that, after being arrested, Alford told Hertfordshire police officers: “This stinks. This is a setup.”Alford told jurors of his previous convictions, which go back to 1999. They included convictions for the supply of drugs, disorderly behaviour, drink-driving, causing criminal damage and obstructing police. He claimed the conviction for the supply of drugs led to him being “blacklisted” as an actor.He said during the trial that he had “never touched either of them girls” and sobbed while giving evidence, telling jurors: “I haven’t done this. No DNA. I didn’t touch them. I think science proves me not guilty.”The 15-year-old girl Alford assaulted said: “We were all just like dozing off. That was when John started to touch me.” She said she felt “absolutely sick” after the assault.She said she immediately showered after being dropped off at the house of the other girl Alford assaulted, where the girls went into the bathroom together and “spoke about everything that happened”.She spoke out about the incidents while visiting a different friend’s home on 11 April. “I had a mental breakdown to my best mate’s mum in the garden and she called my mum,” she said.In a video of her police interview played to the court, the 14-year-old girl said she had never had sex before the night of the alleged incidents. “I told him to stop because I didn’t want to have sex with an old man,” she said.Recorder Caroline Overton granted Alford conditional bail before his sentencing at the same court on 4 December.She warned the defendant he had been convicted of “very serious matters” and should expect to receive a custodial sentence.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

I don’t believe anything he says. He is a born liar.”The court was told Linehan and Brooks had met for the first time in person outside the Battle of Ideas conference in Westminster on 19 October last year.Linehan told police he knocked a phone out of the hand of Brooks, who had been filming him, after being taunted about his divorce. The move was said by Linehan to have been a “reflex response” to a “provocative statement”.When asked if he had had any intention to incite any violent action, Linehan told Westminster magistrates court: “No, because the violence and toxicity in the trans debate comes entirely from the trans side. I intended to make sure that the next time he came to any similar event, people would know to expect trouble and people would be on their guard.”He added: “The nature of trans activism is that it is very male. It’s abusive, it’s sadistic. The police are basically working for trans activists these days. They don’t understand the issue and they believe everything trans activists say to them. A lot of institutions have been captured by trans ideology.”Linehan also accused the Guardian of having described him as “anti-trans” after he was first spoken to by police.He is on trial on one count of harassing Brooks on social media between 11 and 27 October last year and a further charge of criminal damage to a mobile phone on 19 October. He denies the charges.A prepared statement from Linehan, given during a police interview on 5 February with the acting DS Thomas Wells, was read to the court by the prosecution. The statement, in which Linehan referred to Brooks as Tarquin, read: “I was first approached by Tarquin when I arrived at the venue and I was subject to a form of harassment with Tarquin approaching me and filming me at close quarters.“This typically involved placing a phone immediately in front of someone’s face only a few inches away and filming them while trying to provoke a reaction. People often try to block the phone and Tarquin treats that as a game.“He had no respect at all for people’s privacy or personal space. I had to try to ignore Tarquin as much as possible but was then confronted by Tarquin again at the end of the conference. Tarquin made a provocative statement about my current family position. I am now divorced and this is a very sensitive subject for me, as he well knows.”Linehan added: “The taunting from Tarquin was completely unnecessary. In response I grabbed the phone and threw it to one side. I had had enough of the constant harassment from Tarquin and needed to stop him from taunting me any further. I did not intend to cause any damage and I do not know if it was damaged or not, it was a reflex response to provocative actions by Tarquin.“I accept I have referred to Tarquin in posts, but as a journalist, I believe exposing the tactics of vindictive and aggressive trans activists is in the public interest.”Asked how the Tarquin name came to be used, Brooks had told the court on the first day of the trial: “It is apparently to do with my poshness.”The court has heard from the prosecution that Linehan, who has no previous convictions, had “relentlessly” posted abusive and vindictive material on social media about Brooks, now 18.Linehan was arrested over separate matters when he landed at Heathrow airport on Monday on suspicion of inciting violence over three social media posts about transgender people. He was flying from Arizona to the UK to attend the Westminster magistrates court trial.The writer told the court on Friday that he had lived in the US state of Arizona for the past six months, having previously lived in Surrey Quays, south-east London, and Norwich.The case continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Met Office recommends people keen to see the phenomenon plan to be somewhere with as clear a view of the eastern horizon as possible, ready for the lunar eclipse to peak in the UK at 7.33pm. In built-up areas this may mean going to a hill or viewpoint.The eclipse – sometimes referred to as a “blood moon” – will be visible to the naked eye and unlike solar eclipses is safe to view directly as the moon’s reflected light is not as bright.Giant asteroid could crash into moon in 2032, firing debris towards EarthRead moreDr Ed Bloomer, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, said the moon will rise over the UK just in time for people to see the tail end of the eclipse. He said: “The moon is pretty unmistakable in the sky, so the most important thing is to face the right direction.“It’ll be rising towards the east, and head southwards over the course of the night. As it rises, the most important thing will be whatever is low on your horizon. A flat landscape, or an elevated position makes for the best visibility – so there aren’t things like buildings, trees, or other things in the way.“A lunar eclipse like this is a great opportunity for observing with kids too. It isn’t too late for us in the UK, the target is nice and easy, and minute by minute you will notice changes – good for short attention spans.”People eager to see the eclipse are advised to check the forecast in their area over the weekend, but the Met Office said the clearest skies for viewing the blood moon are most likely to be across the south-west and parts of eastern England.The Royal Observatory said the next partial lunar eclipse will be in August 2026. Other regions well positioned to view the eclipse include Australia, China, India, the Philippines and parts of Africa.But most of North and South America will miss out entirely as they will be on the sunlit side of the planet during the event.Throughout history, blood moons have stirred awe and superstition. Ancient cultures from Norse to South American, Native American to Chinese, interpreted the red moon as a sign of divine anger or supernatural conflict, while biblical texts warned that “the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the day of the Lord comes, that great and terrible day”.Explore more on these topicsThe moonSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

But as the war drags on, that support has sparked outrage in parts of the young and politically active population of the Pacific, and pockets of resistance are beginning to build.Among the most visible signs of support for Israel from Pacific nations is their consistent backing at the UN.Aresolution in Junethat called for an immediate ceasefire to the war was overwhelmingly approved, with 149 countries voting in favour of it. Of the 12 that voted against, seven – Fiji, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Tuvalu – were Pacific nations.According to pro-Israel website UN Watch, Micronesia is a more consistent supporter than even the US, having not cast a single vote against Israel in the past 10 years.#BREAKINGUN General Assembly ADOPTS resolution that demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in the war in#Gaza.In favor: 149Against: 12Abstain: 19pic.twitter.com/HSZhxsY8Ru— UN News (@UN_News_Centre)June 12, 2025In a further sign of support, Papua New Guinea is one of just six countries that has opened an embassy in Jerusalem, recognising it as Israel’s capital.Fijihas also committed to opening an embassy in Jerusalem, with prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka set to travel to Israel later this month for the official opening, alongside Benjamin Netanyahu.“Most Israelis probably haven’t even heard of these countries,” a recent Jerusalem Post editorial states, but “they have the best record of voting in staunch favor of Israel at the United Nations.”Their influence at international forums where issues vital to Israel are debated are crucial. That’s because despite some Pacific countries numbering less than 20,000 people, at the UN their votes carry the same weight as superpowers like the US and China.‘Politically convenient’Experts say that the Pacific’s enduring support for Israel – even as other western allies have grown frustrated and appalled by its actions – can largely be explained by religion.The Jewish population of the Pacific is tiny, while Christians number more than 90% in many countries, says Prof Steven Ratuva from the University of Canterbury. But like evangelical Americans, many Pacific Christians see an Israel inhabited by Jewish people asvital to their beliefs. Their governments tend to support this view by aligning with Israel.Israel has sought to leverage this religious connection with some aid and development assistance, says Ratuva.“It’s only interested in getting support from states over what it’s doing right now inGaza… so it’s looking for friends and the friends happen to be in the Pacific.”Semi Turaga is a member of the Fijians for Palestine solidarity network, one of the few groups challenging their governments commitment to Israel. He says it is “politically convenient for the governments because supporting Israel is a majority view”.View image in fullscreenProtesters gather outside parliament in Honiara, Solomon Islands, in 2021.Photograph: Georgina Kekea/ReutersHis colleague, Roshika Deo, agrees. “Because we’re a majority Christian country with a government made up of people with conservative Christian views, that’s reflected in our politics and foreign policy.”They say this is evidenced by the number of Israeli flags that are displayed in Fiji; at churches, protests, outside schools and even at rugby games.Unbreakable support?In an attempt to sustain the relationship, Israeli politicians and officials have conducted multiple visits to the Pacific, including a 2020 tour by then president Reuven Rivlin.Days after the Australian governmentcancelled the visa of a far-right Israeli politicianahead of a planned speaking tour this month – sparking a war of words between the two countries – Israel announced an official visit to the Pacific for October. Hailing a “profound appreciation for the Pacific Island states”, Israel’s foreign ministry laid bare the deep and enduring partnership between countries that sit half a world away from each other.This support has not gone unnoticed in Pacific states though, and protest groups have mobilised to express anger at their governments’ seemingly limitless patience when it comes to Israel’s actions in Gaza. But for now, they remain in the minority.In January a young, politically active group in Samoa donned Palestinian keffiyehs to march through the country’s capital demanding a ceasefire. However their rally was vastly outnumbered by a counter protest, organised by local evangelical churches which saw hundreds turn up waving Israeli flags.In Fiji, demonstrators have at times been denied permission from the government to march in support of Palestine. But Turaga says his group has found other ways to make their voices heard. Last week they organised public readings of testimony from local people in Gaza.“There were a lot of people there,” says Turaga, but many remained afraid of speaking out. “Some were asking not to have photos taken and put online. They fear losing their jobs.”Despite this, more people are starting to support their cause, says Deo.“We’ve mostly had negative reactions, but our most recent protest had a lot of positives,” she says. “An older man shouted from a bus ‘Free Palestine’, and we’ve never had that in such a public way. I think there’s some change happening.”Explore more on these topicsPacific islandsFijiIsraelGazaAsia PacificPapua New GuineaPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than 1,100 sessions featured “gamechanger” research, new guidelines and groundbreaking trials.“This year’s ESC congress marks a turning point: cardiology has never been more dynamic, interdisciplinary, and patient-centred,” said Prof Felix Mahfoud, chair of the ESC communications committee.“Never before have we seen such a high number of late-breaking trials from across all fields of cardiology presented and simultaneously published in top journals, informing clinical decision-making and improving patient care.”Here is a roundup of the key takeaways.1.MedicineDoctors in Madridhailed a new pillfor patients with high blood pressure resistant to existing medication as a “gamechanger” and a “triumph of science”.Globally, 1.3 billion people have hypertension and in half of cases, their high blood pressure is uncontrolled or resistant to existing treatments. They face a much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and early death.A new drug – baxdrostat – can significantly lower blood pressure in these people whose levels remain dangerously high despite taking several medicines.The results of the BaxHTN study showed that after 12 weeks, patients taking baxdrostat saw their blood pressure fall by about 9-10 mmHg (millimetres of mercury, the unit of measurement of blood pressure) more than the placebo – a reduction large enough to cut cardiovascular risk.There were also exciting discoveries about existing drugs that could help heart patients, delegates were told.In one trial, researchers found a drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks and strokes. A new analysis of seven clinical trials showed patients taking clopidogrel had a 14% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events compared with those taking aspirin.A second study showedweight loss drugs may halve the risk of heart patients being hospitalised or dying early.2.Diet and exerciseEating foods rich in potassium, such as avocados, bananas and spinach, could reduce your risk of heart conditions, hospitalisation and death by 24%,Danish researchers told the conference.Previous research had shown that cutting out salt from meals can slash your risk of heart problems. A new study showed just how much potassium, which increases the amount of salt your body removes from the bloodstream, could help to ward off cardiovascular problems.Not a fan of spinach? Pulses, fish, nuts and seeds are also good sources of potassium, experts said.Exercise is also key to a healthy heart. It can lower your resting blood pressure and heart rate, improve your cholesterol levels, and help you maintain a healthy weight, which in turn reduces your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.In Madrid, doctors heard about another potential benefit of getting active:mending a broken heart.3.Artificial intelligenceDoctors have developedan artificial intelligence-led stethoscopethat can detect three heart conditions in 15 seconds.Two centuries after the invention of the humble stethoscope, a team at Imperial College London and Imperial College healthcare NHS trust have designed a hi-tech upgrade. It analyses tiny differences in heartbeat and blood flow undetectable to the human ear, and takes a rapid ECG at the same time.The tool’s AI capabilities mean it can spot heart failure, heart valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms almost instantly.Early diagnosis of these three heart conditions is critical. The AI stethoscope enables patients who need life-saving treatment to be spotted sooner, before they become dangerously unwell.Meanwhile, a revolutionary AI scanning system is increasing the number of stroke patients avoiding serious disability, tripling the rate of recovery,delegates were told.And a new generative AI tool – ESC Chat – istransforming the workof cardiologists worldwide. The chatbot responds immediately to questions about clinical guidelines, saving time and providing doctors with access to recommendations, diagnostic criteria and treatment solutions.4.ChildrenArrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), which is typically genetic, is responsible for more than 10% of sudden cardiac deaths in children.Now a simple cheek-swab test can identify children with the condition, five years before they would normally be diagnosed,according to research presented in Madrid.Experts at Great Ormond Street hospital and City St George’s, University of London are now developing the two-minute test into swab kits that can be used at home and sent away for analysis.Elsewhere,doctors raised the alarmabout high levels of vaping among children, saying they were convinced e-cigarettes were causing irreversible harm to their health.Cardiologists, researchers and health experts said they were “extremely concerned” about the harmful effects of e-cigarettes on millions of teenagers and young people, including exposure to toxins and carcinogens – some of which are still unknown.5.VaccinesVaccination has increasingly been seen as an effective measure not only against specific infections, but also for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or events.Delegates at the conference were briefed about the world’s first global systematic review and meta analysis of the shingles vaccine.The results showedthe jab could lower risk of a heart attack or stroke by as much as 18%.Explore more on these topicsMedical researchHeart diseaseHeart attackHealthEuropeDrugsArtificial intelligence (AI)key takeawaysShareReuse this content"

At the beginning of the year, more than 100,000 jobs were being added each month.Amid Donald Trump’s trade wars, tariffs have now been put on most foreign goods and prices have started going up. Uncertainty seems to have spooked businesses and this combination of a slowing jobs market and higher inflation paints a murky picture of the US economy.Here’s what we learned with Friday’s report:Negative job numbers for the first time since 2020Friday’s job report included revisions to initial reports for June and July. The pace of hiring in June was initially reported as 139,000 jobs added to the economy, but revisions now put the actual figure at -13,000. This is the first time the labor market lost jobs since December 2020, during the massive unemployment seen during the pandemic. July’s numbers were revised up by 6,000, from 73,000 to 79,000.Revisions, a standard part of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ data collection, became a marked point of tension between the bureau and the White House after the bureau dramatically revised numbers in last month’s report.Initial figures overestimated the number of jobs in May and June by 258,000, which the bureau said was the result of receiving additional reports – the bureau collects its data by surveying employers – from businesses and government agencies. With the new revisions released on Friday, total revisions covering May, June and July revised figures down by a combined 279,000 for those three months.Last month, Trumpfiredthe bureau’s commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after the revision, saying the numbers were “rigged” to make him and Republicans look bad. But economists point out that the bureau is made up of career statisticians, many of whom have been with the bureau for many years.Job losses were seen in federal employment and manufacturingThe impacts of the “department of government efficiency” are still being felt even though Elon Musk has largely stepped away from his role in Trump’s White House. In August, federal employment went down another 15,000 jobs, bringing the total number of federal job cuts to 97,000 since January.Manufacturing jobs have also taken a hit this year, down 12,000 jobs in August and 78,000 over the last year.Job growths were seen in healthcare and social assistance industries, which saw increases of 31,000 and 16,000 jobs, respectively.Unemployment among Black Americans has jumpedIn August, the unemployment rate for Black Americans jumped 0.3% over the last month to 7.5% – over double the unemployment rate for white and Asian Americans, which are just over 3.5%. The unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans was also higher, at 5.3%.Though the overall unemployment rate went up just 0.1% over the last year, the Black unemployment rate jumped 1.4%. The unemployment rate for white and Asian Americans actually went down slightly compared with last year.It’s been a longtime trend that Black Americans are the “last hired, first fired” in an economic downturn, meaning they are the first to feel the impacts of a downturn and the last to recover from one. This was seen during the Great Recession, in which unemployment hit Black and Hispanic Americansdisproportionately.Federal Reserve will probably cut interest rates in SeptemberFed officials have been signaling that a rate cut could come at the Fed’s next board meeting on 16 and 17 September, though it probably won’t be a drastic cut. Investors seem to have found hope in last month’s Jackson Holespeechby the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, in which he implied that officials would probably ease interest rates amid concern about the labor market.But the Fed cutting rates doesn’t mean it sees stability in the economy. Fed officials, including Powell, have raised concerns about higher prices due to Trump’s tariffs. It remains unclear if inflation will keep going up, or if there will be a one-time price increase from the tariffs.Powell noted that officials, for now, were more concerned about the labor market, which August’s report confirmed has been experiencing turbulence this summer.White House urges Americans to trust Trump’s planOn Thursday, before Friday’s jobs report release, Trumpsaidthat “the real numbers” will be reported next year.“The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” he said. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.”When asked about the hiring slump, the national economic council director, Kevin Hassett, toldCNBCon Friday that “you are seeing that people are being hired”.“Members of my family have been hired,” he said. “Both of them started their new jobs about a week ago.”Hassett called the jobs report “disappointing” but said that the numbers will eventually go back up.In a separate interview on Friday, the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told CNBC that the jobs reports will be better once the administration makes changes to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.“You’ll take out the people who are just trying to create noise against the president,” Lutnick said. He added that Americans will see “the greatest growth economy … starting six months from today to a year from today”.Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment dataUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpexplainersShareReuse this content"

His talents can’t outdo the one-note dialogue and lack of hilarityHannah J DaviesFri 5 Sep 2025 16.35 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShareTwo years after the British version concluded with a second brilliantly mortifyingChristmas special in 2003, American viewers got their own take on The Office. Set at the Dunder Mifflin paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania, it was very much in the spirit of the original, at least initially: a deadpan mockumentary centred on a megalomaniac manager (Steve Carrell’s Michael Scott), who like Ricky Gervais’s David Brent before him was “a friend first, and a boss second … and probably an entertainer third”. The Office: An American Workplace ran for nine seasons, setting aside some of the original’s cringe comedy aspects in favour of something with a little more heart. By the timeit ended in 2013, it was an award-winning sitcom juggernaut in its own right – hugely popular but bearing little resemblance to its Slough-based sibling.It is in this US Office universe that showrunner Greg Daniels’s new spinoff is set, with the camera crew that followed Dunder Mifflin for a decade now decamping to a floundering local news outlet a state away (Oscar Nunez’s judgy accountant Oscar Martinez is the only character to transfer from Pennsylvania to Ohio). The Toledo Truth Teller is a newspaper struggling to survive in the digital age: cue the arrival of plucky new editor Ned Sampson (a very un-Irish Domhnall Gleeson). Ned hasn’t actually worked for a newspaper before, but hehasrisen the ranks selling high-end cardboard at the Truth Teller’s parent company, Enervate, which specialises in different types of paper (hence the link with Dunder Mifflin, and cue a recurring bit about the Truth Teller being less popular than toilet roll).In early scenes that may be triggering for journalists, we see just how terrible the Truth Teller is. In lieu of actual journalism, staff populate its pages with trivial wire copy (“Elizabeth Olsen reveals her night-time skin routine”) and its website is smothered with banner ads. Managing editor Esmerelda Grand (Sabrina Impacciatore) shows off her magnum opus, titled “You Won’t Believe How Much Ben Affleck Tipped His Limo Driver”.What follows is a perfectly serviceable, if rarely hilarious, workplace comedy about how to revive a failing business while under increasingly unbearable levels of stress. Alex Edelman’s uber-dry Adam and Gbemisola Ikumelo’s zoned-out Adelola are perfect stock sitcom characters. But – devoid of those Office-style glimmers of tragedy (Adam is a put-upon dad?) – their dialogue is often one-note. The paper company conceit also means that the show never really has to commit to being about the media per se; one plot focuses on a news story involving the company’s “man mitts”, a glove for cleaning oneself after using the bathroom that is also prone to causing sewer fatbergs. The show does do classic misdirection quite well – like when Ned thinks he has a lead on a local serial killer, only to find that the police are suspicious ofhimon account of a breathy phone call he made to a morgue. But such moments are few and far between. Compared to other mockumentaries du jour –Abbott Elementary,St Denis Medical– The Paper often feels like dated background TV that’s crying out for a laughter track.Thank God, then, for Impacciatore, last seen as the White Lotus’s stressy Sicilian manager Valentina. As Ned’s nemesis Esmerelda, she gets the best lines in the whole series, among them, “in America, there is the saying about accepting the things you cannot change. In Italy we do not have that saying”. She describes tenacious reporter Mare (Chelsea Frei) as “the woman whose parents named her after horse”. Ned accuses her of sensationalising stories, to which she asks “since when is sensationalism a bad thing?!” The mix of Ab Fab-style getup, beautiful physical comedy (as a cockroach, a lobster and more), and those campy punchlines make Esmerelda an instantly iconic character. And, yes, there is some Office-esque pathos in there, too. The fledgling double act between her and Tim Key’s Brexity, David Brent-lite executive Ken is wonderful as well, and leaves me wanting a spinoff of the spinoff where the two of them climb the greasy pole of Enervate, badly.Maybe that’s where The Paper should have concentrated its energy all along. Gleeson is so talented but the character of Ned – the editor-in-chief who gets locked in his own office by his own employees – is too milquetoast a lead for a franchise that has long put vain, oblivious bosses front and centre. The Paper has no problem characterising local journalism as mundane and mediocre but, as they say, it takes one to know one.The Paper aired on Sky Max and is on Now in the UK. In the US it airs on Peacock and in Australia it airs on Binge.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

This year was no exception: stars including Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Jude Law and George Clooney dutifully waved from canals and trooped down red carpets (although Law tripped while on a water taxi and Clooney got ill).But the films themselves struck a different note. Jury president Alexander Payne may have rebutted questions about current affairs during his opening press conference, declaring himself concerned only with discussing cinema, but cinema at Venice this year was concerned largely, it turned out, with discussing current events.The big hits of the festival were both nailbiting ticking-clock stories – directed by women – that tackled real-world situations of such tragedy and magnitude that many people shy from discussing them, let alone make a movie about them.Towards the end of the festival,The Voice of Hind Rajab, Kaouther Ben Hania’s dramatisation of the killing by the Israel Defense Forces of a five-year-old girl in Gaza, earned a 23-minute standing ovation, as well as chants around the auditorium of “Free Palestine”.The film uses the real audio of Rajab’s phone call with emergency call handlers, where she pleads to be rescued from the car in which she was trapped after Israeli tank fire killed the family members around her. During the January 2024 incident, the ambulance sent to reach Rajab also came under attack and the two paramedics on board were killed. Rajab’s body, as well as those of her relatives and the paramedics were found 12 days later.Speaking in Venice, Ben Hania said: “I just felt I had to do something, so I wasn’t complicit. I have no political power. I’m not an activist. All I have is this one tool that I have mastered a little bit – cinema. At least, with this film, I wasn’t silenced.”View image in fullscreen‘The film is an invitation to decide what to do about all these weapons’ … from left: Idris Elba, Kathryn Bigelow and Rebecca Ferguson at a photocall for A House of Dynamite.Photograph: Riccardo Antimiani/EPAMeanwhile, Kathryn Bigelow’s first film in eight years,A House of Dynamite, put audiences repeatedly through the 18 minute period from the launch of a nuclear strike on the US until its landing, from the point of view of, variously, a soldier, military leader and the president (played by Idris Elba). Bigelow said she had made the film in an desperate attempt to kickstart conversations about a nuclear treaty.“The film is an invitation to decide what to do about all these weapons,” she said. “How is annihilating the world a good defensive measure?”Elsewhere, the evidence mounted that cinema is increasingly acting as a quasi-urgent response unit to help audiences interpret a chaotic world. Yorgos Lanthimos’s latest,Bugonia, stars Emma Stone as a high-powered executive kidnapped by conspiracy theorists convinced she is an alien intent on destroying Earth. Confirming the film as an allegory for inertia over tackling a climate catastrophe, its director said: “Humanity is facing a reckoning very soon. People need to choose the right path, otherwise, I don’t know how much time [we have] left.”Meanwhile,No Other Choice, the latest from Oldboy’s Park Chan-wook, was a satire about a long-serving employee fired from his role in a manufacturing plant who feels forced to eliminate all competitors for a future post. “We all harbour that deep fear of employment insecurity,” said Park. “Anyone who’s out there trying to make a living in the current modern capitalist society.”View image in fullscreenPlaying Vladimir Putin … Jude Law and Paul Dano in The Wizard of the Kremlin.Photograph: Carole BethuelGuillermo del Toro’sFrankensteinengaged with the ethics of AI,though he claimed otherwise, and Law was in town playing Vladimir Putin in Olivier Assayas’sThe Wizard of the Kremlin. While Law sought to downplay the film’s contemporary relevance, his director was less abashed, declaring: “The film is very much about how modern politics, 21st-century politics, was invented, and part of that evil raised from the rise to power of Vladimir Putin in Russia.”Such eagerness by film-makers for direct political engagement appears unlikely to wane. Announcing their lineup on Friday, the San Sebastián film festival director also issued a long statement calling for end to the “genocide … the unimaginable massacres to which the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is subjecting the Palestinian people.”Meanwhile in London on Wednesday evening, Hugh Bonneville took an ITV reporter by surprise when he began his comments on the red carpet by saying: “What’s about to happen inGazaCity is indefensible. The international community must do more to bring it to an end.” He then continued: “Downton Abbey’s a lovely film.”Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalFestivalsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warKathryn BigelownewsShareReuse this content"

Our writer smells the gloveFri 5 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 11.22 EDTShareSpinal Tap are remembering the old days. It was 1966, and the young beat group from Squatney in east London – still, at that point, the Thamesmen – were honing their act in the tough clubs of the Benelux circuit. A young band from Britain could learn a lot, facing up to riotous crowds of Dutch, Flemings, Walloons and Luxembourgers. What lessons did Tap take from that year?“If you speak really loudly, it’s all right if you don’t have any of the local language,” says David St Hubbins, Tap’s leonine lead singer.“The Belgian beer is very good,” offers Nigel Tufnel, the lead guitarist who inspired legions. “And if you’ve had enough of them, you can pretty much speak the language.”And is it true what they say about women from Luxembourg?“The few women I met from Luxembourg, you’d do a gig and a girl comes up and says something to you, and you say something to her. And she says: ‘Not bloody likely,’” Tufnel says. “That’s mostly what it was.”“They’re not like the girls from Liechtenstein.” That’s Derek Smalls, bassist, pipe-smoker, vinegar expert, and enigma wrapped inside a riddle wrapped inside a moustache. “Don’t even talk about the girls from Liechtenstein.”“Well, there’s that Bertrand Russell quote about the Liechtenstein women,” Tufnel says. “But I can’t quote it, because it’s rude.”What a thrill it is to hear these three undersung pioneers of British rock back together again, albeit briefly. In 1984, Marty DiBergi’s documentary This Is Spinal Tap captured the band falling apart on a disastrous US tour, and somehow revived their flagging career. Now the film-maker and band have reunited, capturing the Tap reassembling for one final contractually obliged show in New Orleans, in Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.View image in fullscreen‘If there’s one thing that we brought to that film, it was a sort of senselessness’ … a scene from Marty DiBergi’s earlier movie of the band.Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/ShutterstockThe biggest shock is not that Tap reunited – Hope Faith, daughter of their former manager Ian, had the legal power to force them to do so – but that they allowed DiBergi to document it. The first film had painted them as buffoons – for years afterwards the band complained that he only showed the times they got lost on the way to the stage, never the times they made it. It seemed fitting that DiBergi’s own career should have stalled after his next film, Kramer vs Kramer vs Godzilla, and fitting, too, that it should take Tap to revive his dreams. But why let him back on board?“When Hope Faith came to us and told us we owed one more gig, we thought we might turn it into a piece of change, and the only director we knew personally was this man that we had decades of negotiations with to have both his name and ours removed from the first film,” St Hubbins says. “So we said: ‘Let’s give him a call.’”“Nobody else wanted to do it.” Smalls says. “We thought, after four decades, maybe he’s learned something.”He hasn’t, has he?“No, clearly.”This Is Spinal Tap inadvertently became a classic, not as a filmic equivalent of Ian Hunter’s Diary of a Rock’n’Roll Star – his account of touring the US with Mott the Hoople – but as a comedy. DiBergi’s knack – if he had one – was to miss all the moments of triumph and capture only the bathos. The film won Tap a huge new following – enough for them to headline arenas again, and play Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage – but the audience all believed they were watching comedians.“Listen,” St Hubbins says, “we’ve got their money and they can take away whatever they want. Hopefully, some merchandise.”People said This Is Spinal Tap had to have been faked, that no one is that vain, stupid and pretentious in real life. “Well, truth is stranger than fiction,” Tufnel says. “Fiction has to make sense. And if there’s one thing that we brought to that film, it was a sort of senselessness.”The film’s success meant Tap were in the peculiar situation of being far more popular in that follow-through part of their career, rather than when they were sitting on the creative throne itself, during the 1970s. Their popularity is in inverse proportion to the amount of music they record. Why did that happen?“I think the answer is two words: reverse magnetism,” Smalls says.And if you could use two more words to expand on that?“I’d say polar opposites. OK, it’s scientific. If you look at science – and it’s in all the books – people look at it and they say: ‘Look what it says here.’ Polar opposites, reverse magnetism. If you read what those mean, it will become clear to you.”Almost all Tap’s catalogue has been unavailable since release (at one point their then label, Megaphone, took legal action to prevent them making any music at all). From 1967’s Spinal Tap Sings (Listen to the) Flower People and Other Favourites to 1982’s Smell the Glove, the band made 11 studio albums (plus four rumoured unreleased records), two live albums, as well as Tufnel’s solo project Clam Caravan.Yet since 1984 all that has been available has been the soundtrack to the film, featuring a selection of songs from those albums, then 1992’s Break Like the Wind, a mixture of new tracks and re-recordings, then a similar melange on 2009’s Back from the Dead. The problem is that for nearly 50 years, ownership of Tap’s catalogue has been scattered. At one point it was owned by shadowy Iranian operatives, before Ian Faith faked his own death and distributed the songs around assorted faded celebrities, including Mario Andretti and Billie Jean King. Now, even if Tap wanted to rerelease the catalogue, they couldn’t find it to buy it back.View image in fullscreenElton John joins the band.Photograph: Bleecker Street & Authorized Spinal Tap LLCYet for hard rock fans, this is a tragedy. Because the sliver of music we have available tells us that Tap were among the greats of hard rock. Tonight I’m Going to Rock You (Tonight) is a riff to rival Whole Lotta Rosie; Stonehenge crams more ideas into its running time than Francis Ford Coppola did in 10 hours of Godfather films.The more anal obsess over the pioneering three-bass arrangement of 1970’s Big Bottom, but think instead of the ecstatic release of its chorus. The astonishing America lasts only three and a half minutes but seems to go on so much longer (“It feels like an hour,” observes Smalls). The 1992 single The Majesty of Rock is one of the greatest singles of its decade (St Hubbins says there might be some money in it for me if a mention of it gooses the streaming figures).When the first film came out, hard rock was critically disdained – John Paul Jones spoke of being untouchable after Led Zeppelin split; Black Sabbath were a shocking mess; AC/DC were regarded as troglodytes. Now all are seen as legends, and had Tap albums such as Intravenous de Milo, Brainhammer and Silent But Deadly been given the deluxe box set treatment, they might be seen as the equals of Physical Graffiti, Sabotage and Back in Black. Or at least the equals of In Through the Out Door, Headless Cross and Fly on the Wall.And, oh, to have seen the band in full flight in 1969, when they recorded the Silent But Deadly album live, the two-hour guitar tour de force Short and Sweet edited down to just under 19 minutes.“Silent But Deadly was an ironic title,” St Hubbins says. “Ironic because it was quite loud and no one was killed. I do remember one section, Nige, where you played the same note for seven minutes. It was remarkable: like an Andy Warhol film. You go, Thank God that’s over. But at the same time you feel edified.”While St Hubbins and Tufnel shredded, Smalls says: “I was trying to send messages with my mind: Play longer! Play shorter! Get off! I think it communicated. I don’t know. They would know.”With instrumental sections lasting two hours, audiences had the opportunity to really make an evening of it, the band recall. Fans would leave the venue for dinner, then return for the end of the set. “The one thing you don’t want is a hungry audience,” Smalls says. “So the fact they could go away and come back sated was crucial.”“Hail sated!” St Hubbins says.These days the threesome are scattered, but St Hubbins and Tufnel have known each other since infancy, when they were nextdoor neighbours in poverty-stricken Squatney. The area no longer exists – presumably written out of history in the 1974 local government reorganisation – but some detective work can reveal where it once was.The 1994 concert video The Return of Spinal Tap showed the pair returning to their old street, and in the background stood a pub called The Gun. That same pub is now a gastropub, and it is on the east of the Isle of Dogs (“However advertised as showing England v Sweden tonight for the women Euros. In reality an average-sized TV with no sound,” says Cameron on Tripadvisor).View image in fullscreen‘I was trying to send messages with my mind: Play longer! Play shorter! Get off! I think it communicated’ … the band on tour in Spinal Tap II.Photograph: AP“Gastro? What does that really mean except, you know, bad?” Tufnel asks.“Here’s a clue,” Smalls says. “Gastrointestinal. You want to eat in a pub that named itself after that? No.”“The entire north end of Squatney is a giant Sainsbury’s now,” St Hubbins says. “Whether that’s an improvement or not …”“But that tells you something,” Tufnel insists. “Because it’s not a Waitrose.”No, but it’s not Lidl or an Aldi.“And it’s not a Tesco either,” St Hubbins says. “It’s very specific.”Tap, it would be fair to say, are not the greatest communicators with either each other, or anyone else, a tone set by Tufnel and St Hubbins’ sparring. When did they realise, beneath the banter and the joshing, that there was a deep and genuine dislike between them?“It’s not a dislike!” Tufnel protests.“No, it’s an animus,” St Hubbins agrees. “I like to call it an animus or an enmity, just because they have more syllables.”Perhaps that failure to communicate led to one of Tap’s Born in the USA moments, when they – like Bruce Springsteen – had a song catastrophically misinterpreted. Bitch School, from Break Like the Wind, was widely and wrongly condemned for being sexist, portraying women as animals, just because people were too stupid and lazy to pay attention to the lyrics. The video was even banned from one of Australia’s smaller video channels.“You’ve hit upon it exactly: stupid and lazy,” Tufnel says. “It’s obvious what that song is about, and it’s so frustrating.”The real sadness is that the song is more necessary and relevant than ever: in an age of news stories about bully XLs and status dogs, we need pop songs that stress the need for canine training. “The real problem,” Smalls says, “is that they’re closing those songs because they’re running out of funds to teach bitches.”“There was a fourth verse, which was specifically about spaying and neutering,” St Hubbins says. “That might have made things even worse.”This Is Spinal Tap review – a glorious heavy-rock nightmare that was ahead of its timeRead moreI know where I think Tap stand in the British rock pantheon. But where do they think they rank, assuming the Beatles are No 1 and the Stones No 2?“Are you making a comparison to the Premier League and then going down from there?” Tufnel asks. “We might be in mid-League One. With the hope of moving up, but the assurance that you’re not going to go down to the Northern League. I’d say 77th.”“We’re standing on the shoulders of They Might Be Giants,” St Hubbins says.It’s great to have them back. Tonight they’re going to rock you (tonight).Spinal Tap II: The End Continues is out on 12 September in the US and UK, and on 25 September in Australia.

Only just, but a win is a win, especially in a tricky opening-night fixture, as Sonia Bompastor’s side embark on a quest for the club’s seventh consecutive Women’s Super League title.It saw Andrée Jeglertz lose his first game in charge of Manchester City; Bompastor, by contrast, is still yet to lose a league fixture in English football and Chelsea remain unbeaten in the WSL since May 2024, a run of 26 league games.Beever-Jones takes her chance to prove she is more than an impact player for Chelsea | Suzanne WrackRead moreOn Friday night they displayed many of the characteristics that have helped them dominate the division in modern times, particularly their ruthlessness in the final third by comparison to their rivals.Khadija Shaw lashed a rising drive narrowly over the crossbar with 11 minutes to go, but that was as close as it got to an equaliser for the team who finished fourth in the division last term. They had more bad news when Alex Greenwood and Lily Murphy sustained injuries in stoppage time.Just under six weeks since the Euro 2025 final in Basel concluded a tournament which delivered packed stadiums and raucous crowds, it might have been a bit of a comedown for the players to walk out at Stamford Bridge and see the top tier of the stands essentially empty. Nonetheless, the Chelsea fans who did show up were enjoying what they saw, especially from one of their most important summer signings, Ellie Carpenter.Her pacy bursts up the wing caused problems for Manchester City and she created the opening goal with an inch-perfect, low cross into the path of Aggie Beever-Jones.Bompastor, who previously managed Carpenter at their old club Lyon, praised the Australia right-back’s strong debut, saying: “[It was] a great performance from Ellie. I know Ellie by heart and I’m not really surprised debut.View image in fullscreenAggie Beever-Jones tucks the ball home from Ellie Carpenter’s cross to put Chelsea ahead.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty Images“She’s a great player. As you could see tonight, she just brought an immediate impact and I think she has this quality. We are really proud to have her in our squad.”Another of the hosts’ new transfers, Alyssa Thompson, was introduced to the home fans on the pitch before kick-off to add to the mood of anticipation.This fixture came too soon for her debut after her deadline-day move from Angel City for a club record £1.1m but Chelsea hope her arrival can help them in their quest to achieve the aim clearly specified in Bompastor’s matchday programme notes: to win all four major trophies this term and go one better that last term’s domestic treble. As for City, just one piece of silverware would be an uplift on their past three trophyless campaigns.The away side had been fortunate not to concede an early penalty when the ball struck Gracie Prior’s arm inside the box and was diverted goalwards – the City goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita showed great reactions to stop the deflected effort from Sandy Baltimore.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first was a dive to her left to keep out a fierce strike in the game’s first attack, and the second – when Chelsea were already 1-0 up – was a strong low save from close range.View image in fullscreenManchester City had some hope when Chelsea’s Niamh Charles scored an own goal to make it 2-1.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersThe visitors, who deployed Lauren Hemp on the right wing instead of the left and enjoyed success when she cut inside on to her stronger left foot, were creating opportunities and went close again when Greenwood’s curling free-kick rattled the crossbar with 10 minutes remaining of the first half. Jeglertz’s first half-time team talk in charge of Manchester City seemed to inspire them as they began the second half dominating the territory and preventing Chelsea from holding on to the ball, but Yui Hasegawa flicked a great chance narrowly wide from a Hemp cross.They would be made to pay for failing to capitalise on their spell of pressure, because Chelsea’s Maika Hamano was afforded the freedom of the penalty area at the other end to double the defending champions’ lead. It was all too simple. Wieke Kaptein had time to pick out her pass to Hamano, as the Manchester City defending left much to be desired. They will not win the league if teams can score against them so easily.Niamh Charles’s own goal – a header into her own net from a whipped Greenwood free-kick – gave Manchester City hope, but they could not find an equaliser. Jeglertz conceded: “I think we nailed our high press in the second half [but] in the first half, their formation was not what we expected so it took a little bit of time for us to nail that properly.“Of course, everything is about scoring goals. We created enough chances, I think, to at least get one point, but that’s how it is.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueChelsea WomenManchester City WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Denmark could justify leaving the 33-year-old out of their squad for the meetings withScotlandand Greece on the basis he remains unemployed. Yet as the hosts huffed, puffed and failed to unpick a magnificently drilled Scotland defence, the issue of what Eriksen could have contributed was such an obvious one. Denmark in this form will not play at next summer’s World Cup.Steve Clarke’s Scotland were worthy of their point. But for a lack of composure in front of goal, they would have departed Copenhagen with all three. The winners from this opening night of a truncated section were the Greeks, who swept Belarus aside 5-1, but Scotland richly deserved their full-time ovation from an appreciative support.Denmarkwere booed off.Denmark v Scotland, Isak in action for Sweden and more: 2026 World Cup qualifiers - clockwatchRead more“A good, disciplined performance,” said Clarke. “We knew we would have to defend well and certainly did that. We have five more tough games, we are under no illusions about that. You don’t go to the World Cup easily.”Clarke sprang a surprise with the deployment of two strikers, Che Adams and Lyndon Dykes, from the outset. “If I am not brave, I might as well not be in the job,” said the manager. Equally striking was the sight of John McGinn, who has typically operated on the left or centre of midfield for his country, on the right. Rasmus Højlund, fresh from his loan move from Manchester United to Napoli, was among Denmark’s replacements.Scotland had been sloppy in possession before McGinn missed a wonderful chance to give his team the lead. Lewis Ferguson’s deep corner evaded everyone, with the Aston Villa midfielder left alone at the back post. McGinn seemed surprised by his opportunity and scuffed his shot wide. The opening increased Scottish belief, with Adams only just failing to connect with a teasing Ryan Christie cross. Christie was the next to try his luck, curling a shot high and wide from 19 yards after Ferguson had pinched the ball in midfield.View image in fullscreenThe Scotland goalkeeper, Angus Gunn, collects the ball under pressure.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PADenmark had enjoyed plenty of first-half possession without particularly troubling Angus Gunn in the Scotland goal. Gunn reacted smartly to smother the ball before Kasper Dolberg could latch on to an Anders Dreyer through-pass, 10 minutes before the break. Generally, though, the Danes were laboured. Christie should have punished that, the Bournemouth man instead heading McGinn’s cross wide after 38 minutes. Clarke would have been by far the more content coach at the interval, if slightly concerned by Scottish profligacy. This was not a half that will linger long in anybody’s memory.Joakim Mæhle deflected a McGinn drive wide as the visitors began the second period on the front foot. Scott McTominay bobbed and weaved his way through, only to be denied by the feet of Kasper Schmeichel. Clarke would have been well within his rights during the interval to tell his players to be more confident against an underwhelming Denmark team. The early signs were that was precisely what Scotland’s manager did.It felt inevitable that Denmark had to offer more. The 53rd minute saw their finest move thus far, culminating in a low attempt from Pierre-Emile Højbjerg that flew only narrowly wide via Grant Hanley’s deflection. Hanley, routinely the subject of heavy criticism when in Scotland colours, was excellent all evening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aaron Hickey found McGinn, who sent Adams clear on the right flank. Adams played the ball across to his strike partner, who looked certain to blast a first-time shot at Schmeichel. Dykes inexplicably delayed, allowing Rasmus Kristensen to recover. Kristensen could not believe his luck. Dreyer almost dished out immediate retribution courtesy of a long-range shot which rippled Gunn’s side netting.Scotland survived a scare, just after Max Johnston replaced Hickey at right-back. Mika Biereth raced to meet a long ball from Schmeichel, which Johnston blocked after raising his arm. Danish fans appealed vociferously for a red, given Biereth would have been through on goal but for Johnston’s intervention. After a monitor check, the referee refused to alter his original call of a booking for the Scotland player. The ball appeared to strike Johnston above the T-shirt line, with Biereth also nudging his opponent.Denmark called on Højlund without it making any material difference. Højberg had the night’s final chance, but headed straight at Gunn. “We had the ball a lot but didn’t do enough with it,” said the Denmark coach Brian Riemer. His assessment was perfectly fair.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersDenmarkScotlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But now, as the nights draw in and the real stuff gets under way, it should come as no surprise that a team which won every single trophy on offer last season are beginning to stir into life as September begins.For 25 minutes here, you wondered if they would potentially succumb to their great rivals and leave the door ajar for someone to overhaul them and secure a top-two finish before the playoffs. But when the chips are down and the stakes are at their highest, this team ultimately delivers.A bigger Super League is not the only change coming rugby league’s way | Gavin WillacyRead moreTrailing 4-0 midway through the first half, by the break they had surged into an eight-point lead with two wonderful tries before striking a decisive blow six minutes after the restart with a third. Suddenly, a game in which St Helens were well on top had transformed decisively into a one-sidedWigan Warriorswin – and their head coach’s summation of how the final half-hour played out felt apt.“I thought we were comfortable,” Matt Peet said. He wasn’t wrong. This contest proved two things, one being that the Warriors are now warming up for the business end of the season. But the other thing we learned was that this Saints side are a level below the elite teams in Super League.They started with promise here but their shortcomings against the best sides came to the fore again – namely their ability to score points when it really matters. Their spine changes on a weekly basis, and Paul Wellens simply does not know his best side.That is a huge worry when the playoffs begin in three weeks. After this defeat, the Saints will now probably finish fifth, meaning they will have to win back-to-back away games just to make Old Trafford.“I understand the narrative of can’t beat Hull KR and Wigan but that’s got to change at some point,” Wellens admitted. “It’s a frustrating evening. We started well but too many times we go off-script and that hurts you in games like tonight.” Wellens is correct about one thing: his side did start well here in a ferocious atmosphere.They took a deserved lead, too. Wellens’ big gamble was to move the England full-back Jack Welsby to loose forward in a bid to perk up their attack and the early signs were it would work, as Welsby’s superb pass sent Deon Cross over for the opening try. But from there, the Saints simply couldn’t add any more points despite plenty of pressure.And when Wigan replied through Jake Wardle’s try, the balance of power shifted their way. By half-time they had scored again when Liam Marshall added a second and Harry Smith kicked a penalty to make it 12-4. The Saints were stunned, but what came next floored them completely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s not because of the fanzones, free concerts, and fireworks, but who’s coming. These dates have been ringed ever since the fixture list was released. Everyone who’s anyone in a sport where everyone is someone seems to be planning to make a big weekend of it. England play Australia on Saturday, New Zealand play Ireland on Sunday. Both matches are sold out.“An international at Twickenham is more than a mere spectacle,” Alec Waugh once wrote, “it is a gathering of the clan.” It’s true in Brighton, too, although it will be a very different sort of crowd from the one who used to fill the West Stand in Waugh’s day.Abby Dow and England near record territory as Australia search for upsetRead moreLast time the Rugby World Cup went to the city they made a movie about how it all worked out. Karne Hesketh scored in the corner in the final minute,Japan beat South Africa 34-32, and before you knew it the team were up on the big screen in a film calledThe Brighton Miracle. In a particularly inspired bit of casting, the head coach, Eddie Jones, was played by Temuera Morrison, best known for portraying a cold-blooded bounty hunter in the Star Wars movies. This time, the movie has come before the match. World Rugby is releasing a short film calledWhere We Belong, directed by the duoPip + Lib, emphasising rugby’s inclusivity. It is being launched this weekend.“Obviously we’ve seen that players in this tournament have been able to bring across their personalities, because they have that freedom of expression,” says the tournament director, Sarah Massey. “But right from the very beginning we wanted to achieve something a bit deeper, we wanted to make sure we could use this tournament as a platform for all the people, especially women and other under-represented groups, who hadn’t typically seen themselves reflected in the industry.”The executive team is all-female. So are the artists who created the opening TV credits, the DJs, and the groundstaff at the final.It sounds like the sort of talk every sports executive loves to use. The difference is that it’s actually an authentic reflection of the way women’s rugby is. Where We Belong shows a slice of life in three women’s teams and the trailer alone is enough to show that the film-makers caught something about the sport. Pip + Lib have worked with the Lionesses before, but this was their first experience in women’s rugby. “I went into it thinking that there would be a real type that’s interested in rugby,” says Lib. “My perception of it was that it was all very ‘private school’, you know, they’re the ones who have the pitches, and all the options at PE, but actually there are so many different types of girls from different types of backgrounds who love it. And it gives them so much.”View image in fullscreenWorld Rugby’s short film Where We Belong is being launched this weekend.Photograph: Pip + Lib/World Rugby“We did a load of casting, so we met a lot of girls,” says Pip. “There was a good handful of very shy girls who didn’t even really want to look at you, like young, awkward teenagers. But then they’re on the pitch and they were just like a completely different person. And that was very cool.”When they are working in football, the girls all want to show off how many keepy-uppies they can do. “But the rugby girls it’s very much like they want to show off their power, their strength, their aggression.” They met one girl who, they suspected, had a hard home life, “and she was like, ‘I come here because I need it. I need this.’ I don’t think we’ve ever heard any girls talk that passionately about a sport.”It’s the nature of a rugby team that it ought to be one place where anyone who wants to play can belong. The irony is that the macho culture of the men’s game made so many people feel so alienated from the sport for so long. It’s only 15 years sinceGareth Thomas was so tornabout whether or not he could come out that he contemplated killing himself. The women’s game has always been a long way ahead of the men’s on LGBTQ+ representation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Being a rugby player actually celebrates all the parts that society doesn’t, necessarily. If you’re bigger, there’s a place for you, if you’re wider, there’s a place for you, if you’re short, there’s a place for you. It’s a space where difference is accepted. And there is queerness about that.”“Obviously the stereotype is just that you’re a lesbian,” said England prop Hannah Botterman on her BBC podcast, Barely Rugby. Botterman is. As she says herself: “I am the stereotypical women’s rugby player.” At a time when every sport’s organisation wants to rainbow-wash its reputation, women’s rugby stands out because its attitude to inclusivity is entirely authentic. No one in it gives a damn where you are on the rainbow spectrum. Some of the most entertaining content produced during this tournament has come from theKiwi reporter Alice Soperand her partner, who have been putting out videos on how queer each team are (they do it without outing any of the players).OutSports reported that there were more than 50. Soper reckons that’s an underestimate, and the number is above 150. When she ranked the teams by how many queer players they have, she gotvideo messages from players on the Brazilian and US teams demanding a recount. “We know that the USA belongs on that podium, we’re queer and we’re here,” joked the US prop Charli Jacoby. “But not everyone,” she adds, deadpan. “There are some straight sisters.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025Women's rugby unionRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The head coach regards it as essential that his team play with the passion of the Premier League; as a band of brothers, high-fiving, encouraging, selfless.It is about energy and intensity; after a ball loss, for example. Tracking back. They must enjoy the freedom to express themselves. Harry Kane can drop off a bit from the No 9 position but not too much. There needs to be speed around him, space and incisive patterns throughout.Thomas Tuchel says John Stones must stay fit to keep alive World Cup hopesRead more“It is our job to make it quickly understandable, to make it easier to transform it on to the pitch,” Tuchel saidwhen he named his first squadin March for the opening World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia at Wembley.It is probably fair to say that a few things got lost along the way last season, especially in the second camp in June, which featured the stodgy and unenjoyable1-0 win against Andorrain Barcelona and the3-1 loss to Senegalat the City Ground. Albania and Latvia had been seen off with relative comfort although the performances did not set pulses racing.It has hardly been a false start under Tuchel. Three wins out of three in qualification, with no goals conceded, is not to be sniffed at, while Senegal was a friendly. June is always an awkward window. But something does need to change as Tuchel embarks on what he has suggested is the real business, the beginning of a World Cup season.He knows it, just as he claims to have detected a different atmosphere among the players this week as they prepare for Saturday’s return tie against Andorra at Villa Park. The big one against Serbia in Belgrade comes on Tuesday. Tuchel believes he has the answers. He wants to show he is a fast learner in a new environment and for him it comes down to streamlining, greater precision and clarity.Tuchel used 28 players in his first four games and had a clutch of others as unused substitutes; he even had to omit players from matchday squads. Which he hated. It did not create “the right energy”. He had to cast his net at the outset but it was too crowded. And so this time he trimmed the selection long-list and called up only 24 players. He feels the competition has become spicier.In the warm weather training week in Barcelona before the Andorra game, which began with a team bonding trip to the Spanish Grand Prix on the Sunday, Tuchel put his players through their paces on the Monday. There was intensity then but the week came to feel long before the game on Saturday. This time, Tuchel asked the players to report on Tuesday.The most interesting change has been in Tuchel’s approach to training: the tactical side. Few coaches are as obsessed with the finer details but he appears to have concluded that less could be more in international football.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel admits he underestimated the difficulty of trying to project unfamilar ideas to players during international training camps.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty Images“You don’t have the players on a daily basis where you can really tweak into the details,” Tuchel said. “We want to be more clear, more easy, because we have so many players from different clubs so they’re used to a different style. If we implement a lot of new things in only four days of training, it’s just not enough time.“So we need to find an idea where everyone can buy in quickly and everyone drops their club heads. It’s more about principles and building it from a structure that everyone can understand. This is where I have to adapt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We played different structures in the buildup and put players in new positions. Maybe I underestimated the effect that it has. It was a learning. Maybe we translated it a little too much from club football and we need to take a step back to speed up our game with a bit more freedom and less changes within the structure. Maybe the solution comes from running more, from more energy, than the structure.”Tuchel has pretty much picked two players per position and he has been gloriously specific about where he sees each one playing, who they are up against. For example, Tino Livramento has been picked at right-back, in competition with Reece James; Djed Spence as a left-back against Myles Lewis-Skelly. At left centre-back, it is Dan Burn and Marc Guéhi. The No 8s are Declan Rice and Elliot Anderson. There is flexibility and Tuchel said John Stones might have played in the No 6 role had he not beenforced to withdraw with a muscle injury. But not too much flexibility.It is the same story with the formation. Tuchel said a back five could be an option but not for this camp or those that follow in October and November. He is thinking about 4-2-3-1.“This is where the focus is at the moment,” he said. “We have these three camps now and it’s not very likely that we will change [to three centre-backs] in these camps. But then we have March and it’s not so hard to learn to play in a back five. We told the players where they compete. We told them the formation that we’re going to play in these two matches. Once you have clarity, intensity will rise and follow.”Tuchel is braced to run into low-block defences against Andorra and Serbia; they have long been a spectacle killing curse forEnglandin qualifying ties. “It’s like chewing gum,” Tuchel said of the monotony of trying to find a way through.It will be about attitude. “Does the group love to play for England or do they just like to play for England?” Tuchel said. More than that, it will be about showing signs of an identity. It is time for solutions.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There, on the Piazzetta Reale, fans had gathered in a vast throng since the early morning to greet Hamilton as he prepares for his debut with Ferrari at their home race.The Piazzetta Reale – Royal Square – was an entirely apt locale as in Monza this weekend Hamilton and teammate Charles Leclerc are as close as any F1 drivers come to being considered royalty. The vociferous vocal acclaim that greeted them had begun 15 minutes before they appeared and all but drowned out attempts at interviews, according to Corriere della Sera.Lewis Hamilton prepares for Monza homecoming surprised by ‘volatile’ Ferrari startRead more“They sign autographs. It takes them more than five minutes to walk the 30 metres that separate them from the entrance to the Royal Palace,” reports the paper. “Every inch they walk, somebody stops them. Then they climb on to the balcony overlooking the square for the first greeting to the tifosi of the weekend. The party begins.”Ferrari, in Italy, at their home race, is an entirely different ball game. Were passion and unwavering belief enough, the Scuderia would be unbeatable this weekend at Monza, the tifosi would simply will them home. Yet as these fans have learned in the painful years since the Scuderia last won the drivers’ title in 2007, it is not sufficient. Yet here they are once more in the beautiful tree-lined parkland of the Parco di Monza again, eyes alight with hope and anticipation.Last year, hugely against the odds, they were rewarded. Ferrari had been almost one second off the pole pace at the previous round in Zandvoort, yet Leclerc and the team pulled off the most remarkable coup with a one-stop strategy to grab a win in Monza.Similar is not expected this year, although Ferrari did manage to reward the faithful with Hamilton and Leclerc taking the top spots in first practice, perhaps flattering to deceive on low fuel, because all season Ferrari have been off the pace and Hamilton in particular is struggling as he adapts to a new team and car.It has been hard, at times volatile, as even he conceded this weekend in Monza, where he will take a five-place grid penalty from an infraction in Zandvoort but was at least honest about how both sides had perhaps been taken aback by the work their partnership required.“Living the dream, moving to race with Ferrari I had the whole of last year to think about it and try to prepare but there are still things you couldn’t foresee,” he said. “There’s been a lot of adjustment both from my side and the team. They’ve really moved heaven and earth to accommodate me. Obviously, there are cultural differences.“Fred [Vasseur, team principal] made a comment that perhaps they underestimated me joining the team and the year we’ve been faced with in terms of the problems with the car.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton on his way to finishing fifth in second practice.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesIt had been, Hamilton said, an “emotional rollercoaster” with no sign of letting up, which is also perhaps part and parcel of being Ferrari, the team with the most storied, colourful and mercurial history.Indeed, when Hamilton and Leclerc appeared in Milan they were bedecked in blue shirts as part of the tribute to Niki Lauda claiming the championship for Ferrari at Monza in 1975, ending an 11-year drought for the team. Their cars, similarly, will run in the 1975-themed livery of Lauda’s 312T.It will be the same seventies shade of red and with the distinctive, white engine cover of Lauda’s and a silver rear wing mimicking the unadorned aluminium of 1975, before carbon fibre became de rigueur.Lauda worked with Hamilton extensively at his previous team Mercedes where the pair became close friends before the Austrian’s death in 2019, lending this weekend even more significance for the British driver.“I got to celebrate Niki at Mercedes, I got to celebrate winning with him, winning championships with him, and then to be able to come to Ferrari and then also be able to celebrate him here is really, really cool because his legacy continues to live on,” he said.“I know right now what he would be saying to me nowadays and it’s always in the back of my mind. When I didn’t do well he would always say ‘give them hell’, but [instead of hell] he would always say the word ‘arseholes’.”“At the beginning, I never understood. ‘What do you mean? You mean, give them hell?’. He was like, ‘no, give them arseholes’. He was just such a fighter.Lauda’s title that season, his first, was indeed a triumph. But the greatest demonstration of his fighting spirit came a year later when, just 40 days after the accident which had so nearly killed him at the Nurburgring, the Austrian defied every expectation by climbing back into the Ferrari at Monza. Few had believed he would ever even drive again, yet while in enormous pain, with the bandages that covered his extensive burns blood-soaked, Lauda demonstrated a bravery and determination that is unmatched. His fourth place in the race a triumph against all the odds.It was one of the reasons he was so respected and proved inspiring to so many drivers, including Hamilton, who has enjoyed such an enthusiastic reception from the tifosi this weekend. But much as they want a win, they also adore a fighter, a driver willing to give his all in therosso corsaand here Hamilton too surely fits the bill. A newIl Leonein the making perhaps, convinced that every setback is moving him onward and upward.“Honestly, the harder it is the better it can make you,” he observed going into the weekend. “This year has been tough for everyone in the team, but it prepares us for better days. We’ll be stronger having gone through this tough first six months.”In second practice Ferrari maintained a decent show, with Leclerc second to McLaren’s Lando Norris, who is looking to come back after the disappointment of retiring in Zandvoort that has left him 34 points adrift of teammate and championship leader, Oscar Piastri. The Australian was fourth in second practice behind the Williams of Carlos Sainz, with Hamilton fifth in front of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneLewis HamiltonMotor sportFerrarifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Of whom did Donald Trump say admiringly: “I also learned that he loves his country very much”? And: “He wrote mebeautiful letters. And they are great letters. We fell in love”?If you answered “Nigel Farage”, then I’m sorry. The Reform UK leader might have spent this pre-party conference week in his happy place – lodged several feet up the US presidential colon – and rhetorically demanding of US lawmakers: “At what point did [the UK] become North Korea?” But those Trump compliments were in fact previously made about Kim Jong-un, the dictator of … well, you know the rest.We always want what we can’t have, of course, which is why Trump this week had to settle for Farage grinning gormlessly next to his Oval Office desk like a competition winner, while Kim laughed it upwith Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinpingat a vast military parade in Beijing which featured, among other deranged martial curiosities, robot wolves. Good times. If you regard China as the US’s chief rival, then you can definitely see putative prime minister Nigel casting the UK as North Korea in the equivalent western pecking order. In a few short years, Farage might well be honking with laughter as the US’s robot coyotes slink past at Washington’s biannual Big Beautiful Ballistic Parade.Anyway, back to the present day for now. Although his presidential colonic timeshare must be maintained – use it or lose it! – Farage was ostensibly in Washington to slag off Britain, launch the US outpost of a TV station he works lucrativelyand tax-efficientlyfor, and beg for US help in combatting “the really awful authoritarian situation the UK has sunk into” on free speech.Before we go on, a quick word on that point. The UKisn’tin the greatest place on free speech, and could do with a serious rethink on where its priorities lie. Or at least, a serious think about making it make sense. Take those who agree with the new Green party leader that it’s entirely “proportionate” to arrest someone over tweets, but also reckon thatPalestine Action has done nothing wrong. But also, take Farage himself, whining this week about the “really awful authoritarian situation” in the UK, while his underlings exacerbate it in a quite ludicrous piece of free-speech hypocrisy. We’ll come to the full details of that in a minute. But you shouldn’t be able to have it both ways – even if the lessons of the past decade might have suggested to people on both sides of politics that you can.Still, no one on this Earth is having it both ways harder than Trump. No offence, but do we really have to take lectures on free speech from a country where his administration recently wrote a letter to the Smithsonian mandating a review of some of its museums and exhibits “in accordance with Executive Order 14253, Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”? This compulsory review, they added, was “to ensure alignment with the President’s directive” that museums say the things he wants them to say.Do we really have to take it from a country where universities are threatened with being defunded because they aren’t teaching in the way he wants them to teach? Do we really have to take it from a country where the president attacks the press at every possible opportunity and frequently seeks to weaken it? Do we really have to take it from a country with a leader who openly admires a whole array of grim dictators who have eliminated free speech in their countries? Do we really have to take it froma country with book bans? Not to be a bad sport, but I rather think we don’t.Nigel would disagree, of course. In fact, he’d love to help them out with the hypocrisy. Just as Republicans would much rather be conveniently preoccupied with European domestic laws while their own first amendment rights get eroded right before their eyes, so Farage would much rather swan off to Washington to be used as a pawn in partisan misdirection than stay at home and get involved with a free-speech horror show he most definitely can do something about.To Nottingham, then, which, while not as much as a glitzy power trip for Farage as Washington, is nonetheless a town where the council is run by his Reform party. And where, alas, the Nottinghamshire council leaderbanned his councillorsfrom engaging in scrutiny by the local press. Last week, Reform’s Mick Barton announced that because of a story about local government reorganisation, none of his councillors could speak to the Nottingham Post, its online arm Nottinghamshire Live, or a team of BBC-funded local journalists. This week, in the wake of a backlash against his fundamentalist huff against free speech, Barton updated to say his banonly applied to himself. Now, following Farage’s congressional committee session in which various contradictions saw the Reform leader being asked: “Do you agree with yourself?”, Nigel has finally said he would “have a little chat” with Barton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech, Oswald Mosley’s embrace of fascism,Keith Joseph’s 1974 speechapparently in favour of eugenics: each of these transgressions was punished and became infamous.According to believers in this country’s political moderation, the mainstream British right does not make overt appeals to prejudice, encourage political violence, form alliances with the far right, or advocate authoritarianism here or abroad. Unlike in other democracies, such as interwar Germany, our conservatism has always had red lines.Yet even if this reassuring picture was accurate in the past – and that is open to question – nowadays the British right appears to be on a much less cautious path. On law and order, immigration, net zero, multiculturalism, press freedom, the British empire, Donald Trump’s administration, the European convention on human rights, the condition of British cities and general state of the nation, leading Conservative and Reform UK figures routinely say inflammatory things, far outside the supposed bounds of responsible conservatism. This week, the chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Gavin Stephens, without naming specific politicians, took the unusual step of warning that those “in a leadership position” should not “sow division”.A radicalisation is under way on the right, encouraged by excited reactionaries in the media, thinktanks and academia, on a scale not seen since the feverish mid-1970s. What caused this transformation? And where is it leading?One driver is desperation. Not just the Conservatives’ frantic search for an escape from unpopularity; but a deeper restlessness and insecurity. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the free-market policies on which British rightwing politics has been based for half a century have lost much of their credibility – even for many conservatives, who have belatedly realised they are too socially disruptive. Brexit, privatisation and austerity – the right’s three other big projects – have also been discredited. So, no longer trusted by enough voters on the economy or the size and role of the state, the right has turned to culture wars, foreigner-bashing and hyperbolic national declinism. In July, at a Reform press conference on crime, Nigel Farage claimed that Britain is “facing nothing short of societal collapse”.Meanwhile, the Conservatives’ rightward march is being fuelled by frustration, anger and disorientation at being ejected from power for the first time since 1997. The fact that Keir Starmer, whom many Tories see as mediocre, is probably going to be in office with a huge majority for another four years, and possibly more, despite Labour’s endless troubles, adds insult to injury. For a Conservative party that believes it has the right to rule, however dire its governing record, interruptions to this ascendancy are increasingly hard to stomach.The contempt and outrage of the rightwing media towards relatively effective ministers such as Ed Miliband comes from a similar place of entitlement. The constant insinuations that such centre-left figures – a regular, yet rarely dominant part of Labour governments – are sinister and somehow illegitimate is another symptom of the right’s growing extremism: an intolerance of reforms that change Britain in any progressive way at all.Reform’s radicalism is, on the surface, less ill-tempered. The party has been on the up for months, and Farage’s speeches and press conferences revel in that, with huge promises, such as to “deport hundreds of thousands of people”, the product ofsurging confidenceas much as scaremongering about immigrants. Yet the blatant similarities between Reform’s policies and Trump’s – even at a local level, with Nottinghamshire’s Reform-controlled councilimposing bans on journalistswhose revelations it finds inconvenient – show the ominous direction of Farage’s party. Freedom of speech and individual liberty are endlessly invoked by the British right, but it believes that these freedoms should be ever more selectively distributed.View image in fullscreenBoris Johnson addresses the Conservative party spring conference in Blackpool, 19 March 2022.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty ImagesIn some ways, Britain’s current rightwing politics of mingled libertarianism and authoritarianism, slippery populist pledges and largely symbolic policies, originates in the already half-forgotten era ofBoris Johnson. He purged centrist Conservatives, illegally prorogued parliament, insulted Muslims and invoked English nationalism in ways that pleased the far right. Pro-Boris placards were waved at their rallies. Despite all his lying and rule-breaking, most of the rightwing media stayed loyal. Johnson’s path to victory at the 2019 election was eased by Farage’s Brexit party agreeing not to campaign in Tory seats. The British right became more uninhibited during these years, and has never really calmed down.Yet to fully understand the right’s current frame of mind, we need to look further back, to the reckless reactionary summer of 1974. Then as now, a relatively new, struggling Labour government faced an unpopular Conservative party with few fresh ideas. There was much talk of national decline. For many rightwing Britons, one group was to blame: not immigrants, but the unions. To tame them, solutions far beyond standard conservatism began to be considered, involving former soldiers, authoritarian rightwing activists and networks of “volunteers”.In July, the leader of one of these “private armies”, as they became known, a recently retired general, Walter Walker, told the London Evening News: “Perhaps the country might choose rule by the gun in preference to anarchy.” The then defence secretary, Roy Mason, warned of a “near fascist groundswell”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, in fact, this aggressive anti-union politics simply re-emerged in more respectable form, with Margaret Thatcher’s 1975 election as Conservative leader, supported by former participants in the private army projects.Today’s taboo-breaking right could also produce a dominant new conservatism – perhaps a fusion of Reform’s grievance politics with Robert Jenrick’s ever more authoritarian Toryism. Or it could be more illiberal still. This week, Jenrick tried to sound tougher than both Farage and his own party leader, Kemi Badenoch, arguing that asylum seekers should be confined in “rudimentary prisons”, rather than the “holiday camps” proposed by Reform.Even if the new right’s electoral breakthrough never comes – Farage and Jenrick are yet more divisive than Thatcher – its radicalisation has already had major effects: pulling Labour to the right, pushing the Greens to the left, and increasing interest in Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s new socialist party. Once one side starts ignoring the supposed rules of politics, the whole game can change.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Owner Julie Williams says she was inspired by model Cara Delevingne, who installed one in her LA home on the grounds that “you can’t really be sad in a ball pit.” Wise words, Cara, albeit ones suggestive of a life blessedly free of the experience of dragging screaming pugilistic toddlers apart at a soft play centre.Anyway. Julie had a spare room and, suddenly, a dream. So she bought 11,000 plastic balls and fulfilled the latter by filling the former with them. “It’s great,” she says. “This is the new relaxation method for mums and dads. Get a ball pit and hide away from the children.” I had thought my admiration for a woman who builds her own ball pit for fun could not increase but – to find that she did it andshuts the kids out so that she can enjoy it?

I won’t keep you in suspense: it is not me. I’m afraid the era of bobbled cardigans and Sainsbury’s leggings is not yet here. Instead, the job went to American Vogue editor Chloe Malle, the daughter of director Louis and actor Candice Bergen (who once played the magazine’s editor-in-chief in Sex and the City with many nods to Anna “Nuclear” Wintour’s tyrannical regime, which no doubt helped seal the deal for her offspring, given Wintour’s legendary sense of humour).Malle has her work cut out navigating a hostile economy and modern publishing landscape but imagine the glorious life that stretches before Wintour now. No more early morning tennis, daily blowdries, high heels or trademark sunglasses – she can see in colour any time she chooses for the first time in 40 years! She could even have a sandwich if she felt like it. It makes me genuinely joyful to think that she can now experience genuine comfort at last.What’s that? She’s staying on? Same office, different title? Overseeing Malle and the rest of the 27 international titles? Why? Why would you plan to die hungry in harness like this? Anna, please. Try one elasticated waistband before you decide. Or get yourself over to Cara’s gaff. There’s something there that might just blow your mind.WednesdaySweden is putting the finishing touches to its official “cultural canon” – and has left out Abba. People are head over heels at the news. I mean – mamma mia, what in the Fernando is going on? Excluding your greatest claim to fame, your most dominant export since the Vikings – that’s not the name of the game! Such is the controversy that officials may find they have met their Waterloo and have to send an SOS to the world. Voulez-vous this, really, Swedish powers that be?In fact the whole list is slightly off. Pippi Longstocking made the cut instead of Astrid Lindgren’s Bullerby children. Ikea’s original headquarters have placed, when it should obviously have been specifically and far more potently the Billy bookcase. And Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh dreary Seal has been recognised instead of Alexander Skarsgård in True Blood. It’s a travesty. Abba, if you’re listening – thank you for the music. Alexander – thank you for so much more.ThursdayI have done the worst thing. The very worst thing. I didn’t mean to, but I have done it and I don’t know how to move forward from here.I missed a hospital appointment. I had the wrong day in my diary and I didn’t realise. I am mortified. No Mangan has ever done this before. It is no more acceptable to disrespect a doctor – a doctor! – or spike the wheels of a clinic’s administration than it is to murder a puppy. In fact, I would place money on there having been more puppy killings than missed medical appointments in my family’s history, and I stress that I am neither aware of any dead canine-shaped blots on the escutcheon nor of any previous or extant members of the clan being that way inclined.I don’t know what to do with myself in this new reality. I may have to take the veil. Immure myself as a secular anchoress somewhere. Anything to show how sorry I am, prove that I am not the selfish moron you would assume. I’m just, you know, an ordinary moron. One who can’t, apparently, tell the difference between Wednesday 3 September and Thursday 4 September, 15.30. Please, forgive me?FridayI turn for solace to my mother. This is generally a mistake. But this time I ask for proxy comfort only, in the shape of her sole contribution to our culinary history – the sausage pie recipe, handed down through the distaff generations. I’ve never made it before because I like neither it nor cooking, but my son loves it and as I didn’t take him to enough ball pits as a child, my conscience smites me.So I call Mum for the recipe.“It’s skinned sausages, onions, Paxo and tomato ketchup,” she says. “Fry them. Put mashed potato on top. It’s very dry, so make a jug of gravy.”“Okay,” I say, scribbling it all down and hoping Yotam Ottolenghi doesn’t walk past. “And – quantities?”“What do you mean?”“How much of each thing.”“Enough for the number of people you’ve got to feed.”“But – proportions?”“What do you mean, proportions? It’s some sausages, some onion, some stuffing and some ketchup. A dollop. You dollop. You want it more sausagey, add some more sausage. You want it more oniony, add some onions. It’s not rocket science.”“I see,” I say. And I do. I see so much.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage: ‘Ribbit ribbit ribbit.’Photograph: Ian Vogler/MirrorpixExplore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekcommentShareReuse this content"

And that is all thanks to one manFri 5 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 11.23 EDTShareThings seem to be going well at the CDC, the federal agency charged with protecting US public health. By “well” I mean terrible, thanks to the leadership of the health and human services secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr. Not only is the agency in complete disarray under his leadership, but the secretary’s fringe agenda is now also putting the lives of everyone in the country at risk.Let me recount a few of Kennedy’s stellar accomplishments. He is, after all, a manlabeled“a crown jewel of this administration” by Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), a panel that has long developed scientifically based recommendations on the use of vaccines. Kennedy dropped them like a hot beaker andreplacedthem with new members, several of whom share his anti-vaccine views and half-baked skepticism of the most common mRNA Covid-19 vaccines.In Trump’s America, vaccination rates are declining and measles is spreading | Katrina vanden HeuvelRead moreCovid is still with us, unfortunately, and the vaccines are helping us survive a dangerous reality. In fact, 14,660 people have died of Covid as an underlying or contributing cause so farthis year alone. Yet, at his Senate hearing on Thursday, Kennedy wasaskedby Senator Jeff Merkley if he accepted the statistic that a million Americans had died of Covid since the outbreak began. “I don’t know how many died,” Kennedy responded. Meanwhile, the CDC’sown website, an agency he’s responsible for, tabulates the number of deaths as 1,234,371. At the same hearing, Kennedy also said heagreedwith the statement made by one of his appointees to ACIP that “mRNA vaccines cause serious harm, including death, especially among young people”. Never mind thatnumerousstudieshaverepeatedlyshown the vaccines to be safe and effective.That’s not all. Getting that Covid booster shot will probably become significantly harder in the future. In late August, the Food and Drug Administration, also overseen by Kennedy, approved some updated Covid vaccines, but at the same time severely restricted who would be authorized to receive boosters. Last year, anyone over the age of six months was eligible. But this year, you must be over 65 years of age or have an underlying health condition that increases the risk of severe Covid-19 infection.We should have seen something like this coming. In May, Kennedy took the unprecedented unilateralmoveto remove Covid-19 booster shots from its recommended immunization schedule for pregnant women and healthy children. “Our healthcare system is now solidly anti-children and anti-science,” Fatima Khan, co-founder of the Protect Their Future group, which advocates for vaccine access for children, toldCNN.Booster shots will still be available, Kennedysays. But what he’s not saying is that they will probably be a lot harder to find and afford. Private insurance companies generally base their decisions on covering the costs of vaccines by following government recommendations, and many states limit which vaccines pharmacists can administer based on those same recommendations. (California, Oregon and Washington recentlyannouncedan alliance to safeguard vaccine access.)The long and the short of it is that Kennedy is behind “a deliberate effort to weaken America’s public-health system and vaccine protections”. This is what Susan Monarez wrote in anop-edin the Wall Street Journal. Monarez served as the director of the CDC for a whole 29 days before she was ousted from her position. (Jim O’Neil, Monarez’sreplacement, is unsurprisingly a Trump loyalist with no medical or scientific background.) The ACIP isscheduledto meet later this month, and will discuss among other topics the Covid-19 vaccines. Monarez wrote that in August she was told to “preapprove the recommendations” to be made by ACIP. She refused. In another statement made through her lawyers, shesaidshe would not “rubberstamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts”.Kennedy, of course, has done all those things. Hefired2,400 workers (about 18% of the CDC workforce), laterrehiringabout 700 people. He has “severely weakened programs designed to protect Americans from cancer, heart attacks, strokes, lead poisoning, injury, violence and more”, according to nine previous directors of the CDC who sounded the alarm about Kennedy’s leadership in theNew York Times. He downplayed the use of highly effective vaccines during the largest single measles epidemic in 25 years in this country while cheering on the use of home remedies such ascod liver oil or vitamins.It’s all so ideological and irresponsible, leading predictably to horrible consequences. There have been threeconfirmed deathsfrom the measles outbreak, but they are not the only victims. Our collective trust in the government is perhaps the main casualty. After Monarez was fired,four senior officialsof the CDC resigned in protest at the politicization of the agency. More than 1,000 past and present workers of the Department of Health and Human Servicessigned a letterdemanding his resignation and stating that “Secretary Kennedy’s actions are compromising the health of this nation”. We’re now living through a battle between sane scientists and zealous anti-vaxxers, and nobody knows who will win.What do anti-vaxxers and the rightwing get out of such politicization of public health? They live in the same country as the rest of us, after all. Do they feel somehow healthier knowing that Joseph Ladapo, Florida’s surgeon general,aims to endchildhood vaccination against preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, chickenpox, polio and hepatitis? I certainly don’t. Routine childhood vaccinationspreventedabout 508m cases of illness in the US between 1994 and 2023. And he’s getting rid of them? Madness.Ladapoclaimsthat “what you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God”. OK. Fine. But none of us lives entirely alone, and your health affects my health, and vice versa. Living together means taking care of ourselves but also each other for our individual and collective wellbeing. It’s not rocket science. But it must be based on science.The right wing sees it otherwise. To them, the government response to Covid in particular and public health in general is leading us straight to “a regime of suppression, censorship, and coercion reminiscent of the power systems and governance that were previously condemned”. The result? “Human rights and individual freedom, as under previous fascist regimes, will lose,”accordingto David Bell of the Brownstone Institute, a thinktank established to oppose Covid-19 restrictions.But this seems a lot more like projection than any semblance to reality. Recent scholarship tends to point in the opposite direction, showing how social instability from the world’s last major pandemic before Covid, the 1918 global influenza pandemic, helped pave the way for the rise of theNazi partyin Germany and theFascist partyin Italy. Onestudyfound that “Mussolini’s newspaper tended to blame ‘others’ for the pandemic … and portrayed themselves as the voice of the common people against an out-of-touch ‘elite.’” Sounds familiar.Kennedy’s anti-science anti-vax agenda could have catastrophic health outcomes across the nation, helping fuel the rise of an even more extreme rightwing politics in the future. Could that result be what this government is even counting on? The idea sounds too far-fetched to be true, but I would also like to be alive when I’m proven wrong.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrOpinionUS healthcareTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Burgeoning membership and council seats as Reform UK tops 30% in the polls. Immigration is the boat that sailed him here: the more small boats arriving, the broader his wolfish grin.Primeinflamerofforeignerhatredthat he is, black and brown people report what they call the Farage effect in a wave of attacks: Mothin Ali, new deputy head of the Greens and a Leeds councillor, was attacked with bottles while with his family last week on Cromer beach in Norfolk, and racist abuse was hurled at them. He said that Reform rhetoric wascausing people to blameimmigrants and non-white people for Britain’s problems.As immigration powered the Brexit campaign, surely the most shocking Brexit failure for his supporters must be therise in immigrationthat followed. No wonder Farage never mentions Brexit now that its disastrous effects havestruck homewith most voters: Bregret grips 61%, who say leaving was more of a failure than success, only 31% still say leaving was right, while 56% think it was wrong to vote to leave the EU. Who do they blame? The Conservatives and Boris Johnson top the list, with more than two-thirds (67%) blaming Nigel Farage, the Ukip outsider who captured the Tory party.After the greatBrexitfailure, Farage and the Tories turn instead to leaving the European convention on human rights (EHCR), blamed for small boat arrivals of undocumented migrants. Escape from the convention is the new “take back control”. “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me” should be the warning to all who were taken in by the snake oil last time from Farage and Johnson, both life-long charlatans and deceivers. As was the case with Brexit, leaving the ECHR sounds simple: just quit and deport the migrants to anywhere.Leave aside moral and human rights questions, which are unlikely to influence Reform backers. Instead, confront them with the brutal facts about what leaving the ECHR means. This would be Brexit with knobs on, bringing yet worse damage to Britain and its economy. Leaving the EHCRwould jeopardisethe Brexit trade and cooperation agreement with the EU, as EHCR membership is a requirement of that partnership. This could project us into the “no deal” Johnson originally threatened. It is likely to mean sky-high tariffs and steep border barriers.As it is, the minimalist existing trade agreement led to thisOffice for Budget Responsibility assessment: “Our forecasts have assumed that the volume of UK imports and exports will both be 15% lower than if we had remained in the EU.” That 15% loss in trade “will lead to a 4% reduction in the potential productivity of the UK economy”. Now Farage and the Tories want to double down on that disaster.Catherine Barnard, professor of European law at Cambridge University, warns of all the consequences: it would immediately end the better deals being negotiated, such as easy animal and plant trade, she tells me. Food prices would rise, so would inflation, as trade falls. The Good Friday agreement would fall apart overnight: the ECHR runs through it “as in a stick of rock”, as with every EU agreement. (Farage admits he would have torenegotiate the agreement: good luck.) Outrage in Ireland at the fallout would ensure the EU took its revenge. Forget data exchange on crime or extradition of criminals.France would be among the most indignant: any assistance in preventing small boats would be stopped. In fact, as Barnard writes, leaving the ECHR would do nothing at all to aid deportations of migrants. The 1951 refugee convention is the one that bans “refoulement”, sending asylum seekers back to dangerous countries. But leaving that would, says Prof Barnard, have all the same political and trade consequences with the EU as leaving the ECHR.Pariah Britain even further out in the cold, divorced from its democratic allies and falling further behind them economically: that’s the exciting offer from Farage and the Tories, and it won’t even “stop the boats”.But “nothing can be done” is no answer, when people in every country feel their borders should be secure, delineating who belongs, who pays tax and who shares the public benefits. Rising numbers of small boat arrivals, which makes up only atiny proportion of total immigration, undermine the case for welcoming all the people we need to encourage here to build 1.5m homes, keep the NHS and social care on its feet, fund our universities, spur on our life-sciences and much more.Right across Europe, governments face the same dilemmas, the anti-immigrant right riding the wave. But there are moves to reform both the ECHR and the refugee convention, with nine EU leaderswriting a lettercalling for “reinterpretation”. The two leading signatories are the rightwing Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and Denmark’s Social Democrat prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. They call for making it easier to deport foreign criminals, which Barnard sees as a significant step towards change.A Europe-wide collaboration on rethinking asylum looks possible. Few think a 1951 convention designed for escaping political refugees was meant to cover everyone globally from any war-torn or poverty-stricken dictatorship in an era of easy travel. Nor does it make moral sense to rescue only those with the money to get to Europe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s impossible to imagine them working collaboratively with the EU on anything, let alone a complex rethinking of these conventions, as they protest that any Labour deal is sneaking us into the EU by the back door.At prime minister’s questions, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, asked: “Will the prime minister categorically rule out withdrawing from the ECHR or suspending it or watering down our rights in any way?” The PM replied: “We will not withdraw from the ECHR,” but added, “we do need to make sure both the law and other instruments fit the circumstances we face”. Yes indeed. But that can only be done by agreement. Labour needs to get on the front foot against Farage and the Tories. No better way than hammering home the damage their Brexit did, and how quitting the ECHR would bring us new kinds of hell.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageImmigration and asylumRaceBrexitEuropean court of human rightsEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

Between 2016 and 2022, the sheep population on the island of Cretemore than doubled. Or so claim Greek state records, which, over a similar period, reveal other curious trends across the country. The slopes of Mount Olympus are said to beswaddled with banana plantations, high-security military airports have beenturned over to olive trees, and pasture for goats and lambs nowextends off the landand out into the crystalline depths of the surrounding seas.All these claims are as ludicrous as they are lucrative, and they point to an embarrassing scandal that is roiling Greek politics: the revelation that for years, enormous sums of EU funds were being pocketed by individuals claiming them as subsidies for agricultural work that did not exist.Athird of the EU budget, more than is allocated to education and welfare and renewable energy combined, goes to subsidising the agriculture of member states. The more animals there are, the more land is allotted to them to graze – and the more cash gets distributed. In Greece, farming subsidies are dispersed from Brussels to the tune of€2bn a year, equivalent to about a quarter of the country’s wildly bloatedannual military budget.On the face of it, this emerging OPEKEPE scandal – taking its name from the acronym of the Greek state agency that oversaw the allocation of European farming subsidies – could be regarded as an act of revenge. A decade afteran economic crisis in which European technocrats imposed humiliating austerity measures on the Greek working class, havewily Cretan farmers started conjuring up millions of imaginary sheep and swindling back cash from Brussels?It’s a tempting interpretation, but it’s not the story here. In reality, OPEKEPE is looking like a con conducted at the behest of the same political elite that landed Greece in such catastrophic financial waters to begin with. A European investigation into OPEKEPE, begun in 2020 and carried out by the Luxembourg-based European public prosecutor’s office (Eppo), is alleging a cash grab that may have been “organised in a systematic manner” across the state.View image in fullscreenGreek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis delivers a speech during a debate on the no-confidence motion against the government, Athens, 7 March 2025.Photograph: Alexandros Beltes/EPAStarting possibly as far back as 1998, but appearing to ramp up with the election of the right-wing New Democracy party in 2019, Greece’s agricultural balance sheet was distorted. Auditorswere reportedly elbowed asideas plots of new farmland were registered to one individual one year, then transferred – on paper – to another the next. Crete was statistically tweaked into possessing half of Greece’s sheep, even as it became difficult to explain how they were producingless than a 10thof the country’s sheep milk. Bee populationsmore than doubledon islands raging with fires or parched by drought. Two Greek former ministers are alleged to have spent years “aiding and instigating the misappropriation” of EU agricultural funds.So many thousands of fraudulent or exaggerated claims now prompt unavoidable questions. Wheredid the money go? Who benefited? An investigation continues under Laura Codruța Kövesi, the head of Eppo, who endeared herself to Brussels when she was chief prosecutor of Romania’s national anti-corruption directorate by taking a blunt hatchet to her country’s political class,locking up hundreds of Romaniansin the most sweeping anti-corruption drive in recent European memory.It is evident already that the ruling New Democracy party – the dynastic old machine of the Greek right – is deeply involved. Thirteen of its MPshave been implicatedin OPEKEPE’s deceptions (as have a Pasok MP and a Syriza MP). A cabinet minister and four deputies have beenforced to resign. For his part, the prime minister and New Democracy leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has said he has “nothing to hide” andvowed to getto the bottom of the scandal, though he nowbalks at the ideaof a full-scale parliamentary investigation. He personallyreceived EU agricultural subsidiesfrom 2014 to 2021. (A government spokesperson has defended Mitsotakis’s actions, saying that he was under no obligation to give up his historical right to the funding and that “what applies to every landowner applies to him as well”.)“Who are you kidding, Mr Mitsotakis?” Nikos Androulakis, the president of the Pasok opposition,asked in Greece’s parliamentlast month. “Mr Mitsotakis is either complicit,” said Syrizain a party statement, “or being blackmailed by his ministers.”View image in fullscreenA snow-covered Mount Olympus – home to banana plantations, according to Greek state records.Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyThe scandal has also pulled back the curtain to reveal how power in Greece operates. Three OPEKEPE heads who questioned financial irregularities were reportedly tossed out, one after heattempted to blocksome 3,500 suspect subsidy applications, another afterblocking 9,000 payments. Wiretaps conducted by European authorities recorded officials who feared concerns being raised yet insisted on fraudulent payments being waved through anyway. As European inspectors arrived in Crete, farmers were reportedlywarned in advanceand ordered to shift herds around to keep up appearances. Flushing the island with European subsidy cash appears to have made a considerable chunk of its voting bloc happy. This was the point, Mitsotakis’s opponentshave argued. Indeed, in one of the more seismic realignments of the Greek political landscape of late, Crete – a former leftist stronghold – flipped to New Democracy in 2023. (The government’sspokesperson said: “The connection between the fraudsters under investigation and any change in the election result is unrealistic, a product of science fiction.”)Let’s call this scandal what it is: one more financial blow for which Greek taxpayers will again foot the bill. The fine already exacted by Brussels,approximately €415m, will be offloaded on to what has become the EU’smost overworkedyetthird-worst-paidcitizenry; to meet it, the equivalent of all 10 million Greeks would have to labour eight hours each at the country’s minimum wage. More fines are expected in the coming months as Kövesi’s investigation widens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He talks of technocratic overhaul, a “new Greece”, a land airlifted out of the depths of financial destruction and managerial chaos. But crisis after crisis unfurls every contradiction in these assurances. In 2022, his nephew wasforced to step downas general secretary amid the exposure of a ridiculous spyware operation – only for talk to begin of himreturning to his uncle’s officetwo years later. In 2023, Mitsotakis’s minister of infrastructure and transport resignedfollowing a train crashin which 57 people were killed after safety warnings over Greece’s rail system were ignored – only for him to slip back into his former parliamentary seat once the uproar of mass outrage had begun to subside.Such scandals are treated like inconvenient public-relations dust-ups in which the problem isn’t a political class that cycles in and out of office with impunity but Greeks who demand consequences of those who lecture about accountability.Greece is already a place where the narrative of resplendent new prosperity – an emergent tech hub booming with foreign investment–has proven illusory for most. But increasingly it threatens to devolve into something else: a place where the people are told the corruption that keeps devastating their finances and their trust is just one more figment of the imagination.Alexander Clapp is a journalist based in AthensDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If a ministertakes the hit earlyand with contrition, they may be able to rebuild their career once public anger cools.Ms Rayner’s departure is also notable for the balance of Labour and the government. Sir Keir’s reshuffle looks less like renewal than a coup by Labour’s “modernising” clique. Ian Murray’ssackingsevers a bridge to Anas Sarwar’s Scottish Labour, which had been tacking leftwards, just as the Holyrood election looms, whileLucy Powell’sremoval sidelines one of the few cabinet allies of Ed Miliband, the soft left’s champion. Yvette Cooper’s shift to the Foreign Office is an admission of failure over small boat crossings and leaves scant room for dissent on Gaza given her record on protest. Rebranding welfare as a growth department under Pat McFadden signals a downgrade for Liz Kendall after her Commonsdefeatover benefits cuts.David Lammy’s rise to deputy prime minister leaves Labour led by two north London lawyers - a sharp contrast to Ms Rayner’s northern, working-class authenticity. Shabana Mahmood’spromotionto home secretary, Steve Reed’s elevation to housing and Peter Kyle’s move to business emphasise the influence of Sir Keir’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. This is a cabinet that may deliver coherence, but at the cost of balance, ideological diversity and connection with the party’s broader base.Ms Rayner’s resignation exposes a more crucial tension between the deputies that Sir Keir chooses and the one that the party elects.Darren Jones’s arrival in Downing Streetas “chief secretary to the prime minister” adds to the confusion with Mr Lammy. Yet Labour’s deputy leader is not a technocratic role: it is elected by members and unions, carrying its own mandate and the power to oversee any leadership contest.Ms Rayner’s exit sparks a battle over Labour’s future. With Reform rising, crises abroad and public trust ebbing away, the party risks looking inward rather than outwards. But an election for deputy leader will take place. Though high thresholds make a left challenger hard to field, it isn’t impossible. Ambitious “modernisers” such as thehealth secretary, Wes Streeting,will no doubt be weighing up the odds, but the contest risks reviving factional strife just as Labour needs unity. A new party chief whip might help. It’s hard to see a Labour MP who voted for – say – cuts to disability benefits winning. While Sir Keir works to impose his will on government, the greater danger lies in an unpopular leader’s failures becoming part of an open contest for Labour’s soul among the membership.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He never talked down, and never dumbed down eitherFri 5 Sep 2025 13.20 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareOver the years, a select few BBC radio programmes have carved out distinctive niches in the nation’s affections. High on many people’s lists of such radio treasures are probably programmes like the Archers, Desert Island Discs and, now into its second century, the Shipping Forecast. Another shoo-in member of this small and exclusive club – broadcasting’s equivalent of the Order of Merit – is surely Melvyn Bragg’s long-running Radio 4 programmeIn Our Time.In Our Time embodies something fundamental to media. It is living proof that it is possible to beboth serious and popular. So good was the programme, right from the start, that Lord Bragg and his guests managed to turn one of radio’s traditional “graveyard” slots – the hour after 9am on a weekday – into one of the BBC’s most enduring jewels. They did it by the simple expedient of talking interestingly about important and sometimes difficult subjects. Who would have guessed?In Our Time is a misleading title for a programme that is as much concerned with the timeless and the historic as with the contemporary. Each week, the programme simply takes a person, a movement, an idea, a theory or an area of study that has shaped the world – and explains its importance. A group of three experts, mostly from universities, recount the main facts and tease out the significant arguments over the course of 45 minutes, with Lord Bragg holding the reins. What they deliver is consistently among the most listened to speech programmes and podcasts on the radio. The programme is, though, about to lose its presiding spirit. Lord Bragg confirmed this week that, at 85, he isstepping downfrom the job he has done since 1998. He has been a presenter to treasure, happy to keep out of the way before asking a succinct question to move things on, an object lesson to presenters who hog the limelight and try to show off their own knowledge. Away from the radio studio, he has been a tireless champion of the arts and of public service broadcasting. This programme, though, is the best of him. A hard act to follow.The reasons for that are easy to pinpoint. In Our Time is aimed at the listener who wants to know more, or whose imagination can be caught by intelligent and informed talk. It is not snobby, not metropolitan (Lord Bragg, a proud Cumbrian, would not permit that) and not chauvinist, but truly international. It exists to broaden the mind, andit succeeds. It is also a rare oasis of media civility, proof that it is possible to disagree about difficult and important subjects while still getting along. It is appropriate that what turns out to have been Lord Bragg’s final In Our Time, broadcast in July, was an exploration ofthis very subject.In Our Time’s greatest achievement is that while it never talks down to listeners, it never dumbs down either. Each programme is focused, butthe range is immense. Notable episodes stretch from the foundation of Ancient Rome to incompleteness theorems in mathematics, from Anna Akhmatova to Rabindranath Tagore, and from the 18th-century gin craze to the Higgs boson. There have been well over 1,000 programmes since the launch, and there is no sign of them stopping or running out of subjects. Happily, the programme was a pioneer BBC podcast, and many of its episodes are easily retrieved and can still be enjoyed. Long may it continue.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

People will suffer – and Labour will gain absolutely nothingDiane TaylorBritish politicians’ rhetoric has become increasingly shouty and hateful. And now the home secretary has joined the chorusFri 5 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 11.04 EDTShareIt’s been a busy week for asylum-seeker bashing. Had it not been for the forensic scrutiny of the deputy prime minister’stax affairs, the onslaught against people seeking sanctuary would have been even more intense.Monday’s bombshellwas an announcement from the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, about the suspension of refugee family reunion until next spring. Until now, for families who have been through hell due to war and conflict in their home country, the prospect of finally being reunited in a safe country after one member has been granted refugee status haskept them going. That hope has been snatched away, as the government officially stopped taking applications for the programme on Thursday at 3pm.Further bad news spewed out. Appeals (often against flawed initial government decisions on asylum claims) will now be handled bypeople with less expertisethan the highly qualified judges who currently hear these cases. Trained members of the public – no further details provided – will make these life and death decisions.Asylum accommodation is a Premier League-level political football. Warehouses arebeing considered, the home secretary declared, when asked for the millionth time why asylum seekers are still luxuriating at taxpayers’ expense in hotels.Threatening “we’ll send you home” messages sent to 130,000overseas studentsfollowed, failing to mention that students from war zones who claim asylum can’t be returned there at present. And new life has been breathed into the old chestnut ofID cards, along with intensified raids on workplaces to root out illegals wherever they might be concealing themselves and scamming us, no mention that those working illegally are probably being exploited and paid a pittance. Government also omitted to mention that there are alreadyoptions onlinefor employers to confirm whether or not their employees have the legal right to work in the UK.But this week’s announcements are unlikely to be the end of it. It seems that no punishment is harsh enough for asylum seekers. The government is determined to compete with the rhetoric of Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, and the shadow justice minister, Robert Jenrick, who in turn are competing with each other to see which one can “out-nasty” their political rival. In an interview in the Spectator, Jenrick said Farage wasnot going far enoughwith his proposal for cabins with a fence round them to accommodate asylum seekers, and is calling for “a decade of net emigration”.Asylum seekers, especially those who are newly arrived in the country, have often not grasped the complexities of UK politics, and are unaware of how politicians from mainstream parties are scapegoating them to score points and gain votes. They are much more likely to listen to the news about the latest developments in their home country than what is going on here, anxiously checking to see if the area their family lives in has been bombed overnight.Most want to work hard, pay taxes and contribute. The resourcefulness, resilience and energy required to make their difficult journeys are qualities many employers look for in their staff.They are often unaware of the tropes around luxury hotels, especially when they spend their days scrubbing mould off the walls of their rooms, trying to trap rodents and avoid bits of crumbling ceiling falling on their heads. They are also unaware of the images of grinning young men on a dinghy sailing on a sea as smooth as glass, used over and over again by some sections of the media, sending a message to the British public that they are chancers having a laugh at our expense.In reality, it is more likely that a dinghy crossing the Channel will be overstuffed with people screaming and crying, frantically trying to bale out water, crushed and bruised because of the severe overcrowding and convinced they will not make it on to dry land.The mismatch between the realities of asylum seekers’ lives and the increasingly hateful rhetoric of shouty politicians, amplified by large sections of the media and social media, has never been greater. It is steering government policy in a disastrous direction and causing deep fissures in our society.The prime minister isquick to show empathyfor those who oppose migrants, saying he understands their frustration about small boat crossings and hotels in their communities, but he is silent on the other side of the story. Maybe he has forgottenthis casein 2003, and others where he passionately defended the rights of asylum seekers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But ministers will never be able to satisfy the likes of Farage and Jenrick, however low they go. An increasing number of asylum seekers are being accommodated at a bleak former military base, Wethersfield, in Essex. Local residentscompare it to “a stalag”. Nobody can claim people are living in luxury there. Yet a national demonstration has been organised in nearby Colchester later this month to protest about asylum seekers being accommodated at the base with the words: “None in, all out.”Meanwhile, far-right influencers are calling for remigration – ethnic cleansing and mass deportation of people who aren’t white.It starts with asylum seekers, but unless the government replaces its current rhetoric with one about community cohesion and all humans having equal value, it won’t end there.Diane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil libertiesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In 2026, it will be displayed at the British Museum as part of a landmark cultural partnership with France, while the Bayeux Tapestry Museum in Normandy is closed during the construction of a landmark new building. In return, some of the UK’s greatest treasures – including the Lewis chessmen, the Sutton Hoo helmet, the Mold gold cape, and the Dunaverney flesh hook – will travel to Normandy.Understandably, there has been interest in how these priceless items will be moved and concerns about their safety (‘La tapisserie, c’est moi’: Macron accused of putting politics first in Bayeux tapestry loan, 30 August). I want to be clear about the detailed work under way in both countries. Since a partnership agreement was signed earlier this summer, experts on both sides of the Channel have been carrying out rigorous planning and due diligence to ensure the safe transport and conservation of the tapestry. Colleagues in France are preparing for its careful removal before work begins on their new museum, and intricate plans are being made for its journey to London. This expert-led collaboration – indeed, supported for 12 years by one of our leading specialists on the Bayeux scientific committee – will guide every stage, including a full dry run of the journey.When displayed at theBritish Museum, the tapestry will rest on a state-of-the-art table, designed to support its long-term preservation while allowing visitors to view it in a striking new way. That same table will later be used when the Bayeux Museum reopens, ensuring continued conservation of this unique masterpiece. This exchange represents one of the most significant cultural collaborations of recent times, strengthening British-French ties while safeguarding shared heritage for generations to come.Nicholas CullinanDirector, British MuseumThe Bayeux tapestry is far too valuable and fragile to travel to the British Museum. We should welcome the spirit of the gesture by President Emmanuelle Macron, but reject the plan to put it on display in London. Instead let’s put our support behind those conservators who know this 1,000-year-old work of art and history far more deeply than politicians.It’s a misguided attempt by the leaders of two nations to show solidarity between them. Damage to the tapestry in transit to and from London would be disastrous for Anglo-French relations. Why not an animated display of the whole tapestry using the remarkable new technology we are seeing in art exhibitions around the world these days?Mark VaughanBristolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The commission had said at the time that the only way to satisfy antitrust concerns about Google’s lucrative digital ad business was to sell off parts of its business. However, this decision marks a retreat from that earlier position and comes amid renewed tensions between Brussels and the Trump administration over trade, tariffs and technology regulation.Top EU officials had said earlier that the commission was seeking a forced sale because past cases that ended with fines and requirements for Google to stop anti-competitive practices have not worked, allowing the company to continue its behavior in a different form.The commission’s penalty follows a formal investigation that it opened in June 2021, looking into whether Google violated the bloc’s competition rules by favoring its own online display advertising technology services at the expense of rival publishers, advertisers and advertising technology services.

It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The settlement’s higher award – approximately $3,000 per work – probably reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, the CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement “an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors’ works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Novotná cried on the duchess’s shoulder after blowing a 4-1 lead in the third set.During the exchange the duchess, whose husband was president of the All England Club for more than 30 years, told Novotná: “I know you can do it.” Five years later the duchess presented her with the winning trophy.In 1999 the duchess became disenchanted with the Wimbledon authorities when she was refused permission to take the young son of the murdered headteacher Philip Lawrence into the royal box.0:50Jana Novotna on Wimbledon defeat and the Duchess of Kent's comforting words - archive videoThe duchess, who preferred to be referred to as Katharine or Mrs Kent, dropped her HRH title when she stepped back from public life in 2002.She went on to spend more than a decade teaching music in a state primary school in Hull. After visiting Wansbeck primary school in the city in 1996, she offered to help with music teaching and gave a weekly 40-minute lesson, as well as working with its choir. She also taught part-time in a school in Hammersmith, west London, which was attended by some of the children who lived in Grenfell Tower.After retiring as a royal she also volunteered for Samaritans, toured countries as a Unicef ambassador and, in 2004, founded the charity Future Talent. The organisation works to break down barriers and give children from low-income backgrounds equal opportunities to excel in music.After the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, Katharine was the oldest member of the royal family.In 1994 she became the first royal to convert to Catholicism for more than 300 years. She is expected to have a Catholic funeral, attended by senior royals including King Charles and Queen Camilla. It will be the first Catholic funeral service held for a member of the royal family in modern British history.Her funeral is expected to take place at Westminster Cathedral in the coming weeks. It is thought to be likely that the archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, will preside over the mass.For many years she led a separate life from the Duke of Kent but the couple did not divorce.Born Katharine Lucy Mary Worsley on 22 February 1933, the future duchess had an aristocratic upbringing as the only daughter of the landowner Col Sir William Worsley – a baronet – and Lady Worsley of Hovingham Hall, near York.She married King George V’s grandson Edward, Duke of Kent, labelled Steady Eddie by the royal family for his dependable service, in a grand ceremony in York Minster in 1961 and became known for her elegant style.View image in fullscreenThe Duke and Duchess of Kent after their marriage service at York Minster in June 1961.Photograph: PA MediaBuckingham Palace said in a statement that the duchess died peacefully on Thursday evening at her Kensington Palace home surrounded by her family.The palace said: “The king and queen and all members of the royal family join the Duke of Kent, his children and grandchildren in mourning their loss and remembering fondly the duchess’s lifelong devotion to all the organisations with which she was associated, her passion for music and her empathy for young people.”Explore more on these topicsMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

In second place, with $272.3bn, is the investor and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.The incentive plan, revealed in afiling to the US Securities and Exchange Commissionon Friday, comes at a time when some observers have questioned whether Musk’s outspoken political views could be holding Tesla back.The carmaker’s European salesfell by 40% earlier this year, a dramatic slump that some analysts attributed to Musk’s vocal support for far-right political parties, and his intense but short-lived alliance with Donald Trump.Musk has also divided his duties between Tesla and the stewardship of other ventures, such as SpaceX, Neuralink, xAI and the Boring Co, on top of the time he spends posting on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, which he bought for $44bn in 2022.“One minute Tesla’s board is wondering if Elon Musk is a liability to the company given his outspoken views and political distractions, the next they’re effectively saying ‘pick a number, any number’ to lock him in for as long as possible,” said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at the London-based stockbroker AJ Bell.He said the pay package “beggars belief”, questioning whether one person could be worth that much.But in its statement to shareholders, signed by directors Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, Tesla offered Musk an outspoken vote of confidence, describing him as its “visionary leader”.The company also referred investors, a majority of whom must support the pay deal for it to go through, to the difficulty it has previously had in securing incentives for Musk.The filing referred to a legal challenge that has prevented it from following through on apay deal announced in 2018that gave Musk the chance to claim a $55.8bn bonus.Acourt ruled last yearin favour of a group of investors who claimed that the scheme’s targets had been inappropriately set. An appeal by Tesla is due to be heard next month.“Ultimately, the new award aims to build upon the success of the 2018 CEO performance award framework, which ensured that Elon was only paid for performance delivered and incentivised to guide Tesla through a period of meteoric growth,” the company said.Tesla said the new plan included profit targets that were 28 times higher than the 2018 scheme and would also hinge on delivering new products, such as getting1m “robotaxis” in operationand delivering 1m AI bots, humanoid robots that the company is developing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Therefore, it feels like many investors would happily approve it.“The bigger question is whether this proposal sets a new precedent and boardrooms across America will think it’s OK to add a zero or two on to the end of current remuneration packages.

About 55m litres of paint go to waste in the UK every year, which is why one organisation is trying to create a circular paint economy by recycling it.Community RePaintis a UK-wide paint reuse network that collects leftover paint from drop-off points and redistributes it to individuals and groups in the community. They started in 1992 as a research project in Leeds called the Waste Wagon, led by a consortium of waste and recycling organisations and set up in response to concern from the local authority about the high cost of paint disposal and issues around household hazardous waste. The goal was to find out how many homes had paint to dispose of, and how much.Researchers went out to knock on doors, and according to David Squire, Community RePaint’s community network coordinator, they found that “on average, 17 tins of paint were sitting there unused”. So they decided they would collect it. A year later, the pilot project for Community RePaint was set up, and three decades later, 100 people staff the UK-wide network.View image in fullscreenStaff from the Cambridgeshire branch of Community RePaint.Photograph: Dulux / Community RePaintGrowth is gentle, but now “businesses have started to reuse paint in the community”, says Squire. The organisation is bringing recycling centres on board, a critical node in the paint-gathering network.One by one, barriers are being broken down. For example, many local councils do not accept liquid paint for recycling because it is considered hazardous. Although this is done, in principle, to protect the environment, it actually increases the likelihood of people leaving their leftover paint to waste. Community RePaint wants councils to see accepting paint as a “win-win” situation. “We’re trying to change more councils to accept surplus paint … it saves council money as reuse is far cheaper than disposal.”For the past decade, Community RePaint have sold their own brand, WeColour, which is made up of 97% recycled paint, made by separating the collected paint and remixing it. It’s currently the cheapest paint you can buy in the UK while, Squire says, “still having the good quality of major brands”.They sell to schools, gardeners and community-led projects in particular. The network recently supported thepollinator pathway projectin Bristol and aforest recycling projectin east London.They’ve also been behind some distinctive street art, working closely with the street artistAlecLDN(real name Alec Saunders) to make the longest eco-mural in the UK, using their preloved paint. Saunders covered Dugdale art centre in Enfield with a mural that showcased the diversity of the area’s history, including portraits, musical notes and filming equipment, and followed that up with a 77-metre mural in Union Park, the first major park to open in the Wembley neighbourhood for 150 years, celebrating the Wembley population with portraits of people from the area, picked by a selected panel. “It was also intertwined in flora and plants,” said Saunders, “since the park itself is filled with flowers specifically planted for bees to pollinate.”View image in fullscreenA new mural at Wembley Park.Photograph: Chris Winter/Wembley ParkHe points out that: “People think reused paint will be dirty, but the quality was better than fresh paint that I’ve used. With their paint I just had to use one layer, while with others you need multiple layers.”Although sponsorship from Dulux is helpful, Squire admits it is financially difficult to make the network completely UK-wide: “Our mission this year has been to grow the network so that we are operating across the whole of the UK, but we are still short on resources.”It feels, he thinks, like an idea that should be catching on. “People know places to get secondhand clothes, like Depop and Vinted, but they don’t really think of that for paint.” Reuse and recycling is slowly becoming mainstream, but it is still slow to take hold. “The government has struggled to produce a ‘bottle return’ scheme, which has been on the agenda for 10 years. We have to rethink waste as a resource, rather than a nuisance or something to get rid of.”To Squire, a circular economy is the key – an economic model in which resources and products are continuously reused, repaired and recycled. Though smaller organisations already do this, “it needs to be bigger and pushed more because it could transform society as a whole”, he says.As long as paint wastage occurs in the UK, Community RePaint will continue its work. Squire is proud of their growing influence in communities: “This project shows that if you can, you just have to keep going and focus on community needs.”Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesRecyclingWasteEthical and green livingCommunitiesLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That was only the third time that temperature has been recorded in the country in September.The mercury rose again the following day, climbing to 40.8C in nearby Ashcroft. It has been an intensely hot and dry summer across Canada, which has fuelled an extreme fire season – its second worst on record. The country experienced its worst wildfire season on record in 2023, when more than 17m hectares (42m acres) burned.Smoke from wildfires has travelled over the Atlantic this summer, bringing hazy skies to Britain. Extreme heat and damaging wildfire seasons are expected to continue as the climate crisis alters weather patterns around the world.Meanwhile, farther south, a large and destructive hailstorm lashed parts of central and southern Kansas and northernOklahomaon Wednesday afternoon, damaging infrastructure and property in the city of Wichita and neighbouring towns.View image in fullscreenStorm chasers often gather to watch extreme weather events in Kansas.Photograph: John Finney Photography/Getty ImagesThe US National Weather Service had warned of severe thunderstorms in the area from 4pm local time, highlighting the danger of large hail and strong winds.Two powerful supercells developed near Salina and moved south towards Wichita, Kansas’s largest city. A supercell is a thunderstorm that contains a rotating updraught that allows it to maintain its strength for long periods. Strong updraughts such as these can produce large hailstones by keeping them aloft within the storm for longer, giving them time to grow.Wednesday’s deluge produced large hail along a 120-mile (190km) path through Kansas and into Oklahoma, with the largest stones up to 75mm (3in) in diameter, as big as a baseball.There were reports of damage across Wichita, including smashed windscreens and sunroofs on vehicles, damage to houses and trees, with gusts of 75mph (121km/h) recorded in Sedgwick County.Hailstorms cause billions of dollars of damage in the US every year.Explore more on these topicsCanadaWeather trackerKansasOklahomaAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

But just 17.6% of the world’s land and8.6%of the seas are now under global protection, and more than 100 nations areless than halfwayto meeting the target, whichwas establishedunder the2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.Governments will need to implementswift changesif they are to achieve the target within the next five years. But setting aside more space for nature can be a political pitfall. Often it can mean restricting people’s access to land, halting resource extraction and relocating human settlements. These issues, along with possible effects on economic growth, are often cited by countries as barriers to expanding protecting areas.Researchpublished last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, however, suggests that more than 80% of the public across eight sampled countries support the policy.Aksel Sundström, a political scientist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and a co-author of the study, said: “There has been a sentiment among policymakers that they are not sure if people are actually interested in having this massive expansion. But I think from these data points, we can say that public opinion does not seem to be a big hurdle in terms of making this expansion possible or viable.”In their survey of 12,000 people from eight countries – Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and the United States – Sundström and his colleagues found high levels of support at the domestic level.Argentinian and Brazilian respondents were the most supportive of their governments expanding protected areas – at 87.9% and 90% respectively. Swedish and US respondents were slightly less in agreement, at 66.3% and 71.2% respectively. Public support across all eight countries averaged 82.4%.Researchers chose the eight countries to reflect the views of both the global north and south, as well as to reflect varying levels of protected areas. Survey respondents were representative of their country’s demographic make-up.Although only eight nations were surveyed, “given how consistent many of these patterns are, it seems plausible that people in similar countries should have similar preferences”, said a co-author, Patrik Michaelsen, also at University of Gothenburg.Biodiversity declining even faster in ‘protected’ areas, scientists warn Cop16Read moreResearchers found that people were more supportive of the target when the responsibility to protect nature was divided equally among countries and governments were not allowed to pay their way out of domestic protection or pay to protect areas in other countries rather than invest in conservation at home.There was also a strong consensus that richer countries should shoulder most of the costs to achieve the target.For those working to build more political support for the 30x30 target, the results of the new survey were heartening.Susan Lieberman, vice-president of international policy at the WildlifeConservationSociety, said: “[We] work in five of the eight countries studied, and we are encouraged by the results. We believe that on this and other issues, citizens across the globe want their governments to take strong action to protect biodiversity and conserve nature.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsMarine lifeThe age of extinctionBiodiversityConservationWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

For children, it takes them outside, away from screens and develops their cognitive and physical skills. And for parents it helps build community ties and vital social networks.”The study’s participants, from the London borough of Tower Hamlets and Bradford, who influence urban planning in their respective local authorities, told researchers that developers saw play space as a “nice to have”, which led to a “constant kind of challenge between building up housing and keeping enough green and open space and amenity space and play space”.The difficulties of recruiting and retaining good local authority staff, the effects of austerity, the pandemic and Brexit were also cited as barriers to effective urban planning.Furthermore, “well-intentioned but fragmented” urban planning policy within these local authorities was deemed to be problematic, with “play” and “physical activity” being used interchangeably.For example, Tower Hamlets council’s “play charter” was described by participants as a “collection of catchphrases” that lacked a meaningful action plan.Greater regulation, such as national statutory guidance requiring developers to prioritise provision of playable space over quantity of homes, could help mitigate these competing interests, said the study.A recent study revealed thata third of children across the UK do not play outdoors after school, with children living in less deprived communities benefiting more from outdoor play than those in more deprived communities.Dr Amanda Seims, from the Bradford Institute for Health Research and Lancaster University, and co-author of the latest study, said: “Compared to their parents’ generation, the amount of time today’s children play outside has declined by 50%. But this downward trend doesn’t have to be inevitable.“Thoughtful planning, which listens to the voices of children and young people, can produce accessible, enriching environments where children can develop.”Tower Hamlets council and Bradford council have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyChildrenLocal governmentAccess to green spacenewsShareReuse this content"

Local media had reported that a German father had died and a mother was seriously hurt while their 3-year-old child suffered minor injuries.The German foreign ministry said at least three German nationals were in hospital.The injured also include Spanish, Israeli, Portuguese, Brazilian, Italian and French citizens, according to the executive director of Portugal’s national health service, Álvaro Santos Almeida.Downing Street said Keir Starmer was deeply saddened to hear of the death of the three Britons.A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister is deeply saddened to hear that three British nationals have died in the funicular crash in Lisbon. His thoughts are with their families and those affected by this terrible incident. We stand united with Portugal during this difficult time.”Lisbon mapThe wreckage of the Elevador da Glória vehicle was removed from the scene on Thursday night and taken by police for examination as a day of national mourning ended. The chief police investigator, Nelson Oliveira, said a preliminary police report, which would have a broader scope, was expected within 45 days.Investigators have not found any evidence of sabotage, leaving mechanical failures or maintenance issues among the possible causes.The Glória line carries about 3 million people, tourists and residents annually. Its two cars, each capable of carrying about 40 people, are attached to opposite ends of a haulage cable, with traction provided by electric motors on the cars.On Thursday, the leader of the Fectrans union, Manuel Leal, told a local television station that workers had complained that problems with the tension of the cable that hauls the carriages had made braking difficult, but added it was too early to say if that had caused the crash.Carris, the municipal public transport company that operates the service, said “all maintenance protocols” had been carried out, including monthly and weekly service programmes and daily inspections.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I still believe that dredging rivers and cleaning rivers out, for me, is the most important thing.”The inquest heard that on the evening of the flood, fire and rescue services “did all they reasonably and safely could” to save Gilbert but had to stop once it got too dark. A request was made for Gilbert’s home to be reinspected the following morning, but due to aDerbyshirefire and rescue service’s control room systems going down, the request did not come through and no reinspection occurred.View image in fullscreenMaureen Gilbert with her mother and father.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianPaul Gilbert, who spoke during the inquest, which began on Monday and lasted throughout the week, had told the court that he did not blame the services for the technical failure, but still wished he had not been the one to find her body.“The failings of the system going down and messages not being passed on is hard,” he said. “Because if that had have happened and the fire service had have gone in and found my mum, I wouldn’t have had to find her which has been one of my biggest nightmares since that day, finding my mum, but systems do go down.”‘We can’t live in this’: the tightknit Chesterfield street devastated by floodingRead moreKewley said he was “satisfied it cannot be said, on balance, that the outcome necessarily would have been different if that reinspection had taken place” and that Derbyshire fire and rescue had taken “significant steps to learn and identify improvements following Storm Babet”.The Derbyshire fire and rescue service deputy chief fire officer, Clive Stanbrook, said in a statement: “I would like to reiterate our sincere condolences to all of Maureen’s family and friends who have lost someone they loved in devastating and distressing circumstances.“I want to give assurances that we have already learned from this incident, we have invested heavily in our systems and we have made changes to our operational processes, something noted by the coroner.”Explore more on these topicsFloodingDerbyshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Home to the Giorgio Armani headquarters since 2000, the sprawling space includes a purpose-built theatre where each show season a catwalk is constructed.On Friday, crowds again began to gather outside, but this time the mood was much more sombre. They had come to pay their final respects to the visionary Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani,who died on Thursdayat the age of 91.Announcing his death, the fashion company said it would set up a funeral chamber at its headquarters, giving people an opportunity to view the casket and pay their respects from Saturday to Sunday. Following Armani’s wishes, the funeral on Monday will remain private. With barriers now being erected along the street, long queues are expected to form.‘A void that is impossible to fill’: tributes paid to fashion designer Giorgio ArmaniRead moreArmani was affectionately referred to as the “king” or “maestro” of Italian fashion. His journey from humble beginnings in wartime Piacenza to global fashion icon was deeply admired. From fashion to beauty to hotels, restaurants and even chocolates, he leaves behind an empire rumoured to be worth more than £9bn.View image in fullscreenFlowers left outside the Armani Silos exhibition space in Milan.Photograph: Mourad Balti Touati/EPABeatrice Manca, a freelance fashion journalist based in Milan, plans to visit the chamber on Saturday. “Armani was more than a fashion designer in Italy; he was a source of national pride,” she says.Paola Locati, an independent fashion communication consultant, will also attend. “It strikes me to think that as of tomorrow, Mr Armani will be for the last time just a short distance away. I will go and say a final goodbye, I am sure there will be lots of people, because he was loved and admired by the general public, his creations the aspiration for many, two friends of mine got married in his suits. A true master has left us, and he will be sorely missed.”The mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, has declared Monday a day of national mourning. In a statement Sala said Armani “was and will always be one of the greatest representatives of Italian and Milanese fashion in the world”, adding: “Milan will miss his creative vision, his active participation, and his support for the life of our city.”1:12Giorgio Armani: a celebrated fashion icon – video obituaryArmani stores in Milan have closed and are expected to remain shuttered until after the funeral. Stores in London will close at 2pm on Monday. On YouTube, channels including CNN have set up live streams from outside the headquarters.Manca says his death “has affected even those who did not love or follow fashion”. She expects larges queues at the chamber. “Many of whom may never have seen a fashion show. Everyone dreamed of being part of the dignified, industrious, and sophisticated world created by Giorgio Armani.”Although Armani had been absent from his last three fashion shows owing to illness, he had been expected to attend the brand’s 50th anniversary show, which closes Milan fashion week later this month. He was also due to attend the opening of a retrospective at the Pinacoteca di Brera. Featuring more than 150 archive looks, it is the first time the museum has hosted a fashion exhibition and the first dedicated to a designer. Both events are still expected to go ahead.Explore more on these topicsArmaniItalyFashion industryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is a limited-edition jersey intended to rally funds and solidarity for Gaza.Bohemians, a north Dublin side better known as Bohs, collaborated with the Dublin rock groupFontaines DCto make the jersey.

The UN secretary general,António Guterres, has said the Gaza famine is a “man-made disaster”.Thunberg’s wearing of the jersey has delighted Irish activists and will probably bolster Israeli perceptions that Ireland – its government, artists and at least one football club – are hostile to Israel.Bohemians is afan-owned clubthat has acquired a reputation for social advocacy by championing marginalised groups inIrelandas well as Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

I managed to get through it because so many people supported me.”Akuzawa climbed with his daughter Motoe, 70, his granddaughter, her husband, and four friends from a climbing club. His achievement has been recognised byGuinness World Records.View image in fullscreenKokichi Akuzawa was 96 the first time he became the oldest person to scale Mount Fuji. He has since overcome heart issues, shingles and stitches from a climbing fall.Photograph: Hiro Komae/APThe group camped for two nights en route before their ascent on 5 August to the top of Mount Fuji, which is Japan’s tallest mountain at 3,776 metres (12,388ft).“I’m impressed I climbed so well,” he said, communicating with the help of his 75-year-old daughter Yukiko, who repeated questions into her father’s ear because he is hard of hearing. Akuzawa added that he didn’t take any mountain for granted at his age. “It’s better to climb while you still can.”The trip was not Akuzawa’s first record-breaking ascent of Mount Fuji. He was 96 the first time he became the oldest person to scale the mountain. In the six years since, he has overcome heart issues, shingles and stitches from a climbing fall.Akuzawa spent three months in training before the Fuji climb, waking at 5am for hour-long walks and tackling roughly one mountain each week, mostly around the Nagano prefecture in central Japan.Surrounded by relatives and framed paintings of mountains in his home in Maebashi, about 150 miles (241km) north-west of Tokyo, Akuzawa recalled what first drew him to the mountains 88 years ago. While the magic of reaching the summit was undeniable, it was the people who kept him coming back.“I climb because I like it,” he said. “It’s easy to make friends on the mountain.”View image in fullscreenAkuzawa, centre in the blue helmet, climbed with his daughter Motoe, 70, his granddaughter, her husband, and four friends from a climbing club.Photograph: APAkuzawa worked as an engine design engineer and later as a livestock artificial inseminator, a profession he held until he was 85, his family said.“Whether you liked studying or not, you could enjoy the mountain just the same,” he said. “Intelligence didn’t matter up there. We were all on an equal footing and moved forward together.”Akuzawa used to enjoy climbing solo, but as his strength decreased he leaned more on the help of others. His record climb in August was another test that he passed with assistance.“Mount Fuji isn’t a difficult mountain, but this time was harder than six years ago. Harder than any mountain before,” he said. “I’ve never felt this weak. I didn’t have pain, but I kept wondering why I was so slow, why I had no stamina. I’d long since passed my physical limit, and it was only thanks to everyone else’s strength that I made it.“I’d love to keep climbing for ever, but I guess I can’t any more. Now I’m at the level of Mount Akagi,” a nearby summit about half the height of Fuji at 1,828 metres (5,997ft).Akuzawa spends his mornings volunteering at a senior care centre and teaching painting at his home studio.View image in fullscreenKokichi Akuzawa and his daughter Yukiko, at his home that is decorated with his paintings of mountain landscapes.Photograph: Hiro Komae/APMountaineering and painting demand time and dedication but both offer peace, he said. “People who climb mountains, people who paint; if they can create something whole on that path, that’s the most fulfilling thing,” Akuzawa said.Akuzawa’s daughters want him to paint Fuji at sunrise for the next addition to the depictions of mountain ranges covering his living room walls.“I’ve got a lot of requests,” he said. “I want to paint some scenes from the summit of Mount Fuji, places that hold special memories for me, since this was probably my last time reaching the top.”Explore more on these topicsJapanMountaineeringGuinness World RecordsOlder peopleAsia PacificMountainsAgeingnewsShareReuse this content"

The pop singer is 35; O’Connor, who works in public relations and lives in Long Island, New York, is just one year younger. “I’ve been a fan since day one, back in high school, and she’s been there through every phrase and journey of my life,” O’Connor said.So when Swift announced her engagement to NFL starTravis Kelcelast week, O’Connor reacted as many thirtysomething women do when they learn that a girlfriend secured a ring. First, she screamed so loudly her boyfriend thought someone had died. Then she wondered aloud to him: “When’s it going to happen for us?”“It would be fun to be engaged with her at the same time,” O’Connor said. “I’ve been showing my boyfriend photos of the ring and saying how unique it is. That’s not my style, but we talk about what I might like.”Whatever [Swift] chooses to wear is going to set a huge tone for the next couple of yearsElisabeth Kramer, wedding coordinatorO’Connor is not the only one. Swift’s Instagram announcement – a photo in which she and Kelce embrace in front of an elaborate floral arrangement – raked in more than 1m likes in less than 10 minutes; it’s now up to 36m. “We needed this,” read oneVogue editorial. New York Times columnist and chick lit author Jennifer Weineragreed: “Maybe love still wins.”On social media, fans spoke of the news with parasocial investment. One cringe-inducing poem widely shared in the wake of the newsread:The dayTaylor Swiftgot engaged,little girls screamed,grown women cried,and the awkward childwe all carry insidefinally feltchosen.A big day for little girls and grown women perhaps, but D-day for the people dating Swifties. “How do I tell my boyfriend he needs to propose ASAP so I can be engaged at the same time as Taylor Swift without sounding crazy,” one fantweeted. “When I’ve been with my boyfriend longer than Taylor swift has been with Travis kelce yet THEYRE ENGAGED? we literally have a child IM HEATED,” wroteanother.On TikTok, boyfriends of Swifties postedinformative videosabout her career and history to help each other follow along with their partner’s excitement. “It’s time to get the ring, because Taylor and Travis put you on the clock,”saidone comedian on the app. “Showed this to my bf,” a follower commented. “Me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years … when he comes home I’m gonna start an argument and show him Taylor’s ring,” wrote another.O’Connor’s boyfriend also feels the half-serious pressure. “Anytime I say something about Taylor and her wedding, he kind of rolls his eyes and says: ‘I know, I know,’” she said.View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift performs onstage during the Eras tour in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 30 June 2023.Photograph: Taylor Hill/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights ManagementElisabeth Kramer, a wedding coordinator based in Portland, Oregon, said it is too early to tell how Swift’s wedding – which does not yet have a date – will affect the industry. But she is banking on some trends emerging from it. “I definitely see it being part of the conversation for my 2026 clients,” Kramer said. “Whatever she chooses to wear is going to set a huge tone for the next couple of years.”Swift’s engagement may be a boon for the wedding industry, which saw a post-Covid boom that is slowing down amid inflation and the current economic climate. (One survey found thatfewer Americansare planning to have weddings this year, down from 7% in 2024 to 4% in 2025.) “I’m hearing from a lot of vendors that 2026 is going to be a lot quieter, with people more hesitant to spend money,” Kramer said. “I’m interested to see how a Taylor-Travis engagement changes that. Maybe people see them getting engaged and think: ‘This is an OK thing to do.’”A Taylor-made proposal: what Swift and Kelce’s engagement pictures sayRead moreCelebrity weddings encourage copycat brides, especially when it comes to dresses. Princess Diana’s taffeta wedding gown inspired countless dupes. Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy’s sexy, simple bias-cut dress defined 90s sleekness, while Kate Middleton’s lace Alexander McQueen frock brought back bridal sleeves.Julie Sabatino, founder of the wedding styling company The Stylish Bride, predicts that Swift’s pick might join the ranks. “She’s no stranger to a gown,” Sabino said, alluding to the series of ballgowns Swift donned for her Eras tour. “I wouldn’t say the ballgown wedding dress has ever gone out of style, but maybe people who wouldn’t have considered it will now.”O’Connor, the wannabe bride, said that Swift’s engagement has become “a new joke” between her and her boyfriend, as the pair makes light of their unmarried status. But for now, she is not holding her breath. “We just have a lot going on at the moment,” O’Connor said. “But she’s definitely planted a little extra seed.”Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftTravis KelceKansas City ChiefsNFLWeddingsWedding dressesUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It involves a “gnarly” eight-floor apartment block on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, a rooftop party turned sing-off and a debut show at Brooklyn’s coolest bar. So it’s mildly disappointing to discover that only one member of the trio still calls the Big Apple home.“I’m the last one standing,” Sabrina Cunningham confirms as she appears on Zoom, calling from her home in Brooklyn. She’s followed by Nya Gazelle Brown, who completed the band’s recent European tour, including a sold-out show at north London’s 3,000-capacity Roundhouse, while seven months pregnant. “I moved to Maryland over Covid,” Brown says. “I needed to stretch out and I wanted to be around family.” The last to arrive is London-born Piya Malik, who now lives in Los Angeles. “We are just very nomadic,” she says.It was in LA that the band recorded their forthcoming third album, Cut & Rewind, which finesses their unique blend of psych-tinged 70s disco, 80s post-punk and hypnotic three-part harmonies. While their influences – they cite Minnie Riperton, Liquid Liquid, ESG and the Lijadu Sisters as inspirations for the new album – and old-school recording techniques (everything is painstakingly put to tape alongside backing band Orgone) suggest a retro fantasia, their lyrical themes are firmly rooted in the present. “We’re not singing olde worlde stories,” says Malik, by far the chattiest of the trio. In fact, recording sessions for Cut & Rewind, which was created in the gaps between touring, were often a means of collective purging: “It’s all of us together in the room, feeding off of each other’s energy, exchanging ideas, melodies, sounds and politics,” Malik continues. “Bringing humour into the most sordid dark stories of the internet.”On the shimmery Norma, taken from 2023’s critically acclaimed second album Silver, they rail against the 2022 overturning of the Roe v Wade ruling, while new song She Who Dares opens by imagining a not-too-distant Handmaid’s Tale-style dystopia in which “six hundred thousand women” will be imprisoned for “speaking out of turn” among other “crimes”. The pain is couched in strutting vintage funk and R&B, and by the chorus the song morphs into an anthem “about really empowering other women”, says Cunningham. “It’s like the ones who care are everywhere if you look for them.”Disco Life, meanwhile, turns the 1979 Disco Demolition Night – a publicity stunt turned riot at Comiskey Park stadium in Chicago, in which records by predominantly Black and queer artists were burned – into a celebration of the titular genre. (Such is their love for disco that their name is a play on Chic’s single C’est Chic, while asurprise message from Nile Rodgersduring an appearance on a CBS morning TV show last year reduced the band to tears.)Keen not to be defined purely as an “issues” band – “You can’t think about and dwell on [the state of the world] 24/7,” says Brown – they are also aware that Say She She’s very existence makes its own statement. “Just being who we are is political,” says Malik, who left a job working with the former Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas to move to New York in 2013 because she couldn’t face another Tory government. “We’re women of diverse backgrounds and women have always been political because there’s never been a time where it hasn’t been contentious to be a woman or a femme. But, no matter what’s going on, we have to push ourselves to remind people of the beauty in this world, too. Music is medicine and we want to contribute to the medicine cabinet.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re not going to be invisible’ … Say She She.Photograph: Shane McCauleyThe trio bonded over the love of music and a penchant for sharing that love publicly. Having moved to Manhattan from upstate New York straight from graduating high school, Cunningham was in “a bunch of bands, singing back-up [and] singing with friends”. Living above her – in that gnarly eight-floor apartment building – was Malik, who could often be heard not only stomping around at 2am but also singing. The pair became fast friends (“She probably thought: ‘I’m gonna make friends with her so I can tell her to change her shoes,’” laughs Malik), often watching each other perform in their respective bands across the city. Malik then introduced Cunningham to Brown, whom she’d met at a Brooklyn house party that ended with the two of them harmonising on a rooftop.Music is medicine and we want to contribute to the medicine cabinet“Piyawalked in all cool with her British style,” remembers Brown, “and I was just like: ‘Who are you?’ Within seconds we were singing at each other. Then it went to singing at each other out at brunch or, you know, anywhere.”Say She She’s official formation was stalled slightly by the fact that each member was finishing other projects. They also didn’t have any of their own songs. Not that it stopped Malik, who signed them up for their first gig at Barbès, a cool musician hangout in Brooklyn, in 2018. “We hadn’t quite convinced Nya to join the band yet,” explains Malik. “She was working on solo stuff and we were like: ‘Come on you can do it.’”They got a third singer to fill the gap, meaning Brown was in the audience to watch her soon-to-be band’s debut gig. She was also being watched herself. In the crowd to catch brass experimentalist headliners SlavicSoulParty! was a certain Robert Plant. “Obviously, he wasn’t there to see us,” laughs Malik. “No one knew who the hell we were. And he was definitely staring at Nya the whole way through the show.”From there, the band recorded a clutch of songs during the pandemic that would eventually emerge in 2022 as their more lo-fi and soft-focus debut album,Prism, in 2022. A year later came the richer Silver, which earned them an appearance on Later … With Jools Holland, five-star reviews and a reputation as a live tour-de-force. Malik remembers a moment performing Norma during an all-ages show in the US in front of “a sea of girls and it was just so amazing to see all these young teenagers screaming and shouting the lyrics with us”. The show at the Roundhouse was also a big moment, especially for Malik, who went to school not far from the venue in Camden Town. “It was life-changing,” she says.Malik’s smile suddenly fades. While the shows were a success, she claims they didn’t make any money from the tour and “had to pay all the expenses”. She says they were reticent about bringing it up, fearing the negativity would distract from the music, but she’s clearly fed up. “The things that have happened to us in the music business are shocking and it’s important that people realise it’s happening from all angles.”With this album, Say She She are keen to put themselves out there more and more, be it in interviews, or in how their art is presented. While the cover art for their first two albums featured abstract images, Cut & Rewind is adorned by a photograph of the trio in stylish power suits staring down the camera. “When we started, we were conscious of being women who were trying to use our bodies, or our sexuality, or our identity, to push something,” Malik explains. “We didn’t want to be objectified – we wanted to be taken seriously as artists.” But it also felt like hiding, something Say She She will not do. “Now it feels political. Now it’s like: ‘Hey, we’re not going to be invisible.’” The band nod in unison, that New York confidence never far from the surface.Cut & Rewind is released by drink sum wtr on 3 October. Say She She tour the UK and Ireland from 21 to 26 November; tour starts Oxford.Explore more on these topicsMusicDiscoSoulDance musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Their last was 2015’sThe Lady in the Van, a slight, mostly unmemorable film blessed by a spiky Maggie Smith performance but cursed with an uneven tone. Unlike that, and their previous two works together on screen, this wasn’t based on a play but it often feels like it and, at too many points, that it also maybe should have been one instead. There are moments of creaky comedy and some bluntly emotional dialogue that one can more easily picture in front of a specifically catered-to live audience.From Knives Out 3 to Soderbergh: 10 films to look out for at the Toronto film festival 2025Read moreOn a big screen, The Choral is a little out of place, its only moments of pure cinema courtesy of the spectacular Yorkshire scenery. Well, that and those when starRalph Fiennesfully takes command, an actor who adds not just weight and class but also one who gives a more studied and delicate performance than many of those around him. The star is having a bit of a moment after bothConclaveand28 Years Laterand while this project is in a far lower register, and far less likely to be meme-friendly, it’s further proof of his remarkable flexibility. He plays Dr Guthrie, a choir master hired by desperate locals in 1916, a time of loss and confusion, with many already dead or missing and many others waiting to be conscripted. It’s meddled with the social order and allowed for some to find space they might not have otherwise occupied, shown in the new makeup of the choir, which Guthrie must craft and control.He’s a divisive choice, an expert in his field but one whose reputation has slowly been sinking since the war. His many years spent in Germany (they simply respect the arts in a way that the Brits do not, he insists) and his “peculiarities” (read: gay) make him a risk at a time of intense nationalism and religious adherence. But his unimpeachable talent quickly transforms the town, uplifting voices that hadn’t been heard at such a volume before, helping to provide hope to those sorely in need.That number can be a little too high in The Choral, a film that busies itself with too many characters in need of too many scenes there just isn’t enough time for. There’s Roger Allam as a grieving mill-owner cursed by a love of music but a lack of talent, Robert Emms as a pianist harbouring a secret crush on his choir master, Alan Armstrong as a funeral director surviving via gallows humour, Emily Fairn as a woman dealing with the return of her note-perfect singer husband who she presumed dead while experiencing a new flirtation, Amara Okereke as a God-fearing Salvation Army member struggling with romantic feelings and Mark Addy as an open-minded photographer meeting for illicit trysts with Lyndsey Marshal’s local prostitute. The film tries to smoothly flip between these stories but, as with many an overstacked ensemble piece, we find ourselves craving more time with some while spending far too much with others.What too often happens is that whenever Bennett spends time focusing on something knottier or darker, he quickly returns to safety instead. The most effective moments are the most difficult – Fiennes hiding grief for his German lover while others applaud the sinking of his ship, an injured soldier begging the wife who no longer loves him to provide some sad carnal pleasure one last time, the acknowledgment that accepting artistic genius might also mean embracing a life of sorrow, the idea that maybe removing a certain section of men from society allows for wider equality – but they’re too fleeting to really provide the pangs that they should. Broader sentiment over war being destructive and community being important is prioritised but never handled with enough specificity to edge us close to the grand emotional response the film wants us to have. There’s a cup-of-tea cosiness that dances past bigotries and hardships over race, gender and sexuality, leaving the film’s worldview feeling a little too rose-tinted, closer to a Hovis advert than reality.When the big choral finally comes, there’s something a little anticlimactic to how Hytner shoots (and lights) it and then after, something a little meandering about how Bennett chooses to close out his story, tying things up with a too messy bow. We should be up on our feet but it’s hard to find enough energy.The Choral is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released in the UK on 7 November and the US on 25 DecemberExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalRalph FiennesAlan BennettFestivalsNicholas HytnerSimon Russell BealereviewsShareReuse this content"

Premiering at theToronto film festival, it’s likely that might be the case for many international attenders here, and the Irish directors Glenn Leyburn and Lisa Barros D’Sa set themselves the lofty task of translating the overwhelming scale of a very 2002 tabloid scandal for those who weren’t knee-deep in the hows and whys. Words like soap and drama are thrown around, while one commentator compares the public outcry to that seen after the death of Princess Diana. How did a fight over cheese sandwiches turn into such a frenzy?Erupcja review – Charli xcx gives acting a trial run in shallow friendship dramaRead moreAt its heart, Saipan is a workplace drama about the danger of mismanagement and the inescapability of office politics, it pulses with the relatable anger that erupts from the feeling of unfair treatment. It just so happens that the workplace is the world of football and the warring employees are two highly paid household names reaching boiling point as the World Cup looms. Steve Coogan is Mick McCarthy, a player turned manager, taking charge of theRepublic of Irelandteam as they make a rare appearance in a global tournament they’re not typically associated with (it was their third, and to date most recent, World Cup). The media is perhaps rightfully crediting this to the involvement of Roy Keane, played by Éanna Hardwicke, whose success as part of Manchester United has levelled the national team up, whether McCarthy likes to admit it or not. They have a spotty history (we hear a brief reference to an on-pitch spar years prior) but both are entering a crucial period on best behaviour, aware of the many eyes on them. Longtime Shane Meadows collaborator Paul Fraser’s script lightly stacks up bones of contention in the months before flying us to Saipan, the location of a poorly defined team trip that’s part gameplay prep and part R&R. Keane, an often humourless workhorse, is already struggling to play ball, annoyed at the ostentatious excess of the Football Association of Ireland and unsure of McCarthy’s decision-making.We soon learn that he had reason to be suspicious as the ill-advised getaway spins out of control. The hotel is junky and crumbling (Keane compares it to Fawlty Towers) with barely functional AC, unsafe sporting facilities and those aforementioned sandwiches for food. Keane’s view of himself and what he does might seem grandiose (he’s seen watching, and clearly relating to, footage of Muhammad Ali on the flight over) but the stakes are higher than they’ve ever been and his demands are not unacceptable (a fellow player dramatically gasps at his ask for a different meal, to which he replies, straight-faced, “It’s egg on toast”). But it’s less what he expects than how he asks for it, his manner alienating not just McCarthy but the players around him. The film follows this descent from forced pleasantries to an all-out slanging match, as tensions explode outside of backrooms and into the press, elevating a work dispute into a media scandal. Leyburn and Barros D’Sa’s last film was the unusually sensitive and cliche-avoidant drama Ordinary Love, about a couple dealing with a terminal cancer diagnosis, and while the topics couldn’t be more different, there’s a similar level of care and restraint here.Before the film starts, the standard “this film is a dramatisation” legal messaging that’s often kept for the end credits is shown first, nodding to a story that may never be known in full and one that still inspires impassioned opinions from many. The film shows that McCarthy and Keane make ill-advised choices along the way but it’s clearly more in Keane’s corner, a convincing and at times moving portrayal of someone who just believes in basic fairness and honesty grappling with a world and a particular system at odds with him. Hardwicke, an actor unfamiliar to most, is an electric presence, a real star find of the festival. He has the self-possession of someone confident in his ability and moral code and the bristling fury of one who can’t believe that those around him can’t quite live up to it. Coogan, continuing his unlikely career as one of England’s most reliable character actors, is excellent but it’s Hardwicke who steals it and their final, blistering confrontation is an escalating thrill to watch, as full-body rage finally takes over.So much of the film is designed to stoke a response that even as someone at a distance from the original story, I found myself oscillating between surprisingly intense emotional reactions. There’s something frustrating and eventually sad about watching men unable to resolve a conflict that could have been fixed by the smallest amount of humility or admitting wrongdoing (it would make for a fascinating piece of workplace training on how not to manage someone). At a game-length 91 minutes, Saipan smartly comes and goes with speed (for all of its anger, it’s also a breezy, funny time) but it’s the rare football movie that’s worth a replay.Saipan is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released at a later dateExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalSteve CooganRoy KeaneFestivalsRepublic of IrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

An oddly intense mother-son relationship. Plenty of conversational cut and thrust. This melodramatic psychological thriller parades its genre signifiers like a badge of honour. It centres on the relationship between Cherry (Olivia Cooke) and Danny (Laurie Davidson). She’s an ambitious, cunning, thwarted estate agent who is looking for a shortcut up London’s social ladder; he’s a slightly gormless, grinning rich boy. When Danny brings Cherry home to meet his parents, his uptight, manipulative mother Laura (Robin Wright) smells a rat. Thus begins a battle of wills between two women whose mutual suspicion quickly turns into deep antipathy.Prime Video, from Wednesday 10 SeptemberAKA Charlie SheenView image in fullscreenConfessional … AKA Charlie Sheen.Photograph: PATo say thatCharlie Sheenhas had a tumultuous life is an understatement.

But that is just the beginning of her problems as other family members struggle to accept her new primacy. Furthermore, Kimmie doesn’t really know how the business works and with a crowd of vultures waiting for her to fail, she’ll have to learn fast.

Joni, who was at the seance but now works as a child psychologist, is forced to confront her past when 27 years later another teenager goes missing in almost identical circumstances.

But while some of his peers casually throw any old chum into the sea knowing that fans will still feast on it, Snoa keeps his quality at a remarkably high level.The ethereality of producer 444Jet’s beats on Snoa’s July album 2il De4th Du Us 7art make it a classic of the cloud-rap genre, while the bass he tends to rap over, maximally throbbing into redlined distortion, means he feels somewhat aligned with the ragers thrown down by Playboi Carti, Che, OsamaSon and other contemporary US names. But one track he’ll sound like Bladee warbling about existence, the next like Giggs gruffly slating his enemies, and this mutable flow and his equally varied beat selections (some self-produced) mean you can’t hem him into any one sound.His home city is rarely documented in rap so it’s nice to have local details, whether sarcastically upbeat about the drug trade on Plan (“Welcome to Leicester, it’s popping here / K2, whip, e-scooters are profiting”) or morose on City: “It’s like talking to a brick wall when you in Leicester … Race wars, postcodes, 25 sides, everybody so divided.” He sounds superb slinging club-ready chatter over classic grime on 1ne After Another, while Dodecahedron is like a lo-fi Neptunes beat made for a bouncing secondhand Toyota Yaris. “How much longer do I have to wait before I blow?” he complains on the latter.

Couples took him at his word. Now, he’s turned the experience into an album and novelFri 5 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTShareOn a video call from his Gothenburg apartment, Jens Lekman is contemplating the 132 weddings at which he has performed. “When you play a normal show, everything follows a schedule. At a wedding, you never know if you’re going to get punched by someone’s uncle or go skinny dipping with the couple.” He pauses. “And that’s what I like: putting myself in weird, awkward situations.”These include passing out inside a large but poorly ventilated wedding cake. “It was a small wedding and a lot of stuff was DIY. It wasn’t fun to realise they had forgotten the air holes.” Or a man nearly dying on the dancefloor. “Yeah, that happened, too. But he made it.”You may know Lekman as the Swedish indie star whose forlorn love songs can simultaneously break your heart and make you laugh. You may not know that, ever since his 2004 song If You Ever Need a Stranger (To Sing at Your Wedding), he’s been taking requests to do just that. In the beginning, “it was just random people who had heard the song,” he says. But, after an Australian couple shared a video of him playing their wedding in 2013, he was suddenly inundated with requests: “I owe them a lot of gratitude.”View image in fullscreenInspirational … Jens Lekman says playing weddings helps his creativity.Photograph: Chris AlmeidaIn retrospect, he’s always been made for the job. Since the early 00s, Jekman has made records defined by wry yet kind-hearted observations about romance and heartbreak. He named his 2012 album I Know What Love Isn’t and, on To Know Your Mission, from 2017, Lekman tells us he just wants to listen to people’s stories. He says the weddings have only underscored this purpose: “I want to be of service to the people who the music means something to.”With streaming making it ever harder to make a living from music, playing weddings also became a way to get by financially, as well as providing inspiration for his own songwriting. Lekman recounts a story about the director, John Waters, getting picked up while hitchhiking through the Nevada desert. “What the hell are you doing out here?” the driver asked. Waters replied that it helped provide inspiration. “That’s what the weddings are for me,” Lekman says with a smile.His new album is called Songs for Other People’sWeddings, and comes with a novel of the same name written with David Levithan, author of books including Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist. They’ve been friends for 20 years; just before the pandemic, Lekman reached out with an idea for something about “my parallel career as a wedding singer”, having wondered whether it could be a TV show or musical.Levithan was all in. “The situation was so tantalising,” he says on the same call. “The idea of writing about these weddings from the point of view of the wedding singer was something I would never have thought of in a million years.”View image in fullscreenJens Lekman, right, playing at a wedding in Colorado in 2011.Photograph: Ben SwansonThe result is a “novel-with-songs” formed from what Lekman calls “a dialogue between me and David about love and relationships”. It tells the story of the romance between a wedding singer called J and his girlfriend V, through 10 weddings at which he performs. Lekman’s accompanying album imagines what happens in between the book’s chapters: he was inspired by albums with stories running through them, such as the Streets’ A Grand Don’t Come For Free and Frank Sinatra’s Watertown.The result is “purely fictional but, at the same time, emotionally very much both of ours”, as Levithan puts it. Given that it’s the story of a Swedish singer who plays weddings, it blurs art and life: “I love the confusion – and I don’t think there’s really any way around it,” Lekman says, though they decided to change the main character’s name to J: “In the first chapter I wrote, he was named Jens and that wastooconfusing,” says Levithan.It’s part of the fun in Lekman’s storytelling, wondering how autobiographical his hapless and hopeless romantics really are. Levithan says he explains Songs for Other People’s Weddings to friends as: “I’m writing somebody else’s autofiction.” Lekman, meanwhile, says it’s “definitely David’s story”, but admits Levithan “asked me for anecdotes – what it’s like to jump out of a wedding cake, for example”.Lekman was also able to channel the breakup he was going through at the time into tracks like Wedding in Leipzig – with its darkly droll lines, “So this is the singles table, these are my people / Does anyone have cyanide, a razor blade or a pistol?” The track, he says, “is about what it means to be alone. I’m 44 now, so that’s definitely something I thought a lot about during that time.”Working through these feelings and writing the songs made him consider his lifelong relationship with music. “I realised J was describing something to me that I hadn’t formulated for myself yet,” Lekman says. “I was at a point in my life where I was searching for purpose. In this era of streaming, music has become like a scented candle. And singing at weddings is reversing that for me. I began playing weddings because I just thought it was a fun, weird thing to do. And then I realised that these moments were the most important point in these people’s lives. You’re not the reason people are there. Your job is to be a midwife, delivering these people into the next phase of their lives. It was that connection that I was searching for.”One couple he “delivered” was Rich Thane and his wife, Grace Goddard, who both work in the music industry. “We’ve been mega fans for as long as we can remember,” says Thane, so having him play was “equal parts the most surreal and most natural thing in the world”. Watching on was “a mixture of our friends losing their minds and family members who had no idea who he was but were visibly thrilled it was happening. The entire room just shared in a collective joy.”This shared delight exemplifies Lekman’s purpose. Yet he’s surprised at how often people want to hear songs that don’t seem “suitable for a wedding, like Maple Leaves – these sad breakup songs. But they tell me they don’t just want a bunch of happy, lovey-dovey songs, they want the ones that acknowledge the other side of it. And I think they’re on to something.”David Byrne, Little Simz, Jasmine.4.t and more: the best music of autumn 2025Read moreAs a wedding singer, Lekman has seen all kinds of ceremonies. “It’s always fun to play at a billionaire’s wedding, when they come riding in on horses and there’s fireworks,” he says. “But I’ve always been really touched by the very simple ones where it’s, ‘Meet us at this hill at this very particular point which is important to us’, and it’s just a small gathering and a beautiful little ceremony.”In the novel’s dedications, Lekman says he hopes his presence at these occasions “turned out to be a blessing and not a curse”. The video for the album’s lead single, Candy from a Stranger, features footage from Lekman’s various wedding performances. “I got in touch with a lot of the couples. Of course, some have divorced, it’s been a long time,” he says. “But, percentage wise, it seems to have been a blessing.”The album Songs for Other People’s Weddings is released via Secretly Canadian on 12 September.

It contains 48 poems, each representing a kilogram of bodyweight, with the book literally thinning as the pages turn. The final poem declares: “I die without a voice. / He skins me, flesh from bones. / Cuts me into forty-eight pieces. Distributes the parts in blue plastic bags / & throws them to the four corners.” Unlike the Muses who buried Orpheus’s dismembered limbs, the poem ends with the paramedic guessing “which of these bags / contain my flesh”. Written in Gaza between 2023 and 2025, Abu Akleen’s poems disassemble and painstakingly reassemble the body to interrogate injustice, death and grief. She creates a world where absurdity and reality, irony and humanity coexist – from the ice-cream man crying out “corpses for sale” while noting that “no grave buys them”, to death wanting to have a birthday party and picking “an arm the missile hadn’t shattered”. Abu Akleen self-translated 38 of the 48 poems, describing the process of translation as making “peace with death”, while writing in Arabic meant being “torn apart without … anyone there to recollect it”. The book articulates the vital linguistic bridge she establishes in the present between Arabic and English, and includes historical photographs of Gaza from 1863 and 1908 and the 2022 discovery of a fifth-century Byzantine mosaic, highlighting the city’s rich cultural history. Throughout 48Kg Abu Akleen transforms witnessed details into fragile interpretations: the “broken plates they make homes for their younger siblings”, the “moment War became a school”, and the “Ring Finger I lend to the woman who lost / her hand and her husband”. She notes that poetry gives “a form to feelings in order to understand them”, and these heartbreaking and risk-taking poems protest with uncompromising clarity and tenderness against continuing atrocities.Paper Crownby Heather Christle (Corsair, £10.99)View image in fullscreenThis quirky collection captures everyday absurdity with humour and brutal insights: “I own like six nail clippers / and honestly can’t / remember ever buying even one.” Christle’s seemingly light, random poems excel at forging unlikely connections. In How Much for the Swan Boat, she spins virtuosic free-associations from the word “penny” – money, idioms, Penelope’s wait for Odysseus, and relentless self-questioning. This slim volume punches above its weight in range and scope. From a smoothie blender to board-meeting etiquette, the prefix “eff” to an Advent calendar, everything becomes collage under Christle’s deft touch: “writing is more like rolling / a one-pound rock around the yard / if you are into that kind of thing”. While some poems suffer from over-generalisation, the whole is a striking celebration of risk and beauty: “I want this world / to remain with me, this holy tumult.”New Cemeteryby Simon Armitage (Faber, £14.99)View image in fullscreen“Reader, today / the poet has gone / to his shed … He has his themes”, Armitage begins ironically, introducing us to a sustained ruminative sequence about a cemetery built in his neighbourhood during the pandemic. With his signature Yorkshire vernacular, he brings precise locality and light-heartedness to death and grief – the “dirty clouds over Farnley Tyas”, or the “guitar-shaped” gravestone “with adjustable knobs/ for volume and tone”. Framing each poem with the name of a moth, Armitage investigates the complicated tension between natural and constructed habitats. The varied tercets he deploys – spare, rhymed or free-flowing – create an uncomfortable, fluctuating rhythm as the poet observes the cemetery’s progress, and the most memorable poems address his father’s death: “I should be sowing your ashes/ on Puddle Hill / or the bowling green/or the cricket field, / or across the stage / of the village hall.” Structured like burial plots, the poems of New Cemetery tap into deeply personal material while drawing on the laureate’s public persona.Red Carpetby Steve Malmude, edited by Miles Champion (Carcanet, £14.99)View image in fullscreenAt the periphery of the New York School of poets, Malmude succeeded in maintaining a distinctive voice among peers including John Ashbery and Frank O’Hara. This expertly edited collection showcases 65 years of intransigent poetics marked by meticulous craft and a down-to-earth perspective. Reading Malmude is like entering sideways into an encyclopedia of American history seen through the lens of working-class lives – moments like a “hard hat / kneeling in front / of a can of paint”. Nimble, observant and satirical, his vast canvas captures urban and suburban landscapes overshadowed by postwar inequality and climate change: “Spring is no longer / Henry David Thoreau’s / favorite season.” As Malmude ages, his lines grow shorter and more philosophical, meditating on craft and memory: “Poetry / as a dot / to stare at / in secret”. This long-overdue collection celebrates a mercurial, sharp-edged poet whose “tongue / touches the blade / of song” and reveals a new dimension to the New York School.Kit Fan’s latest poetry collection isThe Ink Cloud Reader(Carcanet).Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetry roundupPoetrySimon ArmitagereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a revelation, like watching those stop-motion films of how a plant grows and blooms. There’s a section about how a Roman villa might transform into a parish, the long barn providing the footprint, the web of relationships providing the social connection, the very tiles and columns providing the building materials. I can’t think of anyone who writes better about the way objects can speak to us. There’s a passage here describing her joy on grasping what it means that an ordinary-looking clay lamp found in Carlisle is purple on the inside; there’s a beautiful afterword about the history of bells.The book revolves around the moment that Christianity became a religion of empire – the Council of Nicaea in AD325. Roberts patiently picks away at the mythologising around this key event to figure out how a multitude of competing interests was finally brought together under the umbrella of a particular Christology. She illuminates the way Christianity manages to be both centralised and local. This is still true: a recent Bible Society report shows that if you close a church a third of its congregation will not even try to find another. Truth may be universal, loyalty is parochial.The trouble with rolling your eyes is that you end up looking in the wrong directionThe book (according to its YouTube trailer, at least) promises to “lift the veil on secrets that have been hidden in plain sight” and find out who started Christianity and why. It is a humanist take, so you know the who and why is not likely to be Jesus, and the forgiveness of sins. And some of the secrets have been hidden in very plain sight indeed. The fact that Christians served in the Roman army won’t be news to fans of that patron of archers, gay icon, and subject of portraits by Botticelli, El Greco, Mishima, Derek Jarman and Louise Bourgeois: Saint Sebastian. There is a bracingly contrarian takedown of Saint Paul, reframing him as a Trumpian grifter and stupidity advocate. It’s fun but no more lifts the veil on his influence than pointing out that Marie Stopes was a raging eugenicist would lift the veil on the appeal of contraception.If you’re looking for the open, inquisitive humanism of Erasmus or Ursula K Le Guin, then you’ll have to read them. Prof Roberts’s approach is more brisk. Anyone who thinks the church was about anything “other than money and power”, she says, is suffering from Stockholm syndrome. Illuminators of manuscripts, builders of cathedrals, makers of the objects in which she herself finds such wonder were all either duplicitous or duped. In a splendidly anachronistic closing flourish she shelves the empire metaphor and instead compares the church to a corporation with directors and CEOs, franchises and a product to sell. This – with its implication of top-down control and single unswerving purpose – is queasily close to a conspiracy theory, albeit one that the best bits of this book refute.There is a lot of disappointed eye-rolling about the things that people believed – or pretended to believe. The trouble with rolling your eyes is that you end up looking in the wrong direction. One example among many: Roberts is dismissive of saints such as Columba and Aidan who chose to live on isolated islands, pointing out that these islands were notthatisolated in days when sea was safer than roads. But surely they were choosing to embrace simplicity not just for its own sake but as a kind of protest, a holding to account. Yes, you can more or less see Bamburgh castle from Lindisfarne – but isn’t that the point? That the king in his castle is forced to consider the saint in his cell every time he looks out from the battlements. To protest somewhere truly isolated would be like shouting “fuck the patriarchy” in a penguin colony. Of course from some angles Christianity does looks like a business, but then from many angles a dolphin looks like a fish. It swims, eats and lives like a fish but there’s an important difference. It suckles its young.Back in 2016, Alice Roberts had a go at a vastly more sacred cow than Christianity. In a piece inScientific American, she attacked David Attenborough himself for promoting the “aquatic ape hypothesis”, dismissing it as a theory of everything, and like all theories of everything, “both too extravagant and too simple”. I know this because I kept the article on my desk for years. Cynicism is also a theory of everything. If the humanism that frames the narrative here is ever to offer more than eye-rolling, it needs to embrace the fact that, to quote the Alice Roberts of 2016, the reality is “both more complex and more interesting”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Memory is untrustworthy, but Blume is a genius who has that effect on her reader.My favourite book growing upWe’re always growing up; we’re always choosing a new favourite. For me, once, this was Louise Fitzhugh’s Harriet the Spy. Later I’d have said JD Salinger’s Nine Stories. Later, still, John Cheever’s Collected Stories, Lorrie Moore’s Self-Help, Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain, my favourite changing as I did. Maybe I’m finally old enough to understand that favourite is impossible to designate. Or maybe I’d say my current favourite isDon DeLillo’s Underworld.The book that changed me as a teenagerI encountered Salinger at 13. I began with The Catcher in the Rye (as most do) and read through his (too small) oeuvre. I wrote bad stories ripping him off; he somehow made me believe that I could be a writer, too.The writer who changed my mindI think readingWilliam Faulkner– I’d have been 16 or so – was the first time I understood that the pleasure one finds in a book might not be in its ease. I think that’s what I most loved (and still value!) about the favourites of my childhood: being swept up in story and character and action. Faulkner showed me that there could be delight in wrestling with a sentence, a pure joy in language itself, a thrill in being challenged and confused by a work of art.Theauthor that made me want to be a writerMy early writing education was just mimicry. And the first writer I remember imitating was Agatha Christie. How I wanted to write a perfect whodunit, with a stately home, a party of interesting people and a dead body. That’s easier said than done.Theauthors I come back toThere’s no shortage of these – Don DeLillo, Anita Brookner, Patrick Modiano, Philip Roth, Willa Cather. These are but a few of the writers I can go back to and be thrilled by whenever I need.The books I could never read againMy relationship with Salinger was like a heated youthful romance. Reading his fiction now is a bit like running into that particular ex at a cafe. I’d rather remember Salinger’s work as meaningful to my 14-year-old self than actually read it as I tiptoe toward 50.The book I discovered later in lifeI’m all for discovery whenever it happens. Books have no sell-by date. They’re always there, waiting for their readers, and it’s silly to carry around a sense of embarrassment for not having got to Moby-Dick or what have you. This summer I read Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary for the first time. A perfect novel! Why did I wait so long? It doesn’t matter.The book I am currently readingGertrude Stein’s The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas. My first time with Stein, and I’m reading it slowly while lying on the beach; a luxury, a joy.My comfort readComfort can be different things. In times of stress, I might want something funny, or I might want something that mirrors the tumult I’m feeling in life. The comfort derives, in large part, from knowing that it’s new, that I’m in search of something, that I might discover something other than what I’m looking for. That’s what I love about books – a journey without a map.Entitlement by Rumaan Alam is out in paperback (Bloomsbury)on 11 September.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

After a young deaf boy is shot while watching a puppet show, the citizens of Vasenka fall deaf themselves: refusing to speak, respond, even to hear military orders.The dramatic, book-length poem from 2019 by Ukrainian-bornIlya Kaminskybecomes an elaborately imagined theatrical fable from Dublin’s Dead Centre: not consoling, sometimes laborious, always demanding vigilance.If deafness is metaphor in Kaminsky’s poem, here it is a potent theatrical force. Dead Centre’s writer-directors Bush Moukarzel and Ben Kidd team up with sign language poet Zoë McWhinney. The spoken dialogue doesn’t capture Kaminsky’s flinty concision or wild incantation, but signing impels the show: a vivid choreography of communication. Signing, speech and surtitles are variously combined; panic and violence are loud in every register.‘We wondered if it was ethical to adapt it’: can poetry about deaf resistance wow theatre audiences?Read moreDeaf citizens stand blank-faced before a soldier’s jokes and threats until he resorts to captions (“this is an accessible war!”). Their gestures are lyrical, witty, calmly insurgent, but refusal only goes so far. “Poems are no match for a man with a machine gun,” warns baleful puppeteer Momma Galya (a louche and gritty Derbhle Crotty).The plush textures of Kevin Gleeson’s sound design often blur and muffle the speaking world. Townsquare chatter and traffic envelop us, then falls silent. The story’s central couple (warmly played by Romel Belcher and Caoimhe Coburn Gray) are beguiling guides, often appearing in marionette form. Puppets become a vivid image of childish innocence turned sour, of people struggling to steer their own destinies. In death, humans are hauled up on ropes, defiance reduced to deadweight carcass.Artistic director David Byrne’s Royal Court continues to expand the theatre’s notion of authorship: ensembles can be auteurs. Dead Centre are masters of meta-theatrical dazzle. Here, we rarely watch in a single register. Live film sits atop the stage picture. Scenes are screened in dollhouse miniature then replicated at full scale (ingenious designs by Jeremy Herbert). A hovering drone scans the audience. There are so many moving parts that spectatorship becomes a testing exercise in awareness. Yet the production ultimately asks us to sit with defeat – a hard road, even if it fits our current geopolitical moment.AtRoyal Court theatre, London, until 13 September, then at the Samuel Beckett theatre, Dublin, 2-5 October, as part ofDublin Theatre festivalExplore more on these topicsTheatreDeafness and hearing lossPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Walton’s Chekhov-derived The Bear, from half a century later, was a perfect partner, full of percussive speech rhythms to match the witty rhyming libretto.Mezzo Lea Shaw, as Torquemada’s fickle wife Concepción, has the best of the time-related gags in the verbose text of the Ravel (sharply translated in Kenneth Chalmers’ surtitles) and the central aisle of St Mary’s was imaginatively used to add some sense of offstage action and time passing to a pacy production. The singers’ French diction was not always up to the standard of that first exclamation, but a larger problem was the addition of a little too much stage business, alongside pantomimic costumes and makeup, to what is already a ridiculous confection. Spirei, making his company debut, was perhaps guilty of overegging a rich pudding.View image in fullscreenNicely judged … Chloe Harris and Daniel Barrett  in Scottish Opera’s production of The Bear.Photograph: Sally JubbThe Walton (based on the Chekhov short story about a widow obsessively mourning her faithless dead husband, before finding new love herself) also had no shortage of melodrama, in a nicely judged and well sung performance by the Australian Chloe Harris, who has the only well known song of the evening: I was a constant, faithful wife.Good though both women were, the star of the evening was baritone Daniel Barrett, also making his Scottish Opera debut. He brought charm to the pivotal role of dim, innocent Ramiro, the muscular muleteer in the Ravel, and then really showed his chops in the bigger sing of the title role in The Bear.AtTheatre Royal, Glasgowon 18 and 22 October and Festival theatre Edinburgh on15 November.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

From an audience not too shy to heckle (albeit mostly with variations on “We love you!”) comes an unsolicited plea to engage with one such inflammatory topic: the current US president. Goldberg doesn’t flinch. “It’s worse than that,” she says. “I’m turning 70.”So begins an undemanding set which often plays like aGrumpy Old Womenspin-off and echoes the title of Goldberg’s 2010 book Is It Just Me? Or Is It Nuts Out There? The Egot-winning actor, host ofThe Viewand great-grandmother dispenses semi-formed thoughts on everything from ageing and AI (“Fuck Alexa”) to misbehaving children (she once threatened to eat one). She is sharp on the discomfort of being attracted to “some kid” of 60, her worry being that she will be branded not a cradle-snatcher but a grave-robber. Other moments, such as a warning about how to opt out of sharing personal information via mobile phones, are like reading a boomer relative’s Facebook page.The show’s structure, if that’s not too grand a word for what is essentially a fans’ meet-and-greet complete with mementoes passed to the stage and audience members’ tattoos inspected, is as baggy as Goldberg’s multi-coloured sweatshirt. Sauntering back and forth, she offers vignettes from her recent memoir Bits and Pieces: My Mother, My Brother, and Me. In delineating her late brother’s numerous ex-girlfriends who came out of the woodwork at his wake, she lends a glimpse of her youthful comic acuity for those of us who didn’t see the 1984 Mike Nichols-directedBroadway monologueswhich made her reputation. When she loses her train of thought (“Where was I?”), the crowd gladly step in en masse (“Italy!”).After the interval, Graham Norton spends 45 minutes prodding Goldberg through her career highlights and trying, not always successfully, to steer her away from unpromising anecdotes. She ticks off The Color Purple (on which she offered to play “dirt on the floor”), Ghost (no one wanted her to audition) and Sister Act, on which she exclaimed to her most esteemed co-star: “You’reMaggie Smith!What are you doing in this fucking movie?” There are even appreciative cheers for Theodore Rex, in which she was paired with a talking dinosaur to fight crime – a film so abysmal that she tried to extricate herself at the 11th hour.Ghost at 30: the shock romantic blockbuster that tried to do it allRead moreFrom her declaration of love for – and yearning to play the lead in – Doctor Who to her recollections of how she performed her character Blee T (a Black ET) for Steven Spielberg, there is not a tried-and-tested anecdote here that fans don’t know verbatim.It seems occasionally as if her crowd work might pep things up. “Are you going to the bathroom, girl?” she asks after spotting someone plodding up the aisle, then promises to wait before continuing the rest of the show. In fact, the departing figure turns out to be a man with dreads. Realising her error, Goldberg says: “I need better glasses.” Better material, too.AtCardiff Arenaon 5 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsComedyWhoopi GoldbergreviewsShareReuse this content"

So the BBC’s licensing of a spin-off stage play to mark January’s 75th anniversary of the farming drama raised fears of a Snelly cavalcade of arch jokes for superfans.In fact, Haywire – written by Tim Stimpson, author of almost 500 Archers scripts – is, across the length of eight radio episodes, a smart drama with a strong sense of broadcasting and social history.The conceit is that, in 2025, Jonty, a BBC Ambridge lover with ambitions to edit The Archers (the real current incumbent, Jeremy Howe, was in the audience) gilds his CV by making an afternoon play about the show’s early history from late 1940s conception through 1951 launch to the 1955 immolation of a major character to stymie the opening night of the BBC’s first commercial rival, ITV.Jonty’s cast includes Adrian (Kieran Brown) as Godfrey “God” Baseley, the show’s creator, and Abbie (Olivia Bernstone) playing Ysanne Churchman, a brief early series heroine as Grace Archer.Directed by Joseph O’Malley (a distant descendant of Baseley), the play is as neatly and deeply layered as a hay bale. The main cast play the actor contracted by Jonty now, then their impersonations of a 1950s actor/character which, in some scenes, becomes a period recreation of the “real” past, with some lip-syncing as well to actual vintage episodes. If Lynda Snell ever attempted such meta-drama, she would need tranquillisers from Dr Malik at Darrington surgery.View image in fullscreenAural show and tell … Liam Horrigan and Geebs Marie WilliamsThe intricacies demand (fittingly for a tribute to radio) some extraordinary voice acting, as the cast darts between their characters’ 2025 actor accent and the on-air and off-air tones of a 1950s cast member. These can be enjoyably different, suddenly jumping from Brummie to plummy or street now to Borsetshire then.Yet another level makes Adrian the former lead in a forgotten TV detective franchise and Abbie a current screen soap star with millions of X followers and pursuant paparazzi, permitting Stimpson intriguing parallels: the first Archers cast – drawing to radio the sort of audiences (20 million) that EastEnders achieved at its peak – are shown as prototype media celebrities, with personal appearances amid public hysteria.The result is a behind-the-mic farce, a homage to Michael Frayn’s backstage classicNoises Offin which part of the enjoyment is the creation of noisesonby “spot effects” studio manager Jessica, superbly played by Geebs Marie Williams with a combination of aural show and tell – the use of slopping yoghurt to suggest the birth canal of a lambing ewe – and a silent movie range of facial expressions.The first night audience clearly included aficionados – joining in with the theme tune – but Haywire, though loving to its source, has enough general pleasures to be liked by everyday folk around the country.At theBarn theatre Cirencester, until 11 October.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreThe ArchersRadioComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Duke it out with him in the galaxy’s most unexpected custody battle? Or tackle climate change and LGBTQ+ rights?Ben ChildFri 5 Sep 2025 06.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 11.23 EDTShareIs tomorrow just another day, as the adage goes? Or is it suddenly a franchise-within-a-franchise, a special wing of the nascent DC Universe focused in hard on what all those nutty Kryptonian super-cousins have been up to? What we do know,thanks to studio boss James Gunnin aseries of social media splurts, is that Tomorrow is most definitely the future. Gunn has revealed that his follow-up to Superman will be titled Superman: Man of Tomorrow, due out in 2027. Now you might think you’ve heard the title before, and that would be because you have: next year sees the release of the already announced Supergirl, whichup until June was titled Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow.What are we to make of that title? In the comics, “Man of Tomorrow” has long been one of Superman’s many sobriquets, a hopeful tagline suggesting he represents the future rather than the past. It’s cropped up in everything from old radio serials to Alan Moore’s bittersweet Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? graphic novel, and even lent its name to a 2020 animated movie. It’s a phrase that carries the weight of the best part of a century of mythology. And yet given Gunn’s online spats with Trumpian anti-immigration types –hello Dean Cain!– over what the latter saw as Superman’s overly friendly attitude towards immigrants, it’s hard not to imagine the film-maker chuckling to himself at the new title’s liberal undertones.What else can we glean from Gunn’s announcement? Well, the title hints at hope and futurism; the concept art suggests a bald billionaire trying to punch his way to relevance. Somewhere between those two extremes probably lies Gunn’s film, but in the absence of anything solid to chew on, we’re in the realms of conjecture and wild-eyed fan theory.Some have suggested the “Tomorrow” in the title might not even refer toSupermanat all, but to Conner Kent – the broody Superboy clone who arrived after Superman “died” in the early-90s Death of Superman/Reign of the Supermen comic book arc, and is therefore often framed as representing the next generation of Krypto-heroism. Conner was later revealed as half Superman, half Lex Luthor, and all attitude: stomping around in a leather jacket and shades like a Kryptonian extra from Beverly Hills, 90210. The idea was that he might one day grow into the mantle of Superman, but mostly he spent his early years sulking, flirting and trying to work out whether it was OK to call Lex “Dad”. If Gunn does bring him in, then “Tomorrow” suddenly looks less like an aspirational tagline and more like the galaxy’s most unexpected custody battle.Others reckon the mech-suit, and a pic from Gunn’s posts in which Superman seems to be about to hand Lex a screwdriver, hints at a reluctant team-up between the pair – perhaps after they are faced with a greater threat. But whether this is a necessary plot device to ensure Earth has enough firepower to take down Brainiac, Darkseid, or some other interstellar monstrosit, there’s still something absurd about the idea of Luthor prowling about like Iron Man’s embittered tech bro cousin.And then there are the optimists who think “Tomorrow” means Superman will finally tackle issues such as climate collapse, LGBTQ+ rights and the plight of migrants everywhere. Maybe this really is the film where Superman stops trading punches with the supervillain of choice and turns his attention to saving us from ourselves. Or perhaps Hollywood has got enough existential crises to deal with thanks to James Cameron’s 23 upcoming Avatar sequels and their increasingly waterlogged metaphors for late-stage capitalism and environmental burnout.Tomorrow has been Superman’s tagline for 80 years. It’s been painted on lunchboxes, scribbled across duvet covers, and used as an excuse to reboot the same origin story at least once every decade in print. The question is whether in Gunn’s hands it will finally mean something.Explore more on these topicsSupermanWeek in geekScience fiction and fantasy filmsMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bowie’s notes reveal that he considered the publicly beloved petty thief Jack Sheppard as a potential lead character, as well as Jonathan Wild, the vigilante who was responsible for Sheppard being arrested and executed. He also focused on the Mohocks, a notorious gang of high-class young men who would get drunk and attack people on the streets.The notes detail his fascination with the evolution of art and satire, including a timeline of artistic development in the early 18th century. “It seems he was thinking, ‘What is the role of artists within this period? How are artists creating a kind of satirical commentary?’” lead curator Madeleine Haddon told the BBC.The broadcaster wasgiven access to Bowie’s materials for the project, including a dedicated notebook and detailed sticky notes: the latter had been left affixed to the walls of his private office in New York, to which only Bowie and his PA had a key.Theatre – particularly musical theatre – was a lifelong influence for Bowie. He made no bones about emulating the singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley early on, and studied dramatic arts under Lindsay Kemp. He told the BBC in 2002 that he had always wanted to write for theatre, the intent being “to have a pretty big audience” for whatever he worked on.The notes for The Spectator – and the desk where he worked on them – will be available for the public to view when the David Bowie Centre opens at the V&A East Storehouse in Hackney Wick, east London, on 13 September. The new centre will have 200 items on permanent display, but fans will be able to apply to view anything from the 90,000-piece archive in person by filling out a form.The permanent centre expands on the David Bowie Is exhibition at the V&A in 2013, which became the most visited show in the museum’s history.Bowie’s final completed work was his 26th album, Blackstar, released two days before his death in January 2016.Explore more on these topicsDavid BowieV&AMuseumsPop and rockExhibitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Will it be the candidate who promises free kibble or the one who speaks gnomically of ‘CRIME’?Lucy KnightFri 5 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 00.01 EDTShareIn Somerville,Massachusetts, a community bike path has, in recent months, become a hotly contested political constituency. A cat with a distinctive black smudge on her nose, Berry, had been sighted on the path by a number of concerned neighbours, who reported her missing. But she wasn’t actually anywhere she shouldn’t have been – Berry is an outdoor cat who lives in the area – so her family put up a poster dubbing her the bike path’s “mayor” to let neighbours know not to worry. It wasn’t long though before things got out of hand. How come Berry got to be mayor, asked other pet owners?A heated election is now under way. There have been dirty tactics (at one point, Berry’s campaign sign was stolen), scandal (candidates were outraged when a local vet claimed to be “sponsoring” the race), and even death: Pirate, the candidate whose family took it upon themselves to set up the online ballot, died unexpectedly, mid-race. Voting (for Somerville locals only) ends on 5 September – and with 73 pets currently in the running, there’s plenty of choice. So who are the runners and riders?The incumbent: BerryView image in fullscreen“Make cats outside again,” reads Berry’s sign campaigning for re-election. The current mayor is a three-year-old black and white cat who can be found on the bike path “daily, when I’m not visiting my humans”, the literature says. She has a dedicated team of humans around her: seven-year-old chief of staff Amias and five-year-old chief canvasser Emmeline; as well as campaign manager Mallory, a 39-year-old scientist. Her team claims she has improved community morale and should she be elected, will “unite the community under cat supremacy”.The challenger: Orange CatView image in fullscreenOrange cat’s campaign poster.Photograph: Boston Globe/Getty ImagesOrange Cat is a seven-year-old ginger tom, whose owner, 42-year-old comedian Janet, says he is “pro-democracy and pro-free and fair elections” and is also “against rats”. His solution to Somerville’s rat problem is simple: he will “eat them”.The fan favourite: MinervaView image in fullscreenThe simplest – and most intriguing – sign to have appeared along the bike path features a one-word slogan: “CRIME”. This provocative message has won nine-year-old Minerva many supporters online – despite the fact that, as an indoor cat, she has never been seen on the bike path. “Her minions monitor the path for her,” say her owners. “CRIME” remains her sole policy.The bike-hater: CartwheelView image in fullscreenCartwheel’s campaign poster.Perhaps controversially for a cat who wishes to be in charge of a cycle lane, six-year-old Cartwheel’s campaign has decreed that, “like all things starting with ‘B’ (buses, basketballs, brooms), bikes are scary, and there should be fewer of them on the bike path”. Cartwheel’s owner, 15-year-old Susan, says he is an advocate of “safe outside time for all cats”, and wears a harness and lead to venture out. In fact, he runs a harness lending library for other local cats and can also do tricks, such as using buttons to demand things from his humans.The duo: Clementine and NixView image in fullscreenTwo-year-old siblings Clementine and Nix are running for mayor and vice-mayor respectively. Their owner Lily, 11, says the pair’s goals are lengthy: “Catnip will be planted along the bike path”, “If a cat is napping they must not be disturbed” and “No one is allowed to pet a cat without the cat’s permission” are just some of the rules the pair would like to implement, should they be elected.The baby: ErnieView image in fullscreenAt just four months old, black kitten Ernie is the youngest candidate in the race. Though he hasn’t yet visited the bike path, his owners say his policies include “adopt, don’t shop”, “free kibble” and “universal pet health insurance”.The climate activist: HugoView image in fullscreenKeeping things clean … Hugo.Photograph: HandoutHugo, who was taken in by 61-year-old retiree Jenny, in January, is probably “about a year” old – but as a rescue cat, even he can’t be sure. Jenny says he has “a huge brain” and is “constantly trying to understand how things work” and would apply this to addressing the climate crisis so it’s never too hot for him and other cats to go outside.The one who is not a cat: PicositaView image in fullscreenAlthough the majority of mayoral candidates are cats, it wasn’t long before dogs began planting campaign signs, too. If elected, three-year-old chihuahua Picosita, who lives along the bike path, “will fight for bunnies, birds, and all the small neighbours who can’t bark for themselves”, her owner, 31-year-old data analyst Valerie, says.“Tired of fat cat politicians?”reads her poster. “I’m all ears.”The one who is not a cat or a dog: NagiView image in fullscreenSeven-year-old Nagi is the only tortoise on the ballot: His owner, 24-year-old Trader Joe’s crew member, Shay routinely travels along the bike path with Nagi in his pocket. Nagi’s policies, says Shay, are “centred on waste management” because he has “accidentally nibbled on some trash before.”The nepo-baby: KorbenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ingrid WilsonPolitics runs in the family of five-year-old Korben Dallas, whose owner,Jake Wilson, is in the running to be Somerville’s human mayor. Wilson and Dallas have matching campaign posters: while Wilson runs on “Leadership. Values. Action”, Dallas’s slogan is: “Naps. Tuna. Pets”. Dallas’s owners, 14-year-old Ingrid and 11-year-old Margot, regularly use the bike path and report back to him (as he is an indoor cat) and say he is keen to put a speed limit on the community path, enforce the state-wide ban on motorised vehicles on bikeways and to deal with the rodent problems.The one who isn’t actually running for mayor: WasilView image in fullscreenFive-year-old Wasil doesn’t venture outside himself, but lives in an apartment overlooking the bike path – so runs “a 9-to-5 surveillance operation” from his window perch, according to his owners. He is not actually running for mayor, but has put himself forward for a newly created position: attorney general. Here, his focus would be on “keeping the streets safe “ as he has an excellent vantage point “for spotting both birds and wrongdoing”. His owners say he also wants to put an end to “body-shaming” as everyone who walks past his window says “Whoa, he’s so big!”Explore more on these topicsCatsMassachusettsPetsAnimalsUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s a cruel twist that, just when you’re trying to bank some rest before the arrival of a baby, your body and brain conspire to make falling – and staying – asleep more difficult. Hormonal changes, pelvic or back pain, stress and extra bathroom trips are among the delights that can make sleep elusive for pregnant women. As your baby bump grows, general discomfort is a given.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Pregnancy pillows aim to help relieve some of this discomfort by supporting key parts of the body, such as your growing baby bump, back and hips. Many are designed to encourage an optimal pregnancy sleeping position: theNHS recommendssleeping on your side after 28 weeks. That’s due to research suggesting a link between falling asleep on your back and an increased risk of stillbirth – although note that the overall risk is still very low, and there’s no need to worry if you wake up on your back. Just roll over and go back to sleep.At a glanceBest pregnancy pillow overall:Bbhugme pregnancy pillow£159 at John LewisBest budget pregnancy pillow:Silentnight U-shaped pregnancy pillow£33.15 at La RedouteBestpregnancy pillow for back support:Dreamgenii pregnancy, support and feeding pillow£37.99 at Robert DyasBest pregnancy pillow for leg support:Snüz SnuzCurve pregnancy support pillow£84.95 at SnüzBest for temperature control:Simba extra support body pillow£109 at SimbaWhy you should trust meMy usual expertise is in technology, and I’ve tested all kinds of tech gadgets and AI tools in my decade or so as a tech journalist. But what really made me the perfect tester for prenatal pillows is that I was entering the third trimester of my own pregnancy as testing began – a stage I would describe as “how is everything suddenly so uncomfortable?” Throw in a dash of persistent pregnancy insomnia, and I developed a deep personal interest in unearthing the best maternity pillows for a decent night’s sleep.How I testedView image in fullscreenOur writer gives the Bbhugme pregnancy pillow a whirl.Photograph: Victoria Turk/The GuardianThere are many pregnancy pillows on the market, most of which fall into a few main categories: C-shaped, U-shaped, wedge or I-shaped (which I more often found myself calling “sausage”). I selected pillows that were popular with buyers, sparked discussion on pregnancy forums, offered unique features or simply dominated internet ads. I tested 11 in total.To test, I shamelessly cheated on my existing pillows by sleeping with each contender for at least two nights. I kept notes on firmness, support, comfort and how much bed space each pillow took up. I also noted their aesthetics, ranging from chic to orthopaedic, and their versatility. Some convert into nursing pillows after birth, which extends their usefulness and adds value.The best judge of a pregnancy pillow, of course, is a good night’s sleep. I tracked mine using a smartwatch, focusing on total sleep time and time spent in deep sleep (though I took other factors into account too).The best pregnancy pillows in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The GuardianBest pregnancy pillow overall:Bbhugme pregnancy pillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£159 at John LewisThe Bbhugme is a flexible, microbead-filled cylinder that can be moved into an I or J shape the full length of the body, or a smaller C (useful for sitting) or U (for between the legs). It comes with a cotton jersey cover, secured at the end with plastic “pebbles”, giving the overall impression of an oversized sausage – emphasised by the dusty pink colour of my test pillow. “You look like you’re riding a hotdog,” my husband said as I straddled it sloth-on-a-branch style.Why we love itThe revelation of the Bbhugme is the microbead filling, which gives flexibility in both its shape and firmness. It was easy to mould the pillow around me so that it supported my bump, went between my legs and kept me nestled in a comfortable side sleeping position.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The GuardianDespite its size, it’s lightweight and pliable, making it easy to move when I shifted sides in the night. It even offered some comfort during a 1am bout of Braxton Hicks (“false labour”) contractions.Its adjustability makes it a great all-rounder. I can see it being useful at all stages of pregnancy, as support needs shift, and after birth as a nursing bolster. The covers come in a range of muted tones, so the pillow can blend in with most bedroom decor.It’s a shame that …at £159, the Bbhugme’s comfort also comes at a hefty price – this is not a budget option.Suitable for:pregnancy and nursingShape:I-shapedSize:140-145 x 20cmFilling material:microbeadsCover material:95% cotton, 5% spandex jerseyBestbudget pregnancy pillow:Silentnight U-shaped pregnancy pillowView image in fullscreen£33.15 at La Redoute£38.77 at WayfairAs a U-shape, this maternity pillow is designed to envelop your body on both sides, while also serving as a head pillow. The idea is that the all-encompassing shape can support every part of your body at once: bump, back, hips, knees, neck – you name it. The pillow has a hollowfibre filling and a removable, washable cover in a grey velvet effect.Why we love itThis super-size pillow was cosy to nestle into. Despite its large size, it’s fairly shallow in depth compared with some, so it didn’t create such a barrier between me and my husband. The microfibre cushioning moulded easily around my body, and the two legs of the U shape meant it was easy to switch sides in the night with no rearranging required.The plush velour cover made it feel like I was being cuddled by a giant teddy bear, and according to my smartwatch I had one of my longest sleeps while using the Silentnight pillow. At one point during testing, my dog managed to sneak into the room where I was storing the pillows, and he also made a beeline for this one.It’s a shame that …while this maternity pillow claims to be multi-use, its size and design rather scream “pregnancy pillow”. I can’t imagine many people using it on a sofa.Suitable for:pregnancy and nursingSize:140 x 70 x 16cm (LWD)Filling material:100% polyester hollowfibreCover material:100% polyester micro velourShape:U-shapedBestpregnancy pillow for back support:Dreamgenii pregnancy, support and feeding pillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£37.99 at Robert Dyas£48.99 at EbebekThe Dreamgenii pillow is a sort-of C-shape (G-shape, perhaps?) that curves under your bump and through your legs, as with most pillows, but also provides an attached back support, similar to a wedge. This means it offers support on both sides of your body without taking up the space of a full U-shaped pillow.Why we love itThe Dreamgenii’s cotton jersey cover felt particularly soft against the skin and, although large, the pillow didn’t feel too unwieldy in the bed. Its very particular shape is specifically designed for side sleeping, and it offered ample support for this, with the back wedge helping to prevent unintended rolling and keeping me in position.Despite its odd shape, the pillow does promise some versatility: after birth, Dreamgenii suggests using it for nursing too, by wrapping the leg support behind your back and using the back support to help cradle your baby. It’s also reasonably priced.It’s a shame that …you can’t adjust the gap between the front and back pillows, which would be a nice way to support changing bump size. Because the pillow is specifically shaped for sleeping on one side, it’s also cumbersome to shift position in the night.Suitable for:pregnancy and nursingShape:C-shaped (ish)Size:102 x 77cmFilling material:polyester hollow fibreCover material:100% jersey cottonThe best eco-friendly baby products: 11 sustainable substitutes, from reusable nappies to wipesRead moreBest pregnancy pillow for leg support:Snüz SnuzCurve pregnancy support pillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£84.95 at Snüz£84.95 at AmazonThe innovation of this maternity pillow is its dual fillings: the upper part is a sausage-style pillow filled with polystyrene beads (à la the Bbhugme), while the lower section has a firmer foam filling. For what Snüz claims is the perfect pregnancy sleeping position, snuggle the upper part in your arms and under your bump, then place the foam part between your legs.Why we love itThe pillow’s shape felt very supportive, and the mix of bead and foam fillings provided the best of both worlds. The beaded portion was comfy to cuddle and moulded nicely around my bump.Meanwhile, the lower portion did a particularly good job of keeping my legs separated and supporting me in a side-sleeping position. A bumper for the knees (Snüz calls a “KneeBlade”) helped hold it in place through the night. Keeping your legs separated can help relieve pressure from the pelvis, hips and back – so if you’re experiencing pelvic girdle pain or similar discomfort, this could be a strong choice.It’s a shame that …the SnuzCurve is designed to keep you in one position, so it may not be the best if you’re a wriggler. It’s only available with either a grey or white cover – the latter seems destined to show every mark.Suitable for:pregnancyShape:C-shapedSize:135 x 30 x 25cm (LWD)Filling material:polystyrene beads; polyurethane foamCover material:92% cotton, 8% elastaneskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The cotton cover contains the brand’s Stratos “cool-touch” technology, which aims to draw heat away from the body. The shape is a gentle curve designed to support bump, hips and knees when sleeping on your side.Why we love itThe Simba pillow absolutely delivered on its temperature-regulating promise – it stayed cool to the touch, even after a full night’s sleep during a surprise spring heatwave. Given that pregnant women can be prone to hot flushes, night sweats and overall higher body temperatures, anything that can help combat overheating is a boon for night-time comfort.While fairly bulky and lacking any adjustable features, the pillow was comfortable, and the fairly firm, down-like filling offered good support, especially for the hips.It’s a shame that …the cover fabric, while cooling, isn’t the softest to snuggle up against, and the pillow lacks flexibility in shape and firmness.Suitable for:pregnancy and nursingShape:C-shapedSize:120 x 35cmFilling material:combed recycled PET bottle fibresCover material:cotton with StratosThe best of the restView image in fullscreenThe BellaMoon 3-in-1 pillow transforms into a half-doughnut shape for use when breastfeeding.Photograph: Victoria Turk/The GuardianBellaMoon 3-in-1pillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£99 at John Lewis£64.99 at AmazonBest for:nursingPossibly the most stylish pillow in our test, the BellaMoon comes invarious organic cotton cover designsfeaturing trendy muted prints. It’s a C-shaped pillow: you position the long section along either your front or back, then place one curved end under your head and the other between your legs. Its secret power is two hidden zips that allow the curved ends to detach and then zip together, forming a smaller, half-doughnut shape to support breastfeeding or use as support for your baby.It didn’t make the final cut because …while the BellaMoon pillow is described as medium firmness, I found it too firm, particularly under my head. This also made it unwieldy to reposition during the night and created a bulky barrier in the bed.Suitable for:pregnancy and nursing;shape:C-shaped;size:140 x 50 x 20cm;filling material:100% polyester;cover material:100% organic cottonBabybub Bub’smaternitypillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£39.99 at BabybubBest for:small spacesThe Babybub is a wedge-shaped pillow that’s really more like two wedges: one to support your back and one to support your bump. It also comes with a small cylindrical pillow that can be added to the front or back as needed.Its winged design makes the Babybub much smaller than a traditional pregnancy pillow – you might even call it compact. It took a bit of fiddling with the adjustable Velcro strap to get the wedges the perfect distance apart, but this means you can reposition them as your bump grows.It didn’t make the final cut because …the bamboo and polyester blend cover is slightly scratchy to the touch, and the off-white colour gets grubby easily and looks a little “orthopaedic aid”. I was also quite nonplussed by the additional mini-pillow, which I found inevitably ended up somewhere tangled in the duvet.Suitable for:pregnancy;shape:wedge;size:36 x 46 x 10cm;filling material:polyester and microfibre balls;cover material:bamboo and polyester blendCushy PuffpregnancypillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£135 at ScandibornBest for:colour optionsCurrently dominating my Instagram feed, the Cushy Puff is another microbead-filled sausage in the style of the Bbhugme. As such, it effectively adapts to support your body where you need it. The cotton-jersey pillowcase comes in bold colours and statement stripes and simply ties off at either end – letting you adjust it for firmness by tightening or loosening the knots.It didn’t make the final cut because …the tying mechanism was a bit of a faff. My pillow also gave off a slight chemical odour when first unboxed – off-putting to someone with a heightened sense of smell during pregnancy.Suitable for:pregnancy and nursing;shape:I-shaped;size:120-150 x 25cm (LW);filling material:EPS (expanded polystyrene) microbeads;cover material:95% cotton, 5% spandex jerseyBabymoov Dream BeltpregnancysleepsupportView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£34.77 at AmazonBest for:travelA novel wearable concept, the Babymoov Dream Belt fastens around your waist with an adjustable Velcro strap so it moves with you. The stretchy jersey front panel goes over your bump, while memory foam pads sit on the hips to provide bump support when sleeping on your side. I found the belt comfortable to wear, and it stayed in place well, offering support through plenty of tossing and turning.The most compact pillow tested, this would be a good option for travel – and it comes at a reasonable price.It didn’t make the final cut because …the Dream Belt offers support only around your bump, so its usefulness is limited. You could pair with another pillow (or regular cushions) to add leg and back supports.Suitable for:pregnancy;shape:belt;size:available in two body sizes, XS/S and M/XL;filling material:polyurethane memory foam;cover material:95% cotton, 5% elastaneWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The GuardianPregnancy pillow shapesAs you can tell from the variety above, pregnancy pillows come in different shapes. Which you choose is down to personal preference and the kind of support you’re looking for. Common shapes include C, U, V and wedge pillows.C-shaped pillowssupport your front (or back), head and legs;U-shaped pillowsenvelop the body and so offer support on all sides;V-shaped pillowscan be used in various ways, including one leg of the V supporting your bump and the other going through your legs (like a C-shaped pillow without the head support).When choosing a shape, also consider how much bed space it requires: U-shaped pillows are typically the largest.Wedge-shaped pillowsare usually smaller, wedging under bump or back, but this also limits how much of your body they support. Some pillows, such as theI-shaped pillowswith microbead fillings, offer much more flexibility for you to bend them into different shapes.How to sleep with a pregnancy pillowThis will depend on the shape of the pillow you choose, your support needs and your sleeping position. The NHS recommends sleeping on your side after 28 weeks of pregnancy, and many pillows are designed with this in mind.Longer pillows that go along the front of your body (I, C or U shapes) are usually intended to be cuddled: place one arm and one leg under the pillow, and one on top. At the end of the day, the point of the pillow is comfort, so anything that brings relief and helps you sleep is a plus. Of course, if you’re having any issues with pain or pregnancy symptoms, or are unsure if a pillow is a good idea for you, you should seek medical advice.Features to look forWhen choosing a pregnancy pillow, you’ll want to consider the type of filling (eg microbeads, hollow fibre, memory foam) and the fabric of the cover. Most pillows have removable, washable covers. You may want to choose a pillow that can double as a nursing aid to get extra value out of the product after your baby arrives; some pillows offer specific mechanisms to reshape them for this purpose.Victoria Turk is atechnology journalist whose work has brought her into contact with the latest gadgets and gizmos for the past decade.

Food styling assistant: Isobel Clarke.The sweet spotFoodBenjamina Ebuehi’s recipe for chocolate and malted buttercream cakeFudgy layers and a luscious filling makes this bake simply irresistible – whether it’s your birthday or notBenjamina EbuehiFri 5 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTShareBeing a twin, I’ve always shared a birthday cake. Each year, I ask my sister what I should bake and the answer is almost never chocolate, despite it being one of my favourite cake flavours. However, this year, I’ll be changing that and making this lovely, fudgy two-layer chocolate cake filled and topped with a luscious, malty buttercream that I could eat by the spoonful. If you want to make it extra celebratory, swap the chocolate shavings for sprinkles.Chocolate and malted buttercream cakePrep10 minCook1 hrServes12315g plainflour150g castersugar120g light brown sugar50g cocoa powder2 tsp baking powder1 tsp bicarbonate of soda¼ tsp fine sea salt3 large eggs60ml neutral oil225g plain yoghurt115g unsalted butter, melted170ml hot brewed coffeeFor the malted buttercream250g unsalted butter1 tsp vanillabean paste40ml whole milk50g malted milk powder(eg, Horlicks)175g icing sugar¼ tsp fine sea saltMilk chocolate, shaved, to finishHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and grease and line two 20cm loose-bottomed cake tins. Put the flour, both sugars, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarb and salt in a bowl and whisk to combine.In a jug, whisk the eggs, oil, yoghurt and melted butter. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, pour in the liquid mix, then stir in the coffee until everything comes together into a smooth batter. Divide evenly between the two lined tins and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove, leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 10 minutes, then lift out and transfer to a rack to cool completely.Meanwhile, make the buttercream. In a stand mixer, or using an electric whisk, beat the butter and vanilla for three or four minutes, until pale and creamy.Heat the milk in a small saucepan or microwave until hot, then add the malted milk powder and whisk smooth. Beat half the icing sugar into the butter, then pour in the hot malted milk followed by the rest of the icing sugar and the salt. Beat again until smooth and creamy.When you’re ready to assemble, invert the cakes and put one on a plate or serving board, and trim the top if it’s not level. Spoon some buttercream on top, spread it out evenly, then add the second cake topside down. Spread the remaining buttercream on top, finish with some shaved chocolate around the edges, then slice and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotCakeBakingChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"

He made history and will be remembered forever,” wrote Donatella Versace on Instagram.Long-serving Vogue editor Anna Wintour reflected on Armani’s wide influence: “For him fashion wasn’t one thing: it was also film, music, sport, art, design, and architecture, and he left his mark in all these worlds.”Elegant, determined, a little unknowable: Giorgio Armani is gone but will never be forgottenRead moreFashion designer Valentino Garavani described Armani as “a friend, never a rival … I can only bow to his immense talent.”Ralph Lauren called him “a designer who never strayed from his vision … a man who loved his family and friends, and his homeland in such a special way.”Prada group’s Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli said Armani was “a Maestro recognised for his elegance and creativity, and an undisputed protagonist of Italian and international fashion.”Julia Roberts, whose steel grey oversized Armani suit teamed with a white shirt and tie became one of the most memorable Golden Globes looks of all time,wrote on social mediaArmani was “A true friend. A legend,” adding a broken heart emoji.In a series of posts on X, Russell Crowe recounted how losing his bags on the way to the Cannes film festival in 1997 led to him discovering the designer. “I adored him. He was so kind. So many significant moments in my life, awards, wedding, Wimbledon … all in Armani.

I feel honoured to have called him a friend.”Martin Scorsese, who directed the 1990 documentary Made in Milan offering a behind-the-scenes look at fashion designer, said Armani “was a real artist, and a great one – people use the term ‘timeless’ quite often, but in his case it happens to be true”.Michelle Pfeiffer said she was “heartbroken” to hear of the designer’s passing.View image in fullscreenMichelle Pfeiffer and Giorgio Armani in September 1990.Photograph: James AndansonGiorgio Armani obituaryRead moreFormula One driver Charles Leclerc, who starred in an Armani campaign, said it had been “a great honour to have had the chance to meet and work with such an amazing person”.Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, praised Armani as “an icon, a tireless worker, a symbol of the best ofItaly.”Known as the “king of the blazer”, Armani pioneered soft power dressing and revolutionised red-carpet fashion. He dressed stars from Diane Keaton and Jodie Foster to Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and his designs became synonymous with elegance on the stages of the Academy Awards and Golden Globes.Cindy Crawford, Diane Kruger, Morgan Freeman and Samuel L Jackson were among others paying tribute.Explore more on these topicsFashionArmaniItalyEuropeCelebritynewsShareReuse this content"

There, for less than a euro, you can enjoylepinjawithkajmak–a charred traditional flatbread made in a stone oven and filled with a rich, creamy spread from a local dairy. The bakery is on one of the most picturesque roads through the Neretva River canyon, making this delicious bite even more special.AGCatch of the day in BavariaView image in fullscreenChiemsee, a freshwater lake sometimes called the ‘Bavarian Sea’, in southern Germany.Photograph: Foottoo/Getty ImagesIn the beautiful surrounds of Chiemsee, southern Germany, my partner and I enjoyed a lunch of fresh fish at the family-runChiemseefischerei Stephan, just west of the lake. With just a couple of options available on each daily menu, we didn’t have to faff around with a complicated order, and instead enjoyed the simplicity of the fish, rich potatoes, crisp salad and local Bavarianweissbierin the modern wood-panelled room. There was also Chiemsee sushi on the menu. I remember stepping out of the restaurant afterwards into the bright sunshine, hand in hand with my partner, mountains in the distance, and thinking: could life get any better?EllenA mountainous feast in KosovoView image in fullscreenA plate offergesë, made with red pepper, tomato and feta cheese.Photograph: Saxana/AlamyAfter scaling Kosovo’s highest peak, Gjeravica,Gacaferi Guest Houseprovides delicious home-cooked food in an idyllic setting surrounded by mountains and shepherds herding flocks.

The food scene was surprisingly excellent, with the highlight beingHospůdka U Štěpána, a fantastic restaurant near Sušice. A huge kitchen garden provides most of the produce, accompanying the wide range of different steaks from self-reared charolais beef. Fried courgette flowers followed by striploin in chimichurri sauce were some highlights in our August visit, along with the rustic vibe and more than fair price.EnricoMy favourite pizza in RomeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: edpics/AlamyHaving tested a few pizza-piazza combinations in Rome, we enjoyed a pizza fromAntico Forno Rosciolisitting on the kerb in Piazza Navona. It’s a 500-metre walk from the 19th-century bakery to the 15th-century public space (built atop the first-century Circus Agonalis). It’s the best pizza in Rome (in my humble view) and a relatively uncrowded and spectacular baroque spectacle of a square (oval?).Daniel Beckerskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Every night we indulged in a four-course, fine-dining experience. Ginger soup or fried polenta with wasabi, local beef or salmon tartare followed by organic Dutch cheeses, and a liquorice sorbet with blackberry creams. Perfect after a 30-mile cycle ride, and a constant source of conversation.SophieJazz and open-air dining in rural FranceWe stumbled across the biodynamic vineyardLa Guinguette du Domaine Gayrardin Virac, north-east of Toulouse, and found that not only did it produce some lovely wines but it also hosted aguinguette(open air dining from a simple menu with live music) during the summer months. We booked for dinner and were blown away. This gastronomic triumph was complimented by the most beautiful surroundings: we sat outside, looking over the vineyards as mellow jazz was played and the chef cooked our meal from a trailer. A truly unexpected gourmet experience.RachaelHonest hospitality in northern ItalyView image in fullscreenFresh agnolotti.Photograph: eZeePics Studio/Getty ImagesAtCa’Ordanoin the hills of Monferrato, the tasting was simple but unforgettable. A glass of nebbiolo red wine came first with a simple plate of local salami and cheeses. Then,agnolottipasta filled with roast beef, perfectly paired with a rich monferrato rosso. The visit was small-scale and personal, with no fuss or ceremony, just honest hospitality and food rooted in terroir – they’d hate me for calling it that, but it is what it is: a quiet, undiscovered corner of Piedmont with true flavours among the rolling hills.Mariateresa BoffoWinning tip: the old Crete ways are the bestIn the hills west of Rethymno there is Atsipopoulovillage, famous for Ta Souvlakia tou Gagani, a lovelyrestaurant sitting in a beautiful church courtyard. But a tiny restaurant calledO Manolis, sitting in a less-illustrious location (the seating occupies empty parking spaces off the main street), embodies everything good about rural Crete. Deliciousness beyond description is produced in that restaurant and served with genuine Greek warmth. With no menu, Manolis serves whatever is harvested that day from his garden, declaring confidently it’s the greatest in Europe, or what he hunts and forages from the hills in the old Cretan way.Rory FergusonView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsFood and drinkReaders' travel tipsEurope holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work.Soon after taking office, Noem reversed three extensions granted by the previous administration to immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti, prompting the lawsuit. Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow migrants from the countries to stay on for what is a temporary program.Millions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger.Venezuelais mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.Haitiwas first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpHaitiVenezuelaUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe it’s happening right now.”Meanwhile, two Venezuelan military planes flew close to a US warship in international waters, the Pentagon said on Thursday in asocial media post, an act it called “a highly provocative move … designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations”.The statement by the Department of Defense “strongly advised” the Venezuelan regime of embattled president Nicolás Maduro not to “obstruct, deter or interfere” with US operations.Maduro has accused the US of “seeking a regime change through military threat” and promised to build up his own armed forces.Last month, the state departmentincreased to $50mits reward “for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Maduro”, whom the US said has conspired with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in cocaine production.More than 50 countries, including the US, refuse to recognize Maduro as head of state after accusing him of rigging the Venezuelan presidential election in 2018.Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, defended the US military buildup in the Caribbean in an appearance on Fox News on Wednesday night.“We’ve got assets in the air, assets in the water, assets on ships, because this is a deadly serious mission for us, and it won’t stop with just this strike,” he said.Hegseth was asked by reporters on Thursday what legal justification was used to kill 11 people that the Trump administration had accused, without presenting evidence, of being members of theTren de Araguacriminal gang.“We have the absolute authority and complete authority to conduct that,” he said, stating that the group was “assaulting” the US with a flow of illegal drugs.“I’d say we smoked a drug boat, and there’s 11 narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean. And when other people try to do that, they’re gonna meet the same fate.”Ina statementissued on Thursday, before news of the stealth fighters’ deployment broke, Democratic Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar accused the Trump administration of “lawless and reckless” actions in the Caribbean region.“Congress has not declared war on Venezuela, or Tren de Aragua, and the mere designation of a group as a terrorist organization does not give any president carte blanche to ignore Congress’s clear constitutional authority on matters of war and peace,” she said.“There is no conceivable legal justification for this use of force. Unless compelling evidence emerges that they were acting in self-defense, that makes the strike a clear violation of international law.”Trump expected to order rebrand of Pentagon as ‘Department of War’Read moreTalking to the rightwing channel Newsmax on Wednesday, Rand Paul, the Republican US senator from Kentucky and chair of the Senate homeland security committee,also questionedthe legality and morality of the Trump administration’s actions.“[I have] no love lost for the people who died that are trying to infiltrate our country with this filth, but at the same time you have to realize it’s not as simple as it may sound, ‘let’s just kill drug dealers’, because sometimes you have to figure out who people are before you kill them,” he said.“Even the worst people in our country still get a trial.”Analysts have warned that US aggression in the region will have serious unintended consequences, including the possibility of being drawn into an extended guerrilla war in Venezuela.“I increasingly fear that the Trump administration may stumble into an intervention scenario in Venezuela, which would be frankly disastrous,” Juan González, the national security council’s senior director for the western hemisphere during the Biden administration,told the Guardianthis week.“It’ll become the cause célèbre for every kind of criminal or illegal armed group in theAmericas.

That was only the third time that temperature has been recorded in the country in September.The mercury rose again the following day, climbing to 40.8C in nearby Ashcroft. It has been an intensely hot and dry summer across Canada, which has fuelled an extreme fire season – its second worst on record. The country experienced its worst wildfire season on record in 2023, when more than 17m hectares (42m acres) burned.Smoke from wildfires has travelled over the Atlantic this summer, bringing hazy skies to Britain. Extreme heat and damaging wildfire seasons are expected to continue as the climate crisis alters weather patterns around the world.Meanwhile, farther south, a large and destructive hailstorm lashed parts of central and southern Kansas and northernOklahomaon Wednesday afternoon, damaging infrastructure and property in the city of Wichita and neighbouring towns.View image in fullscreenStorm chasers often gather to watch extreme weather events in Kansas.Photograph: John Finney Photography/Getty ImagesThe US National Weather Service had warned of severe thunderstorms in the area from 4pm local time, highlighting the danger of large hail and strong winds.Two powerful supercells developed near Salina and moved south towards Wichita, Kansas’s largest city. A supercell is a thunderstorm that contains a rotating updraught that allows it to maintain its strength for long periods. Strong updraughts such as these can produce large hailstones by keeping them aloft within the storm for longer, giving them time to grow.Wednesday’s deluge produced large hail along a 120-mile (190km) path through Kansas and into Oklahoma, with the largest stones up to 75mm (3in) in diameter, as big as a baseball.There were reports of damage across Wichita, including smashed windscreens and sunroofs on vehicles, damage to houses and trees, with gusts of 75mph (121km/h) recorded in Sedgwick County.Hailstorms cause billions of dollars of damage in the US every year.Explore more on these topicsCanadaWeather trackerKansasOklahomaAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

The American forces opened fire, killing all those on the small fishing vessel, the report said, without specifying the number of casualties.Neither the US nor the North Korean government has made the botched operation public. Before approving the plan, the White House had been concerned that even a small military action against North Korea could provoke a “catastrophic retaliation”.A classified Pentagon review later concluded the killings were justified under the rules of engagement, the report said.In 2019, the Seals were dispatched to North Korean waters in a nuclear-powered submarine, and then deployed in two mini-subs in frigid waters to reach the shore. A group of eight Seals were then supposed to sneak past North Korean border forces, install the device, and then escape undetected. However, the operation was disrupted by the attack on the civilians, and the Seals left without installing the device.The newspaper also revealed that the plan was based on a similar 2005 operation approved by George W Bush.The White House, the Pentagon and the US embassy in Seoul did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.Since Trump’s last summit with Kim in 2019, talks have fallen apart and North Korea has forged ahead with its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program.Trump this week said that US forces hadkilled 11 peoplein a strike on a boat in international waters that he claimed was carrying drugs to the United States. The White House has released few details about the operation, which it claimed targeted members of Venezuela’sTren de Araguagang.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaUS militaryDonald TrumpKim Jong-unTrump administrationAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He was voted in after a chaotic scramble by parties to gain enough support to replace the ousted PM, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who was removed from office by a court ruling.Friday’s vote is a major setback for Paetongtarn’s family, one of the country’s most influential and polarising political dynasties.Thaksin Shinawatra, Paetongtarn’s billionaire father and a former leader himself,suddenly left the country by private jetthe night before the vote, prompting a frenzy of speculation. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday, when judges will rule on whether he has adequately served his sentence for previous convictions.Thaksin said he had travelled to see a doctor in Dubai, where he spent much of his time in exile, and that he would return in time to attend court.Thailand’s constitutional courtremoved Paetongtarn from officea week ago, saying she had violated ethical rules during her handling of a border dispute with Cambodia. That made her the fourth member of her family to be ousted before reaching the end of her term. The ruling prompted a race between Pheu Thai and Anutin’s Bhumjaithai party to fill the position, with days of horse trading between rival parties.View image in fullscreenAnutin says the cannabis policy was always focused on medical use.Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPAAnutin, an experienced politician, comes from a family that owns one of Thailand’s biggest construction companies, which built Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport, as well as parliament itself.He has served as deputy prime minister, interior minister and health minister, during which time he campaigned for cannabis legalisation. The legal changes were criticised for being rushed through without adequate safeguards, leading to an explosion of dispensaries and recreational use across Thailand, though Anutin says the policy was always focused on medical use.Anutin told reporters as he exited parliament to visit his father in a hospital that he would work hard to solve the country’s problems. “I intend to work with my full capability,” he said. “I must work every day and make the most out of it, with no day off.”1:35New Thai PM, Anutin Charnvirakul, shows off an eclectic mix of passions – videoHe secured enough votes after promising the pro-reform People’s party that, were it to lend its support, he would hold an election in four months, and commit to changing Thailand’s constitution, possibly through holding a referendum.The People’s party, formerly the Move Forward party, has little in common with Bhumjaithai, a conservative royalist party, but has said it believes this arrangement is the quickest way to bring about an election and reform Thailand’s system to make it more democratic. It will not join Anutin’s government.Former PM Thaksin Shinawatra leaves Thailand days ahead of court ruling that could see him jailedRead moreSome of the supporters of the People’s party have questioned whether Anutin can be trusted to stick to his promises, however.The deal allowed him to achieve a thumping victory over Chaikasem Nitisiri, 77, a veteran lawyer and the candidate put forward by Thaksin’s Pheu Thai.Anutin won 311 votes, more than double Chaikasem’s 152.The result adds to the problems facing Thaksin, whose popularity and political clout have faded since his return from 15 years in self-imposed exile in 2023.He returned after striking a controversial deal with his old enemies in the conservative establishment. The arrangement, seen by many as a betrayal of his supporters, has crumbled, while his popularity has dwindled and his legal troubles mounted.In a post on X, Thaksin said he was in Dubai for a medical checkup and to see old friends. “I will be back in Thailand by September 8 to personally attend court on the 9th,” he said.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificThaksin ShinawatranewsShareReuse this content"

I managed to get through it because so many people supported me.”Akuzawa climbed with his daughter Motoe, 70, his granddaughter, her husband, and four friends from a climbing club. His achievement has been recognised byGuinness World Records.View image in fullscreenKokichi Akuzawa was 96 the first time he became the oldest person to scale Mount Fuji. He has since overcome heart issues, shingles and stitches from a climbing fall.Photograph: Hiro Komae/APThe group camped for two nights en route before their ascent on 5 August to the top of Mount Fuji, which is Japan’s tallest mountain at 3,776 metres (12,388ft).“I’m impressed I climbed so well,” he said, communicating with the help of his 75-year-old daughter Yukiko, who repeated questions into her father’s ear because he is hard of hearing. Akuzawa added that he didn’t take any mountain for granted at his age. “It’s better to climb while you still can.”The trip was not Akuzawa’s first record-breaking ascent of Mount Fuji. He was 96 the first time he became the oldest person to scale the mountain. In the six years since, he has overcome heart issues, shingles and stitches from a climbing fall.Akuzawa spent three months in training before the Fuji climb, waking at 5am for hour-long walks and tackling roughly one mountain each week, mostly around the Nagano prefecture in central Japan.Surrounded by relatives and framed paintings of mountains in his home in Maebashi, about 150 miles (241km) north-west of Tokyo, Akuzawa recalled what first drew him to the mountains 88 years ago. While the magic of reaching the summit was undeniable, it was the people who kept him coming back.“I climb because I like it,” he said. “It’s easy to make friends on the mountain.”View image in fullscreenAkuzawa, centre in the blue helmet, climbed with his daughter Motoe, 70, his granddaughter, her husband, and four friends from a climbing club.Photograph: APAkuzawa worked as an engine design engineer and later as a livestock artificial inseminator, a profession he held until he was 85, his family said.“Whether you liked studying or not, you could enjoy the mountain just the same,” he said. “Intelligence didn’t matter up there. We were all on an equal footing and moved forward together.”Akuzawa used to enjoy climbing solo, but as his strength decreased he leaned more on the help of others. His record climb in August was another test that he passed with assistance.“Mount Fuji isn’t a difficult mountain, but this time was harder than six years ago. Harder than any mountain before,” he said. “I’ve never felt this weak. I didn’t have pain, but I kept wondering why I was so slow, why I had no stamina. I’d long since passed my physical limit, and it was only thanks to everyone else’s strength that I made it.“I’d love to keep climbing for ever, but I guess I can’t any more. Now I’m at the level of Mount Akagi,” a nearby summit about half the height of Fuji at 1,828 metres (5,997ft).Akuzawa spends his mornings volunteering at a senior care centre and teaching painting at his home studio.View image in fullscreenKokichi Akuzawa and his daughter Yukiko, at his home that is decorated with his paintings of mountain landscapes.Photograph: Hiro Komae/APMountaineering and painting demand time and dedication but both offer peace, he said. “People who climb mountains, people who paint; if they can create something whole on that path, that’s the most fulfilling thing,” Akuzawa said.Akuzawa’s daughters want him to paint Fuji at sunrise for the next addition to the depictions of mountain ranges covering his living room walls.“I’ve got a lot of requests,” he said. “I want to paint some scenes from the summit of Mount Fuji, places that hold special memories for me, since this was probably my last time reaching the top.”Explore more on these topicsJapanMountaineeringGuinness World RecordsOlder peopleAsia PacificMountainsAgeingnewsShareReuse this content"

After being captured by Russian forces in December 2024, he wasjailed for 13 yearson thecharge of being a “mercenary”.Jenkinsappeared in a videoshared in December by a Russian military blogger showing him being roughly interrogated and hit.The Australian Ukrainian Congress (AUC) community group urged the government and Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, to take action through a contact group for prisoner swap negotiations, established with the government of Turkey.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailEarlier this year, groups of prisoners from both sides of the conflict were released following high-level talks in Istanbul. Russia and Ukraine agreed to a phased exchange of prisoners, as well as the return of killed soldiers’ remains.Ukrainian media reported in June that at least one more round of prisoner exchanges was expected in the near future as part of the agreement.But Russia and its proxies treat foreigners who travel to fight in Ukraine as mercenaries, allowing them to be prosecuted under the criminal code and not afforded rights under the Geneva conventions.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade summoned the Russian ambassador to Canberra in January to seek information on Jenkins, who had beenbelieved to be dead.

Anunverified video several weeks afterappeared to show him alive, though weak and with a serious injury.1:22Unverified footage appears to show Australian Oscar Jenkins alive in Russian captivity – videoMonths after his capture, Andrew Olexander, a spokesperson for the AUC, said attention on Jenkins’ case was receding.“We don’t want him to become Australia’s forgotten PoW,” Olexander told Guardian Australia.Olexander said Wong should push for Jenkins’ priority inclusion in the ongoing prisoner swaps program through representations to the Russian government. He welcomed Wong’s acknowledgment that Jenkins was a serving member of Ukraine’s armed forces and should therefore be considered a prisoner of war.“Claiming that he is a mercenary is just a word game so that Russia can send a warning to other foreign soldiers who might want to join Ukraine’s fight for freedom,” Olexander said.Wong has accused Russia of running “sham trial” to imprison Jenkins and called for him to be treated humanely by authorities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The commission had said at the time that the only way to satisfy antitrust concerns about Google’s lucrative digital ad business was to sell off parts of its business. However, this decision marks a retreat from that earlier position and comes amid renewed tensions between Brussels and the Trump administration over trade, tariffs and technology regulation.Top EU officials had said earlier that the commission was seeking a forced sale because past cases that ended with fines and requirements for Google to stop anti-competitive practices have not worked, allowing the company to continue its behavior in a different form.The commission’s penalty follows a formal investigation that it opened in June 2021, looking into whether Google violated the bloc’s competition rules by favoring its own online display advertising technology services at the expense of rival publishers, advertisers and advertising technology services.

Home to the Giorgio Armani headquarters since 2000, the sprawling space includes a purpose-built theatre where each show season a catwalk is constructed.On Friday, crowds again began to gather outside, but this time the mood was much more sombre. They had come to pay their final respects to the visionary Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani,who died on Thursdayat the age of 91.Announcing his death, the fashion company said it would set up a funeral chamber at its headquarters, giving people an opportunity to view the casket and pay their respects from Saturday to Sunday. Following Armani’s wishes, the funeral on Monday will remain private. With barriers now being erected along the street, long queues are expected to form.‘A void that is impossible to fill’: tributes paid to fashion designer Giorgio ArmaniRead moreArmani was affectionately referred to as the “king” or “maestro” of Italian fashion. His journey from humble beginnings in wartime Piacenza to global fashion icon was deeply admired. From fashion to beauty to hotels, restaurants and even chocolates, he leaves behind an empire rumoured to be worth more than £9bn.View image in fullscreenFlowers left outside the Armani Silos exhibition space in Milan.Photograph: Mourad Balti Touati/EPABeatrice Manca, a freelance fashion journalist based in Milan, plans to visit the chamber on Saturday. “Armani was more than a fashion designer in Italy; he was a source of national pride,” she says.Paola Locati, an independent fashion communication consultant, will also attend. “It strikes me to think that as of tomorrow, Mr Armani will be for the last time just a short distance away. I will go and say a final goodbye, I am sure there will be lots of people, because he was loved and admired by the general public, his creations the aspiration for many, two friends of mine got married in his suits. A true master has left us, and he will be sorely missed.”The mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, has declared Monday a day of national mourning. In a statement Sala said Armani “was and will always be one of the greatest representatives of Italian and Milanese fashion in the world”, adding: “Milan will miss his creative vision, his active participation, and his support for the life of our city.”1:12Giorgio Armani: a celebrated fashion icon – video obituaryArmani stores in Milan have closed and are expected to remain shuttered until after the funeral. Stores in London will close at 2pm on Monday. On YouTube, channels including CNN have set up live streams from outside the headquarters.Manca says his death “has affected even those who did not love or follow fashion”. She expects larges queues at the chamber. “Many of whom may never have seen a fashion show. Everyone dreamed of being part of the dignified, industrious, and sophisticated world created by Giorgio Armani.”Although Armani had been absent from his last three fashion shows owing to illness, he had been expected to attend the brand’s 50th anniversary show, which closes Milan fashion week later this month. He was also due to attend the opening of a retrospective at the Pinacoteca di Brera. Featuring more than 150 archive looks, it is the first time the museum has hosted a fashion exhibition and the first dedicated to a designer. Both events are still expected to go ahead.Explore more on these topicsArmaniItalyFashion industryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But many European countries, including Germany, Spain and Italy, have refused to provide troop commitments.Even among those who are willing to deploy troops, initial suggestions earlier this year of a peacekeeping mission that could police a ceasefire line was quickly scaled back to a “reassurance force” that would be stationed far from the front and provide training rather than combat assistance.On Thursday, Macron announced that 26 nations had pledged to provide postwar security guarantees to Kyiv, which would include a land, sea and air presence. “The day the conflict stops, the security guarantees will be deployed,” Macron said, during a joint press conference withVolodymyr Zelenskyyat the Élysée Palace in Paris.Speaking in the western Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod on Friday, Zelenskyy suggested the plans would involve a significant western force stationed in the country. “It is important that we are discussing all this ... it will definitely be in the thousands, not just a few,” he said, after meeting the European Council president, António Costa.However, Putin knows that western countries are unwilling to go to war overUkraine, and his threats on Friday look designed to further spook European capitals on the escalatory dangers of committing troops.Trump has vacillated over what support the US may provide for such a mission. At a meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders the day before he met Putin in Alaska last month, he appeared to promise some kind of US involvement but many are still blurry on the details.On Friday, NBCreportedthat the US could be willing to take the lead monitoring a demilitarised buffer zone around the frontlines after a ceasefire, with ground troops possibly provided by non-Nato countries.But all such plans are highly hypothetical and rely on Moscow and Kyiv agreeing to a deal to end the war, which does not currently appear to be close. Trump has set a number of deadlines for progress to be made towards peace but all of them have passed with little result. After meeting Putin in Alaska, Trump said he hoped the Russian president and Zelenskyy would meet one on one, followed by a three-way meeting.Zelenskyy has long said he is willing to meet Putin, but the Kremlin has prevaricated and said the conditions are not yet there for a meeting. On Friday, Putin said it would be “practically impossible” to reach an agreement with Ukraine, rendering a meeting pointless, but claimed he was open to meeting anyway, as long as Zelenskyy travelled to Moscow. “I said: I’m ready, please, come, we will definitely provide working conditions and security, a 100% guarantee,’” he said.“We are ready for any kind of meetings. But we don’t feel that Putin is ready to end this war,” said Zelenskyy on Friday, without directly addressing whether he would be prepared to travel to Moscow.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaEuropeEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

This year was no exception: stars including Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Jude Law and George Clooney dutifully waved from canals and trooped down red carpets (although Law tripped while on a water taxi and Clooney got ill).But the films themselves struck a different note. Jury president Alexander Payne may have rebutted questions about current affairs during his opening press conference, declaring himself concerned only with discussing cinema, but cinema at Venice this year was concerned largely, it turned out, with discussing current events.The big hits of the festival were both nailbiting ticking-clock stories – directed by women – that tackled real-world situations of such tragedy and magnitude that many people shy from discussing them, let alone make a movie about them.Towards the end of the festival,The Voice of Hind Rajab, Kaouther Ben Hania’s dramatisation of the killing by the Israel Defense Forces of a five-year-old girl in Gaza, earned a 23-minute standing ovation, as well as chants around the auditorium of “Free Palestine”.The film uses the real audio of Rajab’s phone call with emergency call handlers, where she pleads to be rescued from the car in which she was trapped after Israeli tank fire killed the family members around her. During the January 2024 incident, the ambulance sent to reach Rajab also came under attack and the two paramedics on board were killed. Rajab’s body, as well as those of her relatives and the paramedics were found 12 days later.Speaking in Venice, Ben Hania said: “I just felt I had to do something, so I wasn’t complicit. I have no political power. I’m not an activist. All I have is this one tool that I have mastered a little bit – cinema. At least, with this film, I wasn’t silenced.”View image in fullscreen‘The film is an invitation to decide what to do about all these weapons’ … from left: Idris Elba, Kathryn Bigelow and Rebecca Ferguson at a photocall for A House of Dynamite.Photograph: Riccardo Antimiani/EPAMeanwhile, Kathryn Bigelow’s first film in eight years,A House of Dynamite, put audiences repeatedly through the 18 minute period from the launch of a nuclear strike on the US until its landing, from the point of view of, variously, a soldier, military leader and the president (played by Idris Elba). Bigelow said she had made the film in an desperate attempt to kickstart conversations about a nuclear treaty.“The film is an invitation to decide what to do about all these weapons,” she said. “How is annihilating the world a good defensive measure?”Elsewhere, the evidence mounted that cinema is increasingly acting as a quasi-urgent response unit to help audiences interpret a chaotic world. Yorgos Lanthimos’s latest,Bugonia, stars Emma Stone as a high-powered executive kidnapped by conspiracy theorists convinced she is an alien intent on destroying Earth. Confirming the film as an allegory for inertia over tackling a climate catastrophe, its director said: “Humanity is facing a reckoning very soon. People need to choose the right path, otherwise, I don’t know how much time [we have] left.”Meanwhile,No Other Choice, the latest from Oldboy’s Park Chan-wook, was a satire about a long-serving employee fired from his role in a manufacturing plant who feels forced to eliminate all competitors for a future post. “We all harbour that deep fear of employment insecurity,” said Park. “Anyone who’s out there trying to make a living in the current modern capitalist society.”View image in fullscreenPlaying Vladimir Putin … Jude Law and Paul Dano in The Wizard of the Kremlin.Photograph: Carole BethuelGuillermo del Toro’sFrankensteinengaged with the ethics of AI,though he claimed otherwise, and Law was in town playing Vladimir Putin in Olivier Assayas’sThe Wizard of the Kremlin. While Law sought to downplay the film’s contemporary relevance, his director was less abashed, declaring: “The film is very much about how modern politics, 21st-century politics, was invented, and part of that evil raised from the rise to power of Vladimir Putin in Russia.”Such eagerness by film-makers for direct political engagement appears unlikely to wane. Announcing their lineup on Friday, the San Sebastián film festival director also issued a long statement calling for end to the “genocide … the unimaginable massacres to which the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is subjecting the Palestinian people.”Meanwhile in London on Wednesday evening, Hugh Bonneville took an ITV reporter by surprise when he began his comments on the red carpet by saying: “What’s about to happen inGazaCity is indefensible. The international community must do more to bring it to an end.” He then continued: “Downton Abbey’s a lovely film.”Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalFestivalsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warKathryn BigelownewsShareReuse this content"

The concern for government is that the evidence becomes a widely believed charge sheet against ministers as Israel resists all compromise in its fight against Hamas.Among the allegations made were that:RAF pilots flying from the UK Akrotiri airbase in Cyprus systematically shared intelligence in real time with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but not with the international criminal court.No 10 failed to provide the support requested by lawyers actingfor James Henderson, the British World Central Kitchen aid worker killed by the IDF on 1 April 2024, leaving them reliant on an IDF internal investigation, with a coroners’ inquiry still as long as two years away.Britain provided no support to the chief prosecutor at the international criminal court, Karim Khan, after the US government imposed sanctions that led a British bank to close his account, “so emboldening those who seek to dismantle international accountability”.The UK trade department continued to allow the import of products from Israel-occupied territories after the international court of justice in July 2024 ruled in an advisory opinion that the occupation was unlawful.Forz Khan, a lawyer acting for the family of Henderson, said: “The Henderson family want to know what the full picture is. He went out there in good faith, yet he was for some unknown reason murdered, picked off in a military fashion. An internal IDF investigation found that it was a mistake. Our case is that it was a deliberate murder.”Khan also claimed that when the Henderson family were finally given a meeting with ministers, their lawyers were prevented from attending.Henderson was killed when an Israeli airstrike targeted a clearly marked vehicle. The Israeli inquiry led to the dismissal of two officers. An inquiry by the IDF found a drone operator mistakenly targeted the convoy after thinking it had been taken over byHamasgunmen.Some of the most damaging evidence was given by Charlotte Andrews-Briscoe, a lawyer acting for the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq in the UK court challenge into the handling of arms exports controls toIsrael.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the UK government had examined 413 cases, and lawyers had found the only possible violation of international law involving World Central Kitchen.“That meant, 11 months into this deadly war, the UK government had not found a single incident that exclusively killed Palestinians and had been a possible violation of international law.”The Israeli government says it does not target children or civilians, but says its task is made harder by Hamas, which carried out the 7 October 2023 attacks and still holds Israeli hostages, embedding itself among the civilian population.Mark Smith, a diplomat whoquit his Foreign Office jobover the UK’s refusal to stop selling arms to Israel in August 2024, said civil servants who challenged the IDF’s methods were routinely pressed to tone down their findings “so it sounded less bad”.“Thousands of conversations within the walls of the Foreign Office on the most controversial aspects of our arms sales policy will never be seen by the public [and] never be put to a court because they were held in person,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGazaJeremy CorbynMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Sanctions will make it harder for international human rights organisations to cooperate with the groups, and will make day-to-day life more difficult for their employees.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said sanctions were imposed on the rights monitors for having “directly engaged in efforts by the international criminal court to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute Israeli nationals, without Israel’s consent”.Days earlier, the world’s leading genocide scholars’ associationsaid Israel’s actions in Gaza met the legal definition of genocide, an accusation Israel has denied.The groups asked the ICC in November 2023 to investigate Israeli airstrikes on densely populated civilian areas of Gaza, the siege of the territory and displacement of the population.Since filing the lawsuit, the humanitarian conditions in Gaza have worsened significantly, with the territory facing a starvation crisis and more than 80% of its infrastructure destroyed by Israeli bombing. At that point, nearly 10,000 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza – the number of dead is now more than 64,000.Two weeks ago,an Israeli strike on Nasser hospital in southern Gazathat killed 22 people,including five journalists, raised further questions about Israel’s conduct in the strip.An investigation released by the Associated Press on Friday cast doubt on Israel’s explanation that its forces had struck a position that was well known as a journalists’ gathering point because they believed a camera on the roof was being used by Hamas to observe troops. The AP said it had gathered new evidence indicating the camera in question actually belonged to a Reuters video journalist who was killed in the initial strike.View image in fullscreenPeople flee after the second of two rounds of Israeli strikes hit the outside stairs of Nasser hospital in Khan Younis on 25 August.Photograph: APThe agency noted it had repeatedly informed the army its journalists were stationed there, and that its investigation showed that troops used high-explosive tank shells to strike the hospital, instead of more precise guided weapons that might have resulted in fewer casualties.It said that soon after the first strike, Israeli forces had hit the same position again, after medical and emergency workers had reached the scene to treat the injured. The timing was reminiscent of the “double-tap” technique used by al-Qaida and by forces of the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and others.The three rights organisations released a joint statement condemning the sanctions, which they described as “immoral, illegal and undemocratic”.In their 2023 lawsuit, the three Palestinian groups asked the court to examine factors including Israel’s bombing of densely populated areas in Gaza and prevention of aid into the territory, claiming the actions amounted to crimes against humanity and incitement to genocide.A year later, the ICC issued arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant, as well as a Hamas leader, Ibrahim al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.Netanyahu’s office denounced the warrants as “antisemitic” and said Israel “utterly rejects the false and absurd charges”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some nations, including the US, China, Russia and Israel, do not recognise its authority.Why did ICC issue Netanyahu arrest warrant and what are the implications?Read moreDespite 124 countries being obliged to carry out the arrest warrants, in practice, states such as Hungary have not arrested Netanyahu when he visited.Israel also faces a case at the international court of justice brought by South Africa, which alleges that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Unlike the ICC, rulings from the ICJ are not legally binding but instead are used to inform the UN security council.In an interim judgment in January 2024, theICJ ruled that the claim of genocide was “plausible”and ordered Israel to stop acts of genocide and to allow more aid into Gaza. A final ruling is not expected until 2027 at the earliest.Israel has almost entirely ignored the ICJ’s provisional measures and has reduced the amount of aid let into the territory since the ruling.Israellaunched its assault on the Gaza Stripin October 2023, after fighters from Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in control of the territory, attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages back into Gaza.Since then, Israel’s war has killed 64,000 people, forced most of Gaza’s population to flee their homes at least once, and set off a starvation crisis in parts of the territory that aglobal hunger monitor described as a famine.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesTrump administrationGazaInternational criminal courtUS politicsUS foreign policyIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The US has announced itwill not give visas to Abbas and the authority’s delegationfor the general assembly, a decision Europeans are protesting against on the grounds that a reformed Palestinian Authority is essential to a ceasefire and the future governance of Palestine.Plans reportedly floated in the White House that in effect endorse Israeli annexation of Gaza and the West Bank are anathema to the European and Gulf leaders. “Displacement is not an option and it is a red line for Egypt, and we will not allow it to happen,” the Egyptian foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said on Friday.Tony Blair, close to many Gulf leaders as well as Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, has been in discussion with the UK Foreign Office andmet Trump last week in the White House.The two most controversial issues remain the disarmament of Hamas, a requirement of all European leaders, and whether candidates linked in the past to Hamas or terrorism will be able to stand in any elections for the Palestinian presidency and parliament.Speaking this week at the Chatham House thinktank, Dr Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian representative in the UK, said the Palestinian Authority was committed to staging elections in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, within a year of a ceasefire. A technocratic government would govern Palestine in the meantime.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I assure you the Palestinian people are very clever; they will elect the people that will actually serve them best.”He added: “There had to be one law, one government, one police force. We will do that because the main requirement right now is to keep our unity of territorial system, but in the end Hamas is part of the Palestinian political, national and social fabric, and they will not just disappear in a second. What we are discussing is not erasure, but reform, change in direction and internal dialogue, so we avert Israel’s complete annihilation project.”At a preliminary two-state solution conference in New York in June, Arab and Muslim states, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for the first time issued a joint call for Hamas to disarm and relinquish power in the Gaza Strip as part of efforts to end the war in the territory.The 22-member Arab League, the entire EU and another 17 countries backed the declaration that read: “The governance, law enforcement and security across all Palestinian territory must lie solely with the Palestinian Authority, with appropriate international support,” adding that “in the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international engagement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Palestinian state”.Explore more on these topicsGazaUnited NationsIsrael-Gaza warHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It is a limited-edition jersey intended to rally funds and solidarity for Gaza.Bohemians, a north Dublin side better known as Bohs, collaborated with the Dublin rock groupFontaines DCto make the jersey. It mixes Irish and Palestinian motifs and has raised more than €200,000 (£173,000) for the UK-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians.A veteran Irish activist,Caoimhe Butterly, gave the shirt to Thunberg on the flotilla that sailed in June. Israeli forcesintercepted the vesselsbefore they could deliver aid to the besieged Palestinian territory, where nearly 65,000 people have died and famine is spreading.The Irish activist Caoimhe Butterly with Greta Thunberg, who is wearing a Bohemians shirts, on a flotilla to Gaza.Photograph: Caoimhe ButterlyThunberg wore the shirt again in interviews before thelatest flotilladeparted on Monday, after delays caused by bad weather. After a stopover in Tunis, it is to resume its journey and try to circumvent the Israeli blockade.“Standing up for Palestinians in the face of Israel’s genocide is of great importance to so manyBohemiansmembers and supporters, so we are grateful to see the club represented in this small way by Greta wearing our jersey as she travels on the flotilla,” Bohemians said in a statement.“We commend Greta, and all those travelling on the latest flotilla, for their courage in standing up for the rights and dignity of Palestinians in the face of Israel’s unimaginable heights of brutality.”Israelrejects accusations of genocide and says itswar in Gazais an attempt to free hostages and crush Hamas, which attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and abducting 250 others. This week, the world’s leading genocide scholars’ associationissued a resolutionsaying Israel’s actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of the crime. The UN secretary general,António Guterres, has said the Gaza famine is a “man-made disaster”.Thunberg’s wearing of the jersey has delighted Irish activists and will probably bolster Israeli perceptions that Ireland – its government, artists and at least one football club – are hostile to Israel.Bohemians is afan-owned clubthat has acquired a reputation for social advocacy by championing marginalised groups inIrelandas well as Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Last year, it hosted a friendly with the Palestine national women’s team at Dalymount Park.Fontaines DC, like the Irish rap trioKneecap, have drawn controversy by using chants and banners to denounce Israel during concerts.

But I’d make a pretty basic point, first of all, diplomacy involves meeting people with whom you disagree, and the British government has very strong views in terms of the present conduct of the government of Israel.“It is right that we are engaging with politicians from across the region, because the suffering is incalculable and it needs to stop … In order to get to a path to that two-stage solution, of course you’re going to have to be talking not just to the Palestinians but also to the Israelis,”Alexandersaid.Labour MPs have called on the government to avoid meeting Herzog, saying any talks would send an ambiguous message about the UK’s position on theGazawar.Sarah Champion, the Labour MP and chair of the international development committee, posted on X that she hoped it was inaccurate that ministers would meet the Israeli leader: “The UK has recognised the ‘real risk’ of genocide perpetuated by Israel, so unless this meeting is about peace, what message are we sending?”John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said Herzog should not be permitted entry to the UK. “I am appalled at the decision to allow this representative of a government that issystematically killing Palestinian childrenon a daily basis to visit our country,” he said.“The prime minister is proving to be absolutely tone deaf to the desperate plight of the Palestinian people and the overwhelming feelings of revulsion of the British people at the brutality of the government Herzog represents.”View image in fullscreenA protester at a vigil outside Downing Street last month for journalists killed in Gaza.Photograph: Toby Shepheard/AFP/GettyThe Labour MP Clive Lewis suggested Starmer should exercise extreme caution. “Dialogue is one thing, but there are times when the act of meeting itself becomes a political statement,” he said.“Clearly Herzog is not Netanyahu, their politics on many issues are at variance. But that said, the president’s own words have helped legitimise the collective punishment of Palestinians, language that international jurists have warned could fall foul of the genocide convention.”However,Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, who has been a strong critic of Israel, said “efforts should be made to engage” with Herzog, who had often been at odds with Israel’s hardline prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over domestic issues.“The question must be asked: how do you see Israel in 10 years? What is the future for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza? If you have no reasonable alternative plan, Mr President, then there must be a Palestinian state,” she told the Guardian.“But the only solution to this is through politics, through discussion. Herzog is easier to talk to than many in the extreme rightwing government in Israel. But we mustn’t pull our punches.”Calum Miller, the Liberal Democrats’ foreign affairs spokesperson, said Starmer should “seize this chance to state unequivocally to President Herzog that there must be an end to the suffering in Gaza through an immediate ceasefire”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has previously clashed with Netanyahu over democratic and judicial changes but broadly backed the military campaign in Gaza.The Israeli president has received particular attention for a statement in which he asserted that all Palestinians in Gaza were “unequivocally” responsible for the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023.View image in fullscreenA man carries buckets of water past destroyed buildings in Gaza City.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty“The entire [Palestinian] nation out there … is responsible. It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved,” said Herzog in October 2023.That statement was given additional weight when it was included in the international court of justice’s order of 26 January 2024, finding the right of Palestinians to be protected from genocide was at “imminent risk”, and saying Israel must ensure “with immediate effect” that its forces not commit any of the acts prohibited by the genocide convention and to protect Gaza’s population from genocide.Herzog claimed his statement was misrepresented by the ICJ in selectively quoting him.Starmer last met Herzog more than a year ago in Paris, shortly after he was elected as prime minister, where hepraised the “historic friendship” between Israel and the UKand reiterated the demand for the return of hostages and “support for Israel’s right to self-defence”.But Starmer and Lammy have since adopted a more critical position on Israel’s actions in Gaza, which have killed more than 65,000 people, according to the territory’s health ministry.Sanctions have been imposed by the UK government on two hardline Israeli cabinet ministers, and Starmer has announced plans alongside France to recognise the state of Palestine this month. However, there remains considerable anger and concern within Labour and elsewhere that the UK has done too little to halt the suffering of Palestinians.Last week the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said heplanned to boycott a state dinnerto be hosted by King Charles during Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK in a fortnight – in protest at the US’s lack of pressure on Israel to end the war.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It was not immediately clear how much further damage it has caused.1:01Afghanistan faces 'overlapping crises' after a week of earthquakes – videoIt was the third major quake to hit the country this week, after another 5.5 magnitude aftershock struck on Tuesday, causing panic and interrupting rescue efforts as more roads were cut off by rockfall.Most of the casualties from Sunday’s earthquake have been in Kunar province, where most people typically live in wood and mud-brick houses along steep river valleys, separated by high mountains, which were highly vulnerable to the impact of the quake.The death toll rose steeply on Thursday as rescue operatives managed to reach villages that had been completely cut off in the disaster and bodies continued to be pulled from debris. Fitrat said that search and rescue operations were still ongoing to recover the injured and dead.About 98% of the buildings in the province were damaged or destroyed, according to an assessment issued on Thursday by the charity Islamic Relief.‘The walls collapsed around me’: Afghans describe quake devastationRead moreThe rough, steeply mountainous terrain has been hindering relief efforts. Taliban authorities have deployed helicopters and airdropped army commandos to help locate and rescue survivors. Aid workers reported walking for hours to reach villages cut off by landslides and rockfall.Muhammad Israel said the quake unleashed a landslide that buried his home, livestock and belongings in Kunar. “All the rocks came down from the mountain,” he said. “I barely got my children out of there … The earthquake jolts are still happening. It is impossible to live there.”He was staying at a UN medical camp in Nurgal, one of the worst-affected districts. “The situation is also bad for us here, we don’t have shelter and are living under open skies,” he said.Rescue and relief efforts have also been impacted by a lack of international aid funding and resources flowing into the country. Since the Taliban seized back power in 2021 and began imposing hardline religious laws, making it difficult for NGOs and aid groups to function, there has been a steep drop in aid and support to Afghanistan.Aid agencies said they were urgently in need of staff and supplies to tend to the injured and to house tens of thousands who had been left homeless and without access to food or water. According to aid agencies, around 84,000 people have been affected so far.The Norwegian Refugee Council said it had fewer than 450 staff in Afghanistan, whereas it had 1,100 in 2023 when the last major quake struck the country. The council had only one warehouse remaining and no emergency stock.“We will need to purchase items once we get the funding but this will take potentially weeks and people are in need now,” said Maisam Shafiey, a communications and advocacy adviser for the council in Afghanistan. “We have only $100,000 available to support emergency response efforts. This leaves an immediate funding gap of $1.9m.”Shamshair Khan, a doctor tending to the injured at the UN camp in Nurgal, said supplies were already running out. “Neither these medicines are enough nor these services,” he said. “These people need more medicine and tents. They need food and clean drinking water. They need more aid. These people are in great pain.”The earthquake came as Afghanistan was already struggling with drought and a severe economic crisis that has left many struggling to survive. The withdrawal of USAID funding, after cuts by the Trump administration earlier this year, resulted in the closure of many hospitals and medical clinics.The pressures on the country have also been exacerbated by the forced return of over 2 million Afghans from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, many who have nowhere to live and work in Afghanistan.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanEarthquakesSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, textile and garment exports to the US alone fetched £21bn, riding a wave of strong consumer demand.Now the trade is in jeopardy. With the stroke of a pen, the US president,Donald Trump, last week slapped a 50% tariff on more than half of India’s £65bn worth of merchandise exports to the country’s largest market. A supply chain once prized for being cheap suddenly became among the priciest.The scale of the hit is sobering. Christopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at the investment bank Jefferies, puts the economic blow at £41bn-£45bn, singling out textiles, footwear, jewellery and gems, all of which are highly labour-intensive, as “the most negatively impacted”.The pain is visible in Tirupur, Tamil Nadu’s booming textile hub. “We’re scared of losing our jobs. Many of us borrowed money to come here. If the factories cut workers, we will have nothing,” Harihar Pradhan, a 32-year-old migrant worker from Odisha told the Times of India.Tirupur’s half a million workers churn out cotton T-shirts, tracksuits and undergarments. They are shipped worldwide, but Americans have always been the biggest customers. Factories in Tirupur, as well as Noida in Uttar Pradesh, near Delhi, and Gujarat, are already shuttering production lines, according to the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO).Fashion’s unseen stories: the homeworkers of Tirupur – in picturesRead moreAlongside textiles, India’s gems, jewellery and seafood industries face the same tariffs: 50%, compared with 15-20% for competitors in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and South Korea.Effective rates, once exemptions and existing duties are folded in, are even more punishing: 62% for ready-made garments, up from 12%, and 60% for shrimp, for example. “That’s a massive competitive disadvantage,” said Aurodeep Nandi, an economist at the Asian investment bank Nomura.Margins in these industries were razor-thin to begin with. The new tariffs could push them into loss-making territory, threatening factory closures, mass job losses and the unravelling of supply chains built over decades.Kirit Bhansali, the chair of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, warned of “devastation”. The US “is our single largest market, accounting for over $10bn [£7.4bn] in exports – nearly 30% of our industry’s total global trade,” he said. “A blanket tariff of this magnitude will inflate costs, delay shipments, distort pricing and place immense pressure on every part of the value chain. We fear exports to the US could fall by over 75%, impacting polished diamonds, jewellery and coloured gemstones alike.”Indian exporters rushed shipments to the US in August to beat the fall of the tariff hammer. “If the tariffs stick even for just three to six months, I fear India will lose a major share of this [apparel and garment] business,” said Pallab Banerjee, a senior executive at Pearl Global Industries, a leading garment manufacturing firm. A Jaipur exporter added: “Global buyers are highly price-sensitive. Even a 5% tariff difference can turn away buyers.”Pearl Global can shift orders to factories abroad. But most Indian firms lack that luxury.The stakes for India’s government are political as well as economic. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, has pitched manufacturing as a way to provide jobs to the millions of young Indians who join the labour force each year. These industries employ tens of millions, directly and indirectly.The tariffs pose a direct threat to that pledge, says Adil Kotwal of the Seepz Gems and Jewellery Manufacturers’ Association. “We will see tens of thousands of skilled workers displaced across the country, in Surat, Jaipur, Mumbai and beyond. And once those jobs are lost, the damage will be hard to reverse,” he said.The economic ripple effects spread quickly: fewer tiffin meals get ordered; smaller earnings for drivers and delivery staff, and weaker sales for local vendors.Across other industries, shrimp farming alone supports more than 16 million Indians. Two-thirds of the sector’s £5.5bn in exports go to the US. A Kolkata exporter said: “With the tariffs, India’s shrimp will become super-expensive in the US market. We’re already facing huge competition from Ecuador, as it has only a 15% tariff.” Leather exporters, too, are bracing for tough times. The US buys a fifth of India’s leather goods, from shoes to handbags.Trump has long called India a “tariff king” and accused Delhi of shutting the US out of the domestic market. But officials hoped Modi’s personal rapport with Trump, and India’s role as a strategic bulwark against China, might earn leniency. In July, Trump announced a 25% tariff, painful but seen as survivable. A month later, Trump doubled the levy,citing India’s purchases of discounted Russian oilthat he argued were funding Russia’s war against Ukraine.Trump’s demand that India stop buying Russian oil puts Modi in tight spotRead moreA key reason for the draconian tariff hike, though, according to a New York Times report, was Trump’s anger at Delhi dismissing his claims of brokering peace in the fierce four-day May conflict between arch-foes India and Pakistan.Many Indian exporters had expected tariffs of 10-15%, low enough to keep themselves in play as a seller to the US. Instead, they are finding themselves priced out.The economic growth fallout could be steep. Economists reckon the tariffs could shave up to one percentage point off India’s GDP this year. The country’s surprisingly strong 7.8% first-quarter expansion may cushion the blow, but only partially. “The effective macro hit from the 50% tariff imposition will start to feed via exports and have a domino effect on employment, wages and private consumption,” said Madhavi Arora, the chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services.Industry groups are pressing for credit relief, export assistance and aggressive pursuit of trade deals with other countries. Government officials talk of diversifying towards Japan, South Korea and China, while launching a textile export drive targeting 40 countries.As SC Ralhan, the head of the FIEO trade body, put it: “The steps taken now will determine how effectively India withstands external shocks.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaTrump tariffsInternational tradeDonald TrumpEconomicsGlobal economyTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Met Office recommends people keen to see the phenomenon plan to be somewhere with as clear a view of the eastern horizon as possible, ready for the lunar eclipse to peak in the UK at 7.33pm. In built-up areas this may mean going to a hill or viewpoint.The eclipse – sometimes referred to as a “blood moon” – will be visible to the naked eye and unlike solar eclipses is safe to view directly as the moon’s reflected light is not as bright.Giant asteroid could crash into moon in 2032, firing debris towards EarthRead moreDr Ed Bloomer, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, said the moon will rise over the UK just in time for people to see the tail end of the eclipse. He said: “The moon is pretty unmistakable in the sky, so the most important thing is to face the right direction.“It’ll be rising towards the east, and head southwards over the course of the night. As it rises, the most important thing will be whatever is low on your horizon. A flat landscape, or an elevated position makes for the best visibility – so there aren’t things like buildings, trees, or other things in the way.“A lunar eclipse like this is a great opportunity for observing with kids too. It isn’t too late for us in the UK, the target is nice and easy, and minute by minute you will notice changes – good for short attention spans.”People eager to see the eclipse are advised to check the forecast in their area over the weekend, but the Met Office said the clearest skies for viewing the blood moon are most likely to be across the south-west and parts of eastern England.The Royal Observatory said the next partial lunar eclipse will be in August 2026. Other regions well positioned to view the eclipse include Australia, China, India, the Philippines and parts of Africa.But most of North and South America will miss out entirely as they will be on the sunlit side of the planet during the event.Throughout history, blood moons have stirred awe and superstition. Ancient cultures from Norse to South American, Native American to Chinese, interpreted the red moon as a sign of divine anger or supernatural conflict, while biblical texts warned that “the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the day of the Lord comes, that great and terrible day”.Explore more on these topicsThe moonSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

David Lammy moved to the justice department and will also become deputy prime minister.Mahmood, who has impressed across Westminster for her political skills and policy grip to the extent she is now regularly tipped as a future Labour leader, will now play a significant role in the government’s survival as she battles to get a grip of small boats and asylum hotels.The hand of Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister’s chief of staff, was seen across the reshuffle. Labour figures suggested it was a further move to the right. With the departure of Rayner, Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, becomes one of the few cabinet members on the party’s soft left still in post.Pat McFadden, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, is to take over Rayner’s housing and communities brief as part of a revamped, growth-based department also taking in the skills remit formerly held by the Department for Education.In what was largely a shuffling round of jobs between existing ministers, Liz Kendall, who was the work and pensions secretary, has taken over as science and technology secretary from Peter Kyle, who becomes trade secretary. He replaces Jonathan Reynolds, who becomes chief whip.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ian Murray, removed as Scottish secretary, also left government. He was replaced by Douglas Alexander, who served as a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.As the prime minister began reshaping his cabinet team, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, was confirmed as staying in place early on, as Downing Street sought to reassure the markets that the economy was in safe hands.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, John Healey, the defence secretary, and Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, were among the few ministers to stay in their posts.Rayner had referred herself to the ethics adviser after confirming she would have to pay more stamp duty because she had incorrectly paid the lower rate on the flat in Hove.She had classified the flat as her only property despite spending much of her time with her children at the family house in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.Months before the Hove purchase, she had put her stake in the Ashton house into a trust set up in 2020 to manage a payment to one of her sons, who after a “deeply personal and distressing incident” as a premature baby had been left with lifelong disabilities.Because her son is the beneficiary of that trust and is under 18, Rayner was still counted as having a financial interest in it for tax purposes.However, when she bought the Hove flat, she declared she did not have an interest in any other property, allowing her to pay the lower stamp-duty rate of about £30,000. The higher rate would have been an estimated £70,000.Though she claimed to have received written tax advice before completing her purchase, saying she was entitled to pay the lower amount, Rayner’s conveyancersaid on Thursdayshe had not provided any such advice.Explore more on these topicsLabourAngela RaynerKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

You cannot come here illegally and stay: we will stop the boats within two weeks of winning government.”Keir Starmer and his predecessor, Rishi Sunak, have both struggled to stop dangerous crossings amid rising public anger on the right about the housing of those seeking asylum in hotels and charities calling for safe and legal routes for refugees.The Reform leader said he had brought forward his speech by three hours to address the fact that the government was in crisis. He walked on stage to rock music and fireworks, with a break in the middle of his speech for the former Tory cabinet minister Nadine Dorries to talk about her defection.She said the government was showing it could not manage the economy and that Labour was “fracturing and dividing into two”. Dorries added: “We are in deep trouble and you can’t look at either of the two main political parties up till now to save the country.”Farage and Dorries were preceded by the former Tory MP and new mayor of Greater Lincolnshire Andrea Jenkyns, who came on stage in a sequined blue jumpsuit bellowing out a pop song she wrote herself called Insomniac. She told the audience that they were like the “insomniacs” alert to the UK’s problems when the rest of the country was “sleepwalking” into decline.0:34Andrea Jenkyns performs self-written song Insomniac at Reform UK conference – videoReturning to the stage, Farage urged the audience to “make Britain great again” and spoke about a range of policies, in particular culture wars talking points – but did not mention the NHS, housing or transport.Farage praised thespread of St George’s cross and union flagsacross lamp-posts, which critics have said are inflaming tensions and making migrants feel unwelcome.The Reform leader said every flag placed in view was a way of “sticking two fingers up at the establishment” and saying “we have had enough”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Security also tried to prevent journalists from filming and taking pictures of their handling of the episode.One of the protesters had shouted at Farage that he was not a man of the people. As the woman was carried out, the Reform leader said: “Go easy, she’s clearly got some anger management issues.”Yusuf told a fringe event at the conference that recent Labour attacks on Farage for being “unpatriotic” were similar to the “Russia-gate controversy” in the US around claims that Trump was effectively an agent of the Kremlin.“I think those sorts of attacks are going to ramp up,” Yusuf said. “They have kind of realised they can’t beat us on the arguments. They have just given up on their ability to stop the boats.”Yusuf also said that Tommy Robinson “deserves some credit” for raising the issue of grooming gangs – although he was clear that he would never be allowed to join Reform.His tone was at odds with Farage’s, who has made clear his rejection of Robinson’s far-right activism and as a result fell out with US billionaire Elon Musk and two former senior Reform figures, Ben Habib and Howard Cox.A Labour party spokespersonrejected Farage’s criticisms, saying: “Nigel Farage could have used his conference speech to offer more than just anger without answers and to say more than just ‘don’t know’ to the problems facing the country. He didn’t. It was the same old parade of complaints we’ve heard before.“His answer to the charge that Reform is a one-man band was to unveil one of the faces of failure from the last Tory government, Nadine Dorries.

The man was arrested a little more than a fortnight later, but then released while officers investigated. Police said Sheryl Wilkins died in north London on 24 August. The same man, aged 40, was arrested over both deaths on Thursday.Detectives are investigating how the suspect and the two women might have known each other. One line of investigation is that the two women were sex workers. Police do not know if the women knew each other.DCI Neil John, who is leading the investigation, said: “My sympathy goes to the family and friends of both victims, who have been updated on this development and continue to be supported by specialist officers.“No woman should feel unsafe in our city, and we know this news will cause concern across communities. Our investigation is continuing at pace and remains a priority. I urge anyone who has information relating to either incident to contact us as soon as possible.”Police have not named the man who has been arrested. In March officers responded to reports of an unresponsive woman in a building in Aylesbury Estate in the Walworth area of south-east London.Emergency workers fought to save her but the 53-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene. She was identified as Trujillo.Officers launched an investigation after the cause of her death could not be determined during a postmortem examination. That led police to arrest the man on suspicion of murder 15 days later, on 1 April. “He was released under investigation while extensive inquiries continued,” officers said on Friday.On Sunday 24 August, the second woman was found unresponsive more than seven miles from the scene of Trujillo’s death, in High Road in Tottenham. The 39-year-old was identified as Wilkins and pronounced dead at the scene.Again, police launched an investigation when no cause of death could be determined during a postmortem. The man was arrested on 4 September on suspicion of murdering Wilkins, and rearrested on suspicion of murdering Trujillo. He remains in custody, police said on Friday.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board.He was sentenced in state court to 50 days in jail, with credit for time served, plus five years of probation, despite a presumption that the convictions would bring 16 to 18 months in prison. He is due to be sentenced in November in the federal case; his attorneys will recommend probation, while prosecutors will be able to argue for a sentence of up to one year in custody.Emerson told Cheryl Albrecht, the Multnomah county circuit court judge, that he recognized he had caused harm not only to those on board, but to society at large by reducing confidence in air travel and to the airline professionals who perform excellent work every day.“It should not have happened, and I bear the responsibility for that,” he said.US pilot who took magic mushrooms and tried to cut engines says behavior ‘unfathomable’Read moreEmerson told police he was despondent over a friend’s recent death, had takenpsychedelic mushroomsabout two days earlier, and hadn’t slept in more than 40 hours. He has said hebelieved he was dreamingat the time and that he was trying to wake himself up by grabbing two red handles that would have activated the plane’s fire-suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.The airline has said that other members of the flight crew had not observed signs of impairment that would have barred Emerson from the cockpit.A passenger on the flight, Alison Snyder, told the court the “consequences proposed today seem insufficient relative to Mr Emerson’s choices and actions, regardless of his explanations or circumstances”.“Mr Emerson knew he was not fit to fly, a requirement for sitting in the cockpit,” Snyder said. “Joseph Emerson’s behavior that day showed he lacks the judgment to be a pilot and should never be allowed anywhere near a flight deck ever again.”In court Friday, Emerson reiterated that he had been unable to perceive reality for an extended period after taking the mushrooms, but “that doesn’t make this right”, he said.Emerson also said he was grateful to the flight crew for restraining him and saving his life, along with those of everyone else on board. He called it “the greatest gift I ever got”, even though he lost his career and wound up in jail, because it made him confront his mental health challenges and reliance on alcohol.“This difficult journey has made me a better father, a better husband, a better member of my community,” he said. “Today I get to be the dad I was incapable of when I had to use alcohol to deal with life as life is.”Emerson, of Pleasant Hill, California, was charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew. A state indictment inOregonseparately charged him with 83 counts of endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft.He previously pleaded not guilty to all the charges, and in December 2023 he was released from custody pending trial, with requirements that he undergo mental health services, stay off drugs and alcohol, and keep away from aircraft.On Friday, Emerson pleaded guilty to the federal count and no contest to the state charges, which carries the same legal effect as a guilty plea.The conditions of the state agreement include five years of probation, 664 hours of community service – eight hours for each person he endangered – and $60,569 in restitution, nearly all of it to Alaska Air Group, Horst said.Half of his community service can be performed at a pilot health non-profit Emerson founded after his arrest. He must also undergo assessments for drug and alcohol and mental health treatment, refrain from using any non-prescribed drugs, and keep at least 25ft (7.6 meters) away from operable aircraft unless he has permission from his probation officer.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAir transportUS crimeWashington stateOregonWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

So I want to be clear with you. I am in this race, and I’m the only one that can beat Mamdani,” Adams remarked.The announcement came asthe US president – a native ofNew YorkCity – had reportedly been pushing Adams, who has been polling in the single digits, to ditch his campaign for re-election. Trump had reportedly even floated a potential ambassador post in Saudi Arabia to Adams in order to convince him to drop out.Adamsdeniedthose claims, saying on Thursday: “I have never been promised a job.” At his renewed campaign pitch on Friday, Adams did not take questions from reporters.He insteadpointed at a mayoral polo shirt and said he intended to wear it “another four years”. He also insulted his rivals as “spoiled brats” who were not working-class New Yorkers like he and voters were.Sources toldABC Newsthat Trump’s team had been hearing from Republican donors in the city pleading with Trump aides to get involved in the New York City mayoral race, citing fears thatMamdani, who has had a commanding lead in polling, could win the November election.There is a suggestion that Cuomo could consolidate enough support to challenge Mamdani if Adams – who won the 2021 race to become mayor of one of the world’s biggest cities as a Democrat – and the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, were to drop out of the race. The New York Times reported that there have been talks in the Trump administration about also finding a job for their fellow Republican Sliwa to get him out of the race.Mamdani’s team on Friday issued a statement saying: “Zohran’s running to serve New York, not do the bidding of an authoritarian president and his billionaire friends.“City hall should belong to the people – that’s what our city deserves and what Zohran’s campaign is all about.”Explore more on these topicsEric AdamsAndrew CuomoZohran MamdaniNew YorkDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some legal expertsquestionedwhether the strike was lawful under international law.The combination of aggressive military action and symbolic rebranding goes in contrast with Trump’s repeated claims to be “the anti-war president” who campaigned on promises to end conflicts and avoid new wars. Trump said during the signing of the order that his focus on strength and trade has improved America’s position in the world..Trump has argued the original name betterreflects military victoriesand honestly represents what the department does.

The US lost 13,000 jobs in June, according to the latest survey, the first time it went into the negative since December 2020.The unemployment rate for August inched up to 4.3%, the highest it has been since 2021.The healthcare sector added 31,000 last month but most other sectors were flat or lost jobs.Chart of US jobsThe report highlighted worrying trends:Federal employment dropped 15,000 jobs in August, totaling 97,000 jobs lost since January.Manufacturing jobs went down by 12,000 in August and have tumbled 78,000 for the year.The racial unemployment gap widened in August. Black Americans are seeing an unemployment rate of 7.5%, compared to 6.1% last August. The unemployment rate for White Americans is 3.7%The closely watched data comes from a monthly survey of employers conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which has beenunder attackfromDonald Trumpafter it revised its findings last month, showing that hiring in early summer was much weaker than initially reported.Last month the BLS slashed the number of new jobs created in May and June by by more than 250,000. The figures – revised when the bureau received more reports from businesses and government agencies – showed hiring over the summer was far weaker than first reported. The revised figures for May and June were 19,000 and 14,000, respectively – the lowest since the pandemic.Those figures were revised again this month. The BLS revised June’s tally down by 27,000, from +14,000 to -13,000, and the change for July was revised up by 6,000, from +73,000 to +79,000. Employment in June and July combined was 21,000 lower than previously reported.Though Trump claimed the revisions were “rigged in order to make the Republicans, and me, look bad”, August’s figures show that the slumped pattern has continued even after Trump fired the bureau’s commissioner in retaliation. Trump has nominated a conservative ally who helped write Project 2025 as the bureau’s commissioner, leaving many economistsworriedabout the future of the bureau.And data from other sources besides the bureau has also highlighted stagnation in the labor market. The payroll firmADPreported on Thursday that private employers added 54,000 jobs in August, nearly 20,000 below expectations. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas also reported that job cuts reached 85,979 in August – up 39% from July and up 13% compared with August 2024.“The year started with strong job growth, but that momentum has been whipsawed by uncertainty. A variety of things could explain the hiring slowdown, including labor shortages, skittish consumers and AI disruption,” said Nela Richardson, the chief economist at ADP.The Federal Reserve has been monitoring the labor market for signs that it may need to adjust interest rates. At his speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell,seemed to hintthat officials were leaning toward a rate cut at their next meeting on 17 September.Though Wall Street investors have been waiting for the Fed’s next rate cut, which would be its first since December, the next cut will probably come withcaveats. Powell emphasized that it was still unclear what impact Trump’s tariffs and immigration policies will have on the economy.“There is significant uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be,” he said.Revisions and rising unemployment: what to know about the US jobs reportRead morePowell warned that while there are new jobs being added each month, “the downside risks to employment are rising. And if those materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.”Powell, who was first appointed by Trump in 2017 and again by Biden in 2022, reaches the end of his second term in May 2026. Trump earlier this year walked back onthreatsto fire Powell after stock markets responded poorly to his comments and the supreme court implied that the Fed chair has special protection from termination.But the White House has continued pressuring the Fed, includingfiringLisa Cook, a Fed governor, for allegedmortgage fraud, and implying that the weak job numbers are due to the central bank’s inaction. On Friday, Trump and his cabinet zeroed in on Powell again and attacked the Fed for being “too late” to lower interest rates.“Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he’s “Too Late’!” Trump wrote on Truth Social Friday.Lori Chavez-DeRemer, labor secretary,toldFox Business that Powell “should be embarrassed by this report because he has not done his job”. Meanwhile, Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, published anop-edin the Wall Street Journal on Friday morning, arguing that the Fed over the years has “blurred the lines between monetary and fiscal policy” and accused the Fed of “regulatory overreach”.Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment dataEconomicsTrump tariffsJerome PowellDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

In second place, with $272.3bn, is the investor and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.The incentive plan, revealed in afiling to the US Securities and Exchange Commissionon Friday, comes at a time when some observers have questioned whether Musk’s outspoken political views could be holding Tesla back.The carmaker’s European salesfell by 40% earlier this year, a dramatic slump that some analysts attributed to Musk’s vocal support for far-right political parties, and his intense but short-lived alliance with Donald Trump.Musk has also divided his duties between Tesla and the stewardship of other ventures, such as SpaceX, Neuralink, xAI and the Boring Co, on top of the time he spends posting on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, which he bought for $44bn in 2022.“One minute Tesla’s board is wondering if Elon Musk is a liability to the company given his outspoken views and political distractions, the next they’re effectively saying ‘pick a number, any number’ to lock him in for as long as possible,” said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at the London-based stockbroker AJ Bell.He said the pay package “beggars belief”, questioning whether one person could be worth that much.But in its statement to shareholders, signed by directors Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, Tesla offered Musk an outspoken vote of confidence, describing him as its “visionary leader”.The company also referred investors, a majority of whom must support the pay deal for it to go through, to the difficulty it has previously had in securing incentives for Musk.The filing referred to a legal challenge that has prevented it from following through on apay deal announced in 2018that gave Musk the chance to claim a $55.8bn bonus.Acourt ruled last yearin favour of a group of investors who claimed that the scheme’s targets had been inappropriately set. An appeal by Tesla is due to be heard next month.“Ultimately, the new award aims to build upon the success of the 2018 CEO performance award framework, which ensured that Elon was only paid for performance delivered and incentivised to guide Tesla through a period of meteoric growth,” the company said.Tesla said the new plan included profit targets that were 28 times higher than the 2018 scheme and would also hinge on delivering new products, such as getting1m “robotaxis” in operationand delivering 1m AI bots, humanoid robots that the company is developing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Therefore, it feels like many investors would happily approve it.“The bigger question is whether this proposal sets a new precedent and boardrooms across America will think it’s OK to add a zero or two on to the end of current remuneration packages.

About 300 areSouth Koreannationals, according to local media reports. Hyundai Motor is a South Korean automotive company but has many international plants.The raid on Thursday has dealt a setback to the company’s substantial project in Georgia and was a dramatic iteration of theTrump administration’s harsh crackdown on immigrants in the US.From Uncle Sam to social media memes: inside homeland security’s push to swell Ice ranksRead moreIt also showed the disruptive impact thatDonald Trump’s mass deportation agenda is having on businesses, even as the White House tries to spur more inflows from foreign investors.An agent at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said multiple federal agencies, including Ice, the FBI and the DEA “conducted a judicially authorized enforcement operation, as we are actively conducting an investigation into unlawful employment practices”.“Arrests are being made,” Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia, said in a news briefing.A government official representingSouth Korea, the home of Hyundai Motor, said those arrested were being held at an Ice detention facility.South Korea’s foreign ministry said that “many of our nationals” had been detained and expressed concern about the impact of the raid.“The economic activities of our companies investing in the United States and the interests of our citizens must not be unduly violated during the course of US law enforcement,” a ministry spokesperson, Lee Jae-woong, said in a statement on Friday.The battery production facility, a joint venture between South Korean battery maker LGES and Hyundai Motor, was due to start operations at the end of this year, according to LGES, to power electric vehicles.The arrests could exacerbate tensions between Washington and Seoul, a key ally and investor in the US. The countries have been at odds over the details of a trade deal that includes $350bn of investments. At a summit last month, South Korea pledged $150bn in US investments – including $26bn from Hyundai Motor.A spokesperson at the Hyundai-GA battery company in Georgia said in a statement that it was cooperating fully and that it had paused construction work.DHS officials said the workers who were arrested were barred from working in the US after crossing the border illegally or overstaying visas, following an investigation lasting several months.A Hyundai Motor spokesperson said none of the people detained were employed directly by the automaker, which complies “with all laws and regulations wherever we operate”.Hyundai Motor also said its production of electric vehicles at the sprawling site was not affected.The workers were being held at Ice’s Folkston, Georgia, detention facility, Schrank said. Most of the 475 people are Korean nationals, he said.In 2023, Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution (LGES) announced the $4.3bn venture to produce EV battery cells, with each company holding a 50% stake. The plant will supply batteries for Hyundai, Kia and Genesis EV models.The battery factory is part of Hyundai’s $12.6bn investments in Georgia, including the automaker’s just-opened car factory, in what would be “the largest economic development project in the state’s history” and is part of a bigger investment in US industry by the South Korean company,announced in Marchas Trump was ramping uptariffs.Social media video footage showed a man wearing a vest with the letters HSI, an acronym for Homeland Security Investigations, telling workers in yellow safety vests: “We have a search warrant for the whole site.

Here’s how he’s trying to get his wayRead moreLast month, Trumpmoved to fireCook over unconfirmed claims that she listed two properties as her primary residence. Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing and Finance Agency and a close ally of Trump, alleged Cook had lied on bank documents and records to obtain a better mortgage rate.Cook, a voting member of the Fed board that sets interest rates, said she had “no intention of being bullied to step down” and that she would “take any questions about my financial history seriously”.In response to Trump’s attempt to dismiss her, Cook filed alawsuitagainst the president arguing that her removal was unconstitutional and threatened the independence of the Fed. Cook’s lawyers say the firing is “unprecedented and illegal” and that federal law requires showing “cause” for a Fed governor’s removal.“An unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications submitted by Governor Cook prior to her Senate confirmation is not [cause],” her lawyers said in court documents.‘Pattern of lawfare’: Trump is targeting opponents with mortgage fraud claimsRead moreIn court documents, lawyers for Cook suggested that a “clerical error” may be behind the discrepancies found in her mortgage records.Cook was appointed by Joe Biden in 2022 for a 14-year term on the board that was set to end in 2038. She is the first Black woman to be appointed to the board.US district court judge Jia Cobbheard argumentsfor the lawsuit last week and said she will expedite the case, which is ultimately expected to be taken up by the US supreme court.Trump’s attacks against Cook come against the backdrop of a long fight the White House has waged against the Fed, which has historically been treated as non-partisan.Earlier in the year, Trumpthreatenedto fire the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, for not lowering interest rates, but ultimately walked back his threats after negative responses from investors. Trump also tried to accuse Powell of fraud overrenovationsat the Fed’s headquarters, which have cost more than anticipated.Abbe Lowell, Cook’s lawyer, told the Journal that “it takes nothing for this DoJ to undertake a new politicized investigation”.

It’s far from the league’s first misstep of lateAndrew Lawrencein New YorkFri 5 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 05.01 EDTShareTom Brady catches all the breaks. First,the Tuck Rulehelped pave the way for his charmed NFL career. Now, there’s the Brady Exception to ease his unexpectedly rough transition into the broadcast booth.Quick refresher: In May 2022 Fox rushed to sign Brady toa blockbuster 10-year, $375m dealto work as their lead analyst once he retired (that ended up being the end of the 2022 season). Then, a year later, Brady called a surprise audible andbought a 5% stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, without apparently considering how that might affect his position at Fox. In a typical setup, the top broadcast booths embed with the teams they’re covering in the days leading up to a game. But with Brady also a part-owner of the Raiders, other NFL teams justifiably worried his TV role would allow him to gain inside information on opponents.After 17 months of haggling with league owners – as Bradystruggled through standup comedy, divorce and other post-retirement fumbles – the Raiders deal was approved on the condition that he stay out of Fox’s team briefings. With only his 23 years experience and broadcast partner Kevin Burkhardt’s notes to draw from, Brady finally made his Fox debut in 2024. The resultshave not been pretty.Which brings us back to the Brady Exception. After making such a big deal of the QB’s sneak to the Raiders, NFL ownersare reportedly allowingBrady to attend pre-game production meetings with players and coaches while upholding the ban on him attending team practices. The concession is as much a testament to Brady always getting his way as it is a troubling indicator of the NFL’s hasty retreat from integrity and objectivity. After all, this is the league in which the former commissioner Pete Rozelle introduced himself to team owners after washing himself with the phrase: “I can honestly say that I come to you withclean hands.”NFL 2025 season predictions: will it be Mahomes, Jackson or Allen in the Super Bowl?Read moreThat mission statement, which set the tone for 30 years of league prosperity that was guided in large part by Rozelle’s unerring moral compass, has a strange ring now. A month before the owners reversed field on Brady, theNFLunveiled another piece of news that may have jarred with Rozelle. The league announced the acquisition of a 10% equity stake in ESPN, meaning it is now a part-owner of a broadcaster that, among other things, reported objectively on the NFL itself in the past.That’s not the only way the NFL has influence over a media that is supposed to interrogate the league’s actions. NFL games accounted for 72 of the 100 most-watched telecasts in the US in 2024, making the league’s product extremely valuable to broadcasters. In turn, that means those same broadcasters may be reluctant to bring up uncomfortable storylines for the league, particularly around concussion and brain trauma in players. “You can’t get this issue on television anymore,” the former footballer turned neuroscientist Chris Nowinskitold me last month. “That’s primarily because the NFL has now given a game to every media platform. It’s not even a well-kept secret that anybody who carries game broadcasts is very concerned about [not calling attention to] CTE in the NFL.”Speaking of fixes: how different have NFL telecasts looked since the US supreme court struck down prohibitions on gaming in 2018? The sports books that once styled themselves as portals for “daily fantasy football” to sneak their adverts into games have long since abandoned the ruse. The 2022 Super Bowl was more a pretext forgambling ads.The 2024 Super Bowl – the first ever staged inLas Vegas, home of Brady’s Raiders – instigated more than $1bn in bets, with roughly one-tenth of that take passing through the sports books that surround Allegiant Stadium, which, in case it’s unclear, is rather conveniently situated just off the Las Vegas Strip.Rozelle didn’t just see gambling as an existential threat to his league. He was convinced it might take down all of sports, and society with it, if given the chance to run amok. When a 1963 league investigation found that two NFL players had bet on games and associated with known gamblers, Rozellewanted to ban them for lifebut ultimately suspended them for a year. But now headlines about NFLplayers getting busted for gamblingrecur in between trade news and injury updates – and record salaries have done little to dissuade them from risking potential suspension for a few thousand dollars of side-action.Worse, the financial vice problem would appear to extend well beyond the locker room. In July, CNBC reported that more than 100 players and club personnelwere fined and penalizedfor violating the ticket resale policies for Super Bowl 59. Last March, a Jacksonville Jaguars employee was sent to prison forembezzling $22m from the team. Between those infractions and the NFL somehow eliding responsibility for its outsizedrole in promoting cryptocurrency, pro football would seem to have entered the era of grift.What would Rozelle make of his precious NFL, America’s most watched and prosperous league, selling out to Big Betting? What would he make of his former intern, present-day commissioner Roger Goodell, letting this happen while sticking to the claim that his “No 1 job is protecting the integrity of the game”? Goodell, after all, signed on as an advisor on the physical fitness council of Donald Trump, a president who once called large swathes of NFL players “sons of bitches”. And Goodell solemnly swore, under oath, that gambling was the greatestthreat to the integrity of pro footballonly to lay downhis shield. In the ownership deal with NFL, ESPN gained operational control over the league’s media properties and its popular RedZone Channel – a gambler’s paradise that willnow include commercial breaksfor the first time in its 16-year history. New York governor Kathy Hochul was among scores of incredulous viewers whovented about the decision online.Seven hours ofcommercial-free footballis RedZone’s entire raison d’être!Time and again, Goodell gaslights NFL fans. He dismissed them as “ridiculous” for accusing the league of being biased toward the Kansas City Chiefs – and then quietly relegated three officials to the college ranks asa PR sacrifice. (“There are no favorites,” an anonymous league source told the officiating news siteFootball Zebras. “There’s no favoritism. There’s none of that; it’s all about performance.”) Fans like to joke about there being a master script for the NFL that preordains the on-field results – the three-peat Chiefs arc in whicha pop star love interestis introduced. The more the NFL comprises its core values, the more it risks fans thinking it is heading in the direction of professional wrestling, an intentional work of fiction.And if things keep trending in that direction, where would that leave Brady? He’s got enough trouble playing it straight in the booth without going wildly over the top, and his own history of benefiting from rules violations can make him an even more unreliable narrator for NFL games. Only time will tell if the Brady Exception actually makes him a better TV analyst. But this much, at least, is inarguable: the NFL is committed to projecting the appearance of integrity and objectivity, even as it stares dead at you through the screen and calmly washes its hands of the matter in real time.Explore more on these topicsNFLTom BradyUS sportsLas Vegas RaidersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There, on the Piazzetta Reale, fans had gathered in a vast throng since the early morning to greet Hamilton as he prepares for his debut with Ferrari at their home race.The Piazzetta Reale – Royal Square – was an entirely apt locale as in Monza this weekend Hamilton and teammate Charles Leclerc are as close as any F1 drivers come to being considered royalty. The vociferous vocal acclaim that greeted them had begun 15 minutes before they appeared and all but drowned out attempts at interviews, according to Corriere della Sera.Lewis Hamilton prepares for Monza homecoming surprised by ‘volatile’ Ferrari startRead more“They sign autographs. It takes them more than five minutes to walk the 30 metres that separate them from the entrance to the Royal Palace,” reports the paper. “Every inch they walk, somebody stops them. Then they climb on to the balcony overlooking the square for the first greeting to the tifosi of the weekend. The party begins.”Ferrari, in Italy, at their home race, is an entirely different ball game. Were passion and unwavering belief enough, the Scuderia would be unbeatable this weekend at Monza, the tifosi would simply will them home. Yet as these fans have learned in the painful years since the Scuderia last won the drivers’ title in 2007, it is not sufficient. Yet here they are once more in the beautiful tree-lined parkland of the Parco di Monza again, eyes alight with hope and anticipation.Last year, hugely against the odds, they were rewarded. Ferrari had been almost one second off the pole pace at the previous round in Zandvoort, yet Leclerc and the team pulled off the most remarkable coup with a one-stop strategy to grab a win in Monza.Similar is not expected this year, although Ferrari did manage to reward the faithful with Hamilton and Leclerc taking the top spots in first practice, perhaps flattering to deceive on low fuel, because all season Ferrari have been off the pace and Hamilton in particular is struggling as he adapts to a new team and car.It has been hard, at times volatile, as even he conceded this weekend in Monza, where he will take a five-place grid penalty from an infraction in Zandvoort but was at least honest about how both sides had perhaps been taken aback by the work their partnership required.“Living the dream, moving to race with Ferrari I had the whole of last year to think about it and try to prepare but there are still things you couldn’t foresee,” he said. “There’s been a lot of adjustment both from my side and the team. They’ve really moved heaven and earth to accommodate me. Obviously, there are cultural differences.“Fred [Vasseur, team principal] made a comment that perhaps they underestimated me joining the team and the year we’ve been faced with in terms of the problems with the car.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton on his way to finishing fifth in second practice.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesIt had been, Hamilton said, an “emotional rollercoaster” with no sign of letting up, which is also perhaps part and parcel of being Ferrari, the team with the most storied, colourful and mercurial history.Indeed, when Hamilton and Leclerc appeared in Milan they were bedecked in blue shirts as part of the tribute to Niki Lauda claiming the championship for Ferrari at Monza in 1975, ending an 11-year drought for the team. Their cars, similarly, will run in the 1975-themed livery of Lauda’s 312T.It will be the same seventies shade of red and with the distinctive, white engine cover of Lauda’s and a silver rear wing mimicking the unadorned aluminium of 1975, before carbon fibre became de rigueur.Lauda worked with Hamilton extensively at his previous team Mercedes where the pair became close friends before the Austrian’s death in 2019, lending this weekend even more significance for the British driver.“I got to celebrate Niki at Mercedes, I got to celebrate winning with him, winning championships with him, and then to be able to come to Ferrari and then also be able to celebrate him here is really, really cool because his legacy continues to live on,” he said.“I know right now what he would be saying to me nowadays and it’s always in the back of my mind. When I didn’t do well he would always say ‘give them hell’, but [instead of hell] he would always say the word ‘arseholes’.”“At the beginning, I never understood. ‘What do you mean? You mean, give them hell?’. He was like, ‘no, give them arseholes’. He was just such a fighter.Lauda’s title that season, his first, was indeed a triumph. But the greatest demonstration of his fighting spirit came a year later when, just 40 days after the accident which had so nearly killed him at the Nurburgring, the Austrian defied every expectation by climbing back into the Ferrari at Monza. Few had believed he would ever even drive again, yet while in enormous pain, with the bandages that covered his extensive burns blood-soaked, Lauda demonstrated a bravery and determination that is unmatched. His fourth place in the race a triumph against all the odds.It was one of the reasons he was so respected and proved inspiring to so many drivers, including Hamilton, who has enjoyed such an enthusiastic reception from the tifosi this weekend. But much as they want a win, they also adore a fighter, a driver willing to give his all in therosso corsaand here Hamilton too surely fits the bill. A newIl Leonein the making perhaps, convinced that every setback is moving him onward and upward.“Honestly, the harder it is the better it can make you,” he observed going into the weekend. “This year has been tough for everyone in the team, but it prepares us for better days. We’ll be stronger having gone through this tough first six months.”In second practice Ferrari maintained a decent show, with Leclerc second to McLaren’s Lando Norris, who is looking to come back after the disappointment of retiring in Zandvoort that has left him 34 points adrift of teammate and championship leader, Oscar Piastri. The Australian was fourth in second practice behind the Williams of Carlos Sainz, with Hamilton fifth in front of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneLewis HamiltonMotor sportFerrarifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Almeida, of UAE Team Emirates-XRG, did all the work on the climb and stayed ahead of Visma-Lease a Bike’s Vingegaard in the sprint to the line.Israel-Premier Tech say pulling out of Vuelta would ‘set a dangerous precedent’Read more“This is a special one, I still don’t believe it,” Almeida said. “I just put my pace from the bottom and did my bit the best I could. Jonas was always on my wheel, we were both on the limit and I was waiting for his attack anytime.”Vingegaard said: “I would have loved to have won but I know that João deserved to win. It’s the L’Angliru. It’s a very special summit.”Thanks to the bonus seconds for the stage win, Almeida closed the gap to the red jersey to 46 seconds, with Britain’s Tom Pidcock (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) losing time but holding on to third overall, two minutes and 18 seconds off the leader.Australian Jai Hindley (Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe) finished third on the 202.7km ride from Cabezón de la Sal to Alto de L’Angliru, 28 seconds behind the leading pair, just ahead of Vingegaard’s teammate Sepp Kuss. Hindley is chasing down Pidcock for third place in the overall standings.Kuss, the Vuelta winner in 2023, almost lost his red jersey on Angliru that year when teammates Vingegaard and Primoz Roglic left him behind, with Roglic edging out the Dane at the finish.Vingegaard suffered a similar fate this time, despite looking as if he was just biding his time, tucked in behind Almeida as they suffered on the final twists and turns of the infamous climb, but his attack never came.“I thought he was going to pass me on the finish line,” Almeida said. “I took the last corner and then it’s hard to pass. I think this is the hardest climb in the world, its crazy, I’m really sore.”Almeida’s pain gained him his first individual Vuelta stage win along with four seconds in the GC, and topping Angliru ahead of the race favourite may give him the confidence he needs to go for the title.“I still have a lot of time to make up,” Almeida said. “He’s looking phenomenal so it’s going to be a hard task but we never give up.”Pidcock also never gave up, despite getting dropped by the leaders, and came in seventh, but the race looks set to be a fight between Vingegaard and Almeida.Bob Jungels of Luxembourg (Ineos Grenadiers) put in a brave battle, part of a large breakaway group early in the stage, and the last man to be caught. At the foot of Angliru, with Nicolas Vinokurov still alongside him, pro-Palestinian protesters delayed the pair’s progress before police cleared the small group from the road.Saturday’s stage 14 is a shorter 135.9km ride from Avilés with another summit finish at Alto de La Farrapona.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected after just six seconds after spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.NFL 2025 season predictions: will it be Mahomes, Jackson or Allen in the Super Bowl?Read moreCarter, one of the Eagles’ best players, approached Prescott as the teams lined up after the kick-off. The pair exchanged words, and Carter then spat on his opponent. Prescott looked shocked as a gob of phlegm landed on his chest and Carter was immediately sent from the field. He shook his head and smiled as he walked to the tunnel but did not argue with the decision as Eagles fans booed.“It was a mistake that happened on my side. It won’t happen again,” Carter, said after the game. “I feel bad for just my teammates and fans out there. I’m doing it for them. I’m doing it for my family, also. But the fans, they showed the most love.”Replays that emerged later showed Prescott had spat in the general direction of Carter, but at the ground, before the confrontation. After the game, Prescott said he wasn’t trying to spit at Carter.“I wouldn’t spit on somebody,” Prescott said. “I stepped through [and] I actually said words like, ‘The hell … what would I need to spit on you for?’ And he just spit on me in that moment. It was more of a surprise than anything.”Referee Shawn Smith said officials had no choice but to eject Carter. “One of the officials observed him spitting on an opponent,” Smith said. “It’s a disqualifiable foul in the game. It’s a non-football act.”Here is Jalen Carter spitting on Dak Prescott:pic.twitter.com/4F5BjEDLHf— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter)September 5, 2025The effect on the Eagles was immediate: the Cowboys drove down the field and scored on their first possession to go 7-0 up. When Javonte Williams ran in the touchdown, the Eagles line was notably missing the disruptive Carter.Indeed, the first eight possessions of the game resulted in points – but after a 65-minute lightning delay interrupted the third quarter, neither team could score again.Jalen Hurts accounted for 214 yards (152 passing, 62 rushing) and Saquon Barkley rushed for 60 yards and a touchdown for the Eagles, who overcame self- inflicted mistakes along with a revamped Dallas defensive front that no longer stars Micah Parsons.Carter’s ejection was the first of many undisciplined moments for the Eagles, who committed nine penalties for 110 yards.“I think our discipline wasn’t in it early in the game,” Hurts said. “Great job by our defense being able to battle and respond. Guys stepped in and filled those roles. We came into this game talking about discipline and focus, and we’ll leave it saying the same things.”Javonte Williams ran for 54 yards and a pair of one-yard touchdowns in his first game for the Cowboys, while Prescott was 21-for-34 passing for 188 yards. CeeDee Lamb led all receivers with seven catches and 110 yards.Jake Elliott nailed a 58-yard field goal to make it 24-20 Eagles 6:30 into the second half. The Cowboys drove into the red zone and got a free set of downs when Reed Blankenship committed unnecessary roughness in the end zone on a third-down incompletion. However, Miles Sanders fumbled on the next play, Quinyon Mitchell recovered for the Eagles and the lightning delay immediately followed.Both offenses seemed to be out of juice by the game’s 11.30pm resumption.

It’s that he agreed to receive them at all.That sort of thing is, after all, extremely un-Michael Bradley.Still, before Saturday’s friendly between the US and South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium, New Jersey’s native son will have no choice. He’ll have to stand there, in the spotlight, the center of attention, and wave to the crowds for a little while. The now-38-year-old head coach of New York Red Bulls II will be honored for a career in which he amassed the third-most US caps of all time and the second-most assists, starting every game at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.From 2006 through 2019, Bradley had one of the most accomplished spells in men’s national team history. And, somehow, also one of its most controversial. In none of his 151 USMNT appearances – captaining the Yanks in 48 of those matches – was there total consensus that he ought to be there, even as the do-it-all central midfielder methodically climbed to one of the historic powers of Serie A withRoma. But as a boring debate over the merits of his game dragged on year after year, its effect was muted or altogether negated by the fact that Bradley himself didn’t seem to care even the tiniest bit. The only person in the American soccer community who didn’t seem to have a loud and public opinion about Michael Bradley was Michael Bradley.Farewell McKennie and Weah in chaos: Predictions for USMNT players abroad this seasonRead moreWe sat down fora one-on-one interview once, a long time ago. Bradley emerged from the elevator and passed over the many fine and frilly couches scattered about the hotel lobby. He chose, instead, to sit on a little stool by a comparatively sad, plastic table in a corner. It may have been a kids’ corner, I can’t remember. Then, for 40 minutes, his pale green eyes beneath his heavy brow barely broke contact with mine as he thought deeply about everything he was asked and deeper still about how to answer carefully and diplomatically. The spell was only broken, briefly, when I wondered about a tattoo on the inside of his biceps and he recoiled and tugged down his sleeve to hide it. “No, that’s OK,” he said politely.Such was his searing intensity during the interview that Bradley didn’t notice until it was over and he rose to walk away how uncomfortable he’d been in the little stool, wincing in pain as he stretched his back.Bradley was not adequately appreciated in his time. Through little fault of his own, he became a kind of Rorschach test for however it was you already viewed the American men’s program. If you believed that American soccer was beset by favoritism and nepotism and that certain players’ ascent was preordained, Bradley seemed to confirm that. Although he was given his national team debut under Bruce Arena, he became a leading player under his father, Bob Bradley, about whom the fanbase nursed their own unreasonably strong misgivings.If, conversely, you thought a new age had dawned in which even a born-and-raised American could grind his way up the sport’s ranks – from the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, to Heerenveen, to Borussia Mönchengladbach, to Chievo, and finally to Roma before returning to North America withToronto FC– Bradley was proof positive of that as well.His case seemed to cut right to the id of a soccer community and its deep-seated hopes and insecurities.View image in fullscreenMichael Bradley became a fixture with the US while his father was head coach.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesHe also didn’t do much to boost his flagging popularity. When he spoke, Bradley was always incredibly guarded, although hetook a laudable stance in criticizing President Trump in 2017. He could be ornery, especially when he was younger. He really didn’t seem to have anything other than soccer and family going on in his life; or if he did, he didn’t care to share any of it. He’d been that way even as a kid. Sports Illustratedtold of a timewhen an 8-year-old Bradley refused his uncle’s offer to buy him fried chicken because, as young Michael put it, “That’s not what soccer players eat.”But if you cared to look carefully and honestly, you would discern perhaps the best midfielder the nation has ever produced. What was always remarkable about Bradley was that he didn’t have any standout physical or technical attributes, yet he willed himself into an excellent player all the same. He was solid-to-good across the board – Athletic, but not a monster. Technically sound, without being a maestro. What elevated him was an unshakable zeal for whatever tasks he’d been assigned on the field – and they varied wildly, as far as central midfielders go. He ran all day and read the game as if he’d been handed the manual. He could break up a counterattack or ping a diagonal ball to unlock a defense. He was relentlessly competent, never had a half-hearted game. His application to his craft was total.It’s just that midfielders who are on the ball a lot get a pass wrong sometimes, and that those tasked with covering a lot of ground lose their man on occasion. Then, inevitably, there would follow an outcry. For Bradley, there never seemed to be the same kind of tolerance for mistakes that others were granted.While he captained the side when it lost to Trinidad and Tobago on the fateful 2017 day when the USMNT missed their first World Cup in 32 years, the program’smodern nadir, Bradley set the standard every day that he was on the national team, protecting and prolonging its culture.“Getting to know him, watching him work and operate and the professionalism that he showed every single training session, every camp, listening to the way that he speaks about and approaches the game, preparing himself – all things that a lot of guys were able to take from him,” said current US captain Tim Ream. “I’m sitting here today because of some of the things and conversations that him and I have had. The leadership that he showed from all the time that we were together, was something that I always left camp in awe of, and now still try to use those examples today.”Michael Bradley made the players around him better, too. He just didn’t get credit for that either.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team is out in the spring of 2026. You canpreorder it here.

Her last appearance for her team,Indiana Fever, came on 15 July when she suffered a groin injury. She had earlier missed time with a quad injury, and also dealt with a bone bruise.“I want to thank everyone who had my back through all the uncertainty,” Clark wrote in her statement. “This has been incredibly frustrating, but even in the bad, there is good. The way the fans continued to show up for me, and for the Fever, brought me so much joy and important perspective. I am so proud of how this team has only gotten stronger through adversity this year. Now it’s time to close out the season and claim our spot in the Playoffs.”The Fever had hoped the 23-year-old would return for the end of the regular season as they battle for a place in the playoffs. They have three more games to play, against the Sky, Mystics and Lynx and have not yet sealed their place in the postseason.Clark had participated in light practice earlier this week but the Fever were more concerned about her long-term fitness.“Caitlin has worked so hard throughout this time, doing everything possible to recover and return to the court but, ultimately, time is not on our side,” Fever chief operating officer and general manager Amber Cox said in a statement. “While we will continue working with Caitlin and provide her with every resource we have available, there is not enough time left in our season for her to safely return, and her long-term health and well-being remains our top priority. We are looking forward to having her back at full strength to start the 2026 season.”Clark became one of the most famous athletes in America after her outstanding college career with Iowa. The Fever chose her with the No 1 overall pick in the 2024 draft, and she broke several records on her way to being named rookie of the year. This season she averaged 16.5 points, 8.8 assists and 5.0 rebounds a game, but never managed to remain fully fit.Explore more on these topicsCaitlin ClarkWNBABasketballIndiana FevernewsShareReuse this content"

Only just, but a win is a win, especially in a tricky opening-night fixture, as Sonia Bompastor’s side embark on a quest for the club’s seventh consecutive Women’s Super League title.It saw Andrée Jeglertz lose his first game in charge of Manchester City; Bompastor, by contrast, is still yet to lose a league fixture in English football and Chelsea remain unbeaten in the WSL since May 2024, a run of 26 league games.Beever-Jones takes her chance to prove she is more than an impact player for Chelsea | Suzanne WrackRead moreOn Friday night they displayed many of the characteristics that have helped them dominate the division in modern times, particularly their ruthlessness in the final third by comparison to their rivals.Khadija Shaw lashed a rising drive narrowly over the crossbar with 11 minutes to go, but that was as close as it got to an equaliser for the team who finished fourth in the division last term. They had more bad news when Alex Greenwood and Lily Murphy sustained injuries in stoppage time.Just under six weeks since the Euro 2025 final in Basel concluded a tournament which delivered packed stadiums and raucous crowds, it might have been a bit of a comedown for the players to walk out at Stamford Bridge and see the top tier of the stands essentially empty. Nonetheless, the Chelsea fans who did show up were enjoying what they saw, especially from one of their most important summer signings, Ellie Carpenter.Her pacy bursts up the wing caused problems for Manchester City and she created the opening goal with an inch-perfect, low cross into the path of Aggie Beever-Jones.Bompastor, who previously managed Carpenter at their old club Lyon, praised the Australia right-back’s strong debut, saying: “[It was] a great performance from Ellie. I know Ellie by heart and I’m not really surprised debut.View image in fullscreenAggie Beever-Jones tucks the ball home from Ellie Carpenter’s cross to put Chelsea ahead.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty Images“She’s a great player. As you could see tonight, she just brought an immediate impact and I think she has this quality. We are really proud to have her in our squad.”Another of the hosts’ new transfers, Alyssa Thompson, was introduced to the home fans on the pitch before kick-off to add to the mood of anticipation.This fixture came too soon for her debut after her deadline-day move from Angel City for a club record £1.1m but Chelsea hope her arrival can help them in their quest to achieve the aim clearly specified in Bompastor’s matchday programme notes: to win all four major trophies this term and go one better that last term’s domestic treble. As for City, just one piece of silverware would be an uplift on their past three trophyless campaigns.The away side had been fortunate not to concede an early penalty when the ball struck Gracie Prior’s arm inside the box and was diverted goalwards – the City goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita showed great reactions to stop the deflected effort from Sandy Baltimore.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first was a dive to her left to keep out a fierce strike in the game’s first attack, and the second – when Chelsea were already 1-0 up – was a strong low save from close range.View image in fullscreenManchester City had some hope when Chelsea’s Niamh Charles scored an own goal to make it 2-1.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersThe visitors, who deployed Lauren Hemp on the right wing instead of the left and enjoyed success when she cut inside on to her stronger left foot, were creating opportunities and went close again when Greenwood’s curling free-kick rattled the crossbar with 10 minutes remaining of the first half. Jeglertz’s first half-time team talk in charge of Manchester City seemed to inspire them as they began the second half dominating the territory and preventing Chelsea from holding on to the ball, but Yui Hasegawa flicked a great chance narrowly wide from a Hemp cross.They would be made to pay for failing to capitalise on their spell of pressure, because Chelsea’s Maika Hamano was afforded the freedom of the penalty area at the other end to double the defending champions’ lead. It was all too simple. Wieke Kaptein had time to pick out her pass to Hamano, as the Manchester City defending left much to be desired. They will not win the league if teams can score against them so easily.Niamh Charles’s own goal – a header into her own net from a whipped Greenwood free-kick – gave Manchester City hope, but they could not find an equaliser. Jeglertz conceded: “I think we nailed our high press in the second half [but] in the first half, their formation was not what we expected so it took a little bit of time for us to nail that properly.“Of course, everything is about scoring goals. We created enough chances, I think, to at least get one point, but that’s how it is.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueChelsea WomenManchester City WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Denmark could justify leaving the 33-year-old out of their squad for the meetings withScotlandand Greece on the basis he remains unemployed. Yet as the hosts huffed, puffed and failed to unpick a magnificently drilled Scotland defence, the issue of what Eriksen could have contributed was such an obvious one. Denmark in this form will not play at next summer’s World Cup.Steve Clarke’s Scotland were worthy of their point. But for a lack of composure in front of goal, they would have departed Copenhagen with all three. The winners from this opening night of a truncated section were the Greeks, who swept Belarus aside 5-1, but Scotland richly deserved their full-time ovation from an appreciative support.Denmarkwere booed off.Denmark v Scotland, Isak in action for Sweden and more: 2026 World Cup qualifiers - clockwatchRead more“A good, disciplined performance,” said Clarke. “We knew we would have to defend well and certainly did that. We have five more tough games, we are under no illusions about that. You don’t go to the World Cup easily.”Clarke sprang a surprise with the deployment of two strikers, Che Adams and Lyndon Dykes, from the outset. “If I am not brave, I might as well not be in the job,” said the manager. Equally striking was the sight of John McGinn, who has typically operated on the left or centre of midfield for his country, on the right. Rasmus Højlund, fresh from his loan move from Manchester United to Napoli, was among Denmark’s replacements.Scotland had been sloppy in possession before McGinn missed a wonderful chance to give his team the lead. Lewis Ferguson’s deep corner evaded everyone, with the Aston Villa midfielder left alone at the back post. McGinn seemed surprised by his opportunity and scuffed his shot wide. The opening increased Scottish belief, with Adams only just failing to connect with a teasing Ryan Christie cross. Christie was the next to try his luck, curling a shot high and wide from 19 yards after Ferguson had pinched the ball in midfield.View image in fullscreenThe Scotland goalkeeper, Angus Gunn, collects the ball under pressure.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PADenmark had enjoyed plenty of first-half possession without particularly troubling Angus Gunn in the Scotland goal. Gunn reacted smartly to smother the ball before Kasper Dolberg could latch on to an Anders Dreyer through-pass, 10 minutes before the break. Generally, though, the Danes were laboured. Christie should have punished that, the Bournemouth man instead heading McGinn’s cross wide after 38 minutes. Clarke would have been by far the more content coach at the interval, if slightly concerned by Scottish profligacy. This was not a half that will linger long in anybody’s memory.Joakim Mæhle deflected a McGinn drive wide as the visitors began the second period on the front foot. Scott McTominay bobbed and weaved his way through, only to be denied by the feet of Kasper Schmeichel. Clarke would have been well within his rights during the interval to tell his players to be more confident against an underwhelming Denmark team. The early signs were that was precisely what Scotland’s manager did.It felt inevitable that Denmark had to offer more. The 53rd minute saw their finest move thus far, culminating in a low attempt from Pierre-Emile Højbjerg that flew only narrowly wide via Grant Hanley’s deflection. Hanley, routinely the subject of heavy criticism when in Scotland colours, was excellent all evening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aaron Hickey found McGinn, who sent Adams clear on the right flank. Adams played the ball across to his strike partner, who looked certain to blast a first-time shot at Schmeichel. Dykes inexplicably delayed, allowing Rasmus Kristensen to recover. Kristensen could not believe his luck. Dreyer almost dished out immediate retribution courtesy of a long-range shot which rippled Gunn’s side netting.Scotland survived a scare, just after Max Johnston replaced Hickey at right-back. Mika Biereth raced to meet a long ball from Schmeichel, which Johnston blocked after raising his arm. Danish fans appealed vociferously for a red, given Biereth would have been through on goal but for Johnston’s intervention. After a monitor check, the referee refused to alter his original call of a booking for the Scotland player. The ball appeared to strike Johnston above the T-shirt line, with Biereth also nudging his opponent.Denmark called on Højlund without it making any material difference. Højberg had the night’s final chance, but headed straight at Gunn. “We had the ball a lot but didn’t do enough with it,” said the Denmark coach Brian Riemer. His assessment was perfectly fair.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersDenmarkScotlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Ibrahima Konaté cleared off the line from Ivan Kalyuzhnyi before Illia Zabarnyi struck a post.But once Mbappe sprinted clear to deliver the killer blow with a low drive, Deschamps’s side were able to see out the closing minutes with comfort. Liverpool’s new signing Hugo Ekitiké earned his first cap as a late substitute.“We mastered the first half and could have scored one more, then we struggled briefly but we have so much attacking quality. We had much to lose, so it’s good to start this campaign with a win,” said the head coach, Didier Deschamps.Mbappé echoed his manager’s comments. “We could have scored more, I, myself, missed a few, so there is room for improvement. But it’s a good, solid start,” he said.The result gives the 2018 world champions an early edge in Group D against the toughest opposition.

However, the Slovenians levelled in the first minute of the second half as Olsen somehow spilled a tame drive from Sandi Lovric into the net.Ayari looked to have redeemed his keeper when he bundled the ball into the net in the 73rd minute.

The head coach regards it as essential that his team play with the passion of the Premier League; as a band of brothers, high-fiving, encouraging, selfless.It is about energy and intensity; after a ball loss, for example. Tracking back. They must enjoy the freedom to express themselves. Harry Kane can drop off a bit from the No 9 position but not too much. There needs to be speed around him, space and incisive patterns throughout.Thomas Tuchel says John Stones must stay fit to keep alive World Cup hopesRead more“It is our job to make it quickly understandable, to make it easier to transform it on to the pitch,” Tuchel saidwhen he named his first squadin March for the opening World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia at Wembley.It is probably fair to say that a few things got lost along the way last season, especially in the second camp in June, which featured the stodgy and unenjoyable1-0 win against Andorrain Barcelona and the3-1 loss to Senegalat the City Ground. Albania and Latvia had been seen off with relative comfort although the performances did not set pulses racing.It has hardly been a false start under Tuchel. Three wins out of three in qualification, with no goals conceded, is not to be sniffed at, while Senegal was a friendly. June is always an awkward window. But something does need to change as Tuchel embarks on what he has suggested is the real business, the beginning of a World Cup season.He knows it, just as he claims to have detected a different atmosphere among the players this week as they prepare for Saturday’s return tie against Andorra at Villa Park. The big one against Serbia in Belgrade comes on Tuesday. Tuchel believes he has the answers. He wants to show he is a fast learner in a new environment and for him it comes down to streamlining, greater precision and clarity.Tuchel used 28 players in his first four games and had a clutch of others as unused substitutes; he even had to omit players from matchday squads. Which he hated. It did not create “the right energy”. He had to cast his net at the outset but it was too crowded. And so this time he trimmed the selection long-list and called up only 24 players. He feels the competition has become spicier.In the warm weather training week in Barcelona before the Andorra game, which began with a team bonding trip to the Spanish Grand Prix on the Sunday, Tuchel put his players through their paces on the Monday. There was intensity then but the week came to feel long before the game on Saturday. This time, Tuchel asked the players to report on Tuesday.The most interesting change has been in Tuchel’s approach to training: the tactical side. Few coaches are as obsessed with the finer details but he appears to have concluded that less could be more in international football.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel admits he underestimated the difficulty of trying to project unfamilar ideas to players during international training camps.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty Images“You don’t have the players on a daily basis where you can really tweak into the details,” Tuchel said. “We want to be more clear, more easy, because we have so many players from different clubs so they’re used to a different style. If we implement a lot of new things in only four days of training, it’s just not enough time.“So we need to find an idea where everyone can buy in quickly and everyone drops their club heads. It’s more about principles and building it from a structure that everyone can understand. This is where I have to adapt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We played different structures in the buildup and put players in new positions. Maybe I underestimated the effect that it has. It was a learning. Maybe we translated it a little too much from club football and we need to take a step back to speed up our game with a bit more freedom and less changes within the structure. Maybe the solution comes from running more, from more energy, than the structure.”Tuchel has pretty much picked two players per position and he has been gloriously specific about where he sees each one playing, who they are up against. For example, Tino Livramento has been picked at right-back, in competition with Reece James; Djed Spence as a left-back against Myles Lewis-Skelly. At left centre-back, it is Dan Burn and Marc Guéhi. The No 8s are Declan Rice and Elliot Anderson. There is flexibility and Tuchel said John Stones might have played in the No 6 role had he not beenforced to withdraw with a muscle injury. But not too much flexibility.It is the same story with the formation. Tuchel said a back five could be an option but not for this camp or those that follow in October and November. He is thinking about 4-2-3-1.“This is where the focus is at the moment,” he said. “We have these three camps now and it’s not very likely that we will change [to three centre-backs] in these camps. But then we have March and it’s not so hard to learn to play in a back five. We told the players where they compete. We told them the formation that we’re going to play in these two matches. Once you have clarity, intensity will rise and follow.”Tuchel is braced to run into low-block defences against Andorra and Serbia; they have long been a spectacle killing curse forEnglandin qualifying ties. “It’s like chewing gum,” Tuchel said of the monotony of trying to find a way through.It will be about attitude. “Does the group love to play for England or do they just like to play for England?” Tuchel said. More than that, it will be about showing signs of an identity. It is time for solutions.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve been in football long enough to understand that for a player the career is short and they have things they want to achieve. I’m happy it’s over. Alex is a mate and it’s a tough situation as you want him around to help the team. But [I] also understand for him what he needs to do personally. I’ve got nothing but good wishes for Alex.“There’s no animosity. As a Newcastle fan myself, you know what Newcastle fans are like; we’re protective of our club and city and you want players who want to be there for Newcastle and don’t want to naively think there is anywhere else to go apart from playing for Newcastle. I understand why our fans were frustrated. I’ve been in the game long enough to know what goes on and wish him all the best, apart from when we play Liverpool.”Burn revealed that Isak received positive messages from his former teammates when he contacted the squad’s group chat to let them know he was joining Liverpool. “He put a message in the chat just saying that he was leaving, and thanks for the memories, all that sort of stuff, and the lads replied,” he said. “I think Alex is getting what he wants, and now we’ve just got to focus and do what we can with the players that we’ve got.”Burn, who hopes to start whenEnglandhost Andorra at Villa Park in World Cup qualifying on Saturday, found positives in how Newcastle’s players have reacted. “It brought us closer really,” he said. “I think it can be frustrating at times. Everything was so positive last season, so that took a little bit of a shine off.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak signed for Liverpool for £125m to end a protracted and controversial transfer saga.Photograph: Nikki Dyer/LFC/Liverpool FC/Getty Images“But I’m not silly, I’ve been around football a long time now, and people have short careers, and they want to max out absolutely everything they can, so there’s no hard feelings from me. I think we’ve got two good players in that position now, which will hopefully fill up the goals that we’ve lost.”Newcastle replaced Isak by signing Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa. It has been a difficult summer but Burn is impressed with the players brought in by Eddie Howe and believes that the squad is better equipped to deal with the challenge of playing in the Champions League this season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

London City Lionesses are flexing their muscles in the transfer market thanks to the spending power available to them through their owner,Michele Kang. The American businesswoman also owns the French champions, OL Lyonnes, and the National Women’s Soccer League side Washington Spirit.London City have made a flurry of big-name signings during this first window since their promotion from the second tier, adding the Netherlands midfielder Daniëlle van de Donk, the England forward Nikita Parris and, on Thursday, the Spain youth international winger Lucía Corrales, for a fee understood to be €500,000.London City are trying to disrupt the established order in the women’s game. Based in Bromley and Kent, they are the first fully independent club to reach the WSL. PSG thanked Geyoro and said she had “left an indelible mark on the history” of the club.The fee for Geyoro was described as “crazy” by the Manchester United manager, Marc Skinner. “If we’re being really honest, the window has gone crazy, right?” Skinner said. “I’m just hearing about the Grace Geyoro move, like, that is crazy. The window and the market has just shifted so much.”Skinner went on to name the transfers of Geyoro, Ovalle, Smith andChelsea’s Alyssa Thompson. “Who would have thought that in this window, we’d have four £1m players? I just think we [Manchester United] won’t be able to, right now, go to those levels of transfer fee. I’ll be honest with that. We’re not in that realm.“There’ll be pressure on London City now to deliver and then you’ve got to deliver under pressure, because you spent big. We’ll see how they do with that.”View image in fullscreenManchester United’s manager Marc Skinner said the club were not able to match the top fees paid by other clubs.Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty ImagesA spokesperson for London City said the transfer fee being reported was inaccurate and the club are understood to deny they have paid a world-record sum.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They need sustainability and they need consistency, and that’s how I lead. Would I like to spend £5m? Of course I would, but it’s just not realistic.“The reality is, if there was financial fair play in this league – which I don’t want, by the way, because right now we need to grow – but the reality is, there’s no way London City will make that transfer fee back for many, many, many, many years. That’s what I’m saying.“I understand our fans’ frustration at times because, as I say, it’s moving quicker than anyone could have imagined. As Manchester United, we need to review it and we need to look at what is the right amount of investment to make sure our team stays competitive and wins things.”Alessia Russo has signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal on the eve of their WSL opener against London City at the Emirates Stadium. The forward, a European champion for club and country, has scored 36 goals in 72 games for Arsenal since joining from Manchester United in 2023.Last season Russo shared the WSL’s Golden Boot with Manchester City’s Khadija Shaw, with 12 goals, and was named the Football Writers’ Association’s women’s footballer of the year and shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or.Elsewhere, theWSL 2 side Birmingham Cityhave signed the former Chelsea star Ji So-yun, a six-time WSL winner.

It is transfer deadline day and the midfielder Lia Wälti has announced her emotional departure.“I’m refusing to watch Wally’s video; I’m going to wait until I get home,” says Mead. “I saw her when she sat down at the start of it and I thought: ‘I’m not doing this.’ On the day she told us she was leaving, I thought about what it would be like if I had to do that right now and it didn’t sit right. The thought of leaving is really, really tough, and at some point in your career it’s got to happen, but I’ve had good conversations with Renée [Slegers, the head coach]. I know where I stand, what she wants from me and what I can give the team. I know I can also give a lot to the team off the pitch and I take that role and responsibility quite seriously.”View image in fullscreenBeth Mead has been at Arsenal since 2017.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesIt is just under two years since Mead returned after an anterior cruciate ligament injury that ended her 2023 World Cup hopes. The road since has not been easy but the forward appeared to find her pre-injury form for last season’s run-in with Arsenal and the Euro 2025 campaign with England.“There were moments where I think that my football brain and my footballing ability helped us in big moments in games,” she says. “I had a nice conversation with Sarina [Wiegman] after things had settled down following the Euros. Obviously, it was an amazing Euros,we went and won it, but it was very different to the 2022 Euros where I started every game, was player of the tournament, this, that and the other.“She said she’d argue I’d had as much of an effect this time; that, for her, as a manager, what she’d seen me do on the pitch, the role I’d played in crucial moments in certain games when I came on, was really important. I played different positions, I was playing midfield for quite a lot of the tournament, and she was like: ‘I think some people will miss that because you didn’t directly get the goal or the assist or whatever.’ That gave me a really nice warm feeling because, as a footballer, and my teammates appreciate this too, sometimes externally these things are missed.”View image in fullscreenMead says winning Euro 2025 was ‘very different’ to Euro 2022 because of her role in the England side.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty ImagesAs Mead talks, a mature understanding of the importance of a squad is evident. “Me and Renée, and also the team, have a good understanding that it’s a competitive environment. I’m allowed to be pretty narked off that I’m not playing but also I’m going to come on and make that difference if that’s my job for the weekend. That’s elite-level football and you ultimately know that’s what you’ve sometimes got to do.”The significance of the non‑starters in preparation for matchdays was shown before the1-0 defeat of Barcelonain the Champions League final in May, when roleplaying unlocked an important piece of Arsenal’s strategy. In training the day before the final in Lisbon, the non‑starters were tasked with playing the role of Barcelona.“I was [Clàudia] Pina for Barcelona and, to put it politely, I was taking the piss out of our team,” says Mead, with a grin. “I was finding every bit of space, I was finding pockets, I was putting balls out, I was going forward.“It wasn’t just me – we were causing issues – but we had to do our jobs and I had to do my job as her that day to get the best out of the starting team. What we did in that training session changed our mindset going into the game.“How successful I had been on that side of the pitch as Pina arguably helped us win that game and is why I felt so comfortable going into the Barcelona final. We knew we’d ticked off everything, knew we’d exploited Arsenal’s weaknesses the day before and gone: ‘Do you know what? Barcelona are going to have a field day there if we don’t sort that out.’ We sorted it out, we all committed to our roles, and the rest is history.”View image in fullscreenMead came off the bench, assisting the winner as Arsenal beat Barcelona in May’s Champions League final.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesHumility was key too. “You’ve got to throw your ego aside as well,” says Mead. “We are a team that wants to possess the ball, but you’re playing Barcelona, who are very, very good at it. Same for England v Spain in the final of the Euros: you’ve got to throw your ego out the window, be willing to work hard, defend, show that bit of grit and determination, and I thought every single person, whether they started, whether they came on, whether they were on the bench giving the energy, committed to that in those finals. I think that’s now our bar – it has to be.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’d seen in the game – this is a takeaway from being able to sit and watch games sometimes – how many blocked shots there had been. I know I’ve hit the shots from there before on my left foot but I thought: ‘There’s a lot of bodies in front of me.’ I don’t know why and how I saw Stina in that space, but I thought: ‘If I shoot here and it gets blocked, it’s just another step for the game … I’m going to find Stina.’ It was a split second between choosing to shoot or take the pass. I’m happy I took the pass.”The psychological impact of winning the competition “has to have a big impact”, with Chelsea’s dominance weighing heavy domestically in recent years. “We can, arguably, play better football than Chelsea and we did a lot of times last season,” says Mead. “When we played against them, the first game, we went 2-0 down really early and absolutely dominated them the rest of the game but couldn’t get back into it. Chelsea are good at what they’re good at. They’re lethal, they have their chances and they score their chances.“They showed it last year, they went unbeaten, but how many games did they get 1-0 results right in the dying death? That’s a champion team. We’ve now got to adopt that. We play the Arsenal way, but also when it’s not going perfectly we have to find another way we can win games. Barcelona was the perfect example for us.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianMead made a similar impact at the Euros in Switzerland, providing the assist for Michelle Agyemang’s equaliser at the deathagainst Sweden in the quarter-finalsto force extra time and begin the battling charge through the knockout stage.The 2025 Euros was less fairytale than 2022, more a gritty war epic, but Mead and her teammate Ella Toone were fighting far bigger emotions than the matches threw at them, the former facing her first tournament without her mother, June, and the latter her first without her father, Nick.“It’s coming up three years in January, which is crazy when you think about how much has happened in that time,” says Mead. “At the end of every game we said: ‘They’re watching over us and they’ve done it again. I don’t know how many times they’ll end up helping us out but they will.’ When the whistle went at the final I went to the stands and it’s my brother and my dad. It’s just such an amazing moment, an emotional moment, but the last time my mum was the first there on the front row, and that’s tough to think about.”Next to her dad and next to Toone’s mum were empty seats. “We don’t know if it was done on purpose or it just was a complete coincidence, but it was a nice moment for both of us to be able to think that they were there, that they were sat watching.”Every detail in England’s luxurious Dolder Grand hotel was thought of. “We are very spoiled and we understand that,” Mead says. “We all had suites, they had our names on the door, they had a picture and Sarina had left us a handwritten letter each. They all matter.”It matters to Arsenal, too, that after scratching their big trophy itch their targets for this season do not shift. “Try and win all four,” Mead says of the available trophies. “We’re the only team to have done it, and let’s try and keep it that way.”Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's footballEngland women's football teamWomen's Super LeagueinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Rarely in complimentary terms. “I don’t care about [Dr Tottenham], he don’t care about me, all I care about is [Dejan] Kulusevski,” was one such song.After Thursday’s yellow-ticker trembler, all those fans need worry about is when Kulusevki’s knee-knack allows him to return to Spurs’ teams. Did Levy jump or was he pushed? The suggestion from Big Website is the latter, the executive-chairman, Levy’s job title, shunted for a fresh suit structure. Instead of Levy as an all-seeing eye with hands pulling tight the strings on the purse, two suits will divide duties. Peter Charrington as nonexecutive chair arrives, Vinai Venkatesham, named as chief exec in April, will grow further in influence. The Lewis family who majority-own Tottenham are, it is understood by proper journalists, looking for outside investment.The Lewis Family Trust owns 70.12% of Enic, the company that holds 86.91% of the shares in Spurs. Levy and members of his family own the other 29.88% of Enic, a wrinkle that may need to be Botox-ed. In his farewell statement, Levy said: “I will continue to support this club passionately.” Though perhaps not among those Spurs fans who didn’t care for him for so many years. Thus, time to consider the Levy legacy. Widely, his tenure is divided into opposing views. On the credit side: Levy’s canny business development, including his personal management of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium project, opened in 2019, replacing the beloved but tired White Hart Lane, was a success. Spurs’s home is the envy of much of European football.Then there’s Levy’s farewell claim that he and his executive team “built this club into a global heavyweight competing at the highest level”. That Tottenham are in Bigger Cup this season, having won Bigger Vase last year is true, and Levy did somehow manage to get Spurs included in the nasty Super League breakaway in 2021 but two trophies this century, the other coming in 2008, diminishes any conceit of being a heavyweight, particularly when Tottenham usually competed on a welterweight budget.Some greatest hits: courting Rivaldo in 2002; sacking Jacques Santini after 13 games; sacking Martin Jol halfway through a Euro Vase game in 2007; sacking Harry Redknapp despite finishing fourth because Chelsea won Big Cup in 2012; appointing AVB; getting to Big Cup final in 2019 before not buying new players for Mauricio Pochettino then sacking him that November; sacking José Mourinho the week of the 2021 Milk Cup final; sacking Antonio Conte after he described Tottenham’s story as “20 years there is this owner and they never won something”; sacking Big Ange despite winning Bigger Vase, mate.High points: Wembley 2008, 4-4 at the Emirates, David Bentley soaking ‘arry’s suit, Gareth Bale, Harry Kane, Ajax Big Cup semi drama, Bilbao 2025. And that week in 2019 when all of known humanity was discussing the new stadium filling its pint glasses from the bottom. Farewell, Daniel.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEThe WSL is back!

Instead of cheering the National League South side on from behind the goal against AFC Totton, he has answered the Surrey club’s emergency call and will put his well-worn goalkeeping gloves back on after 28 years in retirement and take his place between the sticks.Dunn, whose former clubs include the now extinct North Holmwood and who was a multiple promotion winner with several local clubs before hanging up his gloves in 1997, is joining the playing squad on a temporary basis … till Monday when Dorking can get in a new keeper and solve their injury crisis.Upon signing for the Wanderers, Dunn said: “Playing in goal is like riding a bike – you never forget it. I still regularly play walking football. As a Wanderers fan, no one will be trying harder than me to keep a clean sheet on Saturday.”The club chair and first-team manager, Marc White, added: “In an era where passion comes in low quantities, what Terry lacks in mobility, he’ll make up for in heart – and for one game, we’re just going to have to get on with it.”Fans can expect a new loan goalkeeper to be announced next week, reportedly joining the club on a four-week deal.Explore more on these topicsFootballnewsShareReuse this content"

Stones has been a regular at recent tournaments but he is yet to play for Tuchel, who made it clear that the 31-year-old will only remain an important part of his plans ahead of next summer’s World Cup if he stays fit.“I’m a big fan of John, his personality and his quality,” England’s head coach told BBC Radio 5 Live. “He could be an important figure, of course, but he needs to be available. He wants to be available and he’s a top professional, so he is the most upset in all this because he does really everything to be fit and struggles then with these minor issues from time to time that cost him game time.“I hope he keeps his spirit up because he will stay important for us. I saw in these three days what he means to the group as a personality and as a social glue within the group. What he brings to the pitch is outstanding quality as a central defender and possibly as a pivotal No 6, but we have to adapt to it. He’s now not available anymore. We will find solutions for it.”Tuchel planned to give Stones, who has played in City’s first three league games this season, a prominent role during this camp. Along with starting him at the back against Andorra, England’s head coach revealed that he was considering using him in defensive midfield for the trip to Serbia on Tuesday.“I think he would have maybe started as a central defender in this match, but he was in contention for playing No 6 for us as well,” Tuchel told Talksport. “It was in our thoughts to maybe use him as a six against Serbia. But listen, this is how it is.”England’s other options at centre-back are Ezri Konsa, Dan Burn, Marc Guéhi and Jarell Quansah.Tuchel made it clear that he is not thinking about using Marseille’s Mason Greenwood, who has left the door open to a recall after rejecting a call-up from Jamaica. “I have not spoken to him until now,” he said. “I have not spoken to him or his camp. My understanding was that he tries to play for Jamaica so we didn’t give it another thought. He was not in the mix at the moment and he is not in our thoughts for our team. I don’t rule anything out but he is no priority at the moment.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Even if approval is granted at that point, setting up a 12-team global competition in three months appears unrealistic.Launching in 2027 would also be hugely problematic, as it would clash with the men’s Rugby World Cup in Australia, and almost inevitably lead to the withdrawal of dozens of leading international players.The R360 vision, which is being fronted by the England World Cup winner Mike Tindall, is for a 12-team global franchise competition following a grand prix-style international circuit, with eight match weekends each year in cities such as London, Barcelona, Tokyo, Dubai, Cape Town, Boston and Miami.It is believed that during informal discussions in recent weeks, R360 has been unable to answer all of World Rugby’s questions, ultimately leading to the application’s withdrawal.World Rugby is understood to have requested detailed responses from R360 on a number of topics, including proposed venues and staging agreements, the level of compensation to be paid to clubs, player release for training camps ahead of international tournaments, and the new competition’s plans for player development.The R360 women’s competition, which will initially consist of four franchises, has been flagged as a particular cause of concern, as the women’s international calendar is different and the initial proposal does not include a release window for the Six Nations and the World Cup. Given the talks have coincided with the biggest ever Women’s Rugby World Cup, which hasgenerated record numbersin terms of ticket sales and viewing figures, that oversight is regarded as extremely problematic by World Rugby.R360’s efforts to date have largely focused on recruitment, with around 160 players reported to have signed pre-contract agreements to join one of their eight franchises, putting them close to their initial target of signing 200 men’s players.The league’s executives, led by former Bath director of rugby Stuart Hooper and players’ agent Mark Spoors, are understood to have discussions with representatives from the Six Nations and southern hemisphere unions during this year’s British & Irish Lions tour in an attempt to win them over.The Rugby Football Union is unlikely to give its approval, as they are just about to enter the second season of the eight-year Professional Game Partnership with Premiership Rugby. That would be decimated by the new competition, which is promising annual salaries of up to £750,000 for just eight matches, a figure on par with the earnings of top England players.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He attempted to serve and volley, he threw in drop shots and vainly tried to take the first strike from his opponent. On more than one occasion, Djokovic’s miraculous defensive efforts drew 23,000 spectators to their feet.Yet this time, in this late stretch of his glorious career, he simply did not have the level to match one of the new standard bearers of the sport he has dominated for so long. Across the net,Carlos Alcarazcontinued his imperious form by maintaining his composure and holding his nerve to return to the US Open final with a 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory.US Open tennis 2025: Novak Djokovic v Carlos Alcaraz, men’s semi-final – liveRead moreThere was once a time when Alcaraz himself would frequently speak of the “rollercoasters” he would find himself on in matches, his tendency to pair his spectacular shotmaking with bewildering performances and to leave himself in unnecessarily protracted battles. By reaching a grand slam final without dropping a set for the first time, this victory further underlines how Alcaraz has evolved into such a reliable and dependable player this summer.He is in the form of his life, having now reached eight consecutive finals in addition to three consecutive major finals this year. At just 22, Alcaraz is the third youngest man in the open era to reach seven grand slam finals, behind only Björn Borg and Rafael Nadal. He now awaits Jannik Sinner or Félix Auger-Aliassime in the final.“It feels amazing, to be honest, it means a lot to me,” said Alcaraz. “It wasn’t the best level of the tournament for me but I kept a good level from the beginning until the last point. I served pretty well, which today I feel was really, really important.”For Djokovic, who had not competed since Wimbledon before this tournament, simply reaching a fourth grand slam semi-final in 2025 was an immense achievement. But with every physio appearance and physical struggle throughout this week, the strains of trying to compete at the highest level across the gruelling best-of-five-sets format at 38 years old has been as clear as ever.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic fought hard but did not have the physical power to make his way past the much younger Carlos Alcaraz.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APDespite being at such contrasting points in their careers, Djokovic and Alcaraz have spent the past few years battling as equals, with the Serb compiling a favourable head-to-head record and pulling off some of his most memorable wins against the Spaniard. This was their first meeting where the mileage in Djokovic’s legs was a clear impediment and despite how hard he fought and how deep he dug, the greatest player of all time just could not keep up.Coming into the semi-final, Alcaraz had been the player of the tournament so far, efficiently rolling through his matches with total focus and determination to waste no unnecessary energy.While Alcaraz was alert from the beginning, putting Djokovic under sustained pressure with the consistency and depth of his return of serve as he immediately broke, Djokovic was flat and erratic. Occasional moments of brilliance were counterbalanced by a consistent stream of sloppy mistakes. At 1-2 on Alcaraz’s serve, for example, Djokovic conjured up a stunning backhand down-the-line passing shot winner to drag the game back to deuce. He immediately followed that up with two missed second serve returns.Although he held and maintained his lead, Alcaraz looked tense and contained himself when they entered into baseline rallies. But he hit his spots brilliantly with his serve, which guided him comfortably through the rest of his service games in the opening set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionA potential turning point came at the beginning of the second set as Djokovic forced himself into the match with a slick opening return game. He broke Alcaraz’s serve with a supreme defensive point, throwing up a perfect lob before drawing a backhand error from the Spaniard. It would only delay the inevitable. With Alcaraz’s superior weight of shot and athleticism, the gulf between them was stark in the moments when Alcaraz found his top level.Still, Djokovic fought as hard as ever. Despite the continuous pressure he endured in his service games, he found a way to pull himself through tight holds, somehow dragging himself into the tie-break.On another occasion during the earlier part of his career, Alcaraz may have offered Djokovic a lifeline with an erratic performance in the tie-break, but not this time. After Alcaraz closed out the second set, Djokovic immediately requested the trainer, who massaged the Serb’s neck during the change of ends. The final set was merely a formality.Over the years, the New York crowd has often been one of the most hostile audiences for Djokovic, and so one of the interesting developments in this latter part of his career has been the greater appreciation he has received from all audiences this year.Throughout the match, as he desperately fought to stay in the opening set, chants of “Nole, Nole!” rang around Arthur Ashe Stadium. Every supreme defensive effort was saluted by the audience as if it was the last time they would see him. He departed making heart symbols with his hands to a long, heartfelt ovation from the packed arena.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Carlos AlcarazNovak DjokovicUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

As the American braced herself for her first round match, her high expectations became a source of significant stress. In hindsight, this was nothing out of the ordinary. “I think most players are putting a lot of pressure on themselves and those few days before the tournament are pretty stressful, just the anticipation of it,” she said after reaching round three. “I feel it was natural for me to feel that way.”However, the circumstances surrounding Anisimova on the eve of the US Open made her situation unique. The last time she appeared at a grand slam, Anisimova wasbeaten 6-0, 6-0 in the Wimbledon finalby Iga Swiatek. Wimbledon had represented a long-awaited breakthrough after years of unfulfilled promise and under most circumstances it would have only signified a positive step forward in her career, but by the end ofher excruciating dayon Centre Court it was hard not to wonder if such a humiliating moment might completely derail her progress.For that reason, Anisimova’s handling of those challenges has been nothing short of remarkable. At the next grand slam tournament, her earliest possible opportunity, the 24-year-old has given herself another shot at competing for a grand slam title again as she facesAryna Sabalenka, the world No 1 and defending champion, on home soil in the US Open final on Saturday.Anisimova’s talent has never been in doubt. She is one of the cleanest, most destructive ball strikers on the tour, blessed with peerless timing and technique that allows her to take the ball so early, change directions at will and generate immense pace off both ground strokes, particularly her extraordinary two-handed backhand.View image in fullscreenAmanda Anisimova was beaten 6-0, 6-0 in the Wimbledon final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThose skills were evident in her last few matches, which have been an exhibition in devastating offensive shotmaking. Inher win over Swiatek, she constantly robbed time from the Pole’s offensive weapons. Despite her early nerves a day lateragainst Naomi Osaka, it was remarkable how she turned the match around, dominating another of the biggest hitters in the game from the baseline. Even as they neared 1am after nearly three hours on the court, her hands remained steady during the decisive moments at the end and she never stopped attacking.It has taken some dramatic mental improvements for Anisimova to reach this point.Her eight-month mental health breakin 2023 has clearly played a significant role in her growth, but in general she has always struggled to maintain her composure, nerve and self-belief in the heat of battle. While some players are born competitors, Anisimova’s path to gaining the self-assurance required to compete with the best players in the world has been long and arduous. She has spoken about embracing therapy, maintaining a positive outlook at all costs and confiding in her loved ones. While she has stressed the importance of moving on from Wimbledon, she did not run away from it. Sometimes, humour helps. The night before her win over Swiatek, she decided to watch highlights of the Wimbledon defeat for the first time to ensure that she did not make the same mistakes twice. What did she learn? “That I was slow as hell,” she said, laughing.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka powered past Jessica Pegula in the semi-finals.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockAlthough Anisimova has already defeated two of the most accomplished players in the game, the path does not get any easier. At the start of a breathless women’s semi-final day,Sabalenka closed out Jessica Pegulain another high-quality match. The American played about as well as she possibly could at times but Sabalenka was courageous in all of the decisive moments, where she completely overpowered Pegula.In the process, the Belarusian has maintained her sublime grand slam record. A three-time major champion, she has now reached the last six hard-court grand slam finals and four of the last five major finals overall. In those finals, however, she has repeatedly crumbled under pressure, becoming overwhelmed by panic and fear. There will be even more pressure on her shoulders on Saturday, a match that represents her last chance to ensure that her considerable efforts actually amount to a grand slam win this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 22-year-old was set to lead Britain's line-up in Shenzhen in a couple of weeks' time but has instead decided to play in the Korea Open the same week, for which she has been offered a wild card.Raducanu's decision is a major blow to Britain's hopes of progress, with Anne Keothavong's team set to face Japan in the quarter-finals on 18 September.Raducanu has spoken of how much she enjoys playing in the team competition and she has an excellent record having won her last five singles matches, including three at last year's Finals, where Britain reached the semi-finals.However, she opted not to play in the group stage in April, choosing to do a training block instead, and this decision is likely to go down like a lead balloon.The PA news agency understands that Raducanu and her team believe she needs to prioritise playing WTA events and spending time on the road with new coach Francisco Roig after a positive start to their partnership.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There are some players who just seem to be magnetically attracted to each other in tournament draws. This will mark a 10th meeting between Sabalenka and Anisimova, and this has actually been a favourable match-up for the American, who holds a 6-3 head-to-head record. The last time they played each other, less than two months ago, Anisimova pulled offthe biggest win of her careerat the time in the semi-finals of Wimbledon.

The pop singer is 35; O’Connor, who works in public relations and lives in Long Island, New York, is just one year younger. “I’ve been a fan since day one, back in high school, and she’s been there through every phrase and journey of my life,” O’Connor said.So when Swift announced her engagement to NFL starTravis Kelcelast week, O’Connor reacted as many thirtysomething women do when they learn that a girlfriend secured a ring. First, she screamed so loudly her boyfriend thought someone had died. Then she wondered aloud to him: “When’s it going to happen for us?”“It would be fun to be engaged with her at the same time,” O’Connor said. “I’ve been showing my boyfriend photos of the ring and saying how unique it is. That’s not my style, but we talk about what I might like.”Whatever [Swift] chooses to wear is going to set a huge tone for the next couple of yearsElisabeth Kramer, wedding coordinatorO’Connor is not the only one. Swift’s Instagram announcement – a photo in which she and Kelce embrace in front of an elaborate floral arrangement – raked in more than 1m likes in less than 10 minutes; it’s now up to 36m. “We needed this,” read oneVogue editorial. New York Times columnist and chick lit author Jennifer Weineragreed: “Maybe love still wins.”On social media, fans spoke of the news with parasocial investment. One cringe-inducing poem widely shared in the wake of the newsread:The dayTaylor Swiftgot engaged,little girls screamed,grown women cried,and the awkward childwe all carry insidefinally feltchosen.A big day for little girls and grown women perhaps, but D-day for the people dating Swifties. “How do I tell my boyfriend he needs to propose ASAP so I can be engaged at the same time as Taylor Swift without sounding crazy,” one fantweeted. “When I’ve been with my boyfriend longer than Taylor swift has been with Travis kelce yet THEYRE ENGAGED? we literally have a child IM HEATED,” wroteanother.On TikTok, boyfriends of Swifties postedinformative videosabout her career and history to help each other follow along with their partner’s excitement. “It’s time to get the ring, because Taylor and Travis put you on the clock,”saidone comedian on the app. “Showed this to my bf,” a follower commented. “Me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years … when he comes home I’m gonna start an argument and show him Taylor’s ring,” wrote another.O’Connor’s boyfriend also feels the half-serious pressure. “Anytime I say something about Taylor and her wedding, he kind of rolls his eyes and says: ‘I know, I know,’” she said.View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift performs onstage during the Eras tour in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 30 June 2023.Photograph: Taylor Hill/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights ManagementElisabeth Kramer, a wedding coordinator based in Portland, Oregon, said it is too early to tell how Swift’s wedding – which does not yet have a date – will affect the industry. But she is banking on some trends emerging from it. “I definitely see it being part of the conversation for my 2026 clients,” Kramer said. “Whatever she chooses to wear is going to set a huge tone for the next couple of years.”Swift’s engagement may be a boon for the wedding industry, which saw a post-Covid boom that is slowing down amid inflation and the current economic climate. (One survey found thatfewer Americansare planning to have weddings this year, down from 7% in 2024 to 4% in 2025.) “I’m hearing from a lot of vendors that 2026 is going to be a lot quieter, with people more hesitant to spend money,” Kramer said. “I’m interested to see how a Taylor-Travis engagement changes that.

In second place, with $272.3bn, is the investor and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.The incentive plan, revealed in afiling to the US Securities and Exchange Commissionon Friday, comes at a time when some observers have questioned whether Musk’s outspoken political views could be holding Tesla back.The carmaker’s European salesfell by 40% earlier this year, a dramatic slump that some analysts attributed to Musk’s vocal support for far-right political parties, and his intense but short-lived alliance with Donald Trump.Musk has also divided his duties between Tesla and the stewardship of other ventures, such as SpaceX, Neuralink, xAI and the Boring Co, on top of the time he spends posting on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, which he bought for $44bn in 2022.“One minute Tesla’s board is wondering if Elon Musk is a liability to the company given his outspoken views and political distractions, the next they’re effectively saying ‘pick a number, any number’ to lock him in for as long as possible,” said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at the London-based stockbroker AJ Bell.He said the pay package “beggars belief”, questioning whether one person could be worth that much.But in its statement to shareholders, signed by directors Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, Tesla offered Musk an outspoken vote of confidence, describing him as its “visionary leader”.The company also referred investors, a majority of whom must support the pay deal for it to go through, to the difficulty it has previously had in securing incentives for Musk.The filing referred to a legal challenge that has prevented it from following through on apay deal announced in 2018that gave Musk the chance to claim a $55.8bn bonus.Acourt ruled last yearin favour of a group of investors who claimed that the scheme’s targets had been inappropriately set. An appeal by Tesla is due to be heard next month.“Ultimately, the new award aims to build upon the success of the 2018 CEO performance award framework, which ensured that Elon was only paid for performance delivered and incentivised to guide Tesla through a period of meteoric growth,” the company said.Tesla said the new plan included profit targets that were 28 times higher than the 2018 scheme and would also hinge on delivering new products, such as getting1m “robotaxis” in operationand delivering 1m AI bots, humanoid robots that the company is developing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Therefore, it feels like many investors would happily approve it.“The bigger question is whether this proposal sets a new precedent and boardrooms across America will think it’s OK to add a zero or two on to the end of current remuneration packages.

Instead, the Tesla CEO stated on his social media platform X that he had been invited but could not make it. He said he planned to send a representative and spent the day on X posting a familiar stream of attacks on immigration and trans people.The White House did not respond for comment on why Musk would not be at the dinner.The event, which was to have been held on the newly paved-over Rose Garden, until a forecast of thunderstorms forced the event indoors, began with televised words of praise for the president from several of the assembled tech leaders, and a brief series of questions from reporters.Musk’s absence, even if voluntary, is a stark turnaround from when Trumprepeatedly jokedfollowing the election that “Elon won’t go home, I can’t get rid of him”. The vacant seat highlights a divide that has emerged between the two men since their very public falling out earlier this year, one that has seen Musk’s influence over the government wane despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars to re-elect Trump during the 2024 election.How Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA companyRead moreMusk’s omission from the list of attendees also echoes one of the seminal moments of his political evolution, another White House event. In 2022, then president Joe Bidenfailed to invite the Tesla CEO to a summit on electric vehiclesover concerns it would draw backlash from autoworkers’ unions. Musk, who had not yet publicly aligned himself with the Republican party, lashed out at the White House for the snub and declared that he would not vote for Biden. The move proved enormously costly for Democrats.The incident clearly stuck with Musk, who like Trump has shown a tendency to harbor long-term grudges. Even on the day of Trump’s dinner, he reserved his ire for Biden rather than the current president, retweeting a clip of himself from 2023 addressing Biden’s snub with the post “I try not to start fights, but I do finish them”.In the ensuing years, Musk has taken a hard turn to the political right. He has turned X into a bastion of far-right influencers, whom he frequently retweets to his more than 200 million followers. He has promoted false theories about Democrats conspiring to get immigrants to illegally vote en masse and embraced far-right political parties around the world. He also became Trump’s most vocal and deep-pocketed supporter, contributing nearly $300m to the re-election campaign and Republican causes.Musk’s support for Trump placed him in a position of immense power after the president’s inauguration as the tech mogul established and led the so-called “department of government efficiency” and its sweeping dismantling of federal agencies. It also turned him into a prominent guest at political dinners and events, only a year after the British government didnot invite him to a major tech summitas he made inflammatory anti-immigrant posts that claimed a “civil war” would take place in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although Trump still praises Musk as a “genius”, he told reporters on Wednesday night that Musk has “got some problems” and the two have not been seen together since their public spat.As Musk has feuded with Trump and ceded his place in the White House, however, rival tech moguls have grown closer with the administration and filled some of the vacuum. Earlier this month, Trump hosted Cook, the Apple CEO, at the White House, who in turngifted the president a 24-karat-goldsouvenir. Meanwhile, Trump aides have discussed cutting Musk’s government contracts,according to the Wall Street Journal, only to find upon review that doing so would endanger too many key operations.If Musk had attended Thursday’s dinner, it would have created an awkward arrangement as he issuing two of the companies whose leaders were in attendance: Apple and OpenAI, helmed by his former collaborator and now nemesis Altman. As with Trump, Musk has also attacked Gates for his ties to Epstein after the Microsoft founderaccused him of “killing children”through Doge’s cuts to foreign aid.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpBill GatesTim CookSam AltmanMark ZuckerbergMetanewsShareReuse this content"

A trip to Venice film festival’s extended reality islandA flourishing lineup of immersive storytelling experiments are taking visitors into novels, nightclubs and outer spaceXan BrooksFri 5 Sep 2025 06.06 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 06.07 EDTShareIn the largest cinema at the Venice film festival, guests gather for the premiere ofFrankenstein, Guillermo del Toro’s lavish account of a man who dared to play God and created a monster. When the young scientist reanimates a dead body for his colleagues, some see it as a trick while others are outraged. “It’s an abomination, an obscenity,” shouts one hide-bound old timer, and his alarm is partly justified. Every technological breakthrough opens Pandora’s box. You don’t know what’s going to crawl out or where it will then choose to go.Behind the main festival venue sits the small ruined island of Lazzaretto Vecchio. Since 2017, it’s been home to Venice Immersive, the event’s groundbreaking section dedicated to showcasing and supporting XR (extended reality) storytelling. Before that it was a storage facility, before that a plague quarantine zone. Eliza McNitt, this year’s jury president, remembers the time when work on the exhibits had to be paused because the builders had uncovered human bones in the ground. “There’s something haunting about the fact that we come to the oldest film festival in the world to present this new form of cinema,” she says. “We’re exploring the medium of the future, but we’re also in conversation with ghosts.”There are 69 different monsters on the island this year and these range from spacious walk-through installations to intricate virtual worlds that can be toured in a headset. Frankenstein’s monster, of course, wound up turning on its creator, and McNitt acknowledges that there are similar concerns about immersive art, which tends to be lumped alongside AI in the public mind, folded in with the runaway technology that threatens to consume us all.“Immersive storytelling is a completely different conversation from AI,” she says. “But there is a genuine fear about what AI means for the film industry. And that’s mostly down to a misconception that you can type a prompt – “make me a movie” – and a movie magically appears, which is absolutely not the case. In practice, it’s about using AI tools to create something personal and unique in collaboration with an enormous team of other dedicated artists.” AI won’t replace people, she adds, “because AI doesn’t have taste”.View image in fullscreen‘Each experience demands a leap of faith’ … Xan Brooks, left, experiencing Reflections of Little Red Dot.Photograph: Venice ImmersiveMcNitt is an early adopter of AI tools and used them most recently on her autobiographical 2025 film Ancestra. Other film-makers, she suspects, are not far behind. “I think there are only a couple of experiences here on the island that are just beginning to experiment with the tools,” she says. “But next year you’re going to see it a lot more involved in all aspects of these projects.”Immersive storytelling’s berth at theVenice film festivalconveniently aligns it with cinema itself and encourages visitors to view it as a natural extension, or the heir to the throne. Several mainstream Hollywood directors have already crossed over. Asteroid, for instance, is a high-stakes space thriller about a mining expedition gone horribly wrong, spearheaded by Doug Liman, the director of Swingers and The Bourne Identity. His producing partner, Julina Tatlock, tells me that the interactive short film effectively returns Liman to his early independent roots and has allowed him to devise and produce a project free from studio constraints. Asteroid is a labour of love and part of a larger story that may yet see life as a straight film feature. “Doug’s obsessed with space,” she says.Immersive art is to cinema what cinema was to photography. When cinema arrived, it didn’t replace photographyThere’s a similarly cinematic quality to The Clouds Are Two Thousand Metres Up, a rapturous arthouse drama in which a bereaved young widower pursues his wife’s spirit through the pages of her unfinished novel. Its Taiwanese director, Singing Chen, has worked in conventional film as well as VR and feels that each form has its strengths. “Immersive art is to cinema what cinema was to photography,” she says. “When cinema arrived, it didn’t replace photography, because the still image has power and value. It affects us in a different way than the moving image.”The films on the schedule at Venice are largely known quantities. More often than not, we’ll be familiar with the actors and the director and can largely intuit the plot. Whereas the artworks on the island could be almost anything: an immersive video, an installation, a hyperactive adventure or a virtual world to explore. In a space of an afternoon, the visitor can bounce from the arcade-game interactivity of Samantha Gorman and Danny Cannizzaro’s Face Jumping to Kate Voet and Victor Maes’s wrenching human drama A Long Goodbye, in which a husband and wife battle the onset of dementia, to Chloé Lee’s excellent, ingenious Reflections of Little Red Dot, which repurposes an old analogue slide projector for a vivid whistle-stop tour of Singapore’s cultural history. Each experience demands a leap of faith and depends on a certain willingness to get lost. You might fall on your face, but you may also achieve lift off.View image in fullscreenVisitors tend to wander out in a daze … Dark Rooms.Photograph: Venice ImmersiveThree projects stand out from this year’s Venice lineup. Ancestors, by Steye Hallema, is a boisterous ensemble interactive in which visitors are first paired as couples, then organised into extended families and are shown pictures of their descendants on their synchronised smartphones. It’s a rarity among the immersive experiences in that it’s a purely communal affair, joyous and slightly chaotic in the manner of all good happy families. If Ancestors is about the importance of human relationships, then the form and the content are in perfect harmony here.Craig Quintero and Phoebe Greenberg’s extraordinary Blur (probably the hottest ticket on the island) covers similar ground to Ancestors with its focus on cloning and identity, genesis and extinction, although it takes the form of precision-tooled immersive theatre. It’s head-spinningly strange, provocative and seductive. In the closing moments, the user is approached by an eerie VR version of themselves in old age: an emissary from the future; the shape of things to come. Distressingly, the bald, withered figure that shuffled in my direction looked only a year or two older than I am now.If there is a real-world equivalent of the Frankenstein scene in which the angry scientists cry “abomination” and “obscenity”, it occurs on the boat ride to the island when a middle-aged Italian man takes issue with the producers of a sensory installation called Dark Rooms. The producers are satanists, he insists. They assure him they are not. “Maybe not,” says the man. “But you have made a work of Satan.” Actually, Dark Rooms is terrific and not satanic at all, even if it does spend the majority of its time underground, in the shadows. Co-directed by Mads Damsbo, Laurits Flensted-Jensen and Anne Sofie Steen Sverdrup, this rites-of-passage tale spirits the user on a jolting, intense trip through the corners of queer subculture, through nightclubs and back rooms and finally out over the sea. It’s brilliant and unnerving and finally rather moving. Visitors, I’m told, tend to wander out in a daze.In the early editions of Venice Immersive, most stories erred on the side of simplicity, as if to reassure newcomers who might be put off by the technology. But the medium has now gained in confidence. It’s broken out of the nursery and reached adolescence. The work has turned more potent, daring and psychologically complex. It’s no accident that many of the best Venice Immersive experiences are about ancestors and descendants and the links between the two. Nor for that matter that so many of them feature scenes that take place aboard moving trains and fragile bridges and inside open elevators. Whether intentionally or not, the medium is telling us where it is: at an interstitial stage, in transit, in progress. It’s travelling between worlds, busily finding its range as it heads into the future.Explore more on these topicsFilmVenice film festivalVirtual realityArtificial intelligence (AI)Drama filmsComputingFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many were unable to complete purchases, with error messages persisting for almost three hours after the launch.Forget Tomb Raider and Uncharted, there’s a new generation of games about archaeology – sort ofRead moreThe surge in demand was reflected on the troubleshooting platform Downdetector, where user reports spiked to 3,750 shortly after launch before gradually tapering off.Social media lit up with complaints and screenshots of error codes as frustrated gamers vented about the lack of a preorder option. One user called the situation “ridiculous”, while others described it as “stupid” that no measures had been taken to prevent the bottleneck.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHumble Bundle, another digital retailer, briefly displayed a message stating the game was unavailable due to overwhelming traffic – a notice that was later removed once the issue was resolved.Despite the technical hiccups, within 30 minutes of going live Steam reported more than 100,000 active players, suggesting many had managed to secure their copies.Hollow Knight was developed by Ari Gibson, William Pellen and Jack Vine with music by Christopher Larkin, who comprise the Adelaide-based indie studio Team Cherry.

But the anticipation for the sequel – which shifts focus to Hornet, a sword-wielding princess who appeared as a supporting character in the original game – was such that at least seven other new games have delayed their launch in the past two weeks to avoid a clash, including the walking sim Baby Steps and the tactical role-playing game Demonschool, the New York Times reported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Other than some social media posts and some blurry golf-course images, the normally ubiquitous president seemed almost to disappear.But most of Big Journalism gave that subject a pass.Given Trump’s obvious health problems – swollen ankles, an uneven gait, bruised hands and instances of verbal confusion – the media silence struck a lot of people as hypocrisy.“Why are the biggest newsrooms silent?” demanded John Passantino, who writes for the media newsletter Status. “No front-page write ups. No broadcast packages.” Trump’s health problems and near disappearance “barely registered in mainstream coverage”.By contrast, the media went overboard with unrelenting coverage of Joe Biden’s old age, but it came late. Almost all of it followed the then president’s shockingly weak debate appearance during his 2024 re-election campaign.There was plenty of finger-pointing – even a bestselling book by two media bigwigs – about the failures to report Biden’s decline earlier and about the White House’s efforts to obscure it.This time, over the Labor Day weekend, wild rumors swirled on social media that Trump had died, or had suffered a debilitating stroke or a series of them. The much-read Drudge Report published a story with this headline: PRESIDENT HEALTH CRISIS DEEPENS.Nevertheless, JD Vance seemed to target big media.“If the media you consumed told you that Donald Trump was on his deathbed because he didn’t do a press conference for three days, imagine what else they’re lying to you about,” Vance posted on X.That translated, for the gullible, into the usual trashing of the mainstream press, a regular talking point from Magaworld.In fact, big journalism was guilty of nothing of the sort; if anything, they took Trump’s disappearancetoolightly.As is often the case with Trump and his allies, there’s a lot of projection going on.“Imagine what else they’re lying to you about” is something that might, much more accurately, be said about Trump and his minions on any number of subjects.Trump joined in, too. “It’s fake news – it’s so fake. That’s why the media has so little credibility,” he responded to a Fox News question that conveniently set up this round of media-bashing. (“How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” asked Peter Doocy at a briefing after Trump re-emerged.)Nonsense, of course. Most of the mainstream media was overly cautious, if anything, in approaching the topic.When the New York Timesdidget around to covering the issue, the paper took up the topic obliquely – focusing primarily on the false rumors of Trump’s death and then, much lower in a long story, addressing the paucity of information about his actual health. The headline: President Trump Is Alive. The Internet was Convinced Otherwise.The story puts in historical context the tendency of White House staffs to obscure the physical problems of American presidents – from Woodrow Wilson’s stroke to John F Kennedy’s chronic back pain. Eventually, it makes the point that “justifiable concerns and questions about Mr Trump’s health have often been met with obfuscation or minimal explanation from the people around him”.(The White House in July explained Trump’s bruising and swelling as chronic venous insufficiency, but downplayed the condition as benign and common for older people; his doctor pronounced him in excellent health.)Even after an assassination attempt on Trump last year, no medical briefings were held. And, to my recollection, there was precious little investigative follow-up on that.Yet, amid all of this, the White House press secretary claimed that Trump has been “completely transparent about his health with the public, unlike his predecessor”.As usual, in Trumpworld, a lie outpaces the truth, and everything is Biden’s fault.So whatdoesresponsible media coverage of this topic look like? The question evokes the Goldilocks fairy tale: what’s too hot? What’s too cold? And what’s just right?“Evidence-based assessments of a president’s health are absolutely fair game” for journalists, Bill Grueskin of Columbia Journalism School told Associated Press media reporter David Bauder.And when someone as omnipresent in the media as Trump drops out of view for days? That’s fair game, too.With Trump now in his 80thyear – he turned 79 in June – these questions are not going away. Rampant speculation certainly isn’t the answer, but it tends to flood in when there is a vacuum of real information.The unquestioning acceptance of White House reassurance isn’t the answer either.In good journalism, “just right” is founded on skepticism and addressed by persistence – by doggedly digging out the facts and presenting them forthrightly.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

And that is all thanks to one manFri 5 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 11.23 EDTShareThings seem to be going well at the CDC, the federal agency charged with protecting US public health. By “well” I mean terrible, thanks to the leadership of the health and human services secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr. Not only is the agency in complete disarray under his leadership, but the secretary’s fringe agenda is now also putting the lives of everyone in the country at risk.Let me recount a few of Kennedy’s stellar accomplishments. He is, after all, a manlabeled“a crown jewel of this administration” by Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), a panel that has long developed scientifically based recommendations on the use of vaccines. Kennedy dropped them like a hot beaker andreplacedthem with new members, several of whom share his anti-vaccine views and half-baked skepticism of the most common mRNA Covid-19 vaccines.In Trump’s America, vaccination rates are declining and measles is spreading | Katrina vanden HeuvelRead moreCovid is still with us, unfortunately, and the vaccines are helping us survive a dangerous reality. In fact, 14,660 people have died of Covid as an underlying or contributing cause so farthis year alone. Yet, at his Senate hearing on Thursday, Kennedy wasaskedby Senator Jeff Merkley if he accepted the statistic that a million Americans had died of Covid since the outbreak began. “I don’t know how many died,” Kennedy responded. Meanwhile, the CDC’sown website, an agency he’s responsible for, tabulates the number of deaths as 1,234,371. At the same hearing, Kennedy also said heagreedwith the statement made by one of his appointees to ACIP that “mRNA vaccines cause serious harm, including death, especially among young people”. Never mind thatnumerousstudieshaverepeatedlyshown the vaccines to be safe and effective.That’s not all. Getting that Covid booster shot will probably become significantly harder in the future. In late August, the Food and Drug Administration, also overseen by Kennedy, approved some updated Covid vaccines, but at the same time severely restricted who would be authorized to receive boosters. Last year, anyone over the age of six months was eligible. But this year, you must be over 65 years of age or have an underlying health condition that increases the risk of severe Covid-19 infection.We should have seen something like this coming. In May, Kennedy took the unprecedented unilateralmoveto remove Covid-19 booster shots from its recommended immunization schedule for pregnant women and healthy children. “Our healthcare system is now solidly anti-children and anti-science,” Fatima Khan, co-founder of the Protect Their Future group, which advocates for vaccine access for children, toldCNN.Booster shots will still be available, Kennedysays. But what he’s not saying is that they will probably be a lot harder to find and afford. Private insurance companies generally base their decisions on covering the costs of vaccines by following government recommendations, and many states limit which vaccines pharmacists can administer based on those same recommendations. (California, Oregon and Washington recentlyannouncedan alliance to safeguard vaccine access.)The long and the short of it is that Kennedy is behind “a deliberate effort to weaken America’s public-health system and vaccine protections”. This is what Susan Monarez wrote in anop-edin the Wall Street Journal. Monarez served as the director of the CDC for a whole 29 days before she was ousted from her position. (Jim O’Neil, Monarez’sreplacement, is unsurprisingly a Trump loyalist with no medical or scientific background.) The ACIP isscheduledto meet later this month, and will discuss among other topics the Covid-19 vaccines. Monarez wrote that in August she was told to “preapprove the recommendations” to be made by ACIP. She refused. In another statement made through her lawyers, shesaidshe would not “rubberstamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts”.Kennedy, of course, has done all those things. Hefired2,400 workers (about 18% of the CDC workforce), laterrehiringabout 700 people. He has “severely weakened programs designed to protect Americans from cancer, heart attacks, strokes, lead poisoning, injury, violence and more”, according to nine previous directors of the CDC who sounded the alarm about Kennedy’s leadership in theNew York Times. He downplayed the use of highly effective vaccines during the largest single measles epidemic in 25 years in this country while cheering on the use of home remedies such ascod liver oil or vitamins.It’s all so ideological and irresponsible, leading predictably to horrible consequences. There have been threeconfirmed deathsfrom the measles outbreak, but they are not the only victims. Our collective trust in the government is perhaps the main casualty. After Monarez was fired,four senior officialsof the CDC resigned in protest at the politicization of the agency. More than 1,000 past and present workers of the Department of Health and Human Servicessigned a letterdemanding his resignation and stating that “Secretary Kennedy’s actions are compromising the health of this nation”. We’re now living through a battle between sane scientists and zealous anti-vaxxers, and nobody knows who will win.What do anti-vaxxers and the rightwing get out of such politicization of public health? They live in the same country as the rest of us, after all. Do they feel somehow healthier knowing that Joseph Ladapo, Florida’s surgeon general,aims to endchildhood vaccination against preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, chickenpox, polio and hepatitis? I certainly don’t. Routine childhood vaccinationspreventedabout 508m cases of illness in the US between 1994 and 2023. And he’s getting rid of them? Madness.Ladapoclaimsthat “what you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God”. OK. Fine. But none of us lives entirely alone, and your health affects my health, and vice versa. Living together means taking care of ourselves but also each other for our individual and collective wellbeing. It’s not rocket science. But it must be based on science.The right wing sees it otherwise. To them, the government response to Covid in particular and public health in general is leading us straight to “a regime of suppression, censorship, and coercion reminiscent of the power systems and governance that were previously condemned”. The result? “Human rights and individual freedom, as under previous fascist regimes, will lose,”accordingto David Bell of the Brownstone Institute, a thinktank established to oppose Covid-19 restrictions.But this seems a lot more like projection than any semblance to reality. Recent scholarship tends to point in the opposite direction, showing how social instability from the world’s last major pandemic before Covid, the 1918 global influenza pandemic, helped pave the way for the rise of theNazi partyin Germany and theFascist partyin Italy. Onestudyfound that “Mussolini’s newspaper tended to blame ‘others’ for the pandemic … and portrayed themselves as the voice of the common people against an out-of-touch ‘elite.’” Sounds familiar.Kennedy’s anti-science anti-vax agenda could have catastrophic health outcomes across the nation, helping fuel the rise of an even more extreme rightwing politics in the future. Could that result be what this government is even counting on? The idea sounds too far-fetched to be true, but I would also like to be alive when I’m proven wrong.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrOpinionUS healthcareTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Of whom did Donald Trump say admiringly: “I also learned that he loves his country very much”? And: “He wrote mebeautiful letters. And they are great letters. We fell in love”?If you answered “Nigel Farage”, then I’m sorry. The Reform UK leader might have spent this pre-party conference week in his happy place – lodged several feet up the US presidential colon – and rhetorically demanding of US lawmakers: “At what point did [the UK] become North Korea?” But those Trump compliments were in fact previously made about Kim Jong-un, the dictator of … well, you know the rest.We always want what we can’t have, of course, which is why Trump this week had to settle for Farage grinning gormlessly next to his Oval Office desk like a competition winner, while Kim laughed it upwith Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinpingat a vast military parade in Beijing which featured, among other deranged martial curiosities, robot wolves. Good times. If you regard China as the US’s chief rival, then you can definitely see putative prime minister Nigel casting the UK as North Korea in the equivalent western pecking order. In a few short years, Farage might well be honking with laughter as the US’s robot coyotes slink past at Washington’s biannual Big Beautiful Ballistic Parade.Anyway, back to the present day for now. Although his presidential colonic timeshare must be maintained – use it or lose it! – Farage was ostensibly in Washington to slag off Britain, launch the US outpost of a TV station he works lucrativelyand tax-efficientlyfor, and beg for US help in combatting “the really awful authoritarian situation the UK has sunk into” on free speech.Before we go on, a quick word on that point. The UKisn’tin the greatest place on free speech, and could do with a serious rethink on where its priorities lie. Or at least, a serious think about making it make sense. Take those who agree with the new Green party leader that it’s entirely “proportionate” to arrest someone over tweets, but also reckon thatPalestine Action has done nothing wrong. But also, take Farage himself, whining this week about the “really awful authoritarian situation” in the UK, while his underlings exacerbate it in a quite ludicrous piece of free-speech hypocrisy. We’ll come to the full details of that in a minute. But you shouldn’t be able to have it both ways – even if the lessons of the past decade might have suggested to people on both sides of politics that you can.Still, no one on this Earth is having it both ways harder than Trump. No offence, but do we really have to take lectures on free speech from a country where his administration recently wrote a letter to the Smithsonian mandating a review of some of its museums and exhibits “in accordance with Executive Order 14253, Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”? This compulsory review, they added, was “to ensure alignment with the President’s directive” that museums say the things he wants them to say.Do we really have to take it from a country where universities are threatened with being defunded because they aren’t teaching in the way he wants them to teach? Do we really have to take it from a country where the president attacks the press at every possible opportunity and frequently seeks to weaken it? Do we really have to take it from a country with a leader who openly admires a whole array of grim dictators who have eliminated free speech in their countries? Do we really have to take it froma country with book bans? Not to be a bad sport, but I rather think we don’t.Nigel would disagree, of course. In fact, he’d love to help them out with the hypocrisy. Just as Republicans would much rather be conveniently preoccupied with European domestic laws while their own first amendment rights get eroded right before their eyes, so Farage would much rather swan off to Washington to be used as a pawn in partisan misdirection than stay at home and get involved with a free-speech horror show he most definitely can do something about.To Nottingham, then, which, while not as much as a glitzy power trip for Farage as Washington, is nonetheless a town where the council is run by his Reform party. And where, alas, the Nottinghamshire council leaderbanned his councillorsfrom engaging in scrutiny by the local press. Last week, Reform’s Mick Barton announced that because of a story about local government reorganisation, none of his councillors could speak to the Nottingham Post, its online arm Nottinghamshire Live, or a team of BBC-funded local journalists. This week, in the wake of a backlash against his fundamentalist huff against free speech, Barton updated to say his banonly applied to himself. Now, following Farage’s congressional committee session in which various contradictions saw the Reform leader being asked: “Do you agree with yourself?”, Nigel has finally said he would “have a little chat” with Barton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s now 2025 and the destructive corporatisation ofAustralian universitiesis galactically worse.How else can we approach discussion about the crumbling of universities except through poetry given the manipulations of English language universities themselves are using to communicate thedevastating cuts to courses and staff?A management missive from Western Sydney University invites career teachers and researchers “feeling unsettled during Reset” to “BYO lunch and take half an hour to invest in yourself” after a management briefingabout redundanciesthat risk depriving students of subject choice, derailing years of research and smashing trajectories in the working lives of human beings.“Reset” in this context seems to mean yet another corporate restructure with job losses, in the same way that “purge” in the movie franchise means a human cull. Bring your own lunch, indeed.Are young women finally being spared the unique cruelty of male literary opinions? | Van BadhamRead moreI would love to concentrate my vitriol towards this patronising nonsense on WSU but, alas, its foul jargonnaise is not an outlier. A couple of weeks ago the University of Technology Sydney advised staff to manage the stress of a “reset” that will suspend a staggering 146 courses by remembering to …wash their underpants.One presumes this specific advice came about after staff learned that 10% of the university was about to be slashed, 400 workers were about to lose their jobs and, as the cry of “are you shitting me?!” roared throughout the campus tower, the management class read it as “stakeholder feedback” and fed it into AI to generate a localised response.This advice on laundering “delicates”was included the uni’s “50 tips” for facing job loss alongside “bake a dessert” or “do a task you’ve been dreading, like … cleaning a bathroom”.Sirs, I have been unemployed. It is not “me-time”.That no one from UTS management thought through the fact their advice would affix “dirty underpants” to the uni’s brand forever proves how denuded Australian higher education standards have become.If only UTS management had proximityto communications expertsto advise them.Alas, this would deprive parasitic corporate consultancies of the richly rewarding opportunity of packaging together some buzzwords, cliches and prejudiced assumptions, firing expert teachers and researchers, and convincing university leadership – at exorbitant cost – that this is modernAustralian education.I guess it is. Seems a shame.Academics, from habit, have tried to alert taxpayers to the facts: a National Tertiary Education Union investigation revealed that universities spent a laughable$734m on external consultants in 2023.The following year universities cut 2,291 jobs – although I note that amid adopting policies that resulted inwidespread wage theft, wasteful spending and conflicts of interest, vice-chancellors retained $1m+ average salaries and306 academic leaders were paid more than state premiers.You won’t be surprised to hear tales from any career academics left standing of mangament pressure to think of their students as customers. Failing them for poor performance and “plAIgarism” becomes a bit tricky, but, hey - it’s just qualifying people for life-and-death jobs they can’t do, what could go wrong?It’s in the national interest for the sector to be reformed, and heads to rollIt seems quaint to remind people that the state acts of parliament which established each of Australia’s public universities specify that – unlike, say, a profit-making professional services firm – they exist for public good, public interest and public benefit.Australia has now had decades of expensive, corporate business geniuses advising universities,but university managements insist they must slash arts and social science degrees because revenue is not meeting cost.At a time when self-declared Nazis are using the internet to mobilise, new information systems are rapidly transforming the nature of work and traditional models of communication are crumbling, properly resourced sociology departments are what the public desperately needs.Albanese’s education minister, Jason Clare, achieved what many thought impossible last year by securing the funding restructure required to finally resource Australia’s public primary and secondary schools. Now a second-term minister, he has reportedly “put unis on notice” about their governance.Personally, I’d suggest he cancel every consultancy contract going forward and put every university decision-maker responsible for the ongoing, farcical fatcattery in Australian higher education to the figurative sword. It’s in the national interest for the sector to be reformed, and heads to roll.But, take heart, heads! In the words of WSU management, “Change on this scale can feel overwhelming - and it’s natural to feel anxious”... But think of prospective unemployment as me-time. Readsome poetry, perhaps.

Elected in a landslide slightly more than a year ago, Labour hit the midterm blues within a few months, currently has the poll numbers of an administration in its dying days – and has now witnessed ascandal and resignationclose to the apex of power.Perhaps the many New Labour veteransnow installed in Downing Streetwill be reassuring Keir Starmer that the storm of Angela Rayner’s departure will pass, reminding him that the Blair cabinet saw theexit of one Peter Mandelson– also over his homeowning arrangements, as it happens – similarly early in the first term, but paid no electoral price. And yet, the prime minister has only to look at the economic numbers and his own popularity ratings to know that this is not 1998 and he is no Tony Blair.Accordingly, Rayner’s decision to quit as both deputy PM and deputy leader of theLabourparty will hit hard, further wounding a government that has been struggling since almost the moment it took office.At its most basic, a resignation always damages an administration’s reputation for competence. It allows opponents to charge, and voters to fear, that things are unravelling, that at the top there is chaos rather than order. No 10 will hope that the Friday afternoon reshuffle – with David Lammy succeeding Rayner as deputy PM and Yvette Cooper replacing him as foreign secretary – will look decisive and even be rejuvenating. But personnel changes forced by scandal hardly fit the image ofa prime minister whose main offer to the country was technocratic calm, as an antidote to the Tory dysfunction embodied by Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.The specific circumstances that led Rayner to quit make things worse. They recall the headlines that dogged Labour from the start, when senior ministers – including Starmer – were having to explain why they had taken free stuff, fromnatty clothes to tickets to see Taylor Swift. Again, those revelations undermined Labour’s promise to clean the Westminster stables of the sleaze that had malodorously piled up in the Johnson era.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner and Keir Starmer at the Labour party conference in Brighton in September 2021.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThere will be plenty ready to argue that there is a world of difference between Rayner’s actions and those that shook the last government, but it will do little good. A senior minister paying £40,000 less tax than they should have will strike too many voters as proof of what the cynics always, and untruthfully, say – that every last politician is either a hypocrite or more concerned with lining their own pockets than serving the public good.That line of attack damages all politicians, but it hurts this government especially. Starmer does not have oratorical gifts or charisma; for a long time, his defining feature was a kind of boy-scout image of probity. As a former chief prosecutor, he cast himself as the un-Boris: the unexciting goody-goody who would ensure that the rules were obeyed. Any rule-breaking on his watch breaks that perception – bad news when that perception is pretty much all he’s got.Still, that is to map only some of the crater that has been left in the Labour landscape by this bombshell. The gap left by Rayner’s resignation is deeper because of who she is and what her elevation in the party meant.Famously, John Prescott played a very particular role for Blair, acting as an emissary to an often suspicious party, a character witness vouching for his boss to traditional, working-class supporters especially. (As vice-president, Joe Biden performed a similar role for Barack Obama.) By rights, Starmer should not have needed such a lieutenant: the son of a toolmaker is from a working-class background himself. But, for whatever reason, the PM does not present that way. Much of contemporary politics is about vibes, and Sir Keir has a vibe that does not match his backstory.Rayner, whose life experience makes her a rarity among practitioners of Westminster politics, filled that space. You’d speak to Labour canvassers awed by her ability to connect with voters on the doorstep, working-class women especially. One told me how Rayner confessed to a woman that the paving stones of her garden path were cleaner than the tiles in Rayner’s kitchen: the voter beamed. Moderators of focus groups notedhow voters warmed to Rayner for being herself. To them, Rayner had that most precious commodity in politics: authenticity.But this was about more than mere presentation. How many national politicians could speak of the girls who fell victim to grooming gangs and credibly say: “That could have been me”? For some in Labour, Rayner embodied the party’s ideal, even its promise, on social mobility: to nurture a country where “someone like Angela Rayner can become deputy prime minister, where we have a talent pool broader and deeper than Eton College,” as one colleague puts it. Others in Labour are convinced that the long-running and relentless scrutiny by therightwing newspapersof the deputy PM proves that there are some who, with equal passion, don’t want to live in a country where “someone like Angela Rayner can become deputy prime minister”.So a cabinet light on gifted communicators and a government short of politicians capable of speaking to Labour’s historic constituency has lost someone who is both. That leaves a large vacancy to fill.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer can reshuffle his cabinet, but the post of deputy leader is decided by party members. Unless Starmermoves to cancel it– or unless Lammy’s appointment effectively forestalls a contest, by paving the way for the latter to run unopposed – thatmeans an internal election at a moment of vulnerability for the leadership. An argument over the party’s direction that has been rumbling inside Labour for months will now burst into the open, given the focus and sharpness that can only come in a choice between individuals.Should Labour continue to chase the so-called hero voters of the pro-Brexit red wall cherished by the Downing Street chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, fighting Reform UK – which gathers for its party conference this weekend buoyed by polls showing iton course to be the largest party at the next general election– on the turf of immigration and the like? Or should it look to its left, staunching the flow of onetime Labour supporters now defecting to the Greens, the new, unnamed party of Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana or assorted independents? This is a debate that Starmer has so far been able to keep the lid on. Rayner has just blown it right off.Blair withstood that first Mandelson exit in part because the government and the economy were riding high. But it was also because Mandelson’s communications skills were not indispensable. The PM himself was no slouch in that department and, more importantly, the entire government knew what story it was telling. If Rayner’s resignation inflicts much greater damage, that’s not wholly down to either her biography or her ability to speak human. It’s because this government is not telling a story compelling enough to transcend the inevitable bumps and skids that happen to every administration.This autumn there will be two opportunities to address that, in the form of the Labour party conference and the budget, now set for 26 November. If Starmer and his ministers do not seize both of them, then that will be a failure more culpable than any underpayment of stamp duty – and its consequences will be far more grave.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

People will suffer – and Labour will gain absolutely nothingDiane TaylorBritish politicians’ rhetoric has become increasingly shouty and hateful. And now the home secretary has joined the chorusFri 5 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 11.04 EDTShareIt’s been a busy week for asylum-seeker bashing. Had it not been for the forensic scrutiny of the deputy prime minister’stax affairs, the onslaught against people seeking sanctuary would have been even more intense.Monday’s bombshellwas an announcement from the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, about the suspension of refugee family reunion until next spring. Until now, for families who have been through hell due to war and conflict in their home country, the prospect of finally being reunited in a safe country after one member has been granted refugee status haskept them going. That hope has been snatched away, as the government officially stopped taking applications for the programme on Thursday at 3pm.Further bad news spewed out. Appeals (often against flawed initial government decisions on asylum claims) will now be handled bypeople with less expertisethan the highly qualified judges who currently hear these cases. Trained members of the public – no further details provided – will make these life and death decisions.Asylum accommodation is a Premier League-level political football. Warehouses arebeing considered, the home secretary declared, when asked for the millionth time why asylum seekers are still luxuriating at taxpayers’ expense in hotels.Threatening “we’ll send you home” messages sent to 130,000overseas studentsfollowed, failing to mention that students from war zones who claim asylum can’t be returned there at present. And new life has been breathed into the old chestnut ofID cards, along with intensified raids on workplaces to root out illegals wherever they might be concealing themselves and scamming us, no mention that those working illegally are probably being exploited and paid a pittance. Government also omitted to mention that there are alreadyoptions onlinefor employers to confirm whether or not their employees have the legal right to work in the UK.But this week’s announcements are unlikely to be the end of it. It seems that no punishment is harsh enough for asylum seekers. The government is determined to compete with the rhetoric of Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, and the shadow justice minister, Robert Jenrick, who in turn are competing with each other to see which one can “out-nasty” their political rival. In an interview in the Spectator, Jenrick said Farage wasnot going far enoughwith his proposal for cabins with a fence round them to accommodate asylum seekers, and is calling for “a decade of net emigration”.Asylum seekers, especially those who are newly arrived in the country, have often not grasped the complexities of UK politics, and are unaware of how politicians from mainstream parties are scapegoating them to score points and gain votes. They are much more likely to listen to the news about the latest developments in their home country than what is going on here, anxiously checking to see if the area their family lives in has been bombed overnight.Most want to work hard, pay taxes and contribute. The resourcefulness, resilience and energy required to make their difficult journeys are qualities many employers look for in their staff.They are often unaware of the tropes around luxury hotels, especially when they spend their days scrubbing mould off the walls of their rooms, trying to trap rodents and avoid bits of crumbling ceiling falling on their heads. They are also unaware of the images of grinning young men on a dinghy sailing on a sea as smooth as glass, used over and over again by some sections of the media, sending a message to the British public that they are chancers having a laugh at our expense.In reality, it is more likely that a dinghy crossing the Channel will be overstuffed with people screaming and crying, frantically trying to bale out water, crushed and bruised because of the severe overcrowding and convinced they will not make it on to dry land.The mismatch between the realities of asylum seekers’ lives and the increasingly hateful rhetoric of shouty politicians, amplified by large sections of the media and social media, has never been greater. It is steering government policy in a disastrous direction and causing deep fissures in our society.The prime minister isquick to show empathyfor those who oppose migrants, saying he understands their frustration about small boat crossings and hotels in their communities, but he is silent on the other side of the story. Maybe he has forgottenthis casein 2003, and others where he passionately defended the rights of asylum seekers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But ministers will never be able to satisfy the likes of Farage and Jenrick, however low they go. An increasing number of asylum seekers are being accommodated at a bleak former military base, Wethersfield, in Essex. Local residentscompare it to “a stalag”. Nobody can claim people are living in luxury there. Yet a national demonstration has been organised in nearby Colchester later this month to protest about asylum seekers being accommodated at the base with the words: “None in, all out.”Meanwhile, far-right influencers are calling for remigration – ethnic cleansing and mass deportation of people who aren’t white.It starts with asylum seekers, but unless the government replaces its current rhetoric with one about community cohesion and all humans having equal value, it won’t end there.Diane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil libertiesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech, Oswald Mosley’s embrace of fascism,Keith Joseph’s 1974 speechapparently in favour of eugenics: each of these transgressions was punished and became infamous.According to believers in this country’s political moderation, the mainstream British right does not make overt appeals to prejudice, encourage political violence, form alliances with the far right, or advocate authoritarianism here or abroad. Unlike in other democracies, such as interwar Germany, our conservatism has always had red lines.Yet even if this reassuring picture was accurate in the past – and that is open to question – nowadays the British right appears to be on a much less cautious path. On law and order, immigration, net zero, multiculturalism, press freedom, the British empire, Donald Trump’s administration, the European convention on human rights, the condition of British cities and general state of the nation, leading Conservative and Reform UK figures routinely say inflammatory things, far outside the supposed bounds of responsible conservatism. This week, the chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Gavin Stephens, without naming specific politicians, took the unusual step of warning that those “in a leadership position” should not “sow division”.A radicalisation is under way on the right, encouraged by excited reactionaries in the media, thinktanks and academia, on a scale not seen since the feverish mid-1970s. What caused this transformation? And where is it leading?One driver is desperation. Not just the Conservatives’ frantic search for an escape from unpopularity; but a deeper restlessness and insecurity. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the free-market policies on which British rightwing politics has been based for half a century have lost much of their credibility – even for many conservatives, who have belatedly realised they are too socially disruptive. Brexit, privatisation and austerity – the right’s three other big projects – have also been discredited. So, no longer trusted by enough voters on the economy or the size and role of the state, the right has turned to culture wars, foreigner-bashing and hyperbolic national declinism. In July, at a Reform press conference on crime, Nigel Farage claimed that Britain is “facing nothing short of societal collapse”.Meanwhile, the Conservatives’ rightward march is being fuelled by frustration, anger and disorientation at being ejected from power for the first time since 1997. The fact that Keir Starmer, whom many Tories see as mediocre, is probably going to be in office with a huge majority for another four years, and possibly more, despite Labour’s endless troubles, adds insult to injury. For a Conservative party that believes it has the right to rule, however dire its governing record, interruptions to this ascendancy are increasingly hard to stomach.The contempt and outrage of the rightwing media towards relatively effective ministers such as Ed Miliband comes from a similar place of entitlement. The constant insinuations that such centre-left figures – a regular, yet rarely dominant part of Labour governments – are sinister and somehow illegitimate is another symptom of the right’s growing extremism: an intolerance of reforms that change Britain in any progressive way at all.Reform’s radicalism is, on the surface, less ill-tempered. The party has been on the up for months, and Farage’s speeches and press conferences revel in that, with huge promises, such as to “deport hundreds of thousands of people”, the product ofsurging confidenceas much as scaremongering about immigrants. Yet the blatant similarities between Reform’s policies and Trump’s – even at a local level, with Nottinghamshire’s Reform-controlled councilimposing bans on journalistswhose revelations it finds inconvenient – show the ominous direction of Farage’s party. Freedom of speech and individual liberty are endlessly invoked by the British right, but it believes that these freedoms should be ever more selectively distributed.View image in fullscreenBoris Johnson addresses the Conservative party spring conference in Blackpool, 19 March 2022.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty ImagesIn some ways, Britain’s current rightwing politics of mingled libertarianism and authoritarianism, slippery populist pledges and largely symbolic policies, originates in the already half-forgotten era ofBoris Johnson. He purged centrist Conservatives, illegally prorogued parliament, insulted Muslims and invoked English nationalism in ways that pleased the far right. Pro-Boris placards were waved at their rallies. Despite all his lying and rule-breaking, most of the rightwing media stayed loyal. Johnson’s path to victory at the 2019 election was eased by Farage’s Brexit party agreeing not to campaign in Tory seats. The British right became more uninhibited during these years, and has never really calmed down.Yet to fully understand the right’s current frame of mind, we need to look further back, to the reckless reactionary summer of 1974. Then as now, a relatively new, struggling Labour government faced an unpopular Conservative party with few fresh ideas. There was much talk of national decline. For many rightwing Britons, one group was to blame: not immigrants, but the unions. To tame them, solutions far beyond standard conservatism began to be considered, involving former soldiers, authoritarian rightwing activists and networks of “volunteers”.In July, the leader of one of these “private armies”, as they became known, a recently retired general, Walter Walker, told the London Evening News: “Perhaps the country might choose rule by the gun in preference to anarchy.” The then defence secretary, Roy Mason, warned of a “near fascist groundswell”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, in fact, this aggressive anti-union politics simply re-emerged in more respectable form, with Margaret Thatcher’s 1975 election as Conservative leader, supported by former participants in the private army projects.Today’s taboo-breaking right could also produce a dominant new conservatism – perhaps a fusion of Reform’s grievance politics with Robert Jenrick’s ever more authoritarian Toryism. Or it could be more illiberal still. This week, Jenrick tried to sound tougher than both Farage and his own party leader, Kemi Badenoch, arguing that asylum seekers should be confined in “rudimentary prisons”, rather than the “holiday camps” proposed by Reform.Even if the new right’s electoral breakthrough never comes – Farage and Jenrick are yet more divisive than Thatcher – its radicalisation has already had major effects: pulling Labour to the right, pushing the Greens to the left, and increasing interest in Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s new socialist party. Once one side starts ignoring the supposed rules of politics, the whole game can change.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Burgeoning membership and council seats as Reform UK tops 30% in the polls. Immigration is the boat that sailed him here: the more small boats arriving, the broader his wolfish grin.Primeinflamerofforeignerhatredthat he is, black and brown people report what they call the Farage effect in a wave of attacks: Mothin Ali, new deputy head of the Greens and a Leeds councillor, was attacked with bottles while with his family last week on Cromer beach in Norfolk, and racist abuse was hurled at them. He said that Reform rhetoric wascausing people to blameimmigrants and non-white people for Britain’s problems.As immigration powered the Brexit campaign, surely the most shocking Brexit failure for his supporters must be therise in immigrationthat followed. No wonder Farage never mentions Brexit now that its disastrous effects havestruck homewith most voters: Bregret grips 61%, who say leaving was more of a failure than success, only 31% still say leaving was right, while 56% think it was wrong to vote to leave the EU. Who do they blame? The Conservatives and Boris Johnson top the list, with more than two-thirds (67%) blaming Nigel Farage, the Ukip outsider who captured the Tory party.After the greatBrexitfailure, Farage and the Tories turn instead to leaving the European convention on human rights (EHCR), blamed for small boat arrivals of undocumented migrants. Escape from the convention is the new “take back control”. “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me” should be the warning to all who were taken in by the snake oil last time from Farage and Johnson, both life-long charlatans and deceivers. As was the case with Brexit, leaving the ECHR sounds simple: just quit and deport the migrants to anywhere.Leave aside moral and human rights questions, which are unlikely to influence Reform backers. Instead, confront them with the brutal facts about what leaving the ECHR means. This would be Brexit with knobs on, bringing yet worse damage to Britain and its economy. Leaving the EHCRwould jeopardisethe Brexit trade and cooperation agreement with the EU, as EHCR membership is a requirement of that partnership. This could project us into the “no deal” Johnson originally threatened. It is likely to mean sky-high tariffs and steep border barriers.As it is, the minimalist existing trade agreement led to thisOffice for Budget Responsibility assessment: “Our forecasts have assumed that the volume of UK imports and exports will both be 15% lower than if we had remained in the EU.” That 15% loss in trade “will lead to a 4% reduction in the potential productivity of the UK economy”. Now Farage and the Tories want to double down on that disaster.Catherine Barnard, professor of European law at Cambridge University, warns of all the consequences: it would immediately end the better deals being negotiated, such as easy animal and plant trade, she tells me. Food prices would rise, so would inflation, as trade falls. The Good Friday agreement would fall apart overnight: the ECHR runs through it “as in a stick of rock”, as with every EU agreement. (Farage admits he would have torenegotiate the agreement: good luck.) Outrage in Ireland at the fallout would ensure the EU took its revenge. Forget data exchange on crime or extradition of criminals.France would be among the most indignant: any assistance in preventing small boats would be stopped. In fact, as Barnard writes, leaving the ECHR would do nothing at all to aid deportations of migrants. The 1951 refugee convention is the one that bans “refoulement”, sending asylum seekers back to dangerous countries. But leaving that would, says Prof Barnard, have all the same political and trade consequences with the EU as leaving the ECHR.Pariah Britain even further out in the cold, divorced from its democratic allies and falling further behind them economically: that’s the exciting offer from Farage and the Tories, and it won’t even “stop the boats”.But “nothing can be done” is no answer, when people in every country feel their borders should be secure, delineating who belongs, who pays tax and who shares the public benefits. Rising numbers of small boat arrivals, which makes up only atiny proportion of total immigration, undermine the case for welcoming all the people we need to encourage here to build 1.5m homes, keep the NHS and social care on its feet, fund our universities, spur on our life-sciences and much more.Right across Europe, governments face the same dilemmas, the anti-immigrant right riding the wave. But there are moves to reform both the ECHR and the refugee convention, with nine EU leaderswriting a lettercalling for “reinterpretation”. The two leading signatories are the rightwing Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and Denmark’s Social Democrat prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. They call for making it easier to deport foreign criminals, which Barnard sees as a significant step towards change.A Europe-wide collaboration on rethinking asylum looks possible. Few think a 1951 convention designed for escaping political refugees was meant to cover everyone globally from any war-torn or poverty-stricken dictatorship in an era of easy travel. Nor does it make moral sense to rescue only those with the money to get to Europe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s impossible to imagine them working collaboratively with the EU on anything, let alone a complex rethinking of these conventions, as they protest that any Labour deal is sneaking us into the EU by the back door.At prime minister’s questions, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, asked: “Will the prime minister categorically rule out withdrawing from the ECHR or suspending it or watering down our rights in any way?” The PM replied: “We will not withdraw from the ECHR,” but added, “we do need to make sure both the law and other instruments fit the circumstances we face”. Yes indeed. But that can only be done by agreement. Labour needs to get on the front foot against Farage and the Tories. No better way than hammering home the damage their Brexit did, and how quitting the ECHR would bring us new kinds of hell.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageImmigration and asylumRaceBrexitEuropean court of human rightsEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

Between 2016 and 2022, the sheep population on the island of Cretemore than doubled. Or so claim Greek state records, which, over a similar period, reveal other curious trends across the country. The slopes of Mount Olympus are said to beswaddled with banana plantations, high-security military airports have beenturned over to olive trees, and pasture for goats and lambs nowextends off the landand out into the crystalline depths of the surrounding seas.All these claims are as ludicrous as they are lucrative, and they point to an embarrassing scandal that is roiling Greek politics: the revelation that for years, enormous sums of EU funds were being pocketed by individuals claiming them as subsidies for agricultural work that did not exist.Athird of the EU budget, more than is allocated to education and welfare and renewable energy combined, goes to subsidising the agriculture of member states. The more animals there are, the more land is allotted to them to graze – and the more cash gets distributed. In Greece, farming subsidies are dispersed from Brussels to the tune of€2bn a year, equivalent to about a quarter of the country’s wildly bloatedannual military budget.On the face of it, this emerging OPEKEPE scandal – taking its name from the acronym of the Greek state agency that oversaw the allocation of European farming subsidies – could be regarded as an act of revenge. A decade afteran economic crisis in which European technocrats imposed humiliating austerity measures on the Greek working class, havewily Cretan farmers started conjuring up millions of imaginary sheep and swindling back cash from Brussels?It’s a tempting interpretation, but it’s not the story here. In reality, OPEKEPE is looking like a con conducted at the behest of the same political elite that landed Greece in such catastrophic financial waters to begin with. A European investigation into OPEKEPE, begun in 2020 and carried out by the Luxembourg-based European public prosecutor’s office (Eppo), is alleging a cash grab that may have been “organised in a systematic manner” across the state.View image in fullscreenGreek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis delivers a speech during a debate on the no-confidence motion against the government, Athens, 7 March 2025.Photograph: Alexandros Beltes/EPAStarting possibly as far back as 1998, but appearing to ramp up with the election of the right-wing New Democracy party in 2019, Greece’s agricultural balance sheet was distorted. Auditorswere reportedly elbowed asideas plots of new farmland were registered to one individual one year, then transferred – on paper – to another the next. Crete was statistically tweaked into possessing half of Greece’s sheep, even as it became difficult to explain how they were producingless than a 10thof the country’s sheep milk. Bee populationsmore than doubledon islands raging with fires or parched by drought. Two Greek former ministers are alleged to have spent years “aiding and instigating the misappropriation” of EU agricultural funds.So many thousands of fraudulent or exaggerated claims now prompt unavoidable questions. Wheredid the money go? Who benefited? An investigation continues under Laura Codruța Kövesi, the head of Eppo, who endeared herself to Brussels when she was chief prosecutor of Romania’s national anti-corruption directorate by taking a blunt hatchet to her country’s political class,locking up hundreds of Romaniansin the most sweeping anti-corruption drive in recent European memory.It is evident already that the ruling New Democracy party – the dynastic old machine of the Greek right – is deeply involved. Thirteen of its MPshave been implicatedin OPEKEPE’s deceptions (as have a Pasok MP and a Syriza MP). A cabinet minister and four deputies have beenforced to resign. For his part, the prime minister and New Democracy leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has said he has “nothing to hide” andvowed to getto the bottom of the scandal, though he nowbalks at the ideaof a full-scale parliamentary investigation. He personallyreceived EU agricultural subsidiesfrom 2014 to 2021. (A government spokesperson has defended Mitsotakis’s actions, saying that he was under no obligation to give up his historical right to the funding and that “what applies to every landowner applies to him as well”.)“Who are you kidding, Mr Mitsotakis?” Nikos Androulakis, the president of the Pasok opposition,asked in Greece’s parliamentlast month. “Mr Mitsotakis is either complicit,” said Syrizain a party statement, “or being blackmailed by his ministers.”View image in fullscreenA snow-covered Mount Olympus – home to banana plantations, according to Greek state records.Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyThe scandal has also pulled back the curtain to reveal how power in Greece operates. Three OPEKEPE heads who questioned financial irregularities were reportedly tossed out, one after heattempted to blocksome 3,500 suspect subsidy applications, another afterblocking 9,000 payments. Wiretaps conducted by European authorities recorded officials who feared concerns being raised yet insisted on fraudulent payments being waved through anyway. As European inspectors arrived in Crete, farmers were reportedlywarned in advanceand ordered to shift herds around to keep up appearances. Flushing the island with European subsidy cash appears to have made a considerable chunk of its voting bloc happy. This was the point, Mitsotakis’s opponentshave argued. Indeed, in one of the more seismic realignments of the Greek political landscape of late, Crete – a former leftist stronghold – flipped to New Democracy in 2023. (The government’sspokesperson said: “The connection between the fraudsters under investigation and any change in the election result is unrealistic, a product of science fiction.”)Let’s call this scandal what it is: one more financial blow for which Greek taxpayers will again foot the bill. The fine already exacted by Brussels,approximately €415m, will be offloaded on to what has become the EU’smost overworkedyetthird-worst-paidcitizenry; to meet it, the equivalent of all 10 million Greeks would have to labour eight hours each at the country’s minimum wage. More fines are expected in the coming months as Kövesi’s investigation widens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He talks of technocratic overhaul, a “new Greece”, a land airlifted out of the depths of financial destruction and managerial chaos. But crisis after crisis unfurls every contradiction in these assurances. In 2022, his nephew wasforced to step downas general secretary amid the exposure of a ridiculous spyware operation – only for talk to begin of himreturning to his uncle’s officetwo years later. In 2023, Mitsotakis’s minister of infrastructure and transport resignedfollowing a train crashin which 57 people were killed after safety warnings over Greece’s rail system were ignored – only for him to slip back into his former parliamentary seat once the uproar of mass outrage had begun to subside.Such scandals are treated like inconvenient public-relations dust-ups in which the problem isn’t a political class that cycles in and out of office with impunity but Greeks who demand consequences of those who lecture about accountability.Greece is already a place where the narrative of resplendent new prosperity – an emergent tech hub booming with foreign investment–has proven illusory for most. But increasingly it threatens to devolve into something else: a place where the people are told the corruption that keeps devastating their finances and their trust is just one more figment of the imagination.Alexander Clapp is a journalist based in AthensDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

First, she screamed so loudly her boyfriend thought someone had died. Then she wondered aloud to him: “When’s it going to happen for us?”“It would be fun to be engaged with her at the same time,” O’Connor said. “I’ve been showing my boyfriend photos of the ring and saying how unique it is. That’s not my style, but we talk about what I might like.”Whatever [Swift] chooses to wear is going to set a huge tone for the next couple of yearsElisabeth Kramer, wedding coordinatorO’Connor is not the only one. Swift’s Instagram announcement – a photo in which she and Kelce embrace in front of an elaborate floral arrangement – raked in more than 1m likes in less than 10 minutes; it’s now up to 36m. “We needed this,” read oneVogue editorial. New York Times columnist and chick lit author Jennifer Weineragreed: “Maybe love still wins.”On social media, fans spoke of the news with parasocial investment.

But she is banking on some trends emerging from it. “I definitely see it being part of the conversation for my 2026 clients,” Kramer said. “Whatever she chooses to wear is going to set a huge tone for the next couple of years.”Swift’s engagement may be a boon for the wedding industry, which saw a post-Covid boom that is slowing down amid inflation and the current economic climate. (One survey found thatfewer Americansare planning to have weddings this year, down from 7% in 2024 to 4% in 2025.) “I’m hearing from a lot of vendors that 2026 is going to be a lot quieter, with people more hesitant to spend money,” Kramer said. “I’m interested to see how a Taylor-Travis engagement changes that. Maybe people see them getting engaged and think: ‘This is an OK thing to do.’”A Taylor-made proposal: what Swift and Kelce’s engagement pictures sayRead moreCelebrity weddings encourage copycat brides, especially when it comes to dresses. Princess Diana’s taffeta wedding gown inspired countless dupes. Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy’s sexy, simple bias-cut dress defined 90s sleekness, while Kate Middleton’s lace Alexander McQueen frock brought back bridal sleeves.Julie Sabatino, founder of the wedding styling company The Stylish Bride, predicts that Swift’s pick might join the ranks. “She’s no stranger to a gown,” Sabino said, alluding to the series of ballgowns Swift donned for her Eras tour. “I wouldn’t say the ballgown wedding dress has ever gone out of style, but maybe people who wouldn’t have considered it will now.”O’Connor, the wannabe bride, said that Swift’s engagement has become “a new joke” between her and her boyfriend, as the pair makes light of their unmarried status. But for now, she is not holding her breath. “We just have a lot going on at the moment,” O’Connor said. “But she’s definitely planted a little extra seed.”Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftTravis KelceKansas City ChiefsNFLWeddingsWedding dressesUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 15 biggest South Park scandals … rankedAfter 28 years of scandal, Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s eviscerations of Donald Trump are some of their greatest work. We rate their most explosive storylines … from ruining Ed Sheeran’s life to episodes banned to this dayMichael HoganFri 5 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareIt has been hailed as the most important TV show of the second Trump presidency. It’s currently in the form of its life and clocking up record ratings. Not bad for a cartoon about four potty-mouthed Colorado schoolboys.NSFW sitcom South Park might have been been on air since 1997, but it has never been more relevant. In an era when satirical talkshows are being axed, Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s creation fulfils a vital function as it mercilessly mocks both sides of the political spectrum. Written and made the week of transmission, it has been able to incorporate topical stories and hold power to account. No wonder parent company Paramount recentlywon a $1.5bn bidding warfor a five-year, 50-episode deal.South Park’s no-holds-barred approach to hot-button issues has made it the most controversial American comedy of all time, animated or not. Here’s our potted history of its scandals, rated in order of explosiveness.15. Meghan and Harry’s privacy pleas (2023)View image in fullscreenThe Worldwide Privacy Tour, 2023.Photograph: Comedy CentralRoyal feathers were ruffled by this slice of Sussex baiting. The Prince of Canada and his wife embark on a “Worldwide Privacy Tour”. When their private jet lands in South Park, they wave “Stop looking at us!” placards. The prince plugs his tell-all memoir, titled Waaagh, with monarchy-bashing interviews. Described in the episode as “sorority girl, actress, influencer, victim”, Meghan Markle was reportedly “upset and overwhelmed”. Rumours swirled that the pair were planning legal action. A spokesperson dismissed this as “baseless, boring nonsense”. Bit rude.Donald Trump is having a lovechild with Satan: South Park sets up future chaosRead more14. Steve Irwin’s fishy fate (2006)When Satan throws a Halloween party in Hollywood, Australian naturalist Steve Irwin is among the celebrity guests. The croc-hunting cult hero was depicted with a stingray barb through his chest, having died in that manner just two months before broadcast. Fans slated it as “grossly insensitive timing”. Irwin’s widow Terri said she was “devastated by Steve being mocked in such a cruel way”, worrying that their children could one day see it.13. The ‘kick a ginger’ craze (2005)View image in fullscreenGinger Kids, 2005.Photograph: Comedy CentralHitler allegory Ginger Kids sees Cartman wage war on red-haired people. When Kyle tricks him into thinking he’s caught “gingervitis”, Cartman switches sides and rallies them to rise up as a master race. Cue real-life controversy when the storyline inspired the infamous “National Kick a Ginger Day” meme. Actual violent attacks included one treated as a hate crime in Canada and bullying at a Rotherham school. Copper-topped troubadour Ed Sheeran joked that the episode “ruined my life”.12. Isaac Hayes’s resurrection (2006)View image in fullscreenIsaac Hayes in The Return of Chef, 2006.Photograph: Comedy CentralSoul legend Isaac Hayes voiced Chef for nearly a decade, serving up home-spun wisdom and crooning about chocolate salty balls. Following the Trapped in the Closet episode (more of which shortly), the Scientologist singer resigned in protest. In retaliation, the next season sees Chef return to South Park after travelling the world with the cult-like “Super Adventure Club”, which brainwashes members into child abuse. Chef’s dialogue was spliced from old episodes, hence the uneasy spectacle of Hayes singing about “making love” to the kids, before soiling himself. Poignantly, Hayes’s sonlater claimedthat his entourage made the decision to quit on Hayes’s behalf, with the man himself unable to speak after a stroke.11. Holy inappropriate (2005)Religion is one of the show’s regular targets, and the Bloody Mary episode was particularly inflammatory. When a statue of the Virgin Mary begins “bleeding out its ass”, the pope dispatches a cardinal to decide if it qualifies as a miracle. Catholic campaign groups in the US, New Zealand and Australia declared it “disgusting”, demanded apologies and unsuccessfully lobbied for it never to be rerun.10. King of pop dethroned (2004)View image in fullscreenMichael Jackson in The Jeffersons, 2004.Photograph: Comedy CentralFive years before his death, Michael Jackson got the South Park treatment. When eccentric millionaire Mr Jefferson moves into a local mansion with a funfair in the garden, the kids investigate whether he is a child abuser or the victim of society’s prejudice against rich Black men. When caught sleeping in Stan’s bed, Jefferson pays off his parents to keep quiet. He dresses as Peter Pan, dangles his son over a balcony and at one point his surgery-addled face falls off. Subtle.9. Great brawl of China (2019)Having already rattled China’s cage with its depiction of the Dalai Lama and deliberate deployment of Asian stereotypes, the episode named Band in China proved the last straw. It took aim at Hollywood’s expansion into the lucrative Chinese market, despite the country’s strict censorship and repressive political regime. Mickey Mouse’s presence made it clear that Disney was one target. In response, the Chinese government banned the show entirely – scrubbing it from streaming and social media platforms – which only proved Parker and Stone’s point. The unrepentant pair issued asarcastic apology, comparing President Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh and saying: “We too love money more than freedom and democracy … We good now, China?”8. Green around the gills (2006)View image in fullscreenAl Gore gets an apology in the episode Time to Get Cereal, 2018.Photograph: Comedy CentralSouth Park has repeatedly mocked the concept of climate change. Its denialism peaked with ManBearPig, in which Al Gore lectures children about a mysterious new environmental threat: a cryptid described as “half man, half bear, half pig”. The show was slammed as “irresponsible” for equating eco-warnings with scares about mythical monsters. Twelve years later, it reverse-ferreted by having the boys realise that ManBearPig actually did exist and grudgingly apologise to Gore. “Time to get cereal”, indeed.7. Toilet humour (2001)The fifth season opened with the profanity-packed It Hits the Fan. When a character says “shit” on a TV cop drama called, well, Cop Drama, it normalises the swearword. This brings on a plague that makes citizens vomit up their intestines, while awakening the ancient Knights of Standards and Practices. The episode parodied CBS medical soap Chicago Hope, which broke ground two years before by having actor Mark Harmon say “shit” for the first time on network TV. South Park went way further, dropping the s-bomb 162 times, averaging once every eight seconds – handily totted up by an onscreen counter. Comedy Central received 5,000 complaints.6. If you tolerate this … (2002)View image in fullscreenThe Death Camp of Tolerance, 2002.Photograph: Comedy CentralMany rate The Death Camp of Tolerance as one of the all-time great episodes. In a typically outrageous storyline, teacher Mr Garrison tries to get himself sacked for being gay so he can launch a $25m anti-discrimination lawsuit. When he inserts Lemmiwinks the class gerbil somewhere intimate, pupils protest. Paranoid they are homophobic, parents send them to Tolerance Camp, where Nazi-esque guards force them to draw pictures of “people of all colours and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow”. Lemmiwinks’s journey through Mr Slave’s rectum became a Hobbit spoof. You shall not pass.5. Slur causes a stir (2007)Inspired by Seinfeld star Michael “Kramer” Richards’s offensive outburst the previous year, With Apologies to Jesse Jackson satirises both racism and meaningless mea culpas which fail to address the underlying issues. When Stan’s father Randy uses the N-word on Wheel of Fortune, a national scandal erupts. Seeking forgiveness, Randy kisses the backside of Rev Jesse Jackson, AKA “the Emperor of Black People”. The uncensored epithet is uttered 42 times. Black communities and civil rights organisations praised this nuanced take on hate speech.4. Too cruel for school (2018)Season 22 begins with gunfire ringing out at South Park Elementary. Yet the staff and students calmly carry on as if school massacres are an everyday event – because in the US they are. As metal detectors are installed and hall monitors armed with rifles, authorities still fail to address the root cause. It aired soon after similar shootings in Parkland and Santa Fe claimed 27 lives. As a takedown of desensitisation to gun violence, the daringly dark Dead Kids was incendiary stuff.3. In bed with Satan (2025)View image in fullscreenSermon on the Mount, 2025.Photograph: Comedy CentralThis summer’s season premiere came out swinging with Sermon on the Mount, satirising Trump’s attacks on free speech by having the president sue the entire town of South Park. Biting the hand that feeds, it also lampooned Paramount’s capitulation to him. He is painted as a predatory tyrant, overcompensating for his micropenis. He hops into bed with Satan, who lambasts Trump about the Epstein files. It sparked a Maga-hatted backlash, while the furious White House said the show “hadn’t been relevant for 20 years”. Itdoubled downa week later with savage anti-deportation episodeGot a Nut, telling conservative critics to “#eatabagofdicks”.2. Hubbard in the cupboard (2005)View image in fullscreenTrapped in the Closet, 2005.Photograph: Comedy CentralSouth Park’s most notorious instalment, Trapped in the Closet, uses the ludicrous R Kelly opus to take aim at A-list Thetans Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Scientology is skewered as “a big fat global scam”, and it animates in unsparing detail the alien lore at the heart of L Ron Hubbard’s religion – accompanied by the onscreen caption “THIS IS WHAT SCIENTOLOGISTS ACTUALLY BELIEVE”. Because the church is so litigious, everyone who worked on the episode is credited as John or Jane Smith. Conspiracy theories abounded that transmission was delayed at Cruise’s behest to avoid overshadowing Mission: Impossible III (also produced by South Park’s parent company Paramount). What’s beyond dispute is that Parker and Stone threatened to quit if it wasn’t aired. Hail Xenu!1. Prophet and loss (2006)View image in fullscreenThe episode 200, 2010.Photograph: Comedy CentralPotshots at Mormonism and Catholicism caused a kerfuffle but were a storm in a teacup compared to Cartoon Wars. With Islamist extremists increasingly angered by satirical depictions of the prophet Muhammad, South Park weighed in. When citizens hear that rival series Family Guy is breaking the taboo, they literally buried their heads in the sand to avoid seeing it. The boys embark on a mission to get the episode pulled – Kyle because he fears terrorist reprisals, Cartman because he just hates Family Guy. Paramount censored the scenes anyway, covering them with a black title card, citing concerns for public safety. Parker and Stone condemned the move as hypocritical. When they revisited the topic in 2010, mentions of Muhammad were bleeped out, as was Kyle’s closing speech about the perils of giving in to violent threats. A radical Muslim blogger still wrote that he prayed for Allah to kill the show’s creators and “burn them in Hell for all eternity”. The Simpsons’ next chalkboard gag saw Bart write: “South Park, We’d Stand Beside You If We Weren’t So Scared”. The episodes remain banned on streaming services to this day.South Park streams on Paramount+ onWednesdays in the US andThursdaysin the UK.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionAnimation on TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year was no exception: stars including Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Jude Law and George Clooney dutifully waved from canals and trooped down red carpets (although Law tripped while on a water taxi and Clooney got ill).But the films themselves struck a different note. Jury president Alexander Payne may have rebutted questions about current affairs during his opening press conference, declaring himself concerned only with discussing cinema, but cinema at Venice this year was concerned largely, it turned out, with discussing current events.The big hits of the festival were both nailbiting ticking-clock stories – directed by women – that tackled real-world situations of such tragedy and magnitude that many people shy from discussing them, let alone make a movie about them.Towards the end of the festival,The Voice of Hind Rajab, Kaouther Ben Hania’s dramatisation of the killing by the Israel Defense Forces of a five-year-old girl in Gaza, earned a 23-minute standing ovation, as well as chants around the auditorium of “Free Palestine”.The film uses the real audio of Rajab’s phone call with emergency call handlers, where she pleads to be rescued from the car in which she was trapped after Israeli tank fire killed the family members around her. During the January 2024 incident, the ambulance sent to reach Rajab also came under attack and the two paramedics on board were killed. Rajab’s body, as well as those of her relatives and the paramedics were found 12 days later.Speaking in Venice, Ben Hania said: “I just felt I had to do something, so I wasn’t complicit. I have no political power. I’m not an activist. All I have is this one tool that I have mastered a little bit – cinema. At least, with this film, I wasn’t silenced.”View image in fullscreen‘The film is an invitation to decide what to do about all these weapons’ … from left: Idris Elba, Kathryn Bigelow and Rebecca Ferguson at a photocall for A House of Dynamite.Photograph: Riccardo Antimiani/EPAMeanwhile, Kathryn Bigelow’s first film in eight years,A House of Dynamite, put audiences repeatedly through the 18 minute period from the launch of a nuclear strike on the US until its landing, from the point of view of, variously, a soldier, military leader and the president (played by Idris Elba). Bigelow said she had made the film in an desperate attempt to kickstart conversations about a nuclear treaty.“The film is an invitation to decide what to do about all these weapons,” she said. “How is annihilating the world a good defensive measure?”Elsewhere, the evidence mounted that cinema is increasingly acting as a quasi-urgent response unit to help audiences interpret a chaotic world. Yorgos Lanthimos’s latest,Bugonia, stars Emma Stone as a high-powered executive kidnapped by conspiracy theorists convinced she is an alien intent on destroying Earth. Confirming the film as an allegory for inertia over tackling a climate catastrophe, its director said: “Humanity is facing a reckoning very soon. People need to choose the right path, otherwise, I don’t know how much time [we have] left.”Meanwhile,No Other Choice, the latest from Oldboy’s Park Chan-wook, was a satire about a long-serving employee fired from his role in a manufacturing plant who feels forced to eliminate all competitors for a future post. “We all harbour that deep fear of employment insecurity,” said Park. “Anyone who’s out there trying to make a living in the current modern capitalist society.”View image in fullscreenPlaying Vladimir Putin … Jude Law and Paul Dano in The Wizard of the Kremlin.Photograph: Carole BethuelGuillermo del Toro’sFrankensteinengaged with the ethics of AI,though he claimed otherwise, and Law was in town playing Vladimir Putin in Olivier Assayas’sThe Wizard of the Kremlin. While Law sought to downplay the film’s contemporary relevance, his director was less abashed, declaring: “The film is very much about how modern politics, 21st-century politics, was invented, and part of that evil raised from the rise to power of Vladimir Putin in Russia.”Such eagerness by film-makers for direct political engagement appears unlikely to wane. Announcing their lineup on Friday, the San Sebastián film festival director also issued a long statement calling for end to the “genocide … the unimaginable massacres to which the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is subjecting the Palestinian people.”Meanwhile in London on Wednesday evening, Hugh Bonneville took an ITV reporter by surprise when he began his comments on the red carpet by saying: “What’s about to happen inGazaCity is indefensible. The international community must do more to bring it to an end.” He then continued: “Downton Abbey’s a lovely film.”Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalFestivalsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warKathryn BigelownewsShareReuse this content"

Singer Brett Anderson suggests that if 2022’s Autofiction – their best post-reunion album until now – was their punk album, Antidepressants is its post-punk sibling. Influences such as Magazine, Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees feed into edgier but otherwise trademarkSuedeguitar anthems. Helmed again by longtime producer Ed Buller, Richard Oakes’s killer riffs maraud and jostle, Anderson’s moods run the gamut from impassioned to reflective and the rhythm section brew up a right old stomp.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for AntidepressantsThe 57-year-old singer has spoken about his keenness to not be seen as a heritage act and to attract younger audiences. Antidepressants is no throwback. It’s thoroughly postmodern. The eerie background noises and sonic atmospheres chime perfectly with Anderson’s lyrics about what he calls “tensions of modern life, the paranoia, the anxiety, the neurosis” as the band extol the virtues of connection in a dislocated world.Glorious openerDisintegrateinvites us to embrace mortality and decay (“Come down and disintegrate with me”). Other songs reflect from a midlife perspective on subjects such as humanity’s transient beauty, breakdowns, toxic relationships or societal dependence on medication. There’s a darker energy altogether on the funereal June Rain, a “vignette of a damaged person” in which Anderson, in character, desperately but movingly concludes: “So I close my eyes and walk into the traffic flow.” Great 10th albums by any artist are rare jewels indeed, but this is a late career triumph.Explore more on these topicsSuedePop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

It involves a “gnarly” eight-floor apartment block on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, a rooftop party turned sing-off and a debut show at Brooklyn’s coolest bar. So it’s mildly disappointing to discover that only one member of the trio still calls the Big Apple home.“I’m the last one standing,” Sabrina Cunningham confirms as she appears on Zoom, calling from her home in Brooklyn. She’s followed by Nya Gazelle Brown, who completed the band’s recent European tour, including a sold-out show at north London’s 3,000-capacity Roundhouse, while seven months pregnant. “I moved to Maryland over Covid,” Brown says. “I needed to stretch out and I wanted to be around family.” The last to arrive is London-born Piya Malik, who now lives in Los Angeles. “We are just very nomadic,” she says.It was in LA that the band recorded their forthcoming third album, Cut & Rewind, which finesses their unique blend of psych-tinged 70s disco, 80s post-punk and hypnotic three-part harmonies. While their influences – they cite Minnie Riperton, Liquid Liquid, ESG and the Lijadu Sisters as inspirations for the new album – and old-school recording techniques (everything is painstakingly put to tape alongside backing band Orgone) suggest a retro fantasia, their lyrical themes are firmly rooted in the present. “We’re not singing olde worlde stories,” says Malik, by far the chattiest of the trio. In fact, recording sessions for Cut & Rewind, which was created in the gaps between touring, were often a means of collective purging: “It’s all of us together in the room, feeding off of each other’s energy, exchanging ideas, melodies, sounds and politics,” Malik continues. “Bringing humour into the most sordid dark stories of the internet.”On the shimmery Norma, taken from 2023’s critically acclaimed second album Silver, they rail against the 2022 overturning of the Roe v Wade ruling, while new song She Who Dares opens by imagining a not-too-distant Handmaid’s Tale-style dystopia in which “six hundred thousand women” will be imprisoned for “speaking out of turn” among other “crimes”. The pain is couched in strutting vintage funk and R&B, and by the chorus the song morphs into an anthem “about really empowering other women”, says Cunningham. “It’s like the ones who care are everywhere if you look for them.”Disco Life, meanwhile, turns the 1979 Disco Demolition Night – a publicity stunt turned riot at Comiskey Park stadium in Chicago, in which records by predominantly Black and queer artists were burned – into a celebration of the titular genre. (Such is their love for disco that their name is a play on Chic’s single C’est Chic, while asurprise message from Nile Rodgersduring an appearance on a CBS morning TV show last year reduced the band to tears.)Keen not to be defined purely as an “issues” band – “You can’t think about and dwell on [the state of the world] 24/7,” says Brown – they are also aware that Say She She’s very existence makes its own statement. “Just being who we are is political,” says Malik, who left a job working with the former Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas to move to New York in 2013 because she couldn’t face another Tory government. “We’re women of diverse backgrounds and women have always been political because there’s never been a time where it hasn’t been contentious to be a woman or a femme. But, no matter what’s going on, we have to push ourselves to remind people of the beauty in this world, too. Music is medicine and we want to contribute to the medicine cabinet.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re not going to be invisible’ … Say She She.Photograph: Shane McCauleyThe trio bonded over the love of music and a penchant for sharing that love publicly. Having moved to Manhattan from upstate New York straight from graduating high school, Cunningham was in “a bunch of bands, singing back-up [and] singing with friends”. Living above her – in that gnarly eight-floor apartment building – was Malik, who could often be heard not only stomping around at 2am but also singing. The pair became fast friends (“She probably thought: ‘I’m gonna make friends with her so I can tell her to change her shoes,’” laughs Malik), often watching each other perform in their respective bands across the city. Malik then introduced Cunningham to Brown, whom she’d met at a Brooklyn house party that ended with the two of them harmonising on a rooftop.Music is medicine and we want to contribute to the medicine cabinet“Piyawalked in all cool with her British style,” remembers Brown, “and I was just like: ‘Who are you?’ Within seconds we were singing at each other. Then it went to singing at each other out at brunch or, you know, anywhere.”Say She She’s official formation was stalled slightly by the fact that each member was finishing other projects. They also didn’t have any of their own songs. Not that it stopped Malik, who signed them up for their first gig at Barbès, a cool musician hangout in Brooklyn, in 2018. “We hadn’t quite convinced Nya to join the band yet,” explains Malik. “She was working on solo stuff and we were like: ‘Come on you can do it.’”They got a third singer to fill the gap, meaning Brown was in the audience to watch her soon-to-be band’s debut gig. She was also being watched herself. In the crowd to catch brass experimentalist headliners SlavicSoulParty! was a certain Robert Plant. “Obviously, he wasn’t there to see us,” laughs Malik. “No one knew who the hell we were. And he was definitely staring at Nya the whole way through the show.”From there, the band recorded a clutch of songs during the pandemic that would eventually emerge in 2022 as their more lo-fi and soft-focus debut album,Prism, in 2022. A year later came the richer Silver, which earned them an appearance on Later … With Jools Holland, five-star reviews and a reputation as a live tour-de-force. Malik remembers a moment performing Norma during an all-ages show in the US in front of “a sea of girls and it was just so amazing to see all these young teenagers screaming and shouting the lyrics with us”. The show at the Roundhouse was also a big moment, especially for Malik, who went to school not far from the venue in Camden Town. “It was life-changing,” she says.Malik’s smile suddenly fades. While the shows were a success, she claims they didn’t make any money from the tour and “had to pay all the expenses”. She says they were reticent about bringing it up, fearing the negativity would distract from the music, but she’s clearly fed up. “The things that have happened to us in the music business are shocking and it’s important that people realise it’s happening from all angles.”With this album, Say She She are keen to put themselves out there more and more, be it in interviews, or in how their art is presented. While the cover art for their first two albums featured abstract images, Cut & Rewind is adorned by a photograph of the trio in stylish power suits staring down the camera. “When we started, we were conscious of being women who were trying to use our bodies, or our sexuality, or our identity, to push something,” Malik explains. “We didn’t want to be objectified – we wanted to be taken seriously as artists.” But it also felt like hiding, something Say She She will not do. “Now it feels political. Now it’s like: ‘Hey, we’re not going to be invisible.’” The band nod in unison, that New York confidence never far from the surface.Cut & Rewind is released by drink sum wtr on 3 October. Say She She tour the UK and Ireland from 21 to 26 November; tour starts Oxford.Explore more on these topicsMusicDiscoSoulDance musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Our writer smells the gloveFri 5 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 11.22 EDTShareSpinal Tap are remembering the old days. It was 1966, and the young beat group from Squatney in east London – still, at that point, the Thamesmen – were honing their act in the tough clubs of the Benelux circuit. A young band from Britain could learn a lot, facing up to riotous crowds of Dutch, Flemings, Walloons and Luxembourgers. What lessons did Tap take from that year?“If you speak really loudly, it’s all right if you don’t have any of the local language,” says David St Hubbins, Tap’s leonine lead singer.“The Belgian beer is very good,” offers Nigel Tufnel, the lead guitarist who inspired legions. “And if you’ve had enough of them, you can pretty much speak the language.”And is it true what they say about women from Luxembourg?“The few women I met from Luxembourg, you’d do a gig and a girl comes up and says something to you, and you say something to her. And she says: ‘Not bloody likely,’” Tufnel says. “That’s mostly what it was.”“They’re not like the girls from Liechtenstein.” That’s Derek Smalls, bassist, pipe-smoker, vinegar expert, and enigma wrapped inside a riddle wrapped inside a moustache. “Don’t even talk about the girls from Liechtenstein.”“Well, there’s that Bertrand Russell quote about the Liechtenstein women,” Tufnel says. “But I can’t quote it, because it’s rude.”What a thrill it is to hear these three undersung pioneers of British rock back together again, albeit briefly. In 1984, Marty DiBergi’s documentary This Is Spinal Tap captured the band falling apart on a disastrous US tour, and somehow revived their flagging career. Now the film-maker and band have reunited, capturing the Tap reassembling for one final contractually obliged show in New Orleans, in Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.View image in fullscreen‘If there’s one thing that we brought to that film, it was a sort of senselessness’ … a scene from Marty DiBergi’s earlier movie of the band.Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/ShutterstockThe biggest shock is not that Tap reunited – Hope Faith, daughter of their former manager Ian, had the legal power to force them to do so – but that they allowed DiBergi to document it. The first film had painted them as buffoons – for years afterwards the band complained that he only showed the times they got lost on the way to the stage, never the times they made it. It seemed fitting that DiBergi’s own career should have stalled after his next film, Kramer vs Kramer vs Godzilla, and fitting, too, that it should take Tap to revive his dreams. But why let him back on board?“When Hope Faith came to us and told us we owed one more gig, we thought we might turn it into a piece of change, and the only director we knew personally was this man that we had decades of negotiations with to have both his name and ours removed from the first film,” St Hubbins says. “So we said: ‘Let’s give him a call.’”“Nobody else wanted to do it.” Smalls says. “We thought, after four decades, maybe he’s learned something.”He hasn’t, has he?“No, clearly.”This Is Spinal Tap inadvertently became a classic, not as a filmic equivalent of Ian Hunter’s Diary of a Rock’n’Roll Star – his account of touring the US with Mott the Hoople – but as a comedy. DiBergi’s knack – if he had one – was to miss all the moments of triumph and capture only the bathos. The film won Tap a huge new following – enough for them to headline arenas again, and play Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage – but the audience all believed they were watching comedians.“Listen,” St Hubbins says, “we’ve got their money and they can take away whatever they want. Hopefully, some merchandise.”People said This Is Spinal Tap had to have been faked, that no one is that vain, stupid and pretentious in real life. “Well, truth is stranger than fiction,” Tufnel says. “Fiction has to make sense. And if there’s one thing that we brought to that film, it was a sort of senselessness.”The film’s success meant Tap were in the peculiar situation of being far more popular in that follow-through part of their career, rather than when they were sitting on the creative throne itself, during the 1970s. Their popularity is in inverse proportion to the amount of music they record. Why did that happen?“I think the answer is two words: reverse magnetism,” Smalls says.And if you could use two more words to expand on that?“I’d say polar opposites. OK, it’s scientific. If you look at science – and it’s in all the books – people look at it and they say: ‘Look what it says here.’ Polar opposites, reverse magnetism. If you read what those mean, it will become clear to you.”Almost all Tap’s catalogue has been unavailable since release (at one point their then label, Megaphone, took legal action to prevent them making any music at all). From 1967’s Spinal Tap Sings (Listen to the) Flower People and Other Favourites to 1982’s Smell the Glove, the band made 11 studio albums (plus four rumoured unreleased records), two live albums, as well as Tufnel’s solo project Clam Caravan.Yet since 1984 all that has been available has been the soundtrack to the film, featuring a selection of songs from those albums, then 1992’s Break Like the Wind, a mixture of new tracks and re-recordings, then a similar melange on 2009’s Back from the Dead. The problem is that for nearly 50 years, ownership of Tap’s catalogue has been scattered. At one point it was owned by shadowy Iranian operatives, before Ian Faith faked his own death and distributed the songs around assorted faded celebrities, including Mario Andretti and Billie Jean King. Now, even if Tap wanted to rerelease the catalogue, they couldn’t find it to buy it back.View image in fullscreenElton John joins the band.Photograph: Bleecker Street & Authorized Spinal Tap LLCYet for hard rock fans, this is a tragedy. Because the sliver of music we have available tells us that Tap were among the greats of hard rock. Tonight I’m Going to Rock You (Tonight) is a riff to rival Whole Lotta Rosie; Stonehenge crams more ideas into its running time than Francis Ford Coppola did in 10 hours of Godfather films.The more anal obsess over the pioneering three-bass arrangement of 1970’s Big Bottom, but think instead of the ecstatic release of its chorus. The astonishing America lasts only three and a half minutes but seems to go on so much longer (“It feels like an hour,” observes Smalls). The 1992 single The Majesty of Rock is one of the greatest singles of its decade (St Hubbins says there might be some money in it for me if a mention of it gooses the streaming figures).When the first film came out, hard rock was critically disdained – John Paul Jones spoke of being untouchable after Led Zeppelin split; Black Sabbath were a shocking mess; AC/DC were regarded as troglodytes. Now all are seen as legends, and had Tap albums such as Intravenous de Milo, Brainhammer and Silent But Deadly been given the deluxe box set treatment, they might be seen as the equals of Physical Graffiti, Sabotage and Back in Black. Or at least the equals of In Through the Out Door, Headless Cross and Fly on the Wall.And, oh, to have seen the band in full flight in 1969, when they recorded the Silent But Deadly album live, the two-hour guitar tour de force Short and Sweet edited down to just under 19 minutes.“Silent But Deadly was an ironic title,” St Hubbins says. “Ironic because it was quite loud and no one was killed. I do remember one section, Nige, where you played the same note for seven minutes. It was remarkable: like an Andy Warhol film. You go, Thank God that’s over. But at the same time you feel edified.”While St Hubbins and Tufnel shredded, Smalls says: “I was trying to send messages with my mind: Play longer! Play shorter! Get off! I think it communicated. I don’t know. They would know.”With instrumental sections lasting two hours, audiences had the opportunity to really make an evening of it, the band recall. Fans would leave the venue for dinner, then return for the end of the set. “The one thing you don’t want is a hungry audience,” Smalls says. “So the fact they could go away and come back sated was crucial.”“Hail sated!” St Hubbins says.These days the threesome are scattered, but St Hubbins and Tufnel have known each other since infancy, when they were nextdoor neighbours in poverty-stricken Squatney. The area no longer exists – presumably written out of history in the 1974 local government reorganisation – but some detective work can reveal where it once was.The 1994 concert video The Return of Spinal Tap showed the pair returning to their old street, and in the background stood a pub called The Gun. That same pub is now a gastropub, and it is on the east of the Isle of Dogs (“However advertised as showing England v Sweden tonight for the women Euros. In reality an average-sized TV with no sound,” says Cameron on Tripadvisor).View image in fullscreen‘I was trying to send messages with my mind: Play longer! Play shorter! Get off! I think it communicated’ … the band on tour in Spinal Tap II.Photograph: AP“Gastro? What does that really mean except, you know, bad?” Tufnel asks.“Here’s a clue,” Smalls says. “Gastrointestinal. You want to eat in a pub that named itself after that? No.”“The entire north end of Squatney is a giant Sainsbury’s now,” St Hubbins says. “Whether that’s an improvement or not …”“But that tells you something,” Tufnel insists. “Because it’s not a Waitrose.”No, but it’s not Lidl or an Aldi.“And it’s not a Tesco either,” St Hubbins says. “It’s very specific.”Tap, it would be fair to say, are not the greatest communicators with either each other, or anyone else, a tone set by Tufnel and St Hubbins’ sparring. When did they realise, beneath the banter and the joshing, that there was a deep and genuine dislike between them?“It’s not a dislike!” Tufnel protests.“No, it’s an animus,” St Hubbins agrees. “I like to call it an animus or an enmity, just because they have more syllables.”Perhaps that failure to communicate led to one of Tap’s Born in the USA moments, when they – like Bruce Springsteen – had a song catastrophically misinterpreted. Bitch School, from Break Like the Wind, was widely and wrongly condemned for being sexist, portraying women as animals, just because people were too stupid and lazy to pay attention to the lyrics. The video was even banned from one of Australia’s smaller video channels.“You’ve hit upon it exactly: stupid and lazy,” Tufnel says. “It’s obvious what that song is about, and it’s so frustrating.”The real sadness is that the song is more necessary and relevant than ever: in an age of news stories about bully XLs and status dogs, we need pop songs that stress the need for canine training. “The real problem,” Smalls says, “is that they’re closing those songs because they’re running out of funds to teach bitches.”“There was a fourth verse, which was specifically about spaying and neutering,” St Hubbins says. “That might have made things even worse.”This Is Spinal Tap review – a glorious heavy-rock nightmare that was ahead of its timeRead moreI know where I think Tap stand in the British rock pantheon. But where do they think they rank, assuming the Beatles are No 1 and the Stones No 2?“Are you making a comparison to the Premier League and then going down from there?” Tufnel asks. “We might be in mid-League One. With the hope of moving up, but the assurance that you’re not going to go down to the Northern League. I’d say 77th.”“We’re standing on the shoulders of They Might Be Giants,” St Hubbins says.It’s great to have them back. Tonight they’re going to rock you (tonight).Spinal Tap II: The End Continues is out on 12 September in the US and UK, and on 25 September in Australia.

Couples took him at his word. Now, he’s turned the experience into an album and novelFri 5 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTShareOn a video call from his Gothenburg apartment, Jens Lekman is contemplating the 132 weddings at which he has performed. “When you play a normal show, everything follows a schedule. At a wedding, you never know if you’re going to get punched by someone’s uncle or go skinny dipping with the couple.” He pauses. “And that’s what I like: putting myself in weird, awkward situations.”These include passing out inside a large but poorly ventilated wedding cake. “It was a small wedding and a lot of stuff was DIY. It wasn’t fun to realise they had forgotten the air holes.” Or a man nearly dying on the dancefloor. “Yeah, that happened, too. But he made it.”You may know Lekman as the Swedish indie star whose forlorn love songs can simultaneously break your heart and make you laugh. You may not know that, ever since his 2004 song If You Ever Need a Stranger (To Sing at Your Wedding), he’s been taking requests to do just that. In the beginning, “it was just random people who had heard the song,” he says. But, after an Australian couple shared a video of him playing their wedding in 2013, he was suddenly inundated with requests: “I owe them a lot of gratitude.”View image in fullscreenInspirational … Jens Lekman says playing weddings helps his creativity.Photograph: Chris AlmeidaIn retrospect, he’s always been made for the job. Since the early 00s, Jekman has made records defined by wry yet kind-hearted observations about romance and heartbreak. He named his 2012 album I Know What Love Isn’t and, on To Know Your Mission, from 2017, Lekman tells us he just wants to listen to people’s stories. He says the weddings have only underscored this purpose: “I want to be of service to the people who the music means something to.”With streaming making it ever harder to make a living from music, playing weddings also became a way to get by financially, as well as providing inspiration for his own songwriting. Lekman recounts a story about the director, John Waters, getting picked up while hitchhiking through the Nevada desert. “What the hell are you doing out here?” the driver asked. Waters replied that it helped provide inspiration. “That’s what the weddings are for me,” Lekman says with a smile.His new album is called Songs for Other People’sWeddings, and comes with a novel of the same name written with David Levithan, author of books including Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist. They’ve been friends for 20 years; just before the pandemic, Lekman reached out with an idea for something about “my parallel career as a wedding singer”, having wondered whether it could be a TV show or musical.Levithan was all in. “The situation was so tantalising,” he says on the same call. “The idea of writing about these weddings from the point of view of the wedding singer was something I would never have thought of in a million years.”View image in fullscreenJens Lekman, right, playing at a wedding in Colorado in 2011.Photograph: Ben SwansonThe result is a “novel-with-songs” formed from what Lekman calls “a dialogue between me and David about love and relationships”. It tells the story of the romance between a wedding singer called J and his girlfriend V, through 10 weddings at which he performs. Lekman’s accompanying album imagines what happens in between the book’s chapters: he was inspired by albums with stories running through them, such as the Streets’ A Grand Don’t Come For Free and Frank Sinatra’s Watertown.The result is “purely fictional but, at the same time, emotionally very much both of ours”, as Levithan puts it. Given that it’s the story of a Swedish singer who plays weddings, it blurs art and life: “I love the confusion – and I don’t think there’s really any way around it,” Lekman says, though they decided to change the main character’s name to J: “In the first chapter I wrote, he was named Jens and that wastooconfusing,” says Levithan.It’s part of the fun in Lekman’s storytelling, wondering how autobiographical his hapless and hopeless romantics really are. Levithan says he explains Songs for Other People’s Weddings to friends as: “I’m writing somebody else’s autofiction.” Lekman, meanwhile, says it’s “definitely David’s story”, but admits Levithan “asked me for anecdotes – what it’s like to jump out of a wedding cake, for example”.Lekman was also able to channel the breakup he was going through at the time into tracks like Wedding in Leipzig – with its darkly droll lines, “So this is the singles table, these are my people / Does anyone have cyanide, a razor blade or a pistol?” The track, he says, “is about what it means to be alone. I’m 44 now, so that’s definitely something I thought a lot about during that time.”Working through these feelings and writing the songs made him consider his lifelong relationship with music. “I realised J was describing something to me that I hadn’t formulated for myself yet,” Lekman says. “I was at a point in my life where I was searching for purpose. In this era of streaming, music has become like a scented candle. And singing at weddings is reversing that for me. I began playing weddings because I just thought it was a fun, weird thing to do. And then I realised that these moments were the most important point in these people’s lives. You’re not the reason people are there. Your job is to be a midwife, delivering these people into the next phase of their lives. It was that connection that I was searching for.”One couple he “delivered” was Rich Thane and his wife, Grace Goddard, who both work in the music industry. “We’ve been mega fans for as long as we can remember,” says Thane, so having him play was “equal parts the most surreal and most natural thing in the world”. Watching on was “a mixture of our friends losing their minds and family members who had no idea who he was but were visibly thrilled it was happening. The entire room just shared in a collective joy.”This shared delight exemplifies Lekman’s purpose. Yet he’s surprised at how often people want to hear songs that don’t seem “suitable for a wedding, like Maple Leaves – these sad breakup songs. But they tell me they don’t just want a bunch of happy, lovey-dovey songs, they want the ones that acknowledge the other side of it. And I think they’re on to something.”David Byrne, Little Simz, Jasmine.4.t and more: the best music of autumn 2025Read moreAs a wedding singer, Lekman has seen all kinds of ceremonies. “It’s always fun to play at a billionaire’s wedding, when they come riding in on horses and there’s fireworks,” he says. “But I’ve always been really touched by the very simple ones where it’s, ‘Meet us at this hill at this very particular point which is important to us’, and it’s just a small gathering and a beautiful little ceremony.”In the novel’s dedications, Lekman says he hopes his presence at these occasions “turned out to be a blessing and not a curse”. The video for the album’s lead single, Candy from a Stranger, features footage from Lekman’s various wedding performances. “I got in touch with a lot of the couples. Of course, some have divorced, it’s been a long time,” he says. “But, percentage wise, it seems to have been a blessing.”The album Songs for Other People’s Weddings is released via Secretly Canadian on 12 September.

Duke it out with him in the galaxy’s most unexpected custody battle? Or tackle climate change and LGBTQ+ rights?Ben ChildFri 5 Sep 2025 06.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 5 Sep 2025 11.23 EDTShareIs tomorrow just another day, as the adage goes? Or is it suddenly a franchise-within-a-franchise, a special wing of the nascent DC Universe focused in hard on what all those nutty Kryptonian super-cousins have been up to? What we do know,thanks to studio boss James Gunnin aseries of social media splurts, is that Tomorrow is most definitely the future. Gunn has revealed that his follow-up to Superman will be titled Superman: Man of Tomorrow, due out in 2027. Now you might think you’ve heard the title before, and that would be because you have: next year sees the release of the already announced Supergirl, whichup until June was titled Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow.What are we to make of that title? In the comics, “Man of Tomorrow” has long been one of Superman’s many sobriquets, a hopeful tagline suggesting he represents the future rather than the past. It’s cropped up in everything from old radio serials to Alan Moore’s bittersweet Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? graphic novel, and even lent its name to a 2020 animated movie. It’s a phrase that carries the weight of the best part of a century of mythology. And yet given Gunn’s online spats with Trumpian anti-immigration types –hello Dean Cain!– over what the latter saw as Superman’s overly friendly attitude towards immigrants, it’s hard not to imagine the film-maker chuckling to himself at the new title’s liberal undertones.What else can we glean from Gunn’s announcement? Well, the title hints at hope and futurism; the concept art suggests a bald billionaire trying to punch his way to relevance. Somewhere between those two extremes probably lies Gunn’s film, but in the absence of anything solid to chew on, we’re in the realms of conjecture and wild-eyed fan theory.Some have suggested the “Tomorrow” in the title might not even refer toSupermanat all, but to Conner Kent – the broody Superboy clone who arrived after Superman “died” in the early-90s Death of Superman/Reign of the Supermen comic book arc, and is therefore often framed as representing the next generation of Krypto-heroism. Conner was later revealed as half Superman, half Lex Luthor, and all attitude: stomping around in a leather jacket and shades like a Kryptonian extra from Beverly Hills, 90210. The idea was that he might one day grow into the mantle of Superman, but mostly he spent his early years sulking, flirting and trying to work out whether it was OK to call Lex “Dad”. If Gunn does bring him in, then “Tomorrow” suddenly looks less like an aspirational tagline and more like the galaxy’s most unexpected custody battle.Others reckon the mech-suit, and a pic from Gunn’s posts in which Superman seems to be about to hand Lex a screwdriver, hints at a reluctant team-up between the pair – perhaps after they are faced with a greater threat. But whether this is a necessary plot device to ensure Earth has enough firepower to take down Brainiac, Darkseid, or some other interstellar monstrosit, there’s still something absurd about the idea of Luthor prowling about like Iron Man’s embittered tech bro cousin.And then there are the optimists who think “Tomorrow” means Superman will finally tackle issues such as climate collapse, LGBTQ+ rights and the plight of migrants everywhere. Maybe this really is the film where Superman stops trading punches with the supervillain of choice and turns his attention to saving us from ourselves. Or perhaps Hollywood has got enough existential crises to deal with thanks to James Cameron’s 23 upcoming Avatar sequels and their increasingly waterlogged metaphors for late-stage capitalism and environmental burnout.Tomorrow has been Superman’s tagline for 80 years. It’s been painted on lunchboxes, scribbled across duvet covers, and used as an excuse to reboot the same origin story at least once every decade in print. The question is whether in Gunn’s hands it will finally mean something.Explore more on these topicsSupermanWeek in geekScience fiction and fantasy filmsMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Welles had previously adapted the novel in 1939 as a radio drama.But some footage of the finished film was removed after it tested poorly with audiences before its release, with Welles giving up final-cut rights as a result of negotiations with the studio. Welles also travelled to Brazil during the film’s editing process to start work on theunfinished production It’s All True, later saying RKO “absolutely betrayed me” by re-editing The Magnificent Ambersons’ final section and shooting a new ending. The master negatives of the removed footage were later destroyed to free up storage space.A number of attempts have been made to restore or reconstruct the film. A working print was sent to Welles in Brazil but is presumed lost, withfilm-maker Joshua Grossberg leading a searchto try to locate it. In 2005 a reconstruction using still photographs premiered at the Locarno film festival.The Magnificent Ambersons at 80: Orson Welles’ powerful but cursed dramaRead moreHowever, Saatchi told the Hollywood Reporter that Showrunner does not hold any rights to The Magnificent Ambersons, so any resulting footage is unlikely to be seen outside scholarly or demonstration contexts. “The goal isn’t to commercialise the 43 minutes, but to see them exist in the world after 80 years of people asking ‘might this have been the best film ever made in its original form?’”Explore more on these topicsFilmOrson WellesArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

I would now like to live disassociated from those who wish me nothing but ill will and destruction, and this is the only resolution.The Smiths’ drummer Mike Joyce announces memoir The DrumsRead more“The songs are me – they are no one else – but they bring with them business communications that go to excessive lengths to create as much dread and spite year after year. I must now protect myself, especially my health.”Serious investors, Morrissey wrote, should email eaves7760@gmail.com to inquire – although the email address doesn’t seem to exist, generating an automated bounce back response.Morrissey shares 50% of the rights to the Smiths with Marr. Whether the brand retains its value to investors without Morrissey as an active participant to help market it remains to be seen.Representatives for Marr and Joyce declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.It is unclear what annual business communications are being referred to by Morrissey. Joyce recently announced the publication of a“no-holds-barred” memoir, The Drums, this November.Johnny Marr has previously said that he declined an “eye-watering” offer for the Smiths to re-form. “It was a little bit about principles, but I’m not an idiot, I just think the vibe’s not right,” he said, referencing the evident political and personal differences between him and Morrissey.In 2024,Marr rubbished Morrissey’s claimthat he had acquired the rights to the Smiths’ trademark “without any consultation”. Morrissey said that Marr owned the copyright which would allow the group to tour with a new vocalist.Marr said this was incorrect. A spokesperson said on his behalf: “In 2018, following an attempt by a third party to use the Smiths’ name – and upon discovery that the trademark was not owned by the band – Marr reached out to Morrissey, via his representatives, to work together in protecting the Smiths’ name.Nick Cave says he declined Morrissey’s request to sing ‘silly anti-woke screed’ on new songRead more“A failure to respond led Marr to register the trademark himself. It was subsequently agreed with Morrissey’s lawyers that this trademark was held for the mutual benefit of Morrissey and Marr.“As a gesture of goodwill, in January 2024, Marr signed an assignment of joint ownership to Morrissey. Execution of this document still requires Morrissey to sign.­­­­­­­­”He denied that he was planning to tour under the Smiths name with a different singer, and had also turned down an offer from Warner Music Group to release a new Smiths compilation “given the number in existence”.Morrissey’s apparently dire situation may have been influenced by the evidently unsuccessful attempt to reform the Smiths, as well as the difficulties he has faced in releasing his 14th solo album, Bonfire of Teenagers, which remains on the backburner.He has previously said he was “gagged” owing to the subject of its title track,the 2017 terrorist attackon an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester that killed 22 people.He has been performing the song since 2022. It features lyrics about how “The silly people sing Don’t Look Back in Anger / And the morons swing and say Don’t Look Back in Anger / I can assure you I will look back in anger ’til the day I die,” a reference to the street singalongs of the Oasis track after the bombing. The song concludes with Morrissey singing “go easy on the killer”.He was dropped by his former label BMG in November 2020 and blamed the split on the label’s “new plans for ‘diversity’”. At the time, BMG declined to comment on whether the decision had anything to do with the musician’s contentious statements about race and sexual assault.Bonfire of Teenagers has been completed since May 2021. His new deal with Capitol should have seen the album released in February 2023. However, at the end of 2022, he said he had “voluntarily” split from Capitol and his management team, and claimed that the label was “holding on to” the record.In April 2024, he said he had bought back the rights to the record but alleged that “every major label in London” had refused it “while also admitting that it is a masterpiece”.He has called the record “the best album of my life” and said the “madly insane efforts to silence the album are somehow indications of its power. Otherwise, who would bother to get so overheated about an inconspicuous recluse?”Explore more on these topicsThe SmithsIndieMorrisseyJohnny MarrnewsShareReuse this content"

Bowie’s notes reveal that he considered the publicly beloved petty thief Jack Sheppard as a potential lead character, as well as Jonathan Wild, the vigilante who was responsible for Sheppard being arrested and executed. He also focused on the Mohocks, a notorious gang of high-class young men who would get drunk and attack people on the streets.The notes detail his fascination with the evolution of art and satire, including a timeline of artistic development in the early 18th century. “It seems he was thinking, ‘What is the role of artists within this period? How are artists creating a kind of satirical commentary?’” lead curator Madeleine Haddon told the BBC.The broadcaster wasgiven access to Bowie’s materials for the project, including a dedicated notebook and detailed sticky notes: the latter had been left affixed to the walls of his private office in New York, to which only Bowie and his PA had a key.Theatre – particularly musical theatre – was a lifelong influence for Bowie. He made no bones about emulating the singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley early on, and studied dramatic arts under Lindsay Kemp. He told the BBC in 2002 that he had always wanted to write for theatre, the intent being “to have a pretty big audience” for whatever he worked on.The notes for The Spectator – and the desk where he worked on them – will be available for the public to view when the David Bowie Centre opens at the V&A East Storehouse in Hackney Wick, east London, on 13 September. The new centre will have 200 items on permanent display, but fans will be able to apply to view anything from the 90,000-piece archive in person by filling out a form.The permanent centre expands on the David Bowie Is exhibition at the V&A in 2013, which became the most visited show in the museum’s history.Bowie’s final completed work was his 26th album, Blackstar, released two days before his death in January 2016.Explore more on these topicsDavid BowieV&AMuseumsPop and rockExhibitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Many were unable to complete purchases, with error messages persisting for almost three hours after the launch.Forget Tomb Raider and Uncharted, there’s a new generation of games about archaeology – sort ofRead moreThe surge in demand was reflected on the troubleshooting platform Downdetector, where user reports spiked to 3,750 shortly after launch before gradually tapering off.Social media lit up with complaints and screenshots of error codes as frustrated gamers vented about the lack of a preorder option. One user called the situation “ridiculous”, while others described it as “stupid” that no measures had been taken to prevent the bottleneck.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHumble Bundle, another digital retailer, briefly displayed a message stating the game was unavailable due to overwhelming traffic – a notice that was later removed once the issue was resolved.Despite the technical hiccups, within 30 minutes of going live Steam reported more than 100,000 active players, suggesting many had managed to secure their copies.Hollow Knight was developed by Ari Gibson, William Pellen and Jack Vine with music by Christopher Larkin, who comprise the Adelaide-based indie studio Team Cherry. The game, which is set in a richly imagined world of insect warriors, has built a devoted following since its 2017 release and has reportedly sold more than 15m copies worldwide.View image in fullscreenA screenshot from Hollow Knight: Silksong.Illustration: Team CherryThe New York Times recently hailed the original Hollow Knight as “a modern Metroidvania classic”, complete with “charming and detailed hand-drawn animations, difficult boss battles and twisting, secret-filled corridors”.The original gained a cult following largely through word of mouth. But the anticipation for the sequel – which shifts focus to Hornet, a sword-wielding princess who appeared as a supporting character in the original game – was such that at least seven other new games have delayed their launch in the past two weeks to avoid a clash, including the walking sim Baby Steps and the tactical role-playing game Demonschool, the New York Times reported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An oddly intense mother-son relationship. Plenty of conversational cut and thrust. This melodramatic psychological thriller parades its genre signifiers like a badge of honour. It centres on the relationship between Cherry (Olivia Cooke) and Danny (Laurie Davidson). She’s an ambitious, cunning, thwarted estate agent who is looking for a shortcut up London’s social ladder; he’s a slightly gormless, grinning rich boy. When Danny brings Cherry home to meet his parents, his uptight, manipulative mother Laura (Robin Wright) smells a rat. Thus begins a battle of wills between two women whose mutual suspicion quickly turns into deep antipathy.Prime Video, from Wednesday 10 SeptemberAKA Charlie SheenView image in fullscreenConfessional … AKA Charlie Sheen.Photograph: PATo say thatCharlie Sheenhas had a tumultuous life is an understatement.

Cecilie Fjellhøy fell victim to Simon Leviev, who would become known to the masses as theTinder Swindler via a 2022 Netflix documentaryof the same name. She lent $200,000 to a man she met online and considered her boyfriend, who appeared to be (and she did her due Google diligence) a billionaire member of the Leviev Israeli diamond dynasty. In fact, his real name was Shimon Hayut and his apparent wealth came from a string of women he had previously dated and defrauded. The film was nominated for five Emmys, is said to beNetflix’s most watched documentary, and the title has since become a byword for online scammers who practise manipulative and emotionally abusive “romance fraud”.So many women (and a few men) got in touch with Fjellhøy to tell similar stories of their suffering at the hands of other seemingly loving men (and a few women), who then drain them of their resources and disappear, that she has become a crusader on their behalf.The new six-part series Love Con Revenge follows her work with the private investigator Brianne Joseph (“I’m like a pitbull”) as they gather evidence for various clients that will force even the most uninterested of police officers (whose attitude on victims’ initial approaches tends towards “It’s a domestic matter, file a civil claim, I’m bored already”) to investigate. There is much to unpack about systemic misogyny and the dismissal of women’s stories and the crimes against them, but Love Con Revenge is more interested in action than attitudes or the reasons behind them.Which is unfortunate because, in truth, there is not much action, at least of the televisual kind, involved in tracking down missing men and handing over dossiers of evidence to the police that mostly comprise documents provided by other victims of the potential scammers, or links found by tapping away at laptops for hours. Worthy work, but not a compelling watch.View image in fullscreenWorthy work, but not a compelling watch … Cecilie Fjellhøy in Love Con Revenge.Photograph: NetflixThus the series stretches its material very thinly. What could perhaps have made four relatively punchy hour-long episodes or six half hours grows repetitive and loses power over time. The women’s stories are sad and infuriating but also very similar (online connection, love-bombing, tragic backstories, desperation, loans repaid at first, then not, then guilt tripping until the victims are too enmeshed to escape), and the detail of each relationship is so minutely described that you start to glaze over.There are also the laborious exchanges between Fjellhøy and Joseph, a number of which feel scripted, as they explain increasingly unnecessarily to each other and to us what they are going to do, what they are doing, and why. And the stories are oddly broken across episodes.The initial case, of a man claiming he needs money from his girlfriend Jill, a woman with a personal interest in mental health and its treatment, to keep funding a wellness centre that never opens, ends halfway through the second episode. The next one runs from there into the third and there are other overruns that, with a firmer edit, could have easily been self-contained and much more effective.The same goes for Fjellhøy’s repeated explanations of why she got into this line of work (if it is work rather than a righteous hobby – there is no mention of whether she, Joseph or the local PIs they engage are paid): she doesn’t want other people to suffer as she did; she wants to stop individuals who will otherwise carry on with impunity and maybe escalate their crimes. Admirable, but very much understandable the first time round.Even the occasional promising moment ends up anticlimactic, like the handing over of the first dossier to the police. We don’t actually see the handover, and then the women sit in a car and wait until, four hours later, an officer comes out to tell them they will investigate and that a detective will call them. At the end of the second story, the confrontation between victim and scammer is only semi-satisfying because he more or less just walks away (“I don’t need to tell you anything”). That’s what happens in real life. And that’s why you should stay single for ever.However – also happening in real life is Hayut existing as a free man in Israel, though he is facing a multi-million dollar lawsuit brought by the Leviev family for impersonation, defamation and invasion of privacy. And so I don’t doubt that one day soon we will be greeted with a film about what should be an interesting battle between furious claimants with unlimited funds to construct a legal net that may yet catch the slipperiest of fish. Justice cannot always be confined to fiction, can it?Love Con Revenge is on Netflix.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDocumentaryTinderreviewsShareReuse this content"

Memory is untrustworthy, but Blume is a genius who has that effect on her reader.My favourite book growing upWe’re always growing up; we’re always choosing a new favourite. For me, once, this was Louise Fitzhugh’s Harriet the Spy. Later I’d have said JD Salinger’s Nine Stories. Later, still, John Cheever’s Collected Stories, Lorrie Moore’s Self-Help, Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain, my favourite changing as I did. Maybe I’m finally old enough to understand that favourite is impossible to designate. Or maybe I’d say my current favourite isDon DeLillo’s Underworld.The book that changed me as a teenagerI encountered Salinger at 13. I began with The Catcher in the Rye (as most do) and read through his (too small) oeuvre. I wrote bad stories ripping him off; he somehow made me believe that I could be a writer, too.The writer who changed my mindI think readingWilliam Faulkner– I’d have been 16 or so – was the first time I understood that the pleasure one finds in a book might not be in its ease. I think that’s what I most loved (and still value!) about the favourites of my childhood: being swept up in story and character and action. Faulkner showed me that there could be delight in wrestling with a sentence, a pure joy in language itself, a thrill in being challenged and confused by a work of art.Theauthor that made me want to be a writerMy early writing education was just mimicry. And the first writer I remember imitating was Agatha Christie. How I wanted to write a perfect whodunit, with a stately home, a party of interesting people and a dead body. That’s easier said than done.Theauthors I come back toThere’s no shortage of these – Don DeLillo, Anita Brookner, Patrick Modiano, Philip Roth, Willa Cather. These are but a few of the writers I can go back to and be thrilled by whenever I need.The books I could never read againMy relationship with Salinger was like a heated youthful romance. Reading his fiction now is a bit like running into that particular ex at a cafe. I’d rather remember Salinger’s work as meaningful to my 14-year-old self than actually read it as I tiptoe toward 50.The book I discovered later in lifeI’m all for discovery whenever it happens. Books have no sell-by date. They’re always there, waiting for their readers, and it’s silly to carry around a sense of embarrassment for not having got to Moby-Dick or what have you. This summer I read Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary for the first time. A perfect novel! Why did I wait so long? It doesn’t matter.The book I am currently readingGertrude Stein’s The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas. My first time with Stein, and I’m reading it slowly while lying on the beach; a luxury, a joy.My comfort readComfort can be different things. In times of stress, I might want something funny, or I might want something that mirrors the tumult I’m feeling in life. The comfort derives, in large part, from knowing that it’s new, that I’m in search of something, that I might discover something other than what I’m looking for. That’s what I love about books – a journey without a map.Entitlement by Rumaan Alam is out in paperback (Bloomsbury)on 11 September.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

It’s a revelation, like watching those stop-motion films of how a plant grows and blooms. There’s a section about how a Roman villa might transform into a parish, the long barn providing the footprint, the web of relationships providing the social connection, the very tiles and columns providing the building materials. I can’t think of anyone who writes better about the way objects can speak to us. There’s a passage here describing her joy on grasping what it means that an ordinary-looking clay lamp found in Carlisle is purple on the inside; there’s a beautiful afterword about the history of bells.The book revolves around the moment that Christianity became a religion of empire – the Council of Nicaea in AD325. Roberts patiently picks away at the mythologising around this key event to figure out how a multitude of competing interests was finally brought together under the umbrella of a particular Christology. She illuminates the way Christianity manages to be both centralised and local. This is still true: a recent Bible Society report shows that if you close a church a third of its congregation will not even try to find another. Truth may be universal, loyalty is parochial.The trouble with rolling your eyes is that you end up looking in the wrong directionThe book (according to its YouTube trailer, at least) promises to “lift the veil on secrets that have been hidden in plain sight” and find out who started Christianity and why. It is a humanist take, so you know the who and why is not likely to be Jesus, and the forgiveness of sins. And some of the secrets have been hidden in very plain sight indeed. The fact that Christians served in the Roman army won’t be news to fans of that patron of archers, gay icon, and subject of portraits by Botticelli, El Greco, Mishima, Derek Jarman and Louise Bourgeois: Saint Sebastian. There is a bracingly contrarian takedown of Saint Paul, reframing him as a Trumpian grifter and stupidity advocate. It’s fun but no more lifts the veil on his influence than pointing out that Marie Stopes was a raging eugenicist would lift the veil on the appeal of contraception.If you’re looking for the open, inquisitive humanism of Erasmus or Ursula K Le Guin, then you’ll have to read them. Prof Roberts’s approach is more brisk. Anyone who thinks the church was about anything “other than money and power”, she says, is suffering from Stockholm syndrome. Illuminators of manuscripts, builders of cathedrals, makers of the objects in which she herself finds such wonder were all either duplicitous or duped. In a splendidly anachronistic closing flourish she shelves the empire metaphor and instead compares the church to a corporation with directors and CEOs, franchises and a product to sell. This – with its implication of top-down control and single unswerving purpose – is queasily close to a conspiracy theory, albeit one that the best bits of this book refute.There is a lot of disappointed eye-rolling about the things that people believed – or pretended to believe. The trouble with rolling your eyes is that you end up looking in the wrong direction. One example among many: Roberts is dismissive of saints such as Columba and Aidan who chose to live on isolated islands, pointing out that these islands were notthatisolated in days when sea was safer than roads. But surely they were choosing to embrace simplicity not just for its own sake but as a kind of protest, a holding to account. Yes, you can more or less see Bamburgh castle from Lindisfarne – but isn’t that the point? That the king in his castle is forced to consider the saint in his cell every time he looks out from the battlements. To protest somewhere truly isolated would be like shouting “fuck the patriarchy” in a penguin colony. Of course from some angles Christianity does looks like a business, but then from many angles a dolphin looks like a fish. It swims, eats and lives like a fish but there’s an important difference. It suckles its young.Back in 2016, Alice Roberts had a go at a vastly more sacred cow than Christianity. In a piece inScientific American, she attacked David Attenborough himself for promoting the “aquatic ape hypothesis”, dismissing it as a theory of everything, and like all theories of everything, “both too extravagant and too simple”. I know this because I kept the article on my desk for years. Cynicism is also a theory of everything. If the humanism that frames the narrative here is ever to offer more than eye-rolling, it needs to embrace the fact that, to quote the Alice Roberts of 2016, the reality is “both more complex and more interesting”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Access isn’t enough; you really need a good story, and this account of the rise, fall and rise again of Brighton & Hove Albion – while “authorised” up the wazoo – has certainly got that.Brighton’s top-flight exploits in the late 1970s and early 1980s may feel like ancient history – and are presented here as such – but their 1983 FA Cup final defeat by Manchester United marked the beginning of an extended spell in the wilderness, capped by the still-outrageous plan by the club’s board to sell the Goldstone Ground, Brighton’s home since 1902, to property developers without any concrete plan for a replacement. (Of the two executives cast as the bad guys,David Bellotti, former MP and the club’s CEO, is no longer with us butBill Archer, DIY retail tycoonand then Brighton chair, is very much still around, so the film treads carefully where the latter is concerned.)The format hits all the conventional beats, including testimony from fervent fans (both celebrity and normie), backroom staff, well-informed journalists, and nakedly hagiographic interviews with the two executives who stepped into the breach, Dick Knight and Tony Bloom. Some of the details are telling: if Brighton, then bottom of the lowest division, had lost their relegation fight in 1997, without a stadium they would have more than likely failed to be admitted to the non-league structure and therefore would have been forced to shut down – so in that final game against Hereford United the club really was fighting for its life. However, the team managed to eke out the draw they needed (sending Hereford down instead), and began the long, slow path to recovery.It’s not explicitly stated here but there’s a case to be made that, ironically, the Goldstone disaster might have been the making of the club; the issue became a lightning rod for fan activism and dissent, generating sympathy across the game, sparking the team into life on the pitch and powering their march up the divisions. There certainly seems to be a lot of goodwill towards “the Albion”, as everyone calls them, with plenty of former players and managers happy to sit down and talk to the camera. Bloom in particular comes out of it well, his fannish enthusiasm buoying the fervent voiceover – though his steel comes out when he justifies giving the boot to popular manager Chris Hughton, whose yeoman service was rewarded with the sack in 2019, after getting the club to the Premier League’s promised land two years prior.The film’s relentlessly celebratory tone – common to all productions of this type – in the end becomes bit of a handicap. While the club’s story is certainly an epic for the ages, the innate partisanship leads to moments of bad grace – particularly towards Gillingham, who bailed a desperate Brighton out with a two-year groundshare – and one or two of the fan comments are a bit … well … old school. I’d also have been interested in hearing a little more detail on Bloom’s spectacularly successful hiring practices; nearly all the club’s managers (with the unfortunate exception of Sami Hyypiä) turned out to be brilliant appointments. Be that as it may, there’s much to like here, a real grassroots success story that can cheer up even the grumpiest follower of the game.Stand or Fall: The Remarkable Rise of Brighton and Hove Albion is on digital platforms, DVD and Blu-ray from 8 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBrighton & Hove AlbionreviewsShareReuse this content"

After a young deaf boy is shot while watching a puppet show, the citizens of Vasenka fall deaf themselves: refusing to speak, respond, even to hear military orders.The dramatic, book-length poem from 2019 by Ukrainian-bornIlya Kaminskybecomes an elaborately imagined theatrical fable from Dublin’s Dead Centre: not consoling, sometimes laborious, always demanding vigilance.If deafness is metaphor in Kaminsky’s poem, here it is a potent theatrical force. Dead Centre’s writer-directors Bush Moukarzel and Ben Kidd team up with sign language poet Zoë McWhinney. The spoken dialogue doesn’t capture Kaminsky’s flinty concision or wild incantation, but signing impels the show: a vivid choreography of communication. Signing, speech and surtitles are variously combined; panic and violence are loud in every register.‘We wondered if it was ethical to adapt it’: can poetry about deaf resistance wow theatre audiences?Read moreDeaf citizens stand blank-faced before a soldier’s jokes and threats until he resorts to captions (“this is an accessible war!”). Their gestures are lyrical, witty, calmly insurgent, but refusal only goes so far. “Poems are no match for a man with a machine gun,” warns baleful puppeteer Momma Galya (a louche and gritty Derbhle Crotty).The plush textures of Kevin Gleeson’s sound design often blur and muffle the speaking world. Townsquare chatter and traffic envelop us, then falls silent. The story’s central couple (warmly played by Romel Belcher and Caoimhe Coburn Gray) are beguiling guides, often appearing in marionette form. Puppets become a vivid image of childish innocence turned sour, of people struggling to steer their own destinies. In death, humans are hauled up on ropes, defiance reduced to deadweight carcass.Artistic director David Byrne’s Royal Court continues to expand the theatre’s notion of authorship: ensembles can be auteurs. Dead Centre are masters of meta-theatrical dazzle. Here, we rarely watch in a single register. Live film sits atop the stage picture. Scenes are screened in dollhouse miniature then replicated at full scale (ingenious designs by Jeremy Herbert). A hovering drone scans the audience. There are so many moving parts that spectatorship becomes a testing exercise in awareness. Yet the production ultimately asks us to sit with defeat – a hard road, even if it fits our current geopolitical moment.AtRoyal Court theatre, London, until 13 September, then at the Samuel Beckett theatre, Dublin, 2-5 October, as part ofDublin Theatre festivalExplore more on these topicsTheatreDeafness and hearing lossPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

This one – directed by Rachel Kavanaugh, with a book by Shaun Kitchener – fuses the myriad hits of Steps on to a storyline based in a seaside supermarket, Better Best Bargains. There we find best friends Caz (an excellent Rebecca Lock), Vel (Jacqui Dubois), Robbie (Blake Patrick Anderson) and Neeta (Rosie Singha), each determined to have a “summer of love” and change their lives while dealing with, variously, useless straight men, pesky adoption agencies, anxiety, latent homosexuality, daddy issues, and via an odd end-of-act-one twist, a faux French ladies man turned capitalist landlord scumbag.View image in fullscreenShowing some emotion … Jacqui Dubois as Vel, Blake Patrick Anderson as Robbie, Rosie Singha as Neeta and Rebecca Lock.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe high street setting – stage designed to evoke a retina-burning, poppers o’clock rendering of the Supermarket Sweep set drawn from memory – is the perfect backdrop to riff on accidental family dynamics and cross-generational friendships. At times, as the often very funny one-liners hit their mark, it reminded me of Victoria Wood’s Dinnerladies, only spiked with the energy of a Zumba class.As ever with a jukebox musical, the plot is ultimately just a vehicle for the songs. Luckily, Steps – to their detractors a sort of Asda Price Abba – have enough bangers, bops and ballads to cover all bases: the bittersweet One for Sorrow soundtracks a toxic reunion; Scared of the Dark’s galloping drama elevates a moment of tension, and a barnstorming Chain Reaction is performed on top of a washing machine by a drag queen dressed as a bag of ice. You just don’t get that with Les Mis.Like Steps themselves – whose surprise appearance on stage tonight is actually one of the show’s more low-key moments – Here & Now is camp, silly, heartfelt, sporadically exhausting but ultimately just endlessly entertaining.AtManchester Opera Houseuntil 13 September.

So the BBC’s licensing of a spin-off stage play to mark January’s 75th anniversary of the farming drama raised fears of a Snelly cavalcade of arch jokes for superfans.In fact, Haywire – written by Tim Stimpson, author of almost 500 Archers scripts – is, across the length of eight radio episodes, a smart drama with a strong sense of broadcasting and social history.The conceit is that, in 2025, Jonty, a BBC Ambridge lover with ambitions to edit The Archers (the real current incumbent, Jeremy Howe, was in the audience) gilds his CV by making an afternoon play about the show’s early history from late 1940s conception through 1951 launch to the 1955 immolation of a major character to stymie the opening night of the BBC’s first commercial rival, ITV.Jonty’s cast includes Adrian (Kieran Brown) as Godfrey “God” Baseley, the show’s creator, and Abbie (Olivia Bernstone) playing Ysanne Churchman, a brief early series heroine as Grace Archer.Directed by Joseph O’Malley (a distant descendant of Baseley), the play is as neatly and deeply layered as a hay bale. The main cast play the actor contracted by Jonty now, then their impersonations of a 1950s actor/character which, in some scenes, becomes a period recreation of the “real” past, with some lip-syncing as well to actual vintage episodes. If Lynda Snell ever attempted such meta-drama, she would need tranquillisers from Dr Malik at Darrington surgery.View image in fullscreenAural show and tell … Liam Horrigan and Geebs Marie WilliamsThe intricacies demand (fittingly for a tribute to radio) some extraordinary voice acting, as the cast darts between their characters’ 2025 actor accent and the on-air and off-air tones of a 1950s cast member. These can be enjoyably different, suddenly jumping from Brummie to plummy or street now to Borsetshire then.Yet another level makes Adrian the former lead in a forgotten TV detective franchise and Abbie a current screen soap star with millions of X followers and pursuant paparazzi, permitting Stimpson intriguing parallels: the first Archers cast – drawing to radio the sort of audiences (20 million) that EastEnders achieved at its peak – are shown as prototype media celebrities, with personal appearances amid public hysteria.The result is a behind-the-mic farce, a homage to Michael Frayn’s backstage classicNoises Offin which part of the enjoyment is the creation of noisesonby “spot effects” studio manager Jessica, superbly played by Geebs Marie Williams with a combination of aural show and tell – the use of slopping yoghurt to suggest the birth canal of a lambing ewe – and a silent movie range of facial expressions.The first night audience clearly included aficionados – joining in with the theme tune – but Haywire, though loving to its source, has enough general pleasures to be liked by everyday folk around the country.At theBarn theatre Cirencester, until 11 October.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreThe ArchersRadioComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

From an audience not too shy to heckle (albeit mostly with variations on “We love you!”) comes an unsolicited plea to engage with one such inflammatory topic: the current US president. Goldberg doesn’t flinch. “It’s worse than that,” she says. “I’m turning 70.”So begins an undemanding set which often plays like aGrumpy Old Womenspin-off and echoes the title of Goldberg’s 2010 book Is It Just Me? Or Is It Nuts Out There? The Egot-winning actor, host ofThe Viewand great-grandmother dispenses semi-formed thoughts on everything from ageing and AI (“Fuck Alexa”) to misbehaving children (she once threatened to eat one). She is sharp on the discomfort of being attracted to “some kid” of 60, her worry being that she will be branded not a cradle-snatcher but a grave-robber. Other moments, such as a warning about how to opt out of sharing personal information via mobile phones, are like reading a boomer relative’s Facebook page.The show’s structure, if that’s not too grand a word for what is essentially a fans’ meet-and-greet complete with mementoes passed to the stage and audience members’ tattoos inspected, is as baggy as Goldberg’s multi-coloured sweatshirt. Sauntering back and forth, she offers vignettes from her recent memoir Bits and Pieces: My Mother, My Brother, and Me. In delineating her late brother’s numerous ex-girlfriends who came out of the woodwork at his wake, she lends a glimpse of her youthful comic acuity for those of us who didn’t see the 1984 Mike Nichols-directedBroadway monologueswhich made her reputation. When she loses her train of thought (“Where was I?”), the crowd gladly step in en masse (“Italy!”).After the interval, Graham Norton spends 45 minutes prodding Goldberg through her career highlights and trying, not always successfully, to steer her away from unpromising anecdotes. She ticks off The Color Purple (on which she offered to play “dirt on the floor”), Ghost (no one wanted her to audition) and Sister Act, on which she exclaimed to her most esteemed co-star: “You’reMaggie Smith!What are you doing in this fucking movie?” There are even appreciative cheers for Theodore Rex, in which she was paired with a talking dinosaur to fight crime – a film so abysmal that she tried to extricate herself at the 11th hour.Ghost at 30: the shock romantic blockbuster that tried to do it allRead moreFrom her declaration of love for – and yearning to play the lead in – Doctor Who to her recollections of how she performed her character Blee T (a Black ET) for Steven Spielberg, there is not a tried-and-tested anecdote here that fans don’t know verbatim.It seems occasionally as if her crowd work might pep things up. “Are you going to the bathroom, girl?” she asks after spotting someone plodding up the aisle, then promises to wait before continuing the rest of the show. In fact, the departing figure turns out to be a man with dreads. Realising her error, Goldberg says: “I need better glasses.” Better material, too.AtCardiff Arenaon 5 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsComedyWhoopi GoldbergreviewsShareReuse this content"

Rooted in his ethnomusicological research, which explores the role of music in ritual contexts and his own Equatoguinean heritage, the results are unsettling but compelling, characterised by heady percussion and swarming electronics. But while his 2019 debutHijos Del Solwas made up of murky downtempo instrumentals, N’Dongo’s follow-up amps up the intensity almost beyond recognition, with a collection of sludgy, abrasive tracks.View image in fullscreenSacred Lodge: Ambam.Photograph: Avon Terror CorpsOne of the starkest differences is the use of vocals, which have previously only featured as echoey background textures. On Ambam, N’Dongo makes full use of his voice. Inspired by the tradition of field hollers and ritual chants (specifically of the Fang people, from which his father originates), he ranges from guttural metal-style growls to distorted screams and yelps; some lyrics are delivered in a panting, rap-like cadence. On opening track Wa Wa Ke Wa Wa Yi, N’Dongo’s grisly tone is offset by composer and vocalist Sara Persico, whose smoky, seductive drawl only reinforces the uncanny atmosphere.The instrumentals are harsher this time, too, welding elements of horrorcore, industrial and bass music into buzzing storms of noise. Excitingly, several tracks are anchored by hypnotic drum patterns that might even seem clubby in a different context. Enêñ is a highlight, with its metallic, polyrhythmic percussion, as is the skulking A Bo Biboa. Other tracks are straight-up discordant, such as Mongu Nnang, featuring Cairo-based producer El Kontessa, which clatters along frenetically. At points, it’s so deconstructed it resembles a malfunctioning computer game.Both dense and disorientating, Ambam may well be too overwhelming for some listeners. But the more you listen, the more you get sucked into the thrill of N’Dongo’s unapologetic resistance music.Also out this monthWritten and recorded during her pregnancy,Le Don des Larmesis French-Algerian musicianLéo La Nuit’s gentle tribute to her newborn child (Knekelhuis). Across 16 lo-fi recordings, there are intimate ditties and lullabies that draw on north African folk music, interspersed with atmospheric pop-ish moments and scattered field recordings, from birdsong to crying.Blurrr, the latest album by Glasgow painter-musicianJoanne Robertson, is another lovely, cosy listen (AD93). Aside from Oliver Coates’s occasional cello feature, it’s just Roberton’s voice and acoustic guitar in these meandering folk songs. But the foggy production quality sets her squarely beyond the singer-songwriter category, adding an edge reminiscent of her regular collaborator Dean Blunt. As in her DJ sets, Spanish producerJASSSdefies genre boundaries on her excellent new albumEager Buyers(AWOS). There are shades of trip-hop, dub, pop and post-rock in these shapeshifting compositions, where glitching electronics fizz around moody guitars and echoey vocals.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental album of the monthExperimental musicElectronic musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

On 20 September the Los Angeles-born artist will be the first to represent the US at Russia’s revived Intervision Song Contest, a cultural spectacle that manages to be both nostalgic throwback and very modern geopolitical manoeuvre. WhileEurovisionhas famously stretched its geographic boundaries to include Australia, Russia’s alternative contest represents a rather different kind of international outreach.Russia dusting off the Intervision brand, largely dormant since 1980 apart from a brief reprise in 2008, follows the country’s exclusion from Eurovision since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Its expulsion cut off access to a platform that – while often mocked by British audiences – had served as a crucial tool of cultural diplomacy for decades.Emblazoned on Intervision’s website is the claim that: “The world-famous music event returns to Russia” – but the contest was, in fact, conceived in 1960s Czechoslovakia. What’s more, that original contest served rather different purposes. “The idea of Intervision was certainly not what the Russians are presenting us these days,” explains Dean Vuletic, a historian who has extensively researched the contest.View image in fullscreenSecond iteration … 1978’s Intervision Song Contest in Sopot, Poland.Photograph: Stefan Kraszewski/PAPRather than being born of exclusion, Vuletic says the first series, running from 1965 to 1968, was explicitly designed to bring east and west together; Czechoslovak Television actually offered to collaborate with Eurovision organisers, though the proposal was rejected. When the contest finally launched, it featured western artists alongside eastern European performers, including Eurovision winners such as Puppet on a String singer Sandie Shaw and Austrian crooner Udo Jürgens appearing as interval acts.Poland took Intervision’s international ethos even further during the contest’s second iteration from 1977 to 1980, including artists from Japan, the US and Canada in a parallel competition for artists representing record companies. Both versions were fundamentally commercial enterprises, with Czech and Polish organisers using the platform to court western record labels and launch careers like that of Karel Gott, who became Czechoslovakia’s biggest pop star after winning the inaugural Intervision. As Vuletic says: “They wanted to attract the interest of western commercial record companies. It’s not like they were communists who wanted nothing to do with capitalism.”The Soviets themselves, meanwhile, were not especially invested in these early contests. “Having been to the archives in Moscow, my conclusion is that the Russians themselves weren’t that interested,” notes Vuletic. With their vast domestic market, they simply didn’t need Intervision to access broader audiences.To understand why Russian president Vladimir Putin is now so engaged with the concept that he brought the contest back to life via a presidential decree in February requires examining how Eurovision itself has changed since the cold war. The European Broadcasting Union’s expansion eastward in the 1990s dramatically altered the contest’s character, bringing in broadcasters from former Soviet republics and communist states who used the platform to assert their European identity.This shift coincided with Eurovision’s growing association with LGBTQ+ causes, beginning with Iceland’s Páll Óskar – the contest’s first openly gay contestant – in 1997 and followed by Dana International’s 1998 victory and Conchita Wurst’s triumph in 2014. The bearded drag queen’s win particularly rankled Moscow, coming just as Putin’s government was promoting “traditional values” and passing laws restricting LGBTQ+ content. For visual culture and identities scholar Bárbara Barreiro León, Intervision serves as a “cultural counterweight” to Eurovision, and is born of “a desire to challenge western cultural dominance, particularly as Eurovision has come to represent liberal, western values.”View image in fullscreenSanitised approach … Intervision 2025 promotional material.Photograph: YoutubeBeyond the contest’s penchant for camp, perhaps even more galling for the Kremlin was Eurovision’s role as a platform for countries once under Soviet rule to showcase their independence and distinct cultures. Ukraine’s multiple victories – including Jamala’s 2016 song about Stalin’s deportation of Crimean Tatars – directly challenged Putin’s narrative that Ukraine lacks legitimate independent culture and history. As expert in post-cold war history Catherine Baker notes, Ukraine’s creativity in Eurovision has made the contest “a platform where hundreds of millions of viewers can see that Putin’s falsehoods about Ukraine aren’t true.”While Russian officials promise to promote “traditional values” and reject what they term the “perversions” of Eurovision, this sanitised approach may prove counterproductive. “People like to watch Eurovision because of all of that diversity, because of the provocations, because of the politics,” says Stephen Hutchings, who has studied Russian media for several decades.So, who has signed up for Putin’s alternative vision? Participating countries appear to be primarily those neutral or supportive of Russia’s position on Ukraine, though the exact roster remains fluid. Initial reports suggested 20-21 countries, and the official website at the time of writing lists 17 – still considerably fewer than the 37 who competed in the ESC in Basel this year. These include Belarus, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, Cuba, and Qatar, alongside Serbia, notionally an EU candidate country. The US’s participation, sending an artist perhaps best known as the subject of speculation about being Michael Jackson’s son, is perhaps the most bizarre. Suffice to say, Ukraine will not be taking part. The country’s foreign ministry has condemned the event “as an instrument of hostile propaganda and a means of whitewashing the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation.”View image in fullscreenMaking history … B Howard will perform in Moscow for the US.Photograph: Imaginechina Limited/AlamyBeyond politics, Intervision faces practical hurdles. Unlike Eurovision, where participants largely share similar time zones (with the notable exception of Australia), Intervision spans multiple continents, making engagement with the live broadcast and voting procedures more challenging. 8pm in Moscow is 1pm in Cuba and Venezuela – not exactly primetime viewing. Many performances will need to be recorded and shown the following day, undermining the communal viewing experience that makes Eurovision compelling. Unlike Eurovision, which developed alongside European integration and shared cultural experiences, Intervision lacks the underlying political and geographic foundation that could spark and sustain long-term viewer engagement.The eclectic mix of far-flung participating countries, according to Hutchings, reflects Russia’s broader strategic pivot away from the west toward the global south and Brics nations. Like the reorientation of Russian state TV news network RT after western bans, the contest represents an attempt to build alternative cultural infrastructure outside western-dominated spaces. Yet for all the geopolitical posturing, the initiative may function more as domestic theatre than international outreach: Putin’s broader strategy of constructing a patriotic Russian culture, while demonstrating that the country can thrive independently of European institutions.View image in fullscreenSigned up … Nastya Kravchenko will sing for Belarus.Photograph: intervisionIf that’s the goal, early indicators suggest the audience isn’t exactly enthralled. As Barreiro León points out, the contest’s social media presence remains underwhelming – little over 4,000 Instagram followers at the time of writing (though Instagram is blocked in Russia, forcing users to access it via VPN), about 14,000 on Russian social media site VKontakte, and approximately 45,000 on a Telegram channel. Eurovision, for comparison, boasts 2.2 million Instagram followers. Even Russian audiences may prove skeptical, Vuletic believes, with educated young Russians seeking cutting-edge music unlikely to embrace a contest explicitly promoting conservative values.Whether this latest attempt to resurrect Intervision will prove more successful than previous efforts remains to be seen. Moscow may frame this as cultural competition, but practical realities suggest the contest faces an uphill battle. Of course, most European audiences won’t be able to judge for themselves – unlike Eurovision’s widespread broadcast across the continent, Intervision won’t be gracing screens in the EU or the UK. As for whether Russia’s alternative will strike the right note with global audiences – the jury’s out.Explore more on these topicsMusicEuropeRussiaEurovisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Walton’s Chekhov-derived The Bear, from half a century later, was a perfect partner, full of percussive speech rhythms to match the witty rhyming libretto.Mezzo Lea Shaw, as Torquemada’s fickle wife Concepción, has the best of the time-related gags in the verbose text of the Ravel (sharply translated in Kenneth Chalmers’ surtitles) and the central aisle of St Mary’s was imaginatively used to add some sense of offstage action and time passing to a pacy production. The singers’ French diction was not always up to the standard of that first exclamation, but a larger problem was the addition of a little too much stage business, alongside pantomimic costumes and makeup, to what is already a ridiculous confection. Spirei, making his company debut, was perhaps guilty of overegging a rich pudding.View image in fullscreenNicely judged … Chloe Harris and Daniel Barrett  in Scottish Opera’s production of The Bear.Photograph: Sally JubbThe Walton (based on the Chekhov short story about a widow obsessively mourning her faithless dead husband, before finding new love herself) also had no shortage of melodrama, in a nicely judged and well sung performance by the Australian Chloe Harris, who has the only well known song of the evening: I was a constant, faithful wife.Good though both women were, the star of the evening was baritone Daniel Barrett, also making his Scottish Opera debut. He brought charm to the pivotal role of dim, innocent Ramiro, the muscular muleteer in the Ravel, and then really showed his chops in the bigger sing of the title role in The Bear.AtTheatre Royal, Glasgowon 18 and 22 October and Festival theatre Edinburgh on15 November.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the third instalment of Gardner’sNielsenseries with the orchestra, after previous discs featuring the third and fourth symphonies. Like its predecessors, the latest release pairs a symphony with one of Nielsen’s concertos, in this case the Fifth Symphony, completed in 1922, with the work for clarinet composed six years later.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Nielsen: Clarinet Concerto; Helios; Symphony No 5.Photograph: ChandosBoth works, as well as the early Helios Overture, receive outstanding performances from the Bergen players, and Gardner controls the teeming textures of the symphony with great refinement. Perhaps there’s just a little too much control towards the close of the magnificent opening movement, when the snare-drum player is instructed to do his best to disrupt the rest of the orchestra; a bit more wildness might have made that passage even more powerfully effective, and the surge into the second movement that follows even more cathartic.Alessandro Carbonare is the soloist in the Clarinet Concerto, which with the earlier work for flute was all that Nielsen lived to complete of his plan to compose concertos for each member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet. It too has a prominent role for a snare drum, a counterpoint to the rather irascible writing for the solo clarinet, which Carbonare handles with great aplomb; there may be more excitable performances of the concerto on disc than this one, but not many that are so elegant and suave.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

There, for less than a euro, you can enjoylepinjawithkajmak–a charred traditional flatbread made in a stone oven and filled with a rich, creamy spread from a local dairy. The bakery is on one of the most picturesque roads through the Neretva River canyon, making this delicious bite even more special.AGCatch of the day in BavariaView image in fullscreenChiemsee, a freshwater lake sometimes called the ‘Bavarian Sea’, in southern Germany.Photograph: Foottoo/Getty ImagesIn the beautiful surrounds of Chiemsee, southern Germany, my partner and I enjoyed a lunch of fresh fish at the family-runChiemseefischerei Stephan, just west of the lake. With just a couple of options available on each daily menu, we didn’t have to faff around with a complicated order, and instead enjoyed the simplicity of the fish, rich potatoes, crisp salad and local Bavarianweissbierin the modern wood-panelled room. There was also Chiemsee sushi on the menu. I remember stepping out of the restaurant afterwards into the bright sunshine, hand in hand with my partner, mountains in the distance, and thinking: could life get any better?EllenA mountainous feast in KosovoView image in fullscreenA plate offergesë, made with red pepper, tomato and feta cheese.Photograph: Saxana/AlamyAfter scaling Kosovo’s highest peak, Gjeravica,Gacaferi Guest Houseprovides delicious home-cooked food in an idyllic setting surrounded by mountains and shepherds herding flocks.

The food scene was surprisingly excellent, with the highlight beingHospůdka U Štěpána, a fantastic restaurant near Sušice. A huge kitchen garden provides most of the produce, accompanying the wide range of different steaks from self-reared charolais beef. Fried courgette flowers followed by striploin in chimichurri sauce were some highlights in our August visit, along with the rustic vibe and more than fair price.EnricoMy favourite pizza in RomeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: edpics/AlamyHaving tested a few pizza-piazza combinations in Rome, we enjoyed a pizza fromAntico Forno Rosciolisitting on the kerb in Piazza Navona. It’s a 500-metre walk from the 19th-century bakery to the 15th-century public space (built atop the first-century Circus Agonalis). It’s the best pizza in Rome (in my humble view) and a relatively uncrowded and spectacular baroque spectacle of a square (oval?).Daniel Beckerskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Every night we indulged in a four-course, fine-dining experience. Ginger soup or fried polenta with wasabi, local beef or salmon tartare followed by organic Dutch cheeses, and a liquorice sorbet with blackberry creams. Perfect after a 30-mile cycle ride, and a constant source of conversation.SophieJazz and open-air dining in rural FranceWe stumbled across the biodynamic vineyardLa Guinguette du Domaine Gayrardin Virac, north-east of Toulouse, and found that not only did it produce some lovely wines but it also hosted aguinguette(open air dining from a simple menu with live music) during the summer months. We booked for dinner and were blown away. This gastronomic triumph was complimented by the most beautiful surroundings: we sat outside, looking over the vineyards as mellow jazz was played and the chef cooked our meal from a trailer. A truly unexpected gourmet experience.RachaelHonest hospitality in northern ItalyView image in fullscreenFresh agnolotti.Photograph: eZeePics Studio/Getty ImagesAtCa’Ordanoin the hills of Monferrato, the tasting was simple but unforgettable. A glass of nebbiolo red wine came first with a simple plate of local salami and cheeses. Then,agnolottipasta filled with roast beef, perfectly paired with a rich monferrato rosso. The visit was small-scale and personal, with no fuss or ceremony, just honest hospitality and food rooted in terroir – they’d hate me for calling it that, but it is what it is: a quiet, undiscovered corner of Piedmont with true flavours among the rolling hills.Mariateresa BoffoWinning tip: the old Crete ways are the bestIn the hills west of Rethymno there is Atsipopoulovillage, famous for Ta Souvlakia tou Gagani, a lovelyrestaurant sitting in a beautiful church courtyard. But a tiny restaurant calledO Manolis, sitting in a less-illustrious location (the seating occupies empty parking spaces off the main street), embodies everything good about rural Crete. Deliciousness beyond description is produced in that restaurant and served with genuine Greek warmth. With no menu, Manolis serves whatever is harvested that day from his garden, declaring confidently it’s the greatest in Europe, or what he hunts and forages from the hills in the old Cretan way.Rory FergusonView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsFood and drinkReaders' travel tipsEurope holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each year, I ask my sister what I should bake and the answer is almost never chocolate, despite it being one of my favourite cake flavours. However, this year, I’ll be changing that and making this lovely, fudgy two-layer chocolate cake filled and topped with a luscious, malty buttercream that I could eat by the spoonful. If you want to make it extra celebratory, swap the chocolate shavings for sprinkles.Chocolate and malted buttercream cakePrep10 minCook1 hrServes12315g plainflour150g castersugar120g light brown sugar50g cocoa powder2 tsp baking powder1 tsp bicarbonate of soda¼ tsp fine sea salt3 large eggs60ml neutral oil225g plain yoghurt115g unsalted butter, melted170ml hot brewed coffeeFor the malted buttercream250g unsalted butter1 tsp vanillabean paste40ml whole milk50g malted milk powder(eg, Horlicks)175g icing sugar¼ tsp fine sea saltMilk chocolate, shaved, to finishHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and grease and line two 20cm loose-bottomed cake tins. Put the flour, both sugars, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarb and salt in a bowl and whisk to combine.In a jug, whisk the eggs, oil, yoghurt and melted butter. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, pour in the liquid mix, then stir in the coffee until everything comes together into a smooth batter. Divide evenly between the two lined tins and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove, leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 10 minutes, then lift out and transfer to a rack to cool completely.Meanwhile, make the buttercream. In a stand mixer, or using an electric whisk, beat the butter and vanilla for three or four minutes, until pale and creamy.Heat the milk in a small saucepan or microwave until hot, then add the malted milk powder and whisk smooth. Beat half the icing sugar into the butter, then pour in the hot malted milk followed by the rest of the icing sugar and the salt. Beat again until smooth and creamy.When you’re ready to assemble, invert the cakes and put one on a plate or serving board, and trim the top if it’s not level. Spoon some buttercream on top, spread it out evenly, then add the second cake topside down. Spread the remaining buttercream on top, finish with some shaved chocolate around the edges, then slice and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotCakeBakingChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"

In Vietnamese restaurants, servers wander around taking partially melted ice blocks out of your glass and replacing them with new ones. Of course, this is fine with low-cost options such as 333, Bia Saigon and even Tiger. The beer stays cold, and in any case it is drunk rather quickly with little chance of any meaningful dilution. Would I put ice in a pint of Pasteur Street Jasmine IPA or Heart of Darkness Dream Alone pale ale? I would not. But would I shun and shame someone who does? Certainly not.Chris HoweHo Chi Minh City, VietnamI enjoyed your article on ice cubes in beer and its apparent origin inFrance. Well, I can attest that, while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Thailand more than 40 years ago, you would see locals in bars and restaurants (even in the most remote parts of the country) doing the same. So, I’d say the origin is up for debate.Curt BordenBellefonte, Pennsylvania, USWere I to jump on to the ice-in-beer bandwagon, given the propensity of bar staff to put ice in drinks by the shovel full, how much of the pint of beer that I ordered would I actually receive?Malcolm WoodsSouthend-on-Sea, EssexI wonder what Pass notes would make of a michelada inCosta Rica?
