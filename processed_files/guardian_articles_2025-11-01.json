Photograph: Laura Stevens/The Guardian; Hair and make up: Constance HaondFormer England goalkeeper reveals full story behind her international retirement, her problems with eating and alcohol, and why she’d struggle on The TraitorsRead an exclusive extract from Mary Earps’ bookByDonald McRaeSat 1 Nov 2025 06.00 EDTShare“I’ve learned a lot about what truly matters in life,”Mary Earpssays on a quiet and cloudy afternoon as, at Paris Saint-Germain’s training centre on the outskirts of the French capital, the former England goalkeeper reflects on the achievements and drama of her last five years. “My life has accidentally come into the court of public opinion. People talking about your performance comes with the territory but when it starts to become about your character, and assumptions people make about you, that can be really, really challenging.”Between 2020 and 2023 Earps overcame depression, a drinking problem, eating issues, won the Euros with England, forced Nike to change their attitude to female goalkeepers, saved a penalty in a World Cup final and wonthe BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year.Since then she has been surprised by Sarina Wiegman, England’s manager, recalling Hannah Hampton after previouslyremoving the young keeper from the squad. Earps believes Hampton’s attitude and behaviourdisrupted the harmonious atmosphereamong the goalkeepers before England won the Euros in 2022. She felt let down and describes Wiegman’s usual clarity and direct communication becoming opaque and distant as the manager wavered over selecting Earps or Hampton.Mary Earps extract: ‘I felt sick and anxious. Then came the words I’d waited 12 months to hear’Read moreAmid turmoil and distress Earpsretired from international footballthis year. She then faced “multiple character assassinations” from people who assumed her ego could not bear being replaced as England’s No 1.Earps stayed silent while she watched England win the Euros this summer, withHampton playing a starring role, and she has now found peace without international football.“At first I found it difficult because of this great sense of injustice I have,” Earps says with a light laugh that belies the strength of her feelings. “I was like: ‘Gosh, I can’t believe this is what people think about me. It’s so far from the truth.’ Sometimes it made me question myself: ‘Is that really how I am?’ But now I try to have as much of a thick skin as I can. I don’t think you survive without it.”Earps’snew autobiography, serialised in the Guardian, is a deep cut above the usual sporting celebrity book. It is stark, authentic and crammed with startling revelations. When I ask her which parts of the book make her feel the most emotional Earps says: “Those pages about being bullied …”As “the girl who played football” she “was often alone”. On one occasion a girl who was two years older than Earps, instructed a friend to “slap her”. Earps fought back “and they chased me round the school till I found sanctuary in the PE department office. It was horrifying.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps in happier times with England, after the victory over Sweden at Bramall Lane during Euro 2022.Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty ImagesShe was sustained by her family and a burning obsession to become a great goalkeeper. Earps also grew used to the harsh coaching regime at junior England camps where, during one-on-one sessions, “I felt like the sole ambition was to make me cry.”Coaches also made casual remarks about her weight with numbing regularity. Earps felt isolated until, in later years, some of her England teammates shared similarly jarring experiences.“The world has changed,” she asserts calmly. “It just wouldn’t happen now. But it’s a part of who I am and with me struggling at school, and never feeling liked or accepted, [the remarks about her weight] really compounded that. It definitely amplified a thing in my head of never being good enough. That [knocks] your self-esteem as a young person.”The book captures Earps living alone, “with death counts mounting”, during the first Covid lockdown, “shovelling down biscuits instead of meals” and binge-drinking vodka.She was “annihilating my fitness” and her worry “about being big and bulky was back with an angry vengeance.”Was she scared? “I don’t think I had enough energy to be concerned for myself. That probably sounds really ugly but I was navigating a very difficult and dark time. I don’t look back and recognise that person, who didn’t have any zest for life. I’m just grateful I found my way out because not everybody does.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps saves Jenni Hermoso’s penalty in the 2023 Women’s World Cup final in Sydney.Photograph: Australian Associated Press/AlamyEarps is warm and often amusing company and it seems incongruous we should discuss such painful memories when she remains one of the world’s best and most highly paid female keepers. “I try to speak honestly because in social media everything looks glitz and glamour all the time. We should be open and have that sense of humanity and community the world is losing.”She never came close to trying to take her life but Earps admits she thought of how she might end it. This happened, she says, “more often than I would have liked”.Two years later Earpswould be the best goalkeeper at the Eurosand help England win the tournament. Another year on, in 2023, she won the Golden Glove at the World Cup – where Englandlost to Spain in the final. Earpsalso stood up to Nikewhen the corporate giant failed to make her goalkeeper’s jersey available as a replica kit. It appeared to be institutionalised sexism and Earps says: “I just recognised something wrong and I’ve got a really strong sense of injustice.”She smiles. “I always feel like I’m sticking my head above the parapet – it’s a recurring theme. It’s about being unapologetically myself and standing up for what I believe in.”At a pre-World Cup media day she was asked about Nike’s lack of interest in female goalkeepers. Her replysparked a campaignwhich forced the company to apologise and make amends. “My proudest achievement is not the result,” Earps says. “It’s the fact I had the courage to answer honestly. The alternative, which seems crazy, was to say nothing. Or I could have complained to Nike privately and nothing would have happened. But because I answered the question, the public pressure and my performances created this change.”Earps’s transformation from her lowest point had been helped enormously by Wiegman’s arrival as England manager in 2021. She felt trusted by Wiegman who made her feel “invincible” while “she constructively tried to always challenge me. I felt like I could be honest while she always had my back.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps and her England teammates interrupt Sarina Wiegman’s press conference after the win over Germany in the Euro 2022 final at Wembley.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Uefa/Getty ImagesIn 2022, Earps writes: “Sarina took absolutely no nonsense when it came to bad behaviour and created a culture where it would be addressed head-on to the point of isolating or removing people from the camp who wouldn’t adhere … Non-collegiate behaviour was not tolerated. We came back to the news that Hannah had been dropped from the squad: her behaviour behind the scenes at the Euros had frequently risked derailing training sessions and team resources. ”Earps describes how Wiegman “would stand in front of everyone and say: ‘This is the situation. This is why this person is not training. This person needs to be managed.’ That gave everyone real clarity.”I ask Earps to offer some examples of how Hampton, allegedly, undermined the “collegiate” atmosphere. “I don’t want to go into the specifics because it’s not my place. I don’t want to speak badly about anybody else either. But unfortunately this played a part in my Euros experience and England situation.”Pressed to explain more, Earps says: “I think we had different ideas of what being a teammate should be. I think there was a mismatch, a misalignment, of values.”Did Earps discuss her misgivings with Hampton? “There was a lot of conversation and a lot of effort to try and [change] the situation. I took my role as a leader very seriously and always wanted the goalkeeper group to be as harmonious as possible. I’d experienced non-harmonious goalkeeper groups and didn’t feel that brought the best out of people. I have a real affinity for goalkeepers … and I can’t speak highly enough of [Ellie] Roebuck and the way she helped me at the Euros. She messaged me yesterday to say I should go on The Traitors. I told her I’d be a terrible traitor because I’m a terrible liar.“You’ve got to give a lot of credit to Roebuck because [as the former No 1] she could have been awful to me. She could have been an arsehole – pardon the French. But she wasn’t. It not just about what she gave me, but also what she gave the team. It’s a really tricky role and she did it incredibly well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I wish that it wasn’t, but I genuinely wish her and the team well. She is a very good goalkeeper and I’ve tried to draw a line under all that. I have messaged her privately to say: ‘Look, no bad blood.’”Her relationship with Wiegman deteriorated after the manager’sturn towards Hampton. Wiegman said “everyone deserves a second chance” but it was troubling to Earps that the atmosphere towards her became “neutral” and far less communicative than before. The unspoken changes left Earps feeling “like a frog that had been placed in tepid water with the heat gradually turned up”.Earps details “an energy shift” between her and Wiegman. “It felt like something was off. You can’t put your finger on it and there’s nothing majorly wrong, like no one’s speaking to you in a crazy way or being mean to you. But you just feel this isn’t how it used to be.”Wiegman appeared to have lost her usual clarity and direct way of communicating and, Earps says: “It was an unusual experience for me and also the squad. It was difficult for everybody.”I wanted to look back and celebrate. We both could have done that. It caused unnecessary bad feeling for no reasonEarps on Sarina WiegmanThe manager finally explained that Hampton’s distribution skills were superior but she told Earps she wouldn’t accept her retirement. Earps agreed reluctantly to stay for the Euros only to revert to her original decision when she concluded that Wiegman no longer followed her closely at PSG.If Wiegman had been transparent at the outset would Earps have remained with the squad? “I don’t know how those conversations would have gone. But a big dynamic at play was making the situation untenable.”In a public statement Wiegman said she was disappointed in Earps. She also had to be nudged by Lucy Bronze to say a few words when Earps left the squad. “I don’t think you should get into who’s right and who’s wrong,” Earps says. “We’d had a relationship that spanned the best part of four years. I still have a tremendous amount of respect [for Wiegman].”Earps “felt like I’d been trudging and troopering on, and I’d been so vulnerable, at times in tears. I just wanted to look back and celebrate what had been. We both could have done that. It caused unnecessary bad feeling for no reason.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps found the knockout stages of the Euros ‘difficult to watch, but I genuinely loved it’. Photograph: Laura Stevens/The Guardian; Hair and makeup: Constance HaondShe sounds composed and without bitterness: “The manager always has the right to make whatever decision for the greater good of the team. Ultimately, she’s won three back-to-back Euros and is incredibly successful. I don’t look back with bad blood. I can give my point of view but also give credit where it’s due. It worked out well for everybody. The team went on and won the second Euros back-to-back, an incredible achievement. Sarina won her third, and I took care of myself mentally and physically and chose to end my international career on my terms, a little bit.”Earps foundthe knockout stages of the Euros“difficult to watch, but I genuinely loved it. I’ve got fantastic friends there, friends I hope remain for the rest of my life. It feels like family.”She also negotiated painful terrain with her own family. During the last World Cup she made a strong decision to support her partner, Kitty, who overheard Earps’s parents talking dubiously about their relationship. Kitty lives with Earps in Paris and the goalkeeper’s face lights up: “She’s tells me the unadulterated truth. She’s a great person to have in my corner.”Did her parents struggle with Earps’s sexuality? “Definitely at the beginning there were elements of that. People make mistakes and hurt you – but the strength of relationships comes from navigating those moments. We talked and worked through it.”I feel very lucky that I live in such a beautiful place after all I’ve been throughMary Earps on life in ParisEarps has frozen her eggs, in the hope of becoming a mother one day, as she wants to play for PSG as long as she can. She loves Paris and rocks in delight: “I call the Eiffel Tower ‘Eileen’ and get so excited.”Come on, Eileen? “Exactly. That’s what I say to her when she’s about to start flashing. I feel very lucky that I live in such a beautiful place after all I’ve been through, the highs and lows. You get caught up in that and in chasing the next trophy and next objective. I still have that hunger to achieve so much at such a fantastic club but you take stock and think: ‘Wow, isn’t this a beautiful, beautiful city?’ It’s given me a different perspective on the urgency of life.”Earps cackles. “I’m 32 now, don’t look a day over 18! I’m going to play as long as I can, because I bloody love this game.”Serenity, as much as certainty, courses through her now. “This is a real home away from home. It’s a really relaxed lifestyle and I can focus on football and maximise every last bit of potential I have in me before, unfortunately, the legs give out.”Earps looks up and, after a thoughtful pause, she says: “Every season is sacred now.”Mary Earps: All In by Mary Earps (Bonnier Books, £22).

On film, he was in features including The Riot Club and Hide and Seek – a story of four young Londoners who move to an isolated country cottage.“What set Josh apart was he seemed so clever and so committed to what an artist’s life is, with real integrity,” Hide and Seek director Joanna Coates told the Guardian. “He really cares about making meaningful things, which sounds simple but holding true to that takes grit.”Coates said O’Connor was not only dedicated but also “really funny”. “I have a whole blur of special memories from that time – but there was a particular scene where he and another actor (Daniel Metz) were making each other laugh so much, in a moment that veered into pure improvisation. It felt so pure and funny we kept it in. The laughter is real.”View image in fullscreenFilm stills from God’s Own Country, directed by Francis Lee.

He makes it appear as if it’s easy, only because his approach is thorough and deliberate.”Laia Costa, who starred opposite O’Connor in the romantic drama Only You the following year, said O’Connor was “a brilliant collaborator”.“We were meant to arrive in Glasgow a full week before filming began, but I was stuck in Miami, grounded by hurricane season,” she recalled. “It was chaos – no rehearsal time, no chance to properly build the chemistry our characters needed”. But O’Connor, she added, “was incredible. Completely effortless, calm, and present. There’s something innate about his talent; it’s not something you can teach or fake.”It was in 2019 that O’Connor gained widespread recognition, when he joined the cast of The Crown as Prince Charles, portraying the future king during his young adulthood and early marriage. His depiction of the prince across the series’ third and fourth seasons was lauded for its precision and depth, and earned him an Emmy award and a Golden Globe.The Crown’s creator, Peter Morgan, has compared O’Connor’s talentsto that of the former Barcelona footballer Andres Iniesta. “I was drawn to his sensitivity and the fact that he was complex but likable,” Morgan has said. Meanwhile, O’Connor’s co-star on the series, Olivia Colman, alsopraised himfor his on-screen tenderness. “Fragility, sparkle, strength, doubt: It’s all there in a second. Every scene we had together became my favourite scene,” she said.Since The Crown, O’Connor has worked in both British and international film projects, including Eva Husson’s Mothering Sunday (2021) and Luca Guadagnino’s Challengers (2024), opposite Zendaya. The latter marked a shift in his public image, recasting him as an unlikely heartthrob and central figure in what social media dubbed the “hot rodent” trend – a celebration of sharp-featured, offbeat male leads.Today, he’s a gen Z pin-up and one of “the internet’s finest boyfriends” – and his star will only rise. Wake Up Dead Man, which boasts a stellar cast including Daniel Craig, Andrew Scott, Mila Kunis and Kerry Washington, is the biggest movie of his career. He’s also starring in Steven Spielberg’s next blockbuster, and will be making a return to the London stage in Golden Boy at the Almeida. If the past few years established him, the next will probably confirm it: Josh O’Connor is about to be everywhere.Explore more on these topicsJosh O'ConnorprofilesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Iwas vegetarian in the 1980s, so I know how far meat-free sausages have come. In fact, some now taste almost identical to their ultra-processed meaty counterparts. Whether that represents progress depends on your perspective: are we creating healthier, more sustainable alternatives or simply replicating the industrial food system’s problems in plant form?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Veggie sausages split into two main categories. The first are what I call meat analogues, which are usually made with pea protein isolates (plant-based protein) or textured vegetable protein (TVP), a byproduct of the soya bean oil extraction process, and designed to imitate processed sausage meat. The second are made from mashed whole foods, such as chickpeas and vegetables, and are a less processed and more textural veg-love affair.TVP was invented in the 1960s and led to the creation of more processed, roughly textured soya-based products, such asLinda McCartney’s range. Contemporary “sausages”, however, include pea protein isolates and more thickeners, have smoother textures, and are uncannily similar to ultra-processed meat, which often contains a huge amount of plant-based fillers and flavourings to lower the price.I scored all these sausages on flavour first, then factored in additive content, value and sustainability credentials; I didn’t consider their likeness to meat. Today’s test group demonstrates how the industrial food system has evolved and become more processed over time, but even so, three products did stand out.Best overall:Gosh! veggie sausages with sage, lentil & black pepperView image in fullscreen£2 for 240g at Ocado (83p/100g)★★★★★Described by Gosh! as a Cumberland-style sausage, these are made from real ingredients (chickpeas, lentils, beans, herbs and spices) and crisp up and turn golden brown. Sweet, herby and savoury, though a touch dry, so best fried in oil or served with sauce. The only completely artificial additive-free sausage tested, and a detailedsustainability effort. Soya-and palm oil-free, too.Best bargain:Cauldron Lincolnshire sausagesView image in fullscreen£2.60 for 276g at Waitrose (94p/100g)£3.10 for 276g at Morrisons (£1.12/100g)★★★☆☆A modern-style TVP sausage (notvegan, because it contains egg white) in alginate casings that brown well and hold their shape. A pleasant, peppery and herby flavour with rich umami notes of soya, sage and onion. Good, firm bite, but a touch rubbery. Excessive additives, including stabilisers (dicalcium phosphate, methylcellulose).And the rest …This Isn’t pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£3.75 for 270g at Tesco (£1.39/100g)£3.75 for 270g at Sainsbury’s (£1.39/100g)★★★★☆Looks and tastes like an ultra-processed sausage, only better. Full-flavoured, umami-rich and piquant with a sweet note and a hint of sage. Firm, meaty texture. B Corp-certified. Contains thickeners (methylcellulose, konjac, carrageenan, xanthan gum) and pea protein isolate, though.Linda McCartney’s vegan red onion and rosemary sausagesView image in fullscreen£2 for 270g at Morrisons (74p/100g)£2.60 for 270g at Waitrose (96p/100g)★★☆☆☆A retro “sausage” brand founded more than 30 years ago. Made with TVP, which gives these a rough texture that I’ve become rather fond of. Nostalgia aside, I don’t love the taste, which has a strong onion and yeast extract flavour, as well as clear rosemary notes. Firm bite, but pasty. Contains methylcellulose.Heck meat-free chipolatasView image in fullscreen£2 for 300g at Tesco (67p/100g)£2 for 300g at Morrisons (67p/100g)★☆☆☆☆A modern industrial vegan sausage, uniformly pink, with a calcium alginate casing that peels off during cooking. Sweet and peppery with a strange fungal undertone from an overcomplicated ingredients list, including intriguing flavourings in the form of hibiscus, black carrot juice powder and grilled white onion. A nice snap, but a floury texture.

This month he will be sentenced at the Old Bailey after pleading guilty to taking bribes to make statements in favour of Russia during his tenure as a member of the European parliament.In modern British politics, it is an almost unique fall from grace – perhaps with parallels to the story ofJohn Stonehouse, the high-flying Labour MP recruited as a spy for Czech intelligence in the early 60s.But Gill’s humiliation isn’t just personal. His links to Russia raise awkward questions for Reform UK, and for its leader, Nigel Farage – Gill was a key lieutenant of his when they were both in Brussels. While Farage has beentrying to distance himself from Gill, multiple sources who worked with them in Brussels have told the Guardian that the two men used to be close.View image in fullscreenFarage (left), then Ukip leader, and Gill before a plenary session at the EU headquarters in Brussels in June 2016, just after the Brexit vote.Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty ImagesThe moment of Gill’s downfall dates back to July 2021 and the arrivals queue at Washington DC’s Dulles international airport.FBI agents stopped Oleg Voloshyn, a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician close to Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch sometimes known in his native country as the “dark prince” and a long-term ally and friend of Vladimir Putin.It was less than a year before Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkraineand Medvedchuk had been charged with treason, and his TV channels, conduits for Russian propaganda, had been taken off the air.Voloshyn, his envoy to the west, was in the crosshairs of US authorities.The FBI extracted WhatsApp messages from Voloshyn’s phone in which he discussed secretly paying Gill. Voloshyn was released after three hours of questioning, but he and Medvedchuk were both named the following year by the US as agents of a Kremlin plot to install a puppet government in Ukraine.Farage insists ex-Reform UK Wales leader convicted of bribery is ‘bad apple’Read moreNow in Moscow, Voloshyn was Gill’s co-accused, albeit beyond the reach of British authorities. Two months later in September 2021, after the stop at Dulles airport, counter-terrorism police arrested Gill at Manchester airport.On his phone, police found messages that showed he had reached an agreement with Voloshyn. According to prosecutors, Gill accepted cash on at least eight occasions to make specific statements and opinions benefitingRussia.The amount has yet to be disclosed, but various amounts totalling in excess of at least £10,000 were mentioned in WhatApp messages between him and Voloshyn.Looking back on them now, the public statements appear subtle, but they provided the mood music in the west for a propaganda war being waged by the Kremlin to paint Ukraine’s pro-western leaders as repressive.For his cooperation in this covert PR campaign, Gill received “xmas presents” and “post cards” – coded references to money. They were his reward for making speeches in the European parliament and giving TV interviews scripted by Voloshyn.View image in fullscreenGill arriving at the Old Bailey in September, charged with bribery and of conspiracy to commit bribery.Photograph: Yui Mok/PASpeaking to the Guardian via email, Voloshyn denied allegations made by the US and UK that he had acted at the direction of Russia’s FSB spy agency.He insisted the payments – typically £4,000 or £5,000 each – were merely media appearance fees, rather than bribes. He described Gill as a “humble” father of five who was “definitely not rich” and was the “victim of a geopolitical conspiracy”.The tangled story of Gill and Voloshyn raises questions about how Russia has attempted to cultivate contacts across British political life.David Coburn and Jonathan Arnott, two other MEPs who were part of Farage’s Ukip bloc in Brussels, visited Ukraine with Gill on an October 2018 trip. During the visit, Coburn, Gill and Arnott appeared on camera in interviews with 112 Ukraine, a pro-Russian channel affiliated with Medvedchuk.Six weeks later, the three would make similar statements during a debate in the European parliament on 11 December that touched on press freedom in Ukraine and the question of whether it should be allowed to join the EU.1:06Nathan Gill questions press freedom in Ukraine in European parliament – videoGill spoke first. While saying he had “every sympathy with Ukraine”,he added: “It is wrong to fight repression with repression.” Prosectors in Britain say he had received a script for the speech from Voloshyn on 7 December 2018.Arnott and Coburn followed,with the formercalling on the Ukrainian government to ensure freedom of the press “against a backdrop of violence against journalists [and] the proposed closure of TV channels”.Coburnthen accused Kyiv’s leadersof being “found wanting” on freedom of the press, accusing them of “plotting” to close the channel 112 Ukraine and questioning whether Ukraine was fit for EU membership. Gill and Coburn sat on the channel’s new “international” board, along Voloshyn and others.There is no suggestion that either Coburn or Arnott took bribes in the same way as Gill.Nigel Farage claims Russia was provoked into Ukraine warRead moreContacted by the Guardian, Arnott rejected any suggestion that he had links to Russia or was acting in its interests and pointed to another part of his speech in which he said “the best response to a loss of freedom is increased freedom”.He added: “I think that provides a bit of background and context to what I was saying in the speech and explains where I was coming from. Russia’s suppression of free speech should not be countered by Ukraine also suppressing free speech.”Attempts have been made to contact Coburn.In correspondence with the Guardian, Voloshyn claims the broadcaster 112 Ukraine “should have” covered the MEPs’ travel costs on their 2018 trip. In fact, declarations by the three to the European parliament record their tickets as having been paid for by the European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights, a front created by Russian intelligence agents with the same name as a genuine organisation.The cutout’s president, Janusz Niedźwiecki, was arrested in 2021 in his home country, Poland, on suspicion of espionage for Russia. Arnott said if he had been aware the money for his trip may have come from Russian assets “obviously I would not have participated in any visit on such a basis”.Farage has faced questions about the extent of contact he may have had with Voloshyn. Nadia Sass, Voloshyn’s wife, a 112 Ukraine journalist, last year posted a photo on X of herself with Farage, which appears to have been taken outside the European parliament in about 2018, saying she would “miss Nigel Farage and his team”.Another tweet included a picture of Farage holding a T-shirt with the logo “Leave and Let Die #brexit”, apparently taken in Gill’s Strasbourg office in 2018. Voloshyn said Sass had given it to Farage because she wanted to promote her political T-shirt business. He claims he has never spoken to Farage.View image in fullscreenFarage, then head of the Brexit party, and Gill visiting a vape shop in Merthyr Tydfil in 2019.Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty ImagesA spokesperson said: “Nigel Farage meets thousands of people every single year. Many hundreds of them will ask to have a photo taken with him. He was deeply shocked and angered by the actions of Mr Gill and condemns them in every possible way.”They added that Farage did not have any knowledge of Gill’s “shameful activities”.But Niedźwiecki and Voloshyn appear to have also widened their net beyond the various incarnations of parties by Farage. Both were named in warning emails sent to all MPs at Westminster in July 2021 and January 2022 by the speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle.A number of MPs are understood to have come forward to the security services after Hoyle warned them that Voloshyn was working to gain the support of a number of politicians in parliament for policies in support of Russian state objectives.Sir John Whittingdale, a former minister and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Ukraine, said he had first come across Voloshyn when he was “the right hand man” toKostyantyn Gryshchenko, who served as Ukraine’s foreign minister under its Moscow-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych.“I went to observe an election around 2012 and I did see him once at his request in Westminster [in 2018] with Nadia Sass [Voloshyn’s wife]. As I recall they were complaining about restrictions and harassment of her TV channel by the government,” Whittingdale told the Guardian.“He has now been identified as a Russian asset, though at the time I knew him he was working for the [previous] Ukrainian government, which was quite pro-Russian.”Labour steps up attacks on Farage and Reform over pro-Russia stanceRead moreThere is no indication that Whittingdale or other Tory MPs such as Mark Pritchard, who was due to appear on a panel at an event in London with Sass, were compromised by any association with him.Instead, the heaviest price is expected to be paid by Gill,whose guilty pleain September to eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019 took prosecutors by surprise.An ashen-faced Gill had entered the plea after earlier appearances at Westminster magistrates court, where he had been ordered to surrender his passport and register with police at Anglesey, the Welsh island where he lives with his wife and children.Before entering politics, he had practised in Anglesey for six years as a Mormon bishop. Anglesey had also been the base for an earlier business running care home services founded by his family and operating mainly in Hull. That business collapsed with debts of £116,000 after the 2008 financial crisis hit.Attempts to build a political career followed, with early failures at gaining election at council and devolved level before finally becoming a Ukip MEP in 2014.From the misery of a struggling business and electoral failure, Gill found himself at the centre of Brussels politics, rubbing shoulders with the eclectic milieu of international visitors and lobbyists at the European parliament. A hitherto unnoticed interest in international affairs bloomed.Farage has been trying to distance himself from Gill,telling the BBCthat he was “stunned” when he found out his party’s former leader in Wales took bribes.Challenged on whether he questioned Gill over the statements, Farage said: “I didn’t know anything about it; all I knew was that he’d been to Ukraine. I told him not to go, he defied me and went, I was completely unaware of any statements that he made.”However, multiple sources who worked with Farage and Gill in Brussels and Strasbourg said the two men had been close.View image in fullscreenFarage and, behind him, Gill after a historic vote for the Brexit agreement at a session of the European parliament on 29 January 2020.Photograph: Thierry Monasse/Getty ImagesGill was described variously as Farage’s “enforcer” and “right-hand man” by some who recalled they had adjoining offices. One former Ukip MEP from that time told the Guardian: “Gill was in the thick of organising. He was the right-hand version of Farage. His office was right beside Farage’s.”“Nathan had a unique place in the party,” another source said. “He was the centre of gravity in Wales, and David [Coburn] was at the centre in Scotland. I found David quite difficult – he could be very outspoken. He was very loyal to Nigel.”Gill also had personal vulnerabilities of the sort foreign intelligence agencies look to seize upon.Alex Phillips, formerly a media adviser to Gill and someone who also served alongside him as a Brexit party MEP, said: “There is a tragic backdrop to this. They clearly targeted someone who was financially vulnerable.”Phillips told the Guardian she was “as shocked as everyone” when Gill was arrested, adding that she voluntarily went to speak to the Metropolitan police and let them know that she had known nothing about his secret activities.“I don’t believe he was cunning enough to really believe in what he became involved in. It’s quite sad really.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Am I addicted?It was only years later, when I heard the word workaholic being used seriously for the first time, that I wondered whether I had a problemJenny KleemanSat 1 Nov 2025 08.00 EDTShareHave you ever heard a word that jolts you to attention? That word, for me, was “workaholism” – and when I heard it through my headphones earlier this year, listening to an audiobook on the tube, I felt a pang of something between recognition and panic. It transported me back to the worst time in my life.In May 2016, when I was nearly five months pregnant, I travelled to rural Norway to make ashort documentaryfor the Guardian. The Norwegian government was making asylum seekers – from mostly Muslim countries – take cultural education classes about women’s rights. I’d been invited to a class in Moi, a town by a lake framed with pine trees, 100km south of Stavanger.My pregnancy hadn’t been easy. I’d bled heavily at nine weeks, after coming off set on Sky News. It was the early hours of Good Friday, and I had to wait four agonising days to be scanned and ultimately told everything looked fine. Then the routine 12-week screening gave my baby a one in two chance of being born with Down’s syndrome. A 20cm needle was inserted into my belly to check his chromosomes; while I waited for the results, I buried myself in work, recording something for BBCRadio 4’s Woman’s Hour.It turned out my baby didn’t have Down’s, or any other chromosomal abnormality, but I was told I should go to Great Ormond Street hospital to have his heart checked. By 19 weeks, my pregnancy was officially declared normal. I bought some maternity T-shirts to cover my now unavoidable bump, and got on the plane to Norway.On the morning of the class, I woke up far too early. The moment I opened my eyes, I knew something was wrong. My throat was tight and salty; I was about to throw up, but it didn’t feel like morning sickness. A searing pain was radiating from my right side, so sharp it left me breathless, but it wasn’t the dull ache of cramps that would make me worry for my baby. Maybe last night’s dinner didn’t agree with me? I took a paracetamol and tried to get back to sleep.I hadn’t told any of my editors how complicated my pregnancy had been. As a freelancer, I had an ingrained sense of always having to appear hyper-employable and, as a woman, I didn’t want anyone to think pregnancy might affect my ability to do my job. At least, that’s what I told myself. The truth was, I didn’t want anyone to tell me I shouldn’t be working so hard.But now I couldn’t get out of bed. I rang Tom, the kind and brilliant video journalist working with me, to tell him I wasn’t going to join him for breakfast. He was worried. He got me an emergency appointment with the local doctor who said, “I think you have appendicitis” after I buckled in agony when she pressed on my side. She said my appendix might rupture and I should go to hospital.Don’t be ridiculous,I thought. What were the chances of me having that now, after so many weeks of bad luck? And what would some rural GP know anyway? Appendicitis is supposed to be agony. This was bearable.The class was due to start in an hour. The paracetamol seemed to be doing its job. Let’s start filming, I said to Tom, and if I feel bad again, I’ll go to a hospital and get everything checked out. He was reluctant, but I insisted.We filmed for eight hours that day, and for three hours the following morning before our flight home. The 11-minute documentary we made is still on the Guardian website. I can’t bring myself to watch it.On the plane home, with my forehead pressed on the cool plastic of the tray table to detract from the pain in my side, I realised this was serious. I got a cab from Heathrow direct to A&E at my local hospital, which sent me upstairs to the maternity ward. Obstetricians, surgeons, midwives and nurses appeared at my bedside with concerned faces. It might well be appendicitis, they said, but the CT scan that could confirm a diagnosis was out of the question because I was pregnant and the radiation would harm my baby. I was put on antibiotics and more paracetamol, and kept in under close watch for a week.I spent my days sitting up in bed with my laptop, answering emails and working on an article.Then, at 5am one morning, while my husband was at home with our three-year-old son, I went into labour. My baby was wrapped up and given to me to hold and behold, but he had died while I was giving birth to him. Apart from me andthe midwife, no one else ever saw his tiny, perfect face.By 10am that same morning, I was back on my phone, going through my work emails. I’d been invited to chair a judging panel on some documentary awards. I said yes. While I was being wheeled in to have the scan I was allowed to have now I was no longer pregnant, I lay on my back and emailed my editor to say the feature I was writing might arrive a few days later than promised.I left hospital the next day, filled with stronger antibiotics. Two days later, I was back on Sky News, doing my regular live slot. A few weeks after that, I had my appendix taken out. And when I had another miscarriage a few months later, it was the same drill: I was doing live television within days of losing the baby.I went on to have a daughter, now eight, four years younger than her brother – but I didn’t believe she was real until I held her in my arms. My pregnancy was one of constant surveillance and painful interventions; losing a baby at 20 weeks had done permanent damage to my cervix, and I was at risk of going into early labour again. For nine months, every time I went to the toilet, I expected to see blood. I buried myself in busyness, presenting a Panorama for BBC One, writing a book proposal and – once I was signed off as safe to travel – flying to Los Angeles to film a report for Vice Newson HBO when I was 32 weeks pregnant.None of this was work that had to be done, or couldn’t be cancelled, or even work that mattered. But I couldn’t stop myself from doing it. When unthinkable things were happening to me, my first instinct – a stark, profound, unavoidable urge – was to work.I’d feel bad if I hadn’t done 12 hours and rarely took a break. I wouldn’t go to the bathroom, or eat, or make a coffee, if I hadn’t done X taskNine years on, I am haunted by how I chose to work through the most terrible time in my life. I have never lived through anything as dark as that again, but as far as my attitude to my work goes, I’m not sure how much has changed. I worked seven days a week for two years during the pandemic, writing from Monday to Thursday and then getting up at 3.30am every Friday, Saturday and Sunday to present a live breakfast radio show from 6-10am (before coming home to try to be “fun mum” to my young kids). Today, I still work every Saturday morning, several evenings a week, during family holidays and through bouts of Covid and tonsillitis.All this is enabled by my very understanding husband and kids, who know that I am happiest when I’m working. I work from home, so I’m still present for them. Or so I tell myself.The video I made in Norway has been doing the rounds on social media (migrants, and their attitude to women, turns out to be an evergreen subject, especially since the protests outside the migrant hotelin Eppingin July). That means I’ve been regularly confronted with the worst thing that ever happened to me. But I’ve begun to look at my immediate response to it through fresh eyes.It was when I was listening to Ed Zwick’smemoirabout his life as a Hollywood movie director, and heard him sombrely and repeatedly use the word “workaholism”, that I was stopped in my tracks. Like so many other people, I Googled it (searches on the topichave surgedsince lockdown), and found there are now hundreds of chapters of Workaholics Anonymous all over the world, including14 different meetingsacross the UK, from Scotland to Bognor Regis to Liverpool.Had I been reaching for work in the same way that an alcoholic reaches for the bottle? Was I using it to numb pain and escape reality like a heroin addict? Could I really be addicted to work?“Many of us, when we first heard of workaholism as an addiction, thought that it was some kind of joke,” reads the Workaholics Anonymous Book of Recovery. “Isn’t hard work how one succeeds?” The word “workaholic” has been around since the 1940s, and it’s used casually – often positively – in capitalist societies such as ours, where job titles, salaries and other markers of professional success can be seen as a score in the game of life. Workaholism has yet to be extensively studied or formally recognised by any international body, but most behavioural addiction specialists now agree it’s possible to become addicted to working in the same way as to other activities, such as gambling and gaming, that fire up our brains’ reward systems. A team at the University of Bergen wrote in 2023 that the “generally agreed upon” definition of workaholism is “a compulsive and extreme need to work, characterised by an unrelenting drive to work hours on end, take on more work responsibility and prioritise work over different areas of life”.Around 10% of Americansare thought to be work addicts. The consequences can be serious: workaholics aremore likely to be anxiousordepressed, torely on stimulant drugsfrom caffeine to cocaine and methamphetamine, and tobe at risk ofsleep disorders and heart disease.Unlike gambling, gaming or sex addictions, there’s no helpline to call for those who believe they are addicted to work.Workaholics Anonymous(WA) is pretty much the only resource, and its website is the place where people like me begin if they think they might have a problem.Founded in the US in 1983, WA applies the 12-step approach pioneered in Alcoholics Anonymous. “Workaholism involves both a substance addiction (adrenaline and other stress hormones) and a process addiction (compulsive doing or not doing) and is not limited to our paid work life,” the Book of Recovery continues. “Workaholism is not strictly about the amount of work we do but rather about our emotional and spiritual relationship to work and activity and how it can negatively affect us and those around us.”There’s a page on the WA website entitled “Am I a Workaholic?” I cast my eye down thelist of 20 questions, nodding in recognition at many of them (“Do you immerse yourself in activities to change how you feel or avoid grief, anxiety, and shame?”; “Do you take work with you to bed? On weekends? On vacation?”) and shaking my head at others (“Do you pull all-nighters?”; “Do you resent your work or the people at your workplace for imposing so many pressures on you?”).I’m relieved that I can only confidently say yes to about 12 of them. Then I get to the bottom of the page. “If you answered ‘yes’ to three or more of these questions,” it reads, “you may be a workaholic.”The in-person WA chapters I approach don’t want me to come to a meeting if I’m going to write about it, but several people who attend regularly agree to tell me their stories. Jen helped set up the City of London WA meeting a couple of years ago. “It’s in the church behind my office,” she says. “As a very focused workaholic, I knew I wouldn’t go if I had to take the tube.”We meet in a cafe in south London on a day when she’s on annual leave from her job in investment banking. Jen has arrived early. There’s a neat pyramid of WA books arranged on the table in front of her. “I came prepared, like a good workaholic,” she says, drily.It didn’t occur to Jen that she might have a problematic relationship with her work until she went to rehab for substance abuse in December 2021. She’d been having regular three-day drug and alcohol binges, and her boss had begun to notice. He supported her trip to rehab for what she thought would be a four-week stay. Jen arrived determined to address her issues as successfully and efficiently as possible. “I explained that I understood that this was a 12-step programme rehab, so I could tackle three steps per week within the four weeks. How could they help me in achieving that?”She soon realised that recovery was not a task that could be checked off a to-do list. Jen ended up spending three months in rehab, during which she had to disengage from her job entirely. Giving up work was much harder than giving up drugs and alcohol, she says. “I hadn’t ever stopped like that before. I was incapable of being in the present.” Work, she discovered, was her “primary addiction”.View image in fullscreen‘I love what I do, and I do it out of passion.’Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianBefore the pandemic, Jen’s typical day in the office would begin at 7.45am. “I’d feel bad if I hadn’t done 12 hours and rarely took a lunch break. I’d play games with myself: I wouldn’t let myself go to the bathroom, or eat, or make myself a cup of coffee, if I hadn’t done X task.” With her global role, Jen could always be useful – working with Asian markets in the morning, Europe during the day and the US in the evening. It wasn’t a question of wanting to beseento be working hard, she assures me; she was determined to make it look easy. “That was the brand: give it to Jen and it will get done.”When lockdown came and Jen was working from home, things got even more intense. She would work until 10 at night, falling asleep with her email. In April 2021 she was made managing director – a position she’d been aiming for her entire professional life – but instead of being able to exhale, she felt she had to work even harder. “No one person in the organisation knew everything I was doing.” Hoarding work and doing it without anyone knowing sounds like alcoholics stashing bottles to drink in secret, I say. “It wasexactlylike that.”Jen describes her workaholism as a physical addiction. “It’s the internal drugstore – adrenaline, cortisol, I’m sure there are many others – but it’s essentially creating this stressful, fight or flight state of being.” I can relate to this – it was the adrenaline of being live on television that I craved only days after losing my babies. It made me feel alive and invincible. But a dependence on stress hormones can be dangerous, Jen says. “You don’t have to eat or sleep, because you are in survival mode.” Jen could switch off only by drowning herself in alcohol and drugs. “I wanted to slice my head off and take my brain out and put it in a bowl of water to cool down.”She’s traced the roots of this behaviour to her childhood. After her parents separated when she was two, Jen, her mother and her younger sister ended up homeless, living in a hostel before eventually moving to council housing. Her mother studied for a PhD, and instilled in Jen the idea that success meant academic achievement. Meanwhile, her father remarried and had three more children; he lived in big houses and drove fast cars. “He had this very flashy life I also wanted. How could I succeed in both of those ways, and how could I financially support my mum and sister?”It’s human to want to escape from something painful. The extent to which what you are using to escape then controls you is what needs looking atAmid all this, Jen endured years of sexual abuse. “I spoke out about it when I was 11 or 12, and then we had a court case to go through. Unfortunately, he wasn’t convicted. I’d almost say the justice process was more traumatic than the abuse itself.” Then her mother got cancer. Jen coped, she tells me, by dissociating with schoolwork. She would complete in a single evening maths books that were supposed to last her an entire term. She won a scholarship to a private school, secured the lead in the school play, a spot in the orchestra, the choir, the sports teams, a place at Cambridge University, and then her highly competitive job.After leaving rehab for substance abuse, Jen had a phased return to work, but she still found herself looking for tasks to hoard. If her work emails had been attended to, she would think about writing her will, putting reminders in her diary for when her MOT was due, “life goals, friendships you need to build, aspirations. You might have achieved things at work, but you haven’t got a kid, you haven’t got a home.” She raced through the 12 steps for her drug addiction in nine months, and then found herself volunteering to chair meetings, taking on every role and responsibility going with the fellowship. She was exhausted, but unable to stop herself. “That’s when I started looking into Workaholics Anonymous.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She’s happy for me to say that she’s in her 50s, works in consulting, has two school-aged kids and separated from their father three years ago.“I didn’t even recognise the behaviour, let alone the word, until my relationship broke down,” she tells me. Her ex accused her of being workaholic; the word jolted her, like it did me, but Sarah didn’t dispute it. Then, last year, she heard the playwrightJames Grahamtalking about going to WA meetings on anepisode of Desert Island Discs. Graham had been getting up at 5am to work, and lying to friends and family about his working hours; he would go for entire days without eating because he couldn’t stop working. “I thought, goodness, I’ve got quite a lot in common with that.”In the height of summer, Sarah would find herself pouring with sweat in her home office, not crossing the room to turn on the fan or going to fetch herself a drink of water, because it would take her away from her desk. “I am frightened of having nothing to do,” Sarah says. If a space in her schedule appears for any reason, her mind “turns in on itself” and she feels hopeless.“I do take leave, because I’ve got children, so I have to,” she says, bluntly. On holiday, Sarah blocks out time to devote to her kids, deliberately scheduling activities such as swimming that demand she leave her phone behind. “But that feels scary,” she tells me.Sarah’s role as a consultant means her time is recorded so it can be billed to clients in units of six minutes. This gamifies her job: each working day comes with a score, which can be bettered tomorrow. “It’sexcitingto get to the target, to see it go green,” she says, with sparkling eyes. “That’s a big part of where my self-esteem comes from. But then it resets every day, week, month.”This sounds like a dystopian capitalist nightmare to me, and nothing like the way I work. I love what I do, and I do it out of passion, not to fulfil time targets. But Sarah insists she loves her job, too. The problem isn’t the work itself, she says, it’s how she has come to rely on it for her basic functioning. “I literally don’t know what I would do with my day if I didn’t work.”Sarah’s first WA meeting, in February, felt like “a big relief”, she says. “People come to it for different reasons, but have one common purpose: to try to stop working obsessively. With alcohol, the goal is to stop drinking – but most people can’t give up working, so you have to find a way of doing it without being so obsessive about it.”What does sobriety look like for a workaholic? “It’s a very similar approach inOvereaters Anonymous, in the sense that you can’t abstain from food,” Jen explains. “In WA we talk about top and bottom lines – thresholds of positive and negative behaviours. Your bottom line could be not working a 70-hour week. For some people it’s not the hours worked – it could be the amount of joy you’ve experienced.”Jen has been attending meetings since March 2023. She goes once a week. “Itislike the films,” she says, with a knowing smile.“My name’s Jen and I’m a workaholic.”My work brings me incredible joy as well as adrenaline. I don’t want to find out I need to change my attitude to itOnce Jen began listening to the other people in the meetings, she saw a future where it was possible both to work and to be present and peaceful. Jen no longer works at the weekend, or on holiday. After thinking about all the things that matter to her beyond her job, she found a sperm donor and had embryos created and frozen. “I was able to do all of that because I’d freed up this space.”I tell her how uneasy I feel about the fact that I have worked through the worst times in my life. “It’s very human to want to escape from something really painful. The extent to which whatever you are using to escape is then more powerful and controlsyou– I think that’s probably what needs looking at,” Jen replies. “The best way to find out is to go to a meeting.”But I don’t want to go to a meeting, I say, because I am frightened of what I might find out. My work brings me incredible joy as well as adrenaline. I don’t want to find out I need to change my attitude to it, even though I recognise that I have used it in a pathological way.Jen looks me in the eyes. “I think if you’re frightened of going to a meeting, that’s more reason to go to one.”Mark Griffiths is one of the few academic researchers to havewrittenextensivelyonwork addiction. He is an emeritus professor at Nottingham Trent University, having specialised in behavioural addictions for 38 years before retiring this summer. I write him an email (on a Saturday, scheduling it to arrive during working hours) and to my surprise he replies within minutes of my message landing in his inbox, even though he’s not supposed to be working any more.“I’ve been a workaholic most of my adult life. Even now, in my retirement, I’m still working way too many hours a week, because I justloveit,” he tells me, almost immediately. While everyone else I’ve spoken to seems to use the words “workaholism” and “work addiction” interchangeably, Griffiths draws a distinction between them. “I’ve written a few papers trying to disaggregate the two. Healthy enthusiasms add to life, and addictions take away from it. There is no conflict in my life as a result of the fact that I work and have worked very hard for decades. So I am not addicted to work.”Conflict is the key component of any addiction, Griffiths argues, be it to gambling, sex, exercise, work, alcohol or drugs. The amount of time you spend doing something doesn’t in itself make you an addict. “For me, a work addict is somebody for whom work has completely taken over their life. They do it to the neglect of everything else, including their partner, their children, other hobbies, friendships. Very few people aregenuinelyaddicted to work.”Griffiths finished his PhD and became a lecturer at 23; back then he would work 12 hours a day, almost every day. “I got promoted very quickly and travelled the world. Everything was just great.” When he had children, he cut his working hours down, but he and his partner would both get their laptops out once their kids were in bed to carry on working. He worked as much as he could, but it didn’t have a detrimental effect on his life. This is workaholism, rather than work addiction, according to the distinction Griffiths draws, but there isn’t really an official name for this kind of behaviour; the critical thing is, work makes him feel fulfilled without causing harm or conflict in his life.‘It’s still very hard to just be’: how workaholism can leave lifelong scarsRead moreMood modification (doing something in order to achieve a buzz or high, or numbing and escape) and salience (when that thing becomes the most important activity in a person’s life) are two other key components of addiction, Griffiths continues, but these elements in themselves don’t make you an addict. “I’ve got major health problems and work, for me, is the best analgesic in the world. I’m in absolutely no pain when I’m working. Mood modification in and of itself is not negative.”When I hear this, I am flooded with relief. I tell him my personal reasons for wanting to understand work addiction, and how I have been wrestling with the idea, because I don’t want to change. And then Griffiths tells mehisstory. Five years ago, he had major spinal surgery. “It left me permanently unable to walk. I am in a wheelchair now,” he says; I hadn’t been able to tell this from the way his camera was set up on our call. Griffiths spent four days in intensive care and three months in hospital in total; it was during the height of Covid lockdown, and for the first 42 days he had no visitors.“As soon as I went on to the general ward, my partner dropped off my laptop with me, and I spent the next two and a half months solidly working. I really enjoyed it. I was giving lectures to my students from my hospital bed. I was like you, Jenny: I used work as a way to block out the fact that I was in a really crap situation.”As with my husband and children, Griffiths says his partner and grown-up kids have always known the great benefits he gets from his work. Both of us have probably taken things further than most when it comes to relying on work to modify our moods. Arguably, we have both abused work. But just as one episode of binge drinking doesn’t make you an alcoholic, abuse does not necessarily mean addiction, Griffiths says.“For a short time, youmightactually be neglecting your family and friends. But it’s episodic,” he says gently. “For you, the behaviour was functional. It was a coping mechanism. It got you through a difficult time in your life. That’s not work addiction.”We might use the word “addiction” too casually today, Griffiths says, but work addiction is real, if poorly understood, compared withgamblingandgamingdisorder, which are recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and now appear in the American Psychological Association’s diagnostic and statistical manual (DSM-5). The WHO doesrecognise burnout. That’s what people go to their GPs with, along with stress and heart problems, if they are addicted to work. “It’s the consequences of work addiction that they’ll seek help for, the long-term symptoms that have come to a head.” Still, Griffiths says, if you think you have a problem, your should go to your GP.Jen and Sarah described their work as if it were an obsession, a harmful, pathological compulsion. Griffiths described his as a life-affirming passion. I hope I will be able to find a way of keeping the rewards of my work without experiencing the harm that would make me an addict. I think that’s what I’ve managed to do, so far.The times I have felt compelled to work are when I have wanted to disappear into a simpler world of inputs and outputs, of known quantities and straightforward rewards. I have abused work when I wanted to escape reality – through the pandemic, as well as the loss of my babies – but I could have done that in far more harmful ways. And today, with my family complete, I’m very comfortable in the present.I don’t know if I will ever be able to watch the documentary I made in Norway. But I am no longer horrified at myself for making it.Explore more on these topicsWork & careersWork-life balanceMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So what does the writer make of our dystopian world?‘From (finally) being given the Booker prize to the day her partner died’:an exclusive extractfrom Margaret Atwood’s memoirSat 1 Nov 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 1 Nov 2025 08.45 EDTShareMargaret Atwood is doing her grocery shopping in her local supermarket in Toronto, and it is taking longer than usual. This is not because The Handmaid’s Tale author turns 86 this month, but because she is checking the provenance of every item before it goes in her trolley: California satsumas out; Canada spuds in. Atwood is a passionate environmentalist, but at the moment she is more worried about boycotting anything that comes from over the border in the US than air miles. “Elbows up!” she declares, taking a furious stance in the fruit and veg aisle.Back in her kitchen she shows me aYouTube skitof Canadian prime minister Mark Carney and comedian Mike Myers in the national hockey kit to explain the significance of “Elbows up”, a growing gesture of Canadian resistance. “Oh, they’re angry. They’re furious,” she says of the reaction to President Trump’sproposed plans to make Canada the 51st state of America. “We’ve not got a very big army. If they wanted to invade they could do so. But I don’t think they would. Do they have any idea what it would be like to try to occupy a hostile Canada? It would not be a joke.” Trump would have to deal with Atwood, for starters.I get hate mail, just like everybody. I don’t get as many weird sexual invitations as I used to, but I still get someView image in fullscreenT-shirt and skirt: Ulla Johnson fromholtrenfrew.com. Shawl:nouveaurichevintage.ca“I think they are worried I’m going to drop dead before the book is out,” she says of her publishers, wielding a large tray, laden with two coffee pots (one decaf), a plate of biscuits and a tin of muffins, down the stairs into her back garden, a late-summer wilderness, surrounded by maples, linden trees and silver birches. Her publishers are doing their best to stop her overexerting herself. It is an impossible task: just the week before my visit, Atwood made headlines by writinga short storyin response to a proposed ban on books with “explicit sexual content” in Alberta.The plan was withdrawn. “The Albertans are an independent-minded bunch,” she says. She has recently been fitted with a pacemaker (hence the decaf) and is on medication that will make her turn blue if she goes in the sun. Last winter, her 88-year-old brother Harold was up on his roof with a chainsaw to deal with a fallen tree, she tells me. Their mother was still clearing leaves from the roof in her 80s. I hope you don’t go up on the roof, I say, looking up at the turrets. “Only the flat bits,” she shoots back.The book in question is her memoir, Book of Lives, a whopping 624 pages edged in shocking pink to match her outfit on the cover. Since 1961, Atwood has published an average of a book a year, includingmuch‑loved novelsCat’s Eye, The Robber Bride, Alias Grace, The Blind Assassin, the MaddAddam trilogy, and the now canonical The Handmaid’s Tale and its sequel The Testaments. She has turned her hand to every genre – poetry, essays, graphic novels, even libretti – except autobiography, always insisting that she had no interest in writing about herself.The memoir is what you can remember. And what you mostly remember is catastrophes and stupid things“I’m an old-fashioned novelist. Everything in my novels came from looking at the world around,” she says. “I don’t think I have much of an inner psyche.” Two impressive water features threaten to drown out her distinctive low murmur. Everything she says is salted with irony. “I felt so left out during the age of neurosis, when everyone was supposed to go to a shrink. I went to therapy once. He was bored with me. I didn’t have anything interesting to say.”She finally gave in to the new book on the condition that it would not be autobiography, but “a memoir of sorts”, as the subtitle has it. “The memoir is what you can remember,” she clarifies. “And what you mostly remember is catastrophes and stupid things.”Written in the chatty, no-nonsense style of her essays, the book marches through the decades: the depression, the second world war, McCarthyism, the shooting of JFK, 9/11, the Iraq war, Trumpism and the pandemic all get a mention. But this is not her take on global affairs or the issues that matter most to her – women’s rights, the environment, freedom of expression, literature. She did all that in her 2022 collected essaysBurning Questions, another doorstopper, to which Book of Lives is the personal companion piece. Here, novels are given genesis stories, debts are repaid, scores are settled: the college boys who spiked her drink; the writer who turned her into a man-killing octopus (“I know who you are, or were, male person”); the Globe journalist who said her kitchen was gloomy, and worse. “Dead people, mostly,” she says now. “But, as far as living people go, truth is an absolute defence.”Was it as enjoyable to write as it is to read?“It was fun in parts,” she says. “But the parts where people are dying were not fun.”The memoir is bookended by her childhood in the Canadian outback and the death, in 2019, of her partner of many decades, the writerGraeme Gibson, giving it an almost novelistic arc. Gibson died while Atwood was in the UK on a publicity tour for The Testaments. She carried on with the tour. Their relationship is the great love story of the book; his death the major catastrophe. “Boo-hoo,” she says quietly now. Her recent short stories, poems and especially the later chapters of the memoir are heartbreaking in their descriptions of loss. But she doesn’t do grief in public, she says.The couple bought the house, now almost camouflaged by trees, in 1985. It was formerly a cult house, apparently, one of four on this wholesomely Canadian street. The walls were covered with orange shag-pile carpet, “so you couldn’t hear the screams”, she jokes grimly. Today, the walls are covered with paintings, including a large portrait of Gibson by an artist friend, Atwoodian publishing memorabilia – and books (a war section, a witches section, a Canadian history section). If there is anything cultish, it is in the many gifts that the author has been sent from fans: a knitted Atwood figure in Handmaid’s robes guarding the downstairs toilet; a tiny handmade library of all her novels, so miniature they need tweezers to be taken out. It’s not all good. “I get hate mail, just like everybody,” she says. “I don’t get quite as many weird sexual invitations as I used to, but I still get some.”The cult of Atwood, 21st-century seer and saint, has been growing steadily. In 2019, she was the first female author to make the cover ofTime magazinesince Toni Morrison two decades before. Her name comes up every year around Nobel time – her popularity probably counts her out.If the States were a full totalitarianism we would not be filming The Testaments at all. We’d be in jail, in exile, or deadView image in fullscreenDress: Greta Constantine fromholtrenfrew.comHaving lived through a publishing epoch that was dominated by postwar male American novelists (Roth, Updike, Bellow) and then the Brits (Amis, McEwan, Rushdie), there is some satisfaction that a tiny female writer from Toronto, a city barely on the literary map when Atwood started out, should have the most enduring reach. “I expect it annoys a lot of people,” she says drily. But she shakes off her status as one of the most famous authors on the planet. “Number one, I’m still alive,” she reminds me. “Which makes me the oldest living whatnot of my generation. Number two, Canadians don’t do ‘most famous’.”If she is “screamingly famous”, as she puts it in the memoir, “it’s an accident of history”, she says. “It’s because of the conjunction of the television series with actual political events.” The2017 Hulu adaptationof her 1985 classic The Handmaid’s Tale catapulted her on to the world stage. Filming began in the summer of 2016 and was still under way in November. “The election happened. Trump won,” she says. “Everybody involved woke up the next morning and thought, ‘We’re in a different show!’ Not because the show changed. It didn’t. Scripts did not change. The frame changed. Instead of thinking, ‘Oh, cute, fantasy’, people thought, ‘Oh my God, here it comes.’”At a time whenabortion has been made illegal in certain states, and people entering the US are having theirphones checked for anti-Trump views, her vision of a future America as a totalitarian theocracy in The Handmaid’s Tale seemedterrifyingly prescient. The red handmaid gowns became a global symbol of female protest, phrases from the novel were printed on placards and T-shirts. “Make Margaret Atwood Fiction Again” became a rallying cry.Nearly a decade since the TV series launched, filming has just finished in Toronto on the first season of The Testaments, in which the author has another cameo. For her first, sheappeared, fleetingly, to give Elisabeth Moss a fierce slap as one of the aunts in the original. She is forbidden to say more about the new series. Naturally, Ann Dowd returns as Aunt Lydia.“The States is not a totalitarianism – yet,” she says. “Though moving towards a concentrated-power structure. If it were a full totalitarianism we would not be filming The Testaments at all. We’d be in jail, in exile, or dead.”Back in 1985, when The Handmaid’s Tale was published, the storming of the Capitol would have been unimaginable. “The wall was still up, the cold war was still on. America was a beacon of light, freedom, democracy, you name it.” she says. “The wall comes down in 1989. People think world conflict is over. We’re just going to go shopping and we’ll all be fine. Capitalism has won. But if you destabilise a world order like that, people come in to fill the vacuum.”She pauses to allow a wasp that has settled on her pastry to fly away. “It’s this time of year. They’ve finished their reproductive cycle and they’ve got time on their hands,” she says, before taking a bite. “Napoleon Bonaparte, ‘I am the revolution’. Stalin, same thing. Trump, ‘America,c’est moi!Je suis America!’”She feels bad for the States right now. “They’re losing their world-leader status and China is going to take over if they keep on going this way,” she says. “People go, ‘Boo, Americans!’ It’s not Americans. Half of them, at least, are not at all in favour of what’s going on at all.”In one of the essays in Burning Questions, Atwood recalls advice on how to escape a crocodile: zigzag. It might serve as a description of a conversation with the author, which can swerve alarmingly across subjects and centuries: from Brexit (“A mistake. Guess what!”) back 8,000 years toDoggerland(when Britain was physically joined to Europe), from the French Revolution to zombies. You have to be wary of the teeth and the tail. As she confesses in the memoir, she has a reputation for “eviscerating interviewers”. If she has mellowed it is because journalists no longer ask why she writes such miserable novels, or if she shouldn’t do something about her hair. You still know when you’ve asked a stupid question. “And why is that, Lisa?” she will ask in a querulous, slightly scary voice.Margaret Eleanor Atwood was born on 18 November 1939. This historically ominous date, two and a half months after the onset of the second world war, shaped her worldview; the idea that power can shift quickly, devastatingly and anywhere informs nearly everything she has written.Her father, Carl, was an entomologist, and her mother, Margaret, was a school teacher before she got married. Atwood’s first years were spent in a succession of cabins in the woods of Ontario and Quebec, playing with snakes and toads with her brother Harold. Her nickname was Peggy.“You have no fear,” a later boyfriend would tell her. This fearlessness, put to tackling different sorts of snakes and toads in later life, is one of the most striking qualities of the memoir. “Not quite,” she says now. “I’m wary of bears and thunderstorms, particularly lightning.” Harold was nearly struck by lightning. “Up in the north, those are the things you’re afraid of. Drowning, a close third.”When Atwood was nine, the family moved to Toronto after her father got a job at the university. Her sister Ruth was born. She attended a proper school for the first time. In her handed-down pinafores, she was unprepared for the “unpredictable, oblique, underhanded, and byzantine nature of the power politics practised by nine- and 10-year-old girls”, she writes in the memoir. It was here that she met Sandra Sanders, who, 40 years later, would become the fictional tormentor Cordelia in her novel Cat’s Eye (often described as Lord of the Flies for girls). She learned never to be afraid of bullies again.View image in fullscreenAtwood with copies of her fourth novel Life Before Man in Los Angeles, 1980.Photograph: Wally Fong/APThe young Peggy was following in her father’s footsteps towards a career in biology. One Friday when she was 16, she was crossing the school football pitch when a four-line poem came into her head. And that was it. She was a poet. She still has the button from the dress she was wearing that day. “Never throw out anything that might be useful,” she advises now.She won a scholarship to Harvard. Every building would later be immortalised in The Handmaid’s Tale, including the Harvard Wall where the executed bodies were displayed. The college was not amused. Her first job with a market research company made its way into her debut The Edible Woman, published in 1969. It was all material.Finding a boyfriend was never a problem. “They just appeared, like mushrooms after the rain.” There’s her first teenage romance, “naturally he had a car”, the Very Nice Boyfriend of her early 20s (he’s still alive), a tryst with a poet one night in a park in Edmonton, and a prolific, nonfiction Canadian author, “The Ill-Omened Lover”, who made the mistake of considering himself the serious writer in the relationship. He’s still alive, too. She’s not telling.“Nobody thought much of it. It just happened,” she says of the general jumping into bed. “I think we probably had more fun than this generation.” In the late 60s, she married her on-off boyfriend Jim Polk, whom she had met at Harvard, “one of the odder things to happen to both of us”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He looked at Atwood and thought “canoe trips”. His first gift was a sturdy pair of work boots. They were both married to other people at the time. “In the 1970s everybody’s marriage exploded,” she says breezily.The next 48 years were filled with shared adventures: renovating farms, long visits to Europe and Australia, annual escapes to Pelee Island, in Ontario, for the spring migration, setting up various writerly and environmental projects – and canoe trips. He was so supportive of her writing that a journalist once wrote: “Every writer should be married to Graeme Gibson”, a slogan Atwood had printed on a T-shirt as a present.View image in fullscreenAtwood being interviewed in a hotel room while her partner Graeme Gibson and their daughter Jess look on, 1982.Photograph: Ross Anthony Willis/Fairfax Media/Getty ImagesTheir daughter Jess (her first name is Eleanor, Atwood’s middle name) was born in 1976. For the first time, she didn’t embark on a novel for two years. “The baby was much more important.” She wanted more children. “I would have settled for three or four,” she says now. But Gibson already had two sons from his first marriage. He also didn’t want to marry again; she did. This bothered her greatly, especially as she was hailed as a feminist role model for “having a baby outside of wedlock”. Both these disappointments are dusted off by her alter ego, an “Inner Advice Columnist” she deploys in the memoir whenever anything threatens to get too intimate. “Oh, for heaven’s sake! Many would give the shirt off their back to have your luck in men. Suck it up. Cherish your child. Get another cat.”“Of course it rankled,” she says. “But who was going to support them?” At the time they were barely making ends meet on two writers’ incomes. Today she considers herself to have three children, including her two stepsons, and three “grandkids”. “That’s enough,” she says. Gibson’s eldest, Matthew “was a better son to me than most sons are to their mothers”. Jess, an art historian, lives in Brooklyn with her partner and nine-year-old son. They spent lockdown, which came shortly after Gibson’s death, with Atwood in Toronto. Jess’s first collection of short storiesThe Good Eyewill be published next May, with a novel to come as part of a three-book deal. They are both wary of too much fuss being made of the connection, for fear it should “attract snipers”, she says. “I’ve had my child attacked in the press before.”The Handmaid’s Tale came about thanks in part to a winter spent in a fisherman’s cottage in Blakeney, Norfolk, in 1983, which was so grim she abandoned the novel she was working on. The family left for West Berlin. She rented an electric typewriter with a German keyboard and finally began the novel that she had been putting off, because it was “too weird, even for me”.Famously,the author’s rulewas only to include atrocities that had actually happened. The Pinochet regime in Chile, the baby-stealing of the Argentine generals, the fear and secrecy behind the iron curtain – all went in. When it was finished she sent the manuscript to the novelist Valerie Martin. “I think you are gonna make a lot of money,” she replied. She was right.The Handmaid’s Tale was her first of six appearances on the Booker shortlist. In 1986, she lost out to Kingsley Amis’s The Old Devils (who reads that now?). She won for The Blind Assassin in 2000, and again, controversially, for The Testaments in 2019, alongsideBernardine Evaristo, the first black female winner, for Girl, Woman, Other. “It couldn’t have gone better for me,”Evaristo has saidof their joint win.View image in fullscreenAtwood with Bernardine Evaristo, with whom she shared the 2019 Booker prize.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty ImagesAfter the success of the TV show, Atwood was increasingly expected “to do the right thing for women in all circumstances”, she explains, “with many different right things projected on to me from readers and viewers”. She has always chafed against her role as high priestess of the sisterhood. “What do we mean exactly by equality?” she will say. “Equality for who?” And there are no shortage of morally repugnant female characters in her fiction, from Zenia in The Robber Bride to Cordelia and Aunt Lydia.In 2017, she provoked afuroreby weighing in on the case of the novelist and lecturerSteven Gallowaywho was suspended from the University of British Columbia after an accusation of sexual misconduct, latercleared of all but one of the accusations in an internal investigation, although “he was fired anyway”, Atwood says. It seemed “a clear case of guilty without trial”, she writes in the memoir. Galloway did admit to an affair with a student, for which he apologised.“All I did was sign a letter asking for due process,” she says now. “Please read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. You can find it on the internet. Note: women’s rights are a subset of human rights. You can’t have one without the other.”Her views were seen as goingagainst the growing #MeToo movement, which she described as “a symptom of a broken legal system” in a 2018 op-ed entitled “Am I a Bad Feminist?”. “#MeToo is no longer the unquestionable thing that it was for a while,” she says. “Now people are talking about the manosphere. There wasn’t a manosphere, now there is one.”Her reluctance to takea clear standon the gender culture wars has also been seen as a betrayal by some feminists. By way of an answer now, she points out that one of the most“banned” books in the US is a children’s book called Tango Makes Threeabout two male penguins in a zoo who are given an egg to raise by the zoo keepers. “True story. The books being banned the most in the US right now are LGBTQ. As well as anything with race,” she says. “But I got in trouble with trans activists, too, forretweeting a piece that worried about the disappearance of the word ‘woman’. Go figure.”People have been attacking me since 1972. Been there, done that, several times on different issuesView image in fullscreenT-shirt: Ulla Johnson fromholtrenfrew.com. Shawl:nouveaurichevintage.caShe is wary of ideological absolutes. Is it true? Is it fair? Andcui bono? Who profits? She will ask on any issue. As a novelist, it is her job to ask questions, and, as she likes to points out, she can’t get sacked for her answers.Does she ever fear being cancelled, or being perceived to be on the wrong side of history? “People have been attacking me since 1972,” she replies. “Been there, done that, several times on different issues.” History doesn’t have “sides”, she corrects me. “It isn’t a road leading inevitably somewhere, as the Marxists and their Bible-induced teleology used to have it. Trends come and go. No one can predict the future with dead certainty.”Her oracular reputation means she is often asked about where the world is going. “Is there hope?” has replaced “Why do you hate men?” as a favourite question at events. As someone with a special interest in the darkest periods of humanity, and who lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis, she usually brushes aside apocalyptic gloom. Not so much recently. “It’s really pretty unsettled right now,” she says. “World power is shifting, old certainties are no longer certain. Of course we have had unsettled times in the past but we forget. It is the scariest of times.”She is often asked “quite stupidly”, she says, if she is the same person now as she was when she was young. “If I were, we would really be in trouble,” she says. “Your perspective changes as you move through time. How could it not? Time never stops.”When an old person dies, “it is not a tragedy”, she reflects, “it is the culmination of their life”. An elderly friend has elected to die next month. Medically assisted dying has been legal in Canada since 2016. Gibson was diagnosed with dementia the following year. By the end he could no longer remember the names of his beloved birds. “Certainly, Graham would have done that had he not had a massive cerebral haemorrhage,” she says.“I have used up my thread,” she writes at the end of the memoir, an allusion to the mice in Beatrix Potter’s The Tailor of Gloucester. “No more twist.”This does not mean no more books. “I’ve told my life up to the end of this chapter,” she makes clear. She is not about to retire anytime soon. “Who knows?” is all she will say. And then she is on to talking about herlatest Substack. She started it as a distraction after Gibson died and to raise money for their Pelee Island bird centre. She loves being able to comment on the world, and anything else that takes her fancy (highlights include a Halloween video and one of her tap-dancing in a hospital gown after her pacemaker was fitted). “It’s fun.” How does she find the time? “I’m a writer,” she replies.Can Xue and László Krasznahorkai are joint favourites to win 2025 Nobel prize in literatureRead moreThe next day we meet for the photoshoot at her old college, Victoria, at the University of Toronto (the students’ pub, The Cat’s Eye, was named in her honour). As she walks across the campus, there are audible gasps from students, and a boy politely asks for a selfie to send to his mum. If she were worried about her legacy – she’s not: “Other people decide that” – she clearly has a new generation of readers. The author gamely joins in a dance routine two girls are rehearsing on the lawns. One of the college staff recalls how on one visit a student produced a Sharpie and asked Atwood to sign his backside. She obliged, apparently. She can’t remember signing any bottoms, she says later, “but it sounds like the sort of thing I might do”.She rifles through the clothes the stylist has bought, like Meryl Streep in the Devil Wears Prada. “No. No. Maybe. Definitely not.” A couple of suitably gothic outfits are settled on. But she is not to be persuaded into heels. The makeup artist tells Atwood that she has launched her own range of products; finding Canadian-made cosmetics is tricky, apparently. Atwood insists on getting photos to post on Instagram. “Elbows up!” they chorus.Having a cup of tea between pictures, in a long purple satin cloak, her sparkly trainers peeping out the bottom, she looks like an off-duty Elizabeth II. “I’ve had tea with the queen,” she says. “Not recently, obviously.

A spokesperson said numerous ambulances, tactical commanders and its hazardous area response team were at the scene, adding: “We can confirm we have transported multiple patients to hospital.”One witness who was on the train recalled seeing someone move through the carriage warning others: “They’ve got a knife, I’ve been stabbed.”The witness told Sky News the man was “extremely bloodied” and that by the time the train stopped “they were basically on the floor”.“That person ended up collapsing on the floor. They were taken to an ambulance pretty much straight away,” he said.Witnesses say people wounded by the attack were seen sprinting through the train away from somebody with a knife.Later on, armed police were seen directing their weapons at a man standing on a platform with a large blade, a witness said. The man was then incapacitated with a taser and restrained.One witness said they saw between six and eight people who were wounded, while another said up to 12 may have been injured.Police said the attack happened on the 6.25pm train service from Doncaster to London King’s Cross, shortly after the LNER train left Peterborough station.View image in fullscreenThe scene at Huntingdon station on Saturday evening.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesKeir Starmer said the incident was “deeply concerning” and urged people to follow police advice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In email exchanges between the pair released on Friday, the disgraced financier suggested toMountbatten Windsoron April 15 2010 that he meet the former JP Morgan executive Jes Staley, who wasbannedfrom the UK banking sector for life in June for misleading the watchdog over his relationship with Epstein.Mountbatten Windsor replied that he would not be in the UK but would “make sure I meet [Staley] soon on another trip”.“Also I have no immediate plans to drop by New York but I think I should at some stage soon. I’ll look and see if I can make a couple of days before the summer. It would be good to catch up in person.”The pair were pictured together in Central Park in New York in December that year in a meeting that Mountbatten Windsor later called a “wrong decision”.During his disastrous 2019 interview with the BBC’s Newsnight, Mountbatten Windsor said the “sole purpose” of the visit was to halt contact with Epstein and that he met him in person because breaking the news “over the telephone was the chicken’s way of doing it”. He nevertheless stayed at Epstein’s New York mansion for several days.“I wanted to make sure that if I was going to go and see him, I had to make sure that there was enough time between his release because it wasn’t something that I was going into in a hurry, but I had to go and see him. I had to go and see him. I had to talk,” he said.Mountbatten Windsor said the conversation ended in a mutual agreement to cut contact, which he claimed to have kept to. A separate cache of court documents released in January, however,showedthat a “member of the British royal family”, believed to be the former duke, emailed Epstein saying: “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there are ways in which it could be brought in immediately.”The scheme would reportedly allow people to delay payment of the charge for several years if they did not want to liquidate their assets immediately.The Times said it was likely to be combined with a policy that would stop capital gains tax being payable on profits people made from investments before arriving in the UK.Taxexperts said this would ensure the resulting tax treatment was “fair and symmetrical” and could also encourage investors to relocate to the UK.The Treasury declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingCapital gains taxTaxRachel ReevesLabourBudget 2025newsShareReuse this content"

If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!”The warning of possible military action came after Nigeria’s president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump announcing the day before that he was designating the west African country “a country of particular concern” for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.In a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.“Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,” Tinubu said. “Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.”Trump on Friday said “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and “radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter”.Trump’s comment came weeks after the US senatorTed Cruzurged Congress to designate Africa’s most populous country a violater of religious freedom with claims of “Christian mass murder”.Nigeria’s population of 220 million people is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.Wole Soyinka, Nigerian Nobel laureate and Trump critic, says US visa revokedRead moreAttacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated attacks targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.Kimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to protect citizens of all religions.“The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion,” Ebienfa said in a statement on Saturday. “Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.”Nigeria was placed on the country-of-particular-concern list by the US for the first time in 2020 over what the state department called “systematic violations of religious freedom”. The designation, which did not single out attacks on Christians, was lifted in 2023 in what observers saw as a way to improve ties between the countries before the then-secretary of state Antony Blinken’s visit.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNigeriaUS foreign policyUS politicsUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

Of these, 108 were later found but 24 are still missing. Between 2020 and August 2025, 213 children went missing from the council’s reception centres for this group of children, with 182 found and 32 still missing.In both cases, Albanian children were the largest group to go missing, making up half the total from the Home Office hotels, 68, and more than a quarter from the reception centres, 65. The second and third largest nationalitiesto have gone missing from both places are Afghans followed by Iranians.Esme Madill, of the Migrant and Refugee Children’s Legal Unit at Islington Law Centre, said: “These figures are shocking. Behind each number is a frightened child who will already have experienced egregious human rights abuses before arriving in the UK seeking safety. When we represent children who have escaped after being trafficked whilst ‘missing’ in the UK, we see how their mental and physical health is permanently harmed by the abuse they experience during this time.“For one child to go missing represents an abject failure of the state to protect the most fragile and abused in their care. These numbers are in the hundreds.”She said more needed to be done to find the missing children. “They have not chosen to ‘go missing’. These children should be playing football in the park and preparing for their GCSEs, not servicing trafficking gangs in conditions we know include being chained to furniture, physically and sexually assaulted, and punished by being starved of food.”In December 2023, following along-running high court caserelating to lone child asylum seekers missing from all Home Office hotels, the practice of routinely accommodating children in hotels was ruled unlawful. KCC instead agreed to increase protection for these children by expanding the use of reception centres. Since that court ruling another 44 children have gone missing from these centres, with 10 still missing and 34 found.Patricia Durr, the chief executive of Every Child Protected Against Trafficking UK, said such data was always alarming.“Once a child does go missing, the risk that they are being exploited increases significantly and they are certainly more vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking,” she said.“Our research over many years shows just how [much] more at risk unaccompanied children are as they are separated from home, families, friends and communities and may have been trafficked into the UK, trafficked en route, or trafficked after arrival.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a meeting with workers’ representatives, the firm agreed to defer the rate-cut until after Christmas, but insisted it would still be implemented. Within weeks of the meeting, drivers have said, management have started to move against people they deemed “ringleaders”.“Now that we have shown them up publicly they’re just trying to assert dominance and trying to control the free will of drivers they don’t want to employ,” said one of those let go, Dean Hawkins.He was involved in organising the action and was told by a DPD manager he had been fired for allegedly breaching a gagging clause in his contract. “It’s a revenge act to assert dominance for us humiliating them,” he said.A DPD spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we have terminated our relationship with eight supplier companies following a breach of contract.”DPD Group UK’s highest-earning director was paid nearly £1.5m, including bonuses, last year, representing a pay rise of more than £90,000 from 2023.The eight cases will probably affect many more individual workers because DPD’s pool of self-employed drivers includes individual contractors and those who run fleets of vans for the company.One of the latter group was Jose Alves, whose contracts were terminated when management said he had breached a clause prohibiting involvement in “any newsworthy event or story or anything which would or in [DPD’s] opinion could damage [the firm’s] interests or reputation or any part of [its] business”.Alves has asked the firm to provide evidence, but thus far has received none.He was also told that DPD reserved the right to keep some or all of the £16,000 in deposits he had handed over when his contracts started. DPD said it would have “incurred costs by spending time sharing with you the benefit of our knowledge, skill and experience”, and that it would “also spend time and money finding a replacement for you”. “If that happens, we may keep your deposit to cover these costs,” it said.DPD said: “With any case of supplier breach of contract, it is our normal procedure to hold on to the deposit for up to 30 days to allow for vehicles to be returned and assessed for damage. Unless there is damage, we would expect to return the deposit in full and within the agreed timescale.”More than 1m UK workers to gain more rights under employment bill, says thinktankRead moreHawkins was also dismissed over claims he had breached a gagging clause. He was shown a Facebook post from around the time the rate cuts emerged, in which he wrote: “Any threats of a strike or legal action, you’re terminated, DPD don’t allow you to stand up for yourself or have a voice … This is why so many drivers across the UK are looking into striking, because God forbid we ask for a fair wage to support our families.”He said his dismissal was unfair because it was DPD – not he – who created the “newsworthy event” and that if DPD’s interests or reputation had been damaged it was the firm’s own actions that were responsible.Asked if this was a reasonable view to take, the leading employment law barrister and Labour peer John Hendy KC said: “Absolutely. It’s their action which has damaged their reputation, not the action of those who’ve reports of it.”Hendy called for a change in the law to protect drivers such as those fired by DPD. “The protection against dismissal or detriment for trade union activities only applies to the activities of an independent trade union,” he said, adding that the drivers may not enjoy such a status.“This reveals a deficiency in the existing legislation which the government should consider fulfilling. Penalising workers for making representations against detrimental changes to their terms and conditions is, quite simply, outrageous. It should be unlawful.”Explore more on these topicsJob lossesEmployment lawnewsShareReuse this content"

He is one of at least three men who had been arrested as of Saturday amid an investigation involving law enforcement agencies in multiple states.“This child … was groomed, exploited and then sexually abused by strangers who found her online,” Louisiana’s attorney general, Liz Murrill,saidin a statement on Friday. “This is just one example of the dangers of social media and of human trafficking.”Officials reported that the teenager at the center of the case – a resident of Baker,Louisiana– disappeared on about 20 October after meeting Crumity through social media. Investigators said they then tracked her across a number of states – and by Thursday, after receiving information from federal agents, Pittsburgh police discovered the girl trapped in a sheet-covered box in Crumity’s basement in the city’s Brighton Park neighborhood.The child was brought to a hospital, and there was evidence of sexual assault recovered, Guardian news-gathering partner WWL Louisiana reported, attributing that information to officials.Citing a criminal complaint, Pittsburgh news outletWTAEreported that the girl spoke to investigators in detail about what had happened to her. She purportedly said she connected with Crumity on the social media platform Snapchat – and that he promised he would help get her adopted by a trusted adult.The child said she was able to get to Pittsburgh by taking a Greyhound bus – and once at Crumity’s home, they slept in a bed in the basement along with a third person described as a woman, the criminal complaint explained.Crumity further gave the girl edibles – a term used to describe food products infused with cannabis – and sexually assaulted her repeatedly for about a week, she told investigators, according to WTAE.WTAE also said the criminal complaint quoted the girl as saying that the safest she ever felt was at the hospital where she was taken once authorities rescued her from Crumity’s basement.Crumity was denied bail after being booked into Pittsburgh’s jail, police there said.A 62-year-old man named Ronald Smith has also been arrested in Columbus, Georgia, in connection with the girl’s temporary disappearance.He and another man, Alvin Hanson, were alleged to have driven the girl from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Georgia before putting her on a bus headed north.Smith is accused of simple kidnapping and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile, authorities said.Meanwhile, Hanson, 64, was arrested in New Orleans – about 60 miles from Baton Rouge – on a count of contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile, Brian Fair of the US marshals service said.Investigators said they anticipate making more arrests in the case. They did not immediately elaborate, but the Louisiana news stationWAFBquoted officials as saying a man and a woman – both from the Washington DC area – were in Crumity’s basement at the time the girl was rescued from there.Explore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaRape and sexual assaultChildrenUS crimeLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

It was a rare moment of relief after years of fear and loss. On Tuesday night he gave an interview to a local NGO urging people to return to their homes in northern Gaza now that fighting had stopped. Just half an hour later, Zein was dead, killed in an Israeli bombing on the school where he had been sheltering in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.He died without being able to fulfil his vow to his wife that they would return to Beit Lahia and pitch a tent over the rubble, eager to be home even if their house was no longer there.“When the most recent truce was announced, Abu Luay felt so happy and relieved,” said his wife, Maryam, using a family name for him. “He told me that finally the bloodshed would stop and people could live in peace. Sadly, that feeling didn’t last. Israel violated the ceasefire again.”Zein was one of 115 people killed and 352 injured during 24 hours of Israeli bombardment ofGazathis week, according to the Gaza health ministry. The strikes came after Hamas returned body parts of a hostage whose remains Israeli troops had recovered two years before, and Palestinian militants attacked Israeli troops in southern Gaza.It was the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire was put in place on 10 October and one of the deadliest days in the whole of the two-year war.The bombings were just the latest in a series of Israeli violations of the three-week-long ceasefire in Gaza. After the initial enthusiasm over the ceasefire announcement, worry has set in among the people of Gaza. They are fearful that the ceasefire does not mean an end to the war but just less frequent and more random bursts of violence they are unable to predict. That randomness makes their own futures hard to imagine, much less to plan.Hussain Abu Munir feels the uncertainty of the ceasefire on his daily commute to work. He travels in a bus filled with other medical professionals displaced to southern Gaza to their workplaces in northern Gaza.To gather so openly with other medical professionals is already unnerving after two years of war where medical workers have become targets. At least 1,722 healthcare workers were killed during the war in Gaza, according to Medical Aid forPalestine. But the journey itself, through the Netzarim checkpoint into northern Gaza, makes Abu Munir fear for his life.“Each day we go and return, it feels like embarking on a dangerous, uncertain journey, without protection or assurance,” said the 40-year-old nurse. “My biggest fear is not for myself but for my children, whom I leave alone in the south when I go to work.”He said he was afraid Israel might close the Netzarim checkpoint while he was at work, meaning he would be unable to return to his children.On Wednesday, Israeli shells began to be fired seemingly at random as Abu Munir approached the Netzarim checkpoint. People screamed for the buses to stop but they managed to make it through unharmed.“We didn’t encounter any direct targeting on our way, but the truth is that no one can guarantee our safety,” Abu Munir said.View image in fullscreenIn Gaza the normal staples of childhood – play and learning – have been overtaken by the grim logistics of survival.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesDespite the bombing and high death toll this week, international mediators said they were confident the ceasefire would hold. Donald Trump said nothing would jeopardise the truce, while the US vice-president, JD Vance, downplayed the violence as “skirmishes”.After their statements, Israel struck Gaza again on Wednesday, this time saying it was targeting a Hamas weapons cache that was to be used in an imminent attack.The continued strikes are disturbing for those in Gaza, who worry they are being led into the same sort of ceasefire that prevails in Lebanon, where Israel carries out airstrikes daily despite a year-old truce.To Ikram Nasser, a 36-year-old English teacher, the ceasefire has so far been a disappointment. She had hoped it would provide the safety required to return her own children and her students back to the classroom after two years of interrupted education.She has watched children regressing socially as the normal staples of childhood – play and learning – have been overtaken by the grim logistics of survival.“Many have become more aggressive and rough, not because they chose to but because of the reality they’ve been forced to live. These children now chase after food distributions, aid trucks or even water tankers,” Nasser said.In the first days of the ceasefire, it seemed there would be a chance to return those children back to normality. More tents were turned into classrooms and children began to line up outside, eager to learn.“Some even arrive as early as seven in the morning, an hour before lessons begin, simply because they’ve missed learning and the feeling of normal life they were deprived of for so long,” Nasser said.This week of bombings, however, has shattered any illusions that life in Gaza could soon return to normal, for children or for adults.“Even now, we don’t feel safe,” Nasser said. “Every day brings a new violation of the ceasefire. The situation remains extremely difficult, for us as mothers and as teachers. We no longer trust the ceasefire will hold.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Even the president himself admitted to being surprised by the sweeping result.Jiménez argues that Milei needs more time. He said that, despite the setbacks, he voted for the president’s party because the opposition had “been in power too long and done too much harm”.Argentinians such as Jiménez, who are struggling to make ends meet, are now the majority.Aftertaking office in December 2023, Milei, an economist and former TV pundit, launched a deep “chainsaw” austerity plan, cutting federal spending, freezing wages and pensions, halting public works and slashing subsidies.To meet his zero-deficit target, he also introduced a “shock therapy” approach to the peso, initially devaluing it by almost 55%.On one hand, the libertarian managed to bring inflation down from more than 211% in 2023 to 32% annually by September 2025 – still high by global standards, but a level Argentinians had not seen in years.On the other hand, average incomes have fallen sharply, dragging down purchasing power, while household debt has risen and the poverty rate climbed above 50% before recently easing to 31.6%.View image in fullscreenA man walks past graffiti reading ‘Milei swindler’ in Buenos Aires.Photograph: Juan Mabromata/AFP/Getty ImagesNicolás Pedrosa, a 40-year-old mobile phone shop owner in Buenos Aires, voted for Milei in the 2023 presidential election. “Today, I deeply regret it … I wanted change, but it was too drastic,” he said.“The middle class no longer exists; you’re either poor or rich,” said Pedrosa, adding that customer traffic in his shop practically disappears by the 15th of the month as many people’s salaries have run out by then.Four months ago, in an attempt to diversify and boost sales, he started selling perfumes and incense alongside the usual phone cases and chargers. “You have to be an all-rounder to survive these days,” he said.After the initial devaluation of the peso, one of Milei’s main measures to curb inflation was burning through reserves to sell dollars and prop up the currency’s value – which, according to many analysts, has left the pesoartificially strong.To keep selling dollars, the president turned in April to a $20bn loan from the International Monetary Fund – $14bn of which has already been disbursed – and recently to a $40bn bailout from the US.The president has also lifted restrictions and lowered tariffs on imports, a move that is driving domestic industry into a “great depression”, according to Luciano Galfione, the president of Fundación Pro Tejer, which represents the textile sector.Textile manufacturers faced two problems, he said: as “the purchasing power of society has fallen dramatically”, people are buying fewer clothes, and those who can still afford them often opt for imported products, which, with the “cheap” dollar, have become more affordable.Even one of Argentina’s greatest passions is being affected. Domestic wine sales – which account for about 70% of production – fell by 17.1% in August, according to areportby the Center for Argentine Political Economy (CEPA). With the stronger peso, Argentine wine has also become more expensive abroad, and export volumes between January and August were down 8.4% from the same period last year.View image in fullscreenA protest against cuts to pensions and benefits at the Argentine National Congress in Buenos Aires, now a weekly demonstration.Photograph: Catriel Gallucci Bordoni/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“We’re not against imports; what we don’t agree with is having to compete under such absolute inequality,” said Galfione, who estimates the textile sector alone has lost 300 companies and 12,000 jobs since Milei took office.Across all sectors, between 205,000 and 250,000 formal jobs – those subject to labour laws – have been lost in Argentina over the same period, mostly in construction and manufacturing, and about 18,000 businesses have closed.“When formal jobs are lost, people have to find some way to earn an income to survive. And what usually happens is that informality increases,” said Roxana Maurizio, a professor of labour economics at the University of Buenos Aires, adding that informal workers now account for 43.2% of the labour force and that half of them don’t earn enough to get by.Despite most socioeconomic indicators showing no improvement in living standards, the “cheap” dollar, somewhat contained inflation, rejection of the opposition and fears of losing the US bailout were widely seen askey factors behind Milei’s victory.As a result, the president’s party went from a modest presence to the largest bloc when combined with the seats of the centre-right PRO, the party of former president Mauricio Macri, which has already allied itself with Milei.The bloc still falls short of the minimum majority needed to pass reforms, and the president already has three in mind – labour, tax and pensions – meaning Milei will have to seek further alliances.“He can’t fix the economy overnight when it’s been a mess for years,” said Jiménez. “I know people who are unhappy who voted for him [in 2023] and thought we were going to become a world power in a year, but he never said that.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In the afternoon sun glints on the Pearce River, shafts of light filter through native tree canopy. It is a fecund, primeval place. The water has flowed down through tunnels in Mount Arthur, in South Island’s north-west, to meet at the Pearce Resurgence at its base. On the surface it looks innocuous, a calm pond. But beneath it is one of the largest and deepest cave networks in the world; unfathomable, an unknown habitat, seemingly bottomless.Its difficulty is legendary among cave divers. To none more so than the anaesthetist and underwater explorer Dr Richard Harris, who has plunged into its dark recesses many times before he attempted a dive that no one had done before.. “It’s an intensely intimidating place to be,” Harris says in thedocumentary film Deeper, released this week.“You enter this cave that just seems to swallow you as you go into it. It’s black. You come to this abyssal drop which goes over an edge and drops down to 100 metres in depth.”View image in fullscreenThe Pearce Resurgence from the surface.Photograph: Madman EntertainmentAnd then it just keeps going.Most people’s most fundamental fear would be of being undergroundandunderwater with a finite amount of air but to Harris underwater caves contain great beauty. To him these hostile places are mysterious hydrological puzzles waiting to be solved.“Each cave is different and uniquely formed,” he tells the Guardian. “It’s an extraordinary world down there. This feeling of swimming into a new passage which you are the first person to lay eyes upon is very addictive and very exciting.“It’s very hard to describe but it gets into your system … The more you do it the more you need to do it.”Diving the Pearce Resurgence became an obsession he couldn’t explain.Deeper review – extreme cave diving documentary offers drama but lacks a little oomphRead moreThere, in 2007, diving with two “gods” of cave diving, Rick Stanton and Dave Apperley, Harris’s suit flooded, he got the bends and had to be treated with oxygen. The feeling of failure was hard to shake. “I could not stop thinking about that cave,” he says in the film.In 2008 he went down to 182 metres, further than Stanton had in 2007. He badly wanted to go further and deeper. He couldn’t let it go. But he was already at the outer reaches of doing so safely.“We risk our lives every time we put our head under,” Harris says. He has been moments from death. He has been stuck in extremely tight caves. His biggest fright was 1.7km into a cave when silt came up and he couldn’t see the little crack to go back through.“I really just couldn’t get myself back through it, so I had to start taking equipment off and pushing it through the hole to come out.” But, he says: “If you panic you are going to die. When you feel the visceral fear starting to rise you can actually talk to it and tell it, ‘This is not helping, I’ve got to concentrate on the problem.’”One particular problem would propel Harris into the international spotlight: in 2018 he and his diving companion Craig Challen became global heroes and were named Australians of the Year for their role in therescue of 12 boys stuck in a flooded Thai cave. Despite that acclaim, Harris says he never felt confident as a person and suffers from anxiety. But when he puts his head under water his anxiety and self-doubt wash away.In February 2023 Harris assembled a crack team of his boffin diving friends to attempt a descent into diving history. Harris wanted to be considered an elite diver. Pearce could deliver that proof.The Pearce Resurgence is so remote that people with equipment have to be flown in by helicopter. The water is 6C year-round. The divers will spend 13 to 16 hours in this water, most of it decompressing. It is a cold, wet place for camping. “Everything is wet,” says Deeper’s director, Jennifer Peedom, who went on a later trip. “There was no phone signal and only a 15-minute window for a satellite signal.” There would be no help coming if the mission failed.But, says Harris: “Being in that beautiful bush with a group of friends having a beer and a campfire is a big part of it.” Says Peedom: “They literally put their lives in each other’s hands. There is a real sweetness that I found really unexpected.”View image in fullscreen‘Down, down, down they go.’Photograph: Madman EntertainmentChallen had been a “willing accomplice” in exploring the Pearce Resurgence. But now, as Harris’s dive partner, their friendship would be tested to the limit. He would be Harris’s “support and observer” at unplumbed depths.In 2020 Harris had dived to 245 metres but suffered high-pressure neurological syndrome, which gave him hand tremors. Being unable to operate his equipment with his hands was extremely dangerous.Now, he planned a radical new approach. He would introduce hydrogen as a breathing gas. It had never been used for deep diving. Its slight narcotic quality could fix Harris’s tremors, allowing him to go further. But there would be helium in the mix because hydrogen and oxygen alone would be too narcotic. This would become known as “the hydrogen experiment”.Two lessons we can all learn from Dr Richard Harris | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreIf it worked, Harris would advance the science and technology of diving and future exploration. If it didn’t, Harris could explode.It was a calculated risk. Or as Harris puts it, “informed risk acceptance”. He is a meticulous man. “I spent 18 months researching it, speaking to world experts,” he says. But his team of scientists at the camp were not entirely convinced. They would literally be in uncharted waters.“I don’t think any of us were sure,” says the dive supervisor, Prof Simon Mitchell, a leading academic in diving medicine. “There were very significant risks.”Deeper was filmed over three weeks in the days counting down to the Resurgence dive. It documents things going wrong with the more than 80kg of equipment the drivers carry – dry suits, electric heated undergarments, cylinders, weight belts, hoses. There were leaks, small failures. “A failure point in the dry suit can be disastrous,” Mitchell says.One day before the big dive day the film shows Challen making the agonised decision to pull out. He does not have a good feeling. He is not in a “tip-top” frame of mind, he says – he has been too busy to prepare properly. Harris understands: “You need to be in the right headspace with a super positive attitude.”View image in fullscreen‘I shouldn’t need to get to the bottom of a cave in NZ to be OK with who I am.’Photograph: Madman EntertainmentBut then Challen has an “attitudinal change”. He decides to do it. If, he says grinning, Harris explodes: “I will pick up as many pieces as I can to bring back home.” They both say that if it goes wrong neither of them want anyone to risk their lives to collect their bodies.The night before Harris obsessively checks his equipment. He lies awake visualising the dive, anticipating when things could go wrong and how he would respond.And the day arrives. At 5am there is a distant glimmer of an apricot sunrise. As he always does, Harris wants to be left alone with his thoughts. “I like peace and quiet while I’m just slowly getting dressed in all the gear, so I don’t work up a sweat and get my heart rate up.”It’s still dark when, looking like astronauts, the men slide into the cold water. Blue flippers disappear under a rock ledge as they begin the descent.I’m obsessed with cave diving. This is the closest environment we have to spaceRead moreDown, down, down they go. And keep going. At 180 metres Harris has the tremors. At 200 metres the moment arrives. He flicks a switch to stop breathing the helium mixture and start breathing the hydrogen mixture. It is, he says, “an intimidating moment”. There is a hiss in the cylinder, a few cautious sips and he is alive and the tremors are easing. He does not blow up. “I felt incredibly relaxed and in control at that depth for the first time ever. I thought, ‘Wow, I could just keep going.’”But he turns back at the agreed 230 metres.And so began the 12-hour decompression ascent. They decompress in a series of watertight chambers with breathable gas placed at 40 metres (one hour), 28 metres (two hours), 16 metres (four hours), seven metres (five hours). By the time they reach the third chamber, “We were sort of looking at each other with dopey smiles on our faces and not really talking because we were thinking about that moment,” Harris says. “It was sublime, it was amazing.”It’s dark when they approach the surface, a circle of faces and torches looking down at them.Now with the “pride and achievement” of making diving history, Harris says, it is finally “enough”. He can’t keep doing this to his wife, Fiona, who without communication at the Pearce Resurgence has had an agonising wait at home. “I shouldn’t need to get to the bottom of a cave in NZ to be OK with who I am,” he tells the camera.He will not be returning to the Pearce Resurgence, he tells Challen.“Well, where are we going then?” Challen asks.Deeper is screening now in Australian cinemasExplore more on these topicsAustralian filmDocumentary filmsDivingExplorationNew ZealandExtreme sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wisely, this fantastically entertaining three-part documentary doesn’t attempt to rectify that. Instead, Girlbands Forever reminisces in a manner that is equal parts meaty and frothy. And, yes, often about as stomach-churning as that combination sounds.At the heart of this series – the female-focused follow-up to 2024’sBoybands Forever– is a lot of old ground. Viewers of a certain age will know the trajectories retraced here (the head-spinning arrival of Spice Girls, the scrappy ascent of Atomic Kitten, the existentially challenging lineup rotation of Sugababes, the talent-show conception of Little Mix) and the dominant themes (tabloid hell, merciless management, relentless touring, intraband resentments) like the backs of their faintly wrinkled hands.Yet via a combination of telling details, ancient-yet-still-juicy gossip, offbeat archive footage, gratifyingly frank interviewees and hearteningly little narrative hand-holding – a style recalling James Bluemel’s far more profound but similarly zingyOnce Upon a Timedocumentary strand – Girlbands Forever offers the angles that can transform familiar subject matter into must-watch TV.Episode one is the best, largely thanks to the funny and candid contributions ofAll Saints’ Melanie Blatt (or, in her words, “Mel from the 1990s”). We kick off with theannus horribilis of 1992, whose Black Wednesday wretchedness was apparently alleviated by a tranche of ultra-cool R&B girl groups from the US. Producer Ron Tom saw an opportunity for a British version – “a twinge of London, underground, edge” – in the teenage Blatt and her friend Shaznay Lewis. Meanwhile, EMI were cultivating gospel-vibed competitors Eternal. The latter had modest success, Lewis and Blatt didn’t. Both were unimpressed when the nonsense-strewn Wannabe stormed the charts in 1996 (Eternal’s Kéllé Bryan presumed it was a leaked demo) before girl power’s empty rallying cry lassoed the zeitgeist.View image in fullscreenKéllé Bryan from Eternal.Photograph: Harry Truman/BBC/Mindhouse ProductionsStrangely,Spice Girls– immediately rewarded with the stardom that had eluded Blatt and Lewis – would be the making of All Saints, now with added Appleton sisters: the group’s smouldering, stylish trip-hop-adjacent R&B could be marketed as the hip, authentic alternative to Ginger and co’s cartoonish, generically rootless pop in a press-friendly Blur v Oasis-style rivalry. It was in this Cool Britannia bonfire that the tribulations of the modern British girl group would be forged: the intrusive press commentary, the person-as-product mentality of the music world (according to Bryan, bosses sent the band to a camp where they controlled what they ate – although the head of EMI UK at the time denies any knowledge of this) and the horrific treatment of members once they became pregnant. Blatt recalls a manager pressuring her to have an abortion; by the time Scary and Posh were also with child, broadcaster Robert Kilroy-Silk was seriously asking whether these twentysomething women were responsible for encouraging tween fans to become mothers.After this first wave of “unlikely musical disruptors” – as per the slightly over-egged voiceover – came the girlband landfill. All these outfits may have been manufactured to some extent, but the short-lived likes of Girl Thing and Vanilla proved you couldn’t just mindlessly run them off a production line.Enter Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark’s Andy McCluskey, who was looking for a second act after his synthpop heyday. He found it in a vivacious backing dancer called Kerry Katona and lo, Atomic Kitten was born.Shaznay Lewis: ‘I asked my husband to describe me in three words. They were not printable’Read moreThe early 00s also birthed Mis-Teeq, who gifted the charts with UK garage-inflected pop. The raucously gobby Atomic Kitten were catnip for the era’s vicious gossip mags, leading Katona to leave the band once she thought she had found her happily ever after with Westlife’s Brian McFadden (a union she says sent both bands’ labels “absolutely fucking apeshit”). Mis-Teeq, three classy Black women, struggled to get much press coverage at all and were then – maddeningly – abandoned by the industry just after scoring a massive global hit with Scandalous.The final instalment is where the giddy nostalgia begins to peter out. In the late 00s, Sugababes’ lineup changes blurred the line between band and brand to a depressing extent, underlining that no matter how great the music was (even Atomic Kitten had their fair share of certified bangers), the girl-group industrial complex was a brutal, soulless, opportunistic business. Eventually, we reach the 2010s andLittle Mix, scions of the talent-show-and-social-media era, who achieved the most success with the least appealing music.The coda acknowledges the recentAll Saintsand Sugababes reunions, while interviewees express misguided optimism about the future of the British girlband – totally ignoring the fact it is extinct. In light of this fascinating and righteously infuriating history of these young women’s woes, it may not be a loss we should necessarily mourn.Girlbands Forever aired on BBC Two and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSpice GirlsAll SaintsLittle MixSugababesreviewsShareReuse this content"

His fur flutters as he turns, his neat button nose sniffs the air, and his eyes soften with a smile. For years, design details of the bear forPaddington the Musical, directed by Luke Sheppard, have been kept top secret. Now here he is, in his blue duffel coat and red hat. A quiet theatrical marvel. “What we’re doing,” says producer Sonia Friedman, “has never been done before.”Standing around 1.2 metres (just under 4ft) tall, the bear is beautifully round, all belly and sloping shoulders. He is not an exact replica of the Paddingtons we’ve seen in illustrations or movies, but something new. His shaggy, caramel fur has a gentle wave, and his white snout is dotted with a brown nose, ideal for sniffing out trouble. Around his neck sits a label, threaded through an old piece of string, asking for someone to look after him.View image in fullscreenSandwiched together … the principal cast of Paddington the Musical.Photograph: Jay BrooksWhen fellow producer Eliza Lumley first had the idea of doing a musical of Michael Bond’s Paddington in 2016, the immediate question was how to do the bear. “We wanted to see if it was possible to have Paddington on stage,” says Friedman, who joined the team two years in. “Just Paddington.” They tested out every idea, finding puppetry to be “gorgeous”, Lumley says, but “slightly whimsical”. The presence of puppeteers also complicated the desire to have this bear alone on stage, lost at a train station and waiting to be found.Paddington Bear given UK passport by Home OfficeRead moreThe innovative answer for this stage adaptation, written by Jessica Swale with music by Tom Fletcher, began to emerge when Neal Scanlan, creature effects artist and designer of Star Wars’ Chewbacca, pointed them towards Tahra Zafar. Having conjured creatures for Star Wars, English National Opera and that pesky monkey for PG Tips, Zafar now boasts the imponderably lovely title of “Paddington Bear designer”.“We looked back at the books and Peggy Fortnum’s beautiful illustrations,” says Zafar, “and all the different versions of Paddington over the years.” The influence of Fortnum’s designs is particularly apparent; where the movie Paddington’s face leans towards realism, Zafar’s design has Fortnum’s wide, teddy-like quality. Zafar describes the technological routes they explored as “quite fancy”, but they kept returning to simpler ideas that captured the bear’s purity. “We wanted to create something that you respond to with your heart.” The result is part toy, part real. Part tech, part costume, part magic.0:51Paddington the Musical bear revealed – videoThe heavy padded bear suit is then brought to life by the skill and partnership of two performers: Arti Shah and James Hameed. Over years of workshops, the duo have formed a unique synchrony that allows us to believe we are watching a walking, talking, singing – and occasionally dancing – Peruvian bear. Shah’s experience as a creature performer for film has prepared her for physically playing the bear, while Hameed provides the voice, with the twinned nature of the role never hidden from the audience. At a recent workshop, a child supplied a more fitting description of Hameed’s role when she marched up to him and announced: “You’re Paddington’s soul.”Hameed also remotely puppeteers Paddington’s facial expressions using a control panel. This means he is in charge of the bear’s infamous hard stare. These controls were originally a separate role, but through workshops, they found that the instinctual relationship between the pair cut any delay in Paddington’s reactions. As an avid gamer, Hameed was thrilled.View image in fullscreenThe bear necessities … James Hameed and Arti Shah.Photograph: Jay BrooksPhysically performing inside the bear requires immense strength, stamina and skill. “Before we started rehearsals I sat in the sauna for a whole week, every day, in my blacks,” says Shah. “It was a way of training my mind. The bear is not as hot as the sauna.” She has experience with such unusual performance constraints. When she was in the movie Attack the Block, she was required to run on all fours in a costume that weighed half her bodyweight and had arm extensions. “This is so much lighter,” she laughs.While eight shows a week creates new physical challenges (actors Abbie Purvis and Ali Sarebani are alternate Paddington performers), the theatre also brings new joys; this musical will be Shah’s first experience of taking a bow. “It hasn’t sunk in,” she says. “I’m just humbled and excited to be doing this, especially being a female Asian of short stature. To show my young son, who has been diagnosed with my condition, that anything is possible.” An enormous fan of the books and movies, her son is frequently found singing Fletcher’s songs from the show. “I’m doing this for him,” Shah says.For many of the team, the bear holds an emotional resonance that goes beyond nostalgia for bedtime stories. “Paddington means something different to everyone,” Hameed says. “My father came over in the 70s from Pakistan, looking for a home. For my British mum, Paddington was manners, tea and marmalade sandwiches. For my dad, he was a visualisation of his own story.”When Bond first wrote A Bear Called Paddington in 1958, he described an evacuee’s label around the character’s neck that read: “Please look after this bear.” The team behind Paddington the Musical evidently takes this role seriously. Zafar mentions a label her team have sewn on to the bottom of one of Paddington’s paws: “Made in Peru.”“It’s quite subtle,” Zafar says. “I don’t think anyone’s going to see it, but we know it’s there.” It’s a mark of the care and attention that has gone into crafting this bear. “I think when you really love making something, that love gets transferred to the thing you’re creating. I’m hoping that’s what you see in Paddington. All that love on stage.”Paddington the Musical is at the Savoy theatre, London.Explore more on these topicsMusicalsPaddingtonActingChildrenTheatreWest EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was excited to meet the cast, who’d already started filming in Batam, Indonesia. After a flight from London to Singapore, then a ferry to Riau Islands, I arrived at my chalet. Even though it was late, I was invited to join the others at one of the villas.About 20 people were gathered, eating, drinking and chatting loudly. I was given a drink and a bowl of noodles, then shortly afterwards the director and showrunner asked me to read a scene with one of the actors, Adinia. She was so graceful and precise in her reading, I remember sitting across from this woman and being in complete awe of her.Adinia was from Indonesia, and another actor called Toshi was from Japan. The three of us became really close friends. We bonded over the power of stories, and we worked on our scripts together for the ambitious mie goreng western that is Grisse. Adinia was the daughter of a rebel leader. I was the Scarlet Pimpernel-type clown. It was a wild ride and when the show wrapped, we stayed in touch as friends.The moment I knew: I found their pyjamas under my pillow and felt butterfliesRead moreMonths later, I was back in Melbourne, waiting tables at a restaurant between jobs. Adinia, who was busy acting on film and TV shows, reached out to say she’d be visiting with friends. We met at Flinders Street station on a cold but sunny winter’s day. It felt really cool, exciting, to be wandering around my home town with her. She was endlessly curious about me, and I felt the same about her.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWe didn’t say it out loud, but around that time we became exclusive. I’d fly to Jakarta or Bali (where her dad lives) and spend incredible weeks with her – followed by weeks and weeks apart. I didn’t speak Indonesian at the time, so every trip was a new discovery about each other and our cultures.Later that year, when Adinia came to visit over summer, we were housesitting for friends in Melbourne. It was New Year’s Day, and I woke up with Adinia by my side. I flicked through little Polaroids I have of us in my wallet – picnics in Footscray, eating pork ribs in Ubud, on set in Batam. Then I picked up my sudoku book from the bedside table. As I started riffling through it I spotted a handwritten note at the bottom of one of the pages, in the right-hand corner of puzzle 239. It read: “I love you. Adinia.”View image in fullscreenMichael and Adinia in 2019It felt like a cork popping out of a bottle. It was the only thing in the world at that moment. We hadn’t said the three words to each other before, so after a breath I nudged her awake. She nodded, smiled, and I said it back. I’ve always felt as if I have known this woman over many lifetimes before.It was tricky to date long distance, and when the pandemic hit we’d spend our evenings on FaceTime, or playing Ghost Recon Breakpoint, hunting bad guys in fictional worlds.We briefly lived together in Jakarta before I went back to Australia to do a play. When the next wave of Covid lockdowns happened, we spent close to a year apart. It was incredibly difficult.Adinia was filming a Netflix show, and I ended up working as a secretary in my local GP clinic. That was when I started to save up for an engagement ring. Even though the situation was tough, I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this woman. I video-called her father to ask for his blessing.View image in fullscreenMichael and Adinia in rehearsals for Bell Shakespeare’s Romeo & Juliet, 2025.Photograph: Brett Boardman Photography 2024In 2023, we married.

We split our time between Melbourne and Jakarta now, always happy to return to our Australian shepherd Batu – the fluffiest boy you’ve ever met.

Whenever I’m on my period, I need Papa John’s. After a photoshoot, everyone knows we’re getting Papa John’s. In LA you have access to so much bougie pizza. No, I want Papa John’s pizza.On your new album you’re exploring an alter ego called Gadget Girl; what’s the number one gadget you can’t live without?Yeah I’ve always been a gadget girl, but I’m putting it to the forefront this time; it’s always enhanced what I’ve done, and I think it’ll be a cool narrative on stage – a sci-fi thing. I can’t live without my electric violin and loop station: that’s how I start all my songs. If I were to make a gadget, it would be basically that, all in one – like a Midi violin. Midi pianos are so accessible and affordable – [I’d invent] a Midi violin that can do the same thing.What book do you return to, and why?African Music: A People’s Art by Francis Bebey. It’s about the different string instruments in Africa and how they’re played, and what tribes play them. And also, right now I keep going back to Stillness Speaks by Eckhart Tolle; it’s light poetry about life, and it’s really inspirational. And you don’t need to read the whole book – when you don’t have a lot of time, you can just open up to any page.Rosie O’Donnell: ‘Meat Loaf’s mother wrote me and said, “You can’t be mean to my son”’Read moreWhen you’re on the road, what’s the first thing you do when you get to your hotel room?Set a vibe: make sure the lights are good; if I have a candle, I’ll light it. And I lay out everything, get my makeup and everything on the counter. And I turn the air-con off, because I don’t like being cold.What’s your most controversial pop culture opinion?That pop culture is stupid in general. Who gives a fuck about what other people are doing?What’s the best lesson you learned from someone you’ve worked with?That you have the final say when it comes to your art. And to stay true to that, no matter what.I learned that from working with every person I’ve ever worked with. Because usually people get invested in the art too, and they start to have their own ideas. If you’re working with a producer, they might take the lead in certain ways. And you have to be a little more direct when it comes to that, like saying, “Actually, I don’t like that.”What habit are you trying to kick?I’m trying to eliminate as much processed food out of my diet as possible and just eat real food every day. That’s hard sometimes, especially when you’re on tour and you want to get quick food, but I really want to make sure I bring a little cutting board and stuff so I can get groceries and cut up some vegetables, buy some meat.What’s the strangest thing in your fridge right now?Probably the sea moss that has a bunch of random shit in it that makes me go to the bathroom really bad. It’s got a bunch of probiotics in it – it’s supposed to be good for you.What do you do when you procrastinate?I doomscroll. I do tutorials on how to do something weird in a program or with gear. Or I will clean up: I think, “Oh, I’ll be able to get this done if I clean up, because then it’ll be clean” – but then I just go to bed.Tell us a favourite fact that you recently learned.I’m 100% that bitch.Sudan Archives’ third album, The BPM, is out on Stones Throw.

This worked in the show’s favor, since tonight’s installment, titled The Woman in the Hat, is very much a Halloween special.After shuttering Tegridy Farms, the Marsh family find themselves rudderless, living out of motels while patriarch Randy looks for work (thanks to thefederal government shutdown, he can’t go back to his former job as a government geologist). Out of desperation, Randy moves his family into the old folks’ home where he’s stashed his elderly father.‘Explicit and outrageous’: South Park is back with its most gratuitous episode since naked TrumpRead moreThis leads a bitter Stan Marsh to lament that “South Park sucks now … and it’s because of this political shit”. Reminiscing about simpler times when the boys used to do things together, he teams up with best friends Kyle and Kenny, as well as Kyle’s uber-stereotypical relative from New York, Cousin Kyle, to launch a new meme coin. Cousin Kyle works his “savvy Jew-jitsu” to “screw a lot of people out of their money”.Meanwhile, in Washington DC, President Trump oversees the destruction of the White House’s East Wing. Although he’s promised his lover Satan that the remodeling is for a new nursery for their forthcoming love child, he fully intends to build yet another party space for himself. Trump’s plans get derailed when he receives word from his inner circle – including a brown-nosed Pam Bondi (her face covered in literal feces, or “rectoplasm”) and a ghoulish Stephen Miller – that unknown forces are conspiring to kill his and Satan’s baby. Despite attempting to force an abortion himself, an already paranoid Trump is freaked out by the news, and he finds himself haunted by the ghostly specter of wife Melania, appearing as a ghostly figure from out of a J-horror film, a la The Ring or The Grudge.(The true murderous mastermind behind everything, JD Vance, continues to plot with co-conspirator Peter Thiel, who is keeping a demonically possessed Eric Cartman on ice.)These disparate threads converge when Cousin Kyle seeks out White House approval for the boys’ crypto dump, only to find himself part of an impromptu seance alongside Trump, Bondi, Miller, Vance, Don Jr, Kristi Noem and FCC head Brendan Carr (still suffering from injuries sustained a few episodes back). A ghostly wrath descends upon the party and threatens to expose both Trump’s Epstein ties and Vance’s power grab until Cousin Kyle, ravaged by guilt, admits that “crypto’s just a money-laundering scheme for the rich to get richer!” Cut to a screeching Fox News alert announcing that Bondi – her entire face still covered in feces – has indicted Cousin Kyle for crypto fraud. He gets sentenced to 10 years in prison, while Bondi vows to “indict anyone who says bad stuff about our amazing president”.Back home, a defeated Stan realizes that “there’s just no really going back to the way things used to be”. Kyle attempts to console him, promising that things will return to normal at some point down the line, but the dark, Shining-esque note that the episode closes on casts doubt on this.Another solid building block in what, when all is said and done, promises to be South Park’s most ambitious season (or two seasons) yet. While the show has always tackled current events, its never folded them into its long-term storytelling in such a way.At the same time, series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker clearly recognize that the fervency of these latest seasons’ political satire is alienating some of their longtime fans, who likely feel that the show has gone too far in this direction. The self-satirizing within this episode may not placate those critics, but it puts Stone and Parker’s perspective into sharp relief: as the world has changed, so too has South Park. Per voice-of-reason Kyle, there’s no point in trying to go back to simpler times – all anyone can do is “make the most of where we are”.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkAnimation on TVTelevisionUS televisionTV comedyComedyUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has a regular spot in the seats behind the press box. He has one of those voices that makes you duck your head every time he shouts out, it carries clean across the ground and sounds as if he is drowning in gravel.After 25 years of coming here I have no idea if he is a brigadier, mind, or has a rank, or whether it is even the same person in every Test or just any one of a number of interchangeable Twickenham men from the home counties. On Saturday he began by shouting: “Bloody hit him” as Immanuel Feyi-Waboso went haring downfield after George’s Ford’s first kick from hand. This was followed with a full-throated “Yes” when Feyi-Waboso clattered into whichever Australian it was who caught it.Pollock proves the key before England cavalry seal victory over AustraliaRead moreThe brigadier isn’t a complicated sort. He doesn’t need the Rugby Football Union to employ a DJ to spin Hey Baby on the decks in a live set at half-time or a rackety brass band to parp out Sweet Caroline whenever the clock stops during the match. He just wants to see England score some tries and smash some people; if they can bully the scrums and bash out a couple of rolling mauls so much the better.For the first hour of this year’sAutumn Nations Series, he did not have a lot to shout about. About the 60-minute mark, Twickenham was so quiet that if you shut your eyes it sounded more like a summer afternoon at Lord’s.The place had picked up when Steve Borthwick brought on his first round of replacements on 50 minutes: Tom Curry, Ellis Genge, Will Stuart, Henry Pollock and Luke Cowan-Dickie entered together and for the first time you felt like Borthwick had his first XV on the pitch. Or something closer to it, anyway, because Fin Smith, who surely ought to be his starting fly-half, was made to wait another 20 minutes before he was brought on to join them.Borthwick is in the rare position of having three fine fly-halves to pick from, with a fourth, Owen Farrell, waiting off-stage. It is not clear if he knows which is the best of them or whether he plans to keep switching them according to whatever the gameplan is for the opposition that week. This time last year Marcus Smith was starting, eight months ago Fin Smith had replaced him, Now he has gone back to Ford, who was allowed to lead the team out in honour of his 100th cap, which he won on tour in Argentina in the summer. Twickenham man gave him a good cheer, but he was even louder when Fin Smith replaced him.View image in fullscreenThe England head coach, Steve Borthwick (centre), is spoiled for choice at fly-half.Photograph: Alastair Grant/APFord’s rugby is the sort of subtle game that makes Twickenham man pick up his second screen. In these late days of his career, Ford has honed his play to such a fine point that you sometimes have to squint to see what he is doing. Look for the action, then look 15 yards away from it, and that is where you will find him, ambling away on the edge of the play, watching, mind whirring.Often as not he will have one arm up, ordering one of his teammates into a different position. At this point, he is practically a player-coach: it is Ford who does the large part of the talking in the team huddles when the other team scores and Ford who swaps messages back and forth with the coaches before and during the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He doesn’t sprint unless he has to and you guess his post-match GPS stats are something like those a shepherd clocks up during a long day whistling at his sheepdog. But it is a treat to watch him when he does spring into life. He carries the ball out in front of him, like he is a butler rushing a tureen-full of hot soup up from the kitchen. His passes never fly to the spot where the man is, but always to the spot where he will be in however many split seconds it takes the ball to travel the distance between them. It is like watching the cogs in a Swiss clock.Ford made every tackle, too, even when Australia kept sending Hunter Paisami barrelling down his channel. Paisami caught him three times, but Ford is one of those rubbery players who just bounces back to his feet and gets back in the line after he has been flattened.You guess he could kick to pick out whichever square inch of the grass you asked him to, it is just a shame he only shows them off when the team has advantage. But then Borthwick does not want his fly-half to take risks, otherwise he would be playing one of the Smiths.Explore more on these topicsAutumn Nations SeriesEngland rugby union teamAustralia rugby union teamAustralia sportRugby unionanalysisShareReuse this content"

But it’s easy to stand by your man when victory is in sight. A more significant rendition came at nil-nil, when the pressure was still firmly on and Dominik Szoboszlai had just squandered a glorious chance to punish the kind of lackadaisical defending that would ultimately prove Aston Villa’s downfall. Support for Slot was unequivocal when it mattered most.Slot hails ‘special’ Salah for reaching 250 goal Liverpool milestone in Aston Villa winRead moreLiverpool, the Premier League’s crisis club before kick-off after six defeats in seven games, sit third in the table after starting an important week with a deserved win against Villa. A first clean sheet in 11 games reflected a more controlled performance from thePremier Leaguechampions and, as Slot admitted, a change in fortune. Unai Emery’s team struck the woodwork twice when the game was delicately poised but would prove the perfect guests for a team and head coach in need of recovery.A terrible mistake by Emiliano Martínez presentedMohamed Salahwith his 250th Liverpool goal before more poor defending enabled Ryan Gravenberch to double the hosts’ advantage early in the second half. Slot was appreciative of both the personal backing and the collective endeavour needed to halt the slide. “It meant a lot,” he said of hearing his name. “Especially because it happened at nil-nil and not when we were leading or top of the league but in a difficult moment for me.”An incontrovertible factor in Liverpool’s dramatic slump had been their habit of conceding first and having to then take more risks while chasing the game. It almost happened for an eighth game in succession when Morgan Rogers split the home defence with a superb ball into Ollie Watkins. The Villa striker returned possession to his England colleague and he stepped across Conor Bradley to curl a shot towards the far corner. Giorgi Mamardashvili was well beaten in theLiverpoolgoal but Rogers’ effort struck the far post and rebounded clear.It was a reprieve that Slot’s side desperately needed with only five minutes on the clock and confidence low. It was also the cue for a highly entertaining, flowing contest. Both teams threatened repeatedly. Liverpool performed with far more aggression and urgency than of late with Szoboszlai a marauding presence again and Salah looking much sharper as he tormented Lucas Digne. Villa looked dangerous every time they broke the Liverpool press. They took some almighty risks to do so, however, and were close to gifting the champions the breakthrough twice before Martínez landed the visitors in it in first-half stoppage time.View image in fullscreenRyan Gravenberch fires home Liverpool’s second goal in the 58th minute.Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty ImagesThe Villa goalkeeper erred earlier in the game when dragging a poor clearance straight to Andy Robertson. He escaped on that occasion when the recalled left-back’s shot looped off Pau Torres and landed in his arms. Next up with a gift was Boubacar Kamara, who put Torres in trouble with a needless return pass that Szoboszlai intercepted with ease. The Liverpool midfielder found himself with only Martínez to beat but stroked a tame shot straight at him. A rare blemish on the Hungary captain’s night.Villa struck the woodwork a second time when Matty Cash made an ambitious attempt for Mamardashvili’s top corner. The right-back’s shot took a slight deflection off Virgil van Dijk before the Georgia international superbly tipped it on to the bar.Hugo Ekitiké had been anonymous at the head of Liverpool’s attack but, like all good strikers, made his first meaningful contribution count when heading Szoboszlai’s beautiful cross inside Martínez’s bottom corner. Liverpool celebrations, and attached sense of relief, were cut short, however, when the video assistant referee disallowed the header for a clear offside against Ekitiké. Liverpool celebrations, and attached sense of relief, soon flooded back thanks to Martínez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A quite dreadful ball went straight to Salah instead. The much-scrutinised striker made light work of his second goal in two games, sliding the ball around Torres and into an unguarded Villa net for the latest milestone in his phenomenal Liverpool career.To Emery’s despair, the Villa defence were not done with dangerous over-elaboration and presenting Liverpool with opportunity. Just before the hour Martínez squared another risky pass to Torres who, under pressure, swiped a clearance towards Van Dijk. Liverpool worked the ball to Gravenberch in space and the influential midfielder let fly from 20 yards with a shot that took a touch off both Ezri Konsa and Torres before beating the wrongfooted Villa keeper.Slot’s reaction, indeed the reaction of the Liverpool team and support, encapsulated the release of pressure.

The trapped energy, the collisions. The sense of something always but never really happening.Oh yes. Watching the full 90 minutes of Chelsea’s narrow but still comfortable 1-0 defeat of Tottenham was like staring at one of those hypnotic drunken city centre brawls that appear on social media from time to time, where nothing ever really seems to start or stop, where the whole thing is just a kind of tortured flailing, but one that must also be pored over endlessly in the comments.João Pedro ends goal drought as Chelsea earn narrow victory at TottenhamRead moreA man in a red hoodie is doing air kung fu kicks. Haymakers are being thrown at no one in particular. Someone falls through a fire door. Yellow-jacketed man tries to break it up, wanders off, comes back waving a bin lid. It is undeniably mesmerising. Energy of some kind is definitely being expended. But you can’t help thinking if only someone could actually land a blow, just one, they could put the whole thing to bed pretty quickly.It was fitting it should be Moisés Caicedo who provided that moment of incision atTottenham HotspurStadium. Not just because he was the best player on the pitch, but because this was also a game that might have been designed just to showcase his own extreme skillset, the king of broken play, the Maradona of the crash tackle.It was also fitting the goal was made by counterpressing, the only effective creative element on the pitch. And fitting in a poor Spurs performance that it should be Xavi Simons who made the vital mistake. Simons is a good passer, but was basically chased, harried and generally beaten up during his time on the pitch. There are games, styles, formations that will suit the very specific talents of Simons. Spurs offered none of those things here.Simons it was who gave a short pass to Micky van de Ven close to his own goal. Cue Caicedo, all over it like a one man zombie horde, walking through challenges, lunges, blocks. The ball eventually bobbled to João Pedro, who put it away.Caicedo was excellent here. He is remarkably strong and utterly focused on protecting and using the ball. In stoppage time at the end of 90 minutes he took the ball from Mohammed Kudus, was bumped over three times, got up, sprawled back down windmilling to win it back, a footballer who always seems to be bursting through windows, leaping across ravines, his own one-man Indiana Jones-style chase scene.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank tries to urge his team on but Tottenham had a day to forget.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAOtherwise, well what? Perhaps this game can be added to the list of things that demand Mikel Arteta has NO EXCUSES if Arsenal don’t win the league. Certainly watching this kind of thing it becomes clearer why Arsenal are so good, so coherent, so settled, so free of glitches by comparison.Tottenham Hotspur Stadium had been a feverish, bitty, gusty kind of place at kick-off. And from the start this was like a chess match, just not a very good chess match, a chess match where neither team had any knights or a queen.Thomas Frank bobbed up repeatedly, a little fraught from the start, waving a notepad, whirling his arms, looking as ever like a legendary pan-European warehouse rave impresario glimpsed furiously chewing gum in the VIP section of an Oslo jam factory all-nighter.Strange things kept happening. Lucas Bergvall had to be dragged off the pitch after suffering a concussion early on. Somebody threw two empty Jack Daniel’s hotel miniatures on to the pitch as Kevin Danso was preparing to take a throw. Six minutes after coming on midway through the second half, Jamie Gittens could be seen calling urgently for something from the Chelsea bench. Finally a pair of gloves was hurled on to the field. He pulled them on urgently. At that point he had touched the ball exactly zero times.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Players and fans took great pleasure in winning this, the most pissy and spiky of all not-quite-local London derbies. The team showed spirit and will. The real takeaway was what this game said about Tottenham, and about the state of the league in general.Spurs could have gone second had they won. It is clearly a false position. This is a half-finished construction site of a team, a pile of sticks leaning against a wall, some plasterboard, some abandoned paint brushes.Salah and Gravenberch secure welcome win for Liverpool against Aston VillaRead moreHere Spurs were just really poor. They seemed always to be passing backwards. Even the set pieces were confused. But then Frank is being asked to create something coherent out of the leftovers of discontinued regimes, and a squad that looks short on talent, all the while playing three games a week.Clearly something isn’t quite right. There seemed to be communication issues between Frank’s staff and the players at times, even between the manager and his players at the end. But Frank is also in a very strange situation, in charge of a team that going into the match were third in the league, but also under pressure to find a way of playing, of winning at home, of generating attacking patterns.The entire setup is unforgivably vague. Here is a club that have had six people calling themselves the head coach in the last five and a half years, that have cartwheeled around making odd signings – £110m this summer on two very standard attackers – all the while constructing a world-class ground in which to stage events to pay back the debt on their world-class ground. What kind of team are they expecting to have at the end of this? A settled one? One with a clear sense of identity and purpose?You might also ask why the Premier League so often does this to itself. Why does any functioning team have to emerge through a fug of incoherence, bodged planning, zigzagging strategy? Imagine if these hugely wealthy and powerful sports clubs could be run coherently, just for a while. This was a meeting of the most expensively assembled squad in world football against the team with the best stadium in the world. It didn’t exactly look like it.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Almost nine years to the day since Ireland’s milestone first victory in the fixture, the All Blacks gained revenge at Soldier Field thanks to tries from Ardie Savea, Tamaiti Williams, Wallace Sititi and Cam Roigard.Ireland 13-26 New Zealand: rugby union Test – as it happenedRead moreIreland initially overcame the controversial third-minute dismissal of Beirne for a high tackle on Beauden Barrett, who landed three conversions, to lead through a Tadhg Furlong score and eight points from Jack Crowley. But the All Blacks underlined their class in the second half to cruise to victory deservedly.The back-row Savea, who came off the bench in the 2016 loss, said: “That was nine years ago, but it is nice to come here and rectify that. We’ll enjoy tonight and celebrate the win.”Talk ofIreland’s landmark 40-29 successfuelled the buildup to a sold-out showdown. Irish hopes of repeating that result suffered a swift setback when the lock Beirne was sent to the sin-bin for an upright challenge on Barrett, pending a review. New Zealand were also dealt an early blow, with Scott Barrett, their captain, limping off.The fly-half Crowley scored a penalty to give Andy Farrell’s side the lead in the stop-start opening before Beirne’s punishment was upgraded to a 20-minute red card by the French referee Pierre Brousset. In spite of Ireland’s temporary numerical disadvantage, the prop Furlong – one of four members of the 2016 team in Ireland’s matchday squad – powered over for the opening try in the 16th minute, only for the All Blacks to hit back quickly through a superb score from Savea after losing the centre Jordie Barrett to a knee injury.Ireland v New Zealand has developed into a genuine rivalry in recent years, with each side beginning the day with five wins apiece from the past 10 meetings, including the previous clash in the United States. After a big buildup, this encounter was more scrappy than scintillating, not helped by frequent stoppages, which often quelled the capacity crowd.View image in fullscreenNew Zealand’s Fabian Holland wins a lineout at the home of the Chicago Bears NFL team.Photograph: Erin Hooley/APIain Henderson eventually replaced Beirne before Caelan Doris made his first appearance since suffering a shoulder injury in May after James Ryan was temporarily forced off for a head injury assessment. Ireland carried a 10-7 lead into the break, which Crowley increased by three points by slotting over a straightforward penalty after missing an earlier attempt.New Zealand had been well below their free-flowing best but led for the first time in the 63rd minute when Jordie Barrett added the extras after the replacement prop Williams bulldozed over. Scott Robertson’s team quickly added a third try to take control of the contest. Barrett brilliantly held his pass for the charging Damian McKenzie, who raced into Ireland’s 22 and popped the ball to Sititi to claim his first Test try, with the successful conversion making it 21-13.The scrum-half Roigard wriggled over to extinguish any prospect of an Ireland fightback as Farrell’s first match leading Ireland since his sabbatical with the British & Irish Lions ended in defeat before Dublin appointments with Japan, Australia and South Africa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Giorgi Mamardashvili leaves his goal and sidefoots into touch. The sense of expectation is palpable. Michael Kayode trots over from right-back to the opposite flank to take the throw-in. He dries the ball, measures his run, steps back and then in one languid fluid movement hurls the ball in to the near post. Liverpool clear. Two minutes later, it happens again. This time, Mamardashvili tries to play the ball to Bradley, who miscontrols to concede the throw-in. And this time, Kayode’s throw is flicked on by Kristoffer Ajer and volleyed home by Dango Ouattara. There are still only five minutes of Brentford’s game against Liverpool played. Welcome to the modernPremier League.Only nine of the 241 goals scored in the Premier League going into this weekend have come from throw-ins, but it feels like far more. Forty-five have come from corners – 18.7%. Were that proportion to be maintained over the season it would present a remarkable leap on the high of 14.2% from 2010-11. The reality is there’s likely to be a regression to the mean: if a glance at the proportion of goals scored from corners shows anything, it’s that there really isn’t much of a pattern at all. The proportion hovered at 11 or 12% most years to 2009, since when it has been at 13-14% – a trend which, if anything, goes against the assumption that everybody stopped taking corners seriously in the peak years ofguardiolismoonly to rediscover their love of a booming inswinger last season (when, in fact, the proportion of goals from corners fell to its lowest level since 2013-14).Football Daily | Tactics derived from AI? ‘The algorithms are watching’Read moreYet something is clearly going on. To watchArsenal’s win over Crystal Palacefollowed byReal Madrid’s victory against Barcelonalast Sunday was to witness two extremely different interpretations of the sport (although even in Spain, just under 14% of goals this season have come from set plays). The suddenness of the change in the approach in England has been remarkable, all the more so for how evident it is among elite sides. It’s as though the past two decades of patient approach work, controlling the game through possession, have been swept away, an unfortunate phase English football went through and now regrets. It seems barely believable that the game allowed itself for a time to be convinced by the early data boffins that set plays weren’t really that important, that fans were misguided in their excitement at a corner.It turns out that if teams weren’t regularly creating chances from set plays, they were just doing them wrong. But even if this is in effect English football growing out of its gap-year affectations, snuffing out the joss sticks and putting the beads and the kaftan back in the drawer, it’s still worth asking why it’s done so now, and what it may mean for the future.View image in fullscreenEmiliano Martínez appeals for a foul as Tottenham swing in a corner against Aston Villa.Photograph: John Patrick Fletcher/Action Plus/ShutterstockTo an extent this is an evolution of the influence of data. Corners are fixed points, much easier to analyse and control than the chaotic fluidity of open play. Runs, feints and blocking moves can be rehearsed in training and repeated to order in games. It may even be that set plays represent the most efficient way to break down a low block, which elite sides have increasingly found themselves facing as the financial inequalities within the game make it less and less feasible for the majority of opponents to take them on in open play.But it’s also to do with circumstance. In January, Pep Guardiola acknowledged that Bournemouth, Brighton and Newcastle were at the cutting edge of the game. “Modern football,” he said, “is not positional, you have to ride the rhythm.” That was widely taken as meaning that runners were essential, an acceptance that hisjuego de posiciónhad become predictable. But his broader point was that the packed modern calendar meant there was such a toll on players, so little time to recover, that the precise planning required for his preferred style had become impossible.What is possible, though, is planning set pieces, something Mikel Arteta seems to have recognised before anybody else. Arsenal have scored seven goals from corners this season, more than anybody else in the Premier League; that represents 44% of their total, a higher proportion than anybody else.Is this, then, the future? Is this what football is to be, a series of set plays – throw-ins or corners, the odd free-kick – interspersed with brief passages of action? One of the most obvious effects of earlyguardiolismowas the return of the diminutive technical midfielder. Barcelona may persist with Pedri and Fermín López, Liverpool are doing their best with Florian Wirtz and Alexis Mac Allister, but is the future of midfielders for them to be hulking figures, grafters and tacklers who may be able to get on the end of a corner?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s more than 40 years since the notoriously athletic former West Germany international Hans-Peter Briegel was declared the footballer of the future, but the sport still accommodates a range of heights and shapes. Tactical styles come and go.Guardiolismois in retreat in the face of the set-piece orthodoxy, but a new challenge will arise.Football over its history has proved remarkably flexible and resilient; unlike, say, rugby union or hockey, it has very rarely needed law changes to resolve tactical issues.The International Football Association Board, concerned by a fall in ball-in-play time as players prepare for long throws, isconsidering a 30-second limiton taking a throw (although if this is a decision based on entertainment, it’s arguable that Brentford fans derive more pleasure from the anticipation of Kayode than they would from a quickly taken throw that leads to the ball being lost) but the reality is that defenders will probably work out a way of clearing throws – which may even be as simple as picking centre-backs for how well they can mark and head rather than their range of passing – and the present trend will fade away.Football exists in a state of constant evolution. After the possession-heavy years ofguardiolismo, the game as an exercise of strategy and technique, this season has brought a reversion to something more physical.

He is enthusiastic about deregulation and handing the private sector all the freedom it needs to exploit workers and resources to boost profits.But what Trump’s America First agenda cannot live with is tariff-free trade. He also resists anti-trust and anti-corruption laws, low budget deficits, and the abolition of barriers to foreign investment that qualify as central tenets of the Washington consensus.And Trump is not alone. Since the 2008 financial crash, most people have questioned the outcomes that flow from neoliberalism.A group of renowned economists joined this debate with the idea of seeking a new consensus around ideas and gaining evidence of what works when thinking about how economies thrive and prosper in the 21st century.The resulting book, just published, could prove to be a successor to the wishlist drawn up in Washington 36 years ago.It’s a timely attempt to wrest back the economic agenda from the current chaosAfter a conference in London and the sponsorship of the London School of Economics, it has quickly become known asthe London consensus. Not with the idea of reinventing some form of economic colonialism directed from the UK capital, but because the world’s best economists gathered in London and most were associated at some point – whether they were a former finance minister of Chile or Bank of England policymaker – with the LSE.It won’t surprise anyone that the proposals are a long way from being described as Trumpian.Philosophically, the London consensus pursues aims that are entirely rejected by Trump and his followers.Trump’s backers – such as the Heritage Foundation and itsauthoritarian Project 25scheme – promote the idea that success comes with building a high wall around your home and a protective financial shield for your family. The government’s job is to support this project with low taxes, unfeasibly high state spending and an extra wall around the country itself, preventing outsiders from gaining undue access.View image in fullscreenThe London Consensus: one of the book’s messages is that increasing inequality will not help our young people to thriveNigel Farage has a similar message, as does the AfD boss Alice Weidel in Germany, the National Rally president Jordan Bardella in France and Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni.It’s a timely attempt to wrest back the economic agenda from the current chaos because many middle-income households in almost every country, from Mexico and South Africa to Britain and the US, are questioning whether to follow a more individualistic path for the sake of their family or join with their neighbours in a collective effort to improve their lives.With ashrinking number of good jobs, a significant rise in property prices and spike in the costs of food and energy, the pressure is on families who aspire to better themselves.One of the messages from the London consensus is that bettering oneself at the expense of others, and thereby increasing inequality, will not help young people to thrive. Not even the children of middle-income parents who have benefited from extensive support – whether from private education, private health or a deposit for a home (surrounded by high walls) – will ultimately feel better if high rates of crime and corruption lurk beyond the garden gate. That high levels of inequality hold back economic progress is empirically proven.Another message relates to how we judge progress. It rejects the emphasis on simply putting more money in people’s pockets as the main aim for a politician. A higher income is relatively easy to measure using gross domestic product. It is a single number that everyone knows is bad when it goes down.The wellbeing of individuals and households is a much better guide to progress. It is something Keir Starmer recognises and it is why Wes Streeting has commissioned more mental health appointments and Peter Kyle, the business secretary, continues to advance the employment rights bill.Mental health is a good measure to watch on the dashboard of indicators by which the London consensus would have us judge success. First, it is classless. Everyone knows someone who is angry, depressed or lonely and could do with, at the very least, some talking therapy.Second, all the evidence points to huge benefits from tackling these modern ills, from better physical health and higher job participation rates to greater involvement in community affairs.The US can avoid spending money in this area because it denies the victims of capitalism a ticket to ride, leaving them to fester on the side of the road.Trump’s supporters may never read the evidence contained in the many chapters of the London Consensus. There are discussions on how to achieve universal healthcare, “foster green and inclusive productivity growth” and maintain sustainable government spending that would probably horrify them.Hopefully, US state governors and prime ministers across the world will ask their staff to read the book, leading us away from the Washington consensus to a better place.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsEconomics viewpointDonald TrumpTariffsInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

The Maga bigwigs Stephen and Katie Miller, on the other hand, appear to have connected over their shared love of terrorizing immigrant children.The political power couple, who married in 2020,bondedduring Donald Trump’s first term, whenStephen helped engineerafamily-separation policyat the border that rippedmore than 5,000 children, as young asfour months old, from their immigrant parents. At the time, Miller (then going by her maiden name, Waldman) was an immigration spokesperson, and a big fan of Stephen’s hardline policies. “DHS sent me to the border to see the separations for myself – to try to make me more compassionate – but it didn’t work,” she told MSNBC’s Jacob Soboroffin 2018, according to his book on the border policy, Separated. The book also quotes Miller saying she didn’t expect tochange her mind: “My family and colleagues told me that when I have kids I’ll think about family separation differently. But I don’t think so.”Fast-forward to the present day and the married couple now share three young children. Stephen is White House deputy chief of staff and possibly the mostdangerous manin the Trump administration. Miller, meanwhile, quit a mysterious role at Elon Musk’s private ventures back in May tostart a podcastabout motherhood as part of an apparent plan to recruitmore women to Maga. Yep, the woman who couldn’t muster up any compassion for kids in cages is now a momfluencer.Miller seems to have been correct in her earlier assessment: having kids hasn’t made her think differently about family separation, a practice that attorneys and former immigration officials allegehas been revived. What has changed, however, is the fact that she’s now weaponizing her poor children against anyone who dares challenge her. And now that her husband is Trump’s right-hand man, she’s not just going after immigrants – she’s threatening to strip one of her critics of US citizenship.This week, Miller appeared onPiers Morgan’s YouTube show, along with a panel that included the leftwing commentator Cenk Uygur, to discuss Islamophobic attacks on the New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Miller kicked off the discussion with an incomprehensible point about the anti-Israel movement and then accused Uygur of “using coded language to attack American Jews and to say that we should not be here and we should not be in existence”.Uygur retorted by saying she was lying, adding: “It’s very normal for a Miller to be completely and utterly lying.” Anepic meltdown ensued.“Piers, quite frankly, I’m really sick and tired of this racist bigoted rhetoric that can comes from people like you against my husband, against my family and my children,” Miller yelled. (Uygur had said nothing about Miller’s children.) “I am raising Jewish children in this country … ”“Who brought your children into this?” Uygur then said. “What a weirdo.”Miller, who doesn’t appear to have much experience being challenged during an interview, then started ranting at Piers Morgan about how Uygur saying “the Millers lie” is coded language for them being Jewish. After some more screaming,she also told Uygur: “You better check your citizenship application and hope that everything was legal and correct … because you’ll be just like Ilhan Omar,” a frequent subject of Republican attacks.You can watch thewhole thingfor yourself but the bottom line is this: the wife of the US homeland security adviser apparently threatened to denaturalize someone because she didn’t like the fact he criticized her.This, to be clear, is hardly some one-off. Threatening to deport your critics, even those with American citizenship, seems to be Maga policy now. The representative Nancy Mace, a Trump loyalist, for example,has saidshe would “love to see” Omar, a progressive representative, “deported back to Somalia”.Various Republicans are also threatening to deport Mamdani; indeed, Miller’s meltdown occurred during a discussion about how the representative Randy Fine of Florida and Andy Ogles of Tennessee have been pushing the federal justice department toinvestigate Mamdani’s citizenship. (Mamdani was born in Uganda, moved to the US at age seven and became a citizen in 2018.) Fine, who has suggested Omar is a “Muslim terrorist” and called forGaza to be nuked,recently demandedthe federal government “review every naturalization of the past 30 years – starting with Mamdani”.Fine doesn’t really need to be demanding this, by the way, because the government is already on it. Back in June, the justice department announced plans to prioritize efforts to strip somenaturalized Americansof their US citizenship. Barack Obama, I should note, also led adenaturalizationpush – but the difference between that and Trump 2.0 is the way in which the president is using deportation fears to chill political speech and intimidate his enemies.While people of color are the main target of these attacks, even some privileged white people are being threatened with deportation or the loss of their citizenship because of their opinions – a terrifying throwback toMcCarthyism. Back when Musk and Trump were feuding, for example, the president responded to a question on whether he’d deport the South African tech billionaireby saying: “I don’t know, we’ll have to take a look.” And, in July, Trump said he was thinking ofrevoking the citizenship of Rosie O’Donnell, an American-born comedian and actor who has repeatedly criticized the president. To be clear, Trump can’t legally take away the citizenship of someone born in the US. But as we all know by now, Trump rarely seems to look at the law as an impediment.Expect more of this. TheTrump administrationhas made it very clear to 24.5 million naturalized Americans in the US that they’d better keep their mouths shut to keep their passports. Ultimately, Miller’s threat on Piers Morgan’s show wasn’t just directed at Uygur, it was a warning to everyone in America: criticize Maga and there will be consequences.Kat Abughazaleh, who is running for Congress, says she has been indicted by the DoJ for protesting ICEAbughazalehcalled the charges“yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They must not cave in to the president’s attacks on the working class during this ongoing government shutdown. If they do, the consequences will be catastrophic for our country.This may be the most consequential moment in American history since the civil war. We have a megalomaniacal president who, consumed by his quest for more and more power, is undermining our constitution and the rule of law. Further, we have an administration that is waging war against the working class of our country and our most vulnerable people.While Trump’s billionaire buddies become much, much richer, he is prepared to throw 15 million Americans off the healthcare they have – which could result in 50,000 unnecessary deaths each year. At a time when healthcare is already outrageously expensive, he is prepared to double premiums for more than 20 million people who rely on the Affordable Care Act. At a time when the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth, Trump is prepared, illegally, to withhold funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap, despite a $5bn emergency fund established by Congress. That decision would threaten to push 42 million people – including 16 million children – into hunger.And all of this is being done to provide $1tn in tax breaks to the 1%.Let’s be clear: this government shutdown did not happen by accident. In the Senate, 60 votes are required to fund the federal government. Today, the Republicans have 53 members while the Democratic caucus has 47. In other words, in order to fund the government the Republican majority must negotiate withDemocratsto move the budget forward. This is what has always happened – until now. Republicans, for the first time, are simply refusing to come to the table and negotiate. They are demanding that it is their way or the highway.To make matters worse, the Republican contempt for negotiations is such that the House speaker, Mike Johnson, has given his chamber a six-week paid vacation. Unbelievably, during a government shutdown – with federal employees not getting paid, millions facing outrageous premium increases and nutrition assistance set to expire for millions more – Republicans in theHouse of Representativesare not in Washington DC.Day after day, Trump shows his contempt for the constitutional role of Congress and the courtsTrump is a schoolyard bully. Anyone who thinks surrendering to him now will lead to better outcomes and cooperation in the future does not understand how a power-hungry demagogue operates. This is a man who threatens to arrest and jail his political opponents, deploys the US military into Democratic cities and allows masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to pick people up off the streets and throw them into vans without due process. He has sued virtually every major media outlet because he does not tolerate criticism, has extorted funds from law firms and is withholding federal funding from states that voted against him.Day after day he shows his contempt for the constitutional role of Congress and the courts.Given that reality, does anyone truly believe that caving in to Trump now will stop his unprecedented attacks on our democracy and working people?Poll after poll shows that the Americans understand the need for strong opposition to Trump’s unprecedented and dangerous agenda. They understand that the Republican party is responsible for this shutdown. And, despite the Democratic party’s all-time low approval rating, independents and even a number of Republicans are now standing with the Democrats in their fight to protect the healthcare needs of the working families of our country.What will it mean if the Democrats cave? Trump, who already holds Democrats in contempt and views them as weak and ineffectual, will utilize his victory to accelerate his movement toward authoritarianism. At a time when he already has no regard for our democratic system of checks and balances, he will be emboldened to continue decimating programs that protect elderly people, children, the sick and the poor while giving more tax breaks and other benefits to his fellow oligarchs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My Democratic colleagues and I are getting calls every day from federal employees who are angry about working without pay and Americans who are frantic about feeding their families and making ends meet. But my Democratic colleagues must also understand this: Republicans are hearing from their constituents as well. There is a reason why 15 Republican Senators are finally standing up to Trump and, along with every member of the Democratic caucus, support funding Snap benefits.There is a reason why 14 Republican members of the House are on record calling for the extension of tax credits for the Affordable Care Act. Understandably, Republicans do not want to go home and explain to their constituents why they voted to double or, in some cases, triple healthcare premiums. They do not want to go home and explain why they are throwing large numbers of their constituents off healthcare. They do not want to go home and explain why they are taking food off the tables of hungry families.We are living in the most dangerous and pivotal moment in modern American history. Our children and future generations will not forget what we do now. Democrats must not turn their backs on the needs of working people and allow our already broken healthcare system to collapse even further. Democrats must not allow an authoritarian president to continue undermining our constitution and the rule of law. The choice is clear. If the Democrats stand with the American people, the American people will stand with them. If they surrender, the American people will hold them accountable.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025OpinionDonald TrumpUS SenateHouse of RepresentativesDemocratsHungerInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

It has not turned out to be a big deal for my life or career, but at the time it felt monumental: racist hate mail was sent to my college for months; the Conservative MP Bob Blackman called for my prosecution; and tabloid journalists turned up at my home and harassed my mother (it was August, a famously slow news month). I received a lot of support from the student population, alumni and the police (and none from the university, bar a few kind academics), but it cast a shadow over the rest of my time there – I worried about what future I could have or what employer would hire me if they were to Google my name and see I had attracted scandal. Mostly I wondered why this was national news.I found myself revisiting those memories when considering the storm aroundGeorge Abaraonye, the now ousted Oxford Union president-elect who attracted significant media attention for laughing at the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk in September. In a WhatsApp group, Abaraonye wrote: “Charlie Kirk got shot, let’s fucking go”, and on his Instagram account wrote: “Charlie Kirk got shot loool”. This was seen as especially egregious as in May this year Abaraonye had debated Kirk on the subject of toxic masculinity at the Oxford Union. Abaraonye apologised for the posts, stating that he wrote these messages before realising the shooting was fatal, and they were intended to highlight the irony of someone so pro-gun being shot. But then he doubled down,saying: “My words were no less insensitive than his – arguably less so.”I have no judgment to pass on Abaraonye’s messages. But log on to any social media site during a major tragic event and you’ll see that laughing at inappropriate jokes is part of the furniture. The Titan submersible, Luigi Mangione’s alleged killing of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Prince Philip dying and indeed Charlie Kirk. Five years on, I still see memes and jokes by rightwing provocateurs making a mockery of George Floyd’s death. Whatever your assessment of the rights and wrongs of people laughing at tragedy, a question remains: if this is such a regular fixture of online life, then why was Abaraonye singled out?View image in fullscreenCharlie Kirk and George Abaraonye during a debate at the Oxford Union in May 2025.Photograph: Oxford UnionIt’s an easy answer. We are abnormally and unethically obsessed with what students get up to at university, and any action is immediately defined as being within the public interest even where it is broadly inconsequential. This is especially the case with Oxbridge students, with those institutions seen as finishing schools for entry into UK elite life. Abaraonye had the unfortunate timing of having volunteered himself for a position there that came with a title, meaning he wasn’t just an obscure student but someone with some importance. He also has long dreadlocks, wears grey tracksuit bottoms to union debates and didn’t get straight As in his A-levels, an almost too-good-to-be-true apparition of what sticklers for decorum or fogey alumni would consider as driving the corruption of a storied institution.What followed the news of Abaraonye’s comments exposes two issues: the hypocrisy of the right’s panic over campus “free speech”, and the dog-eat-dog environment that has been engineered by the media’s intrusion into university spaces.Universitiesare meant to be spaces where students come, thinking they have one of the world’s greatest minds, and thrash out ideas, make provocative statements and forge political convictions, which they may well ditch once they nab a Goldman Sachs graduate role. It’s also a space where they will make mistakes. This is the reality of campus free speech. But presented with the opportunity to discredit and stamp out someone confident and progressively minded who might become a future force in, say, politics, law or journalism, the media seem to want to crack the egg before it hatches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes, students try to settle personal or political scores by calling in the media. It is likely another student screenshotted and leaked Abaraonye’s messages to fit him up. (I had a similar experience, where my comments about a misnamed “Jamaican” beef and mango stew in a food feedback page at my college wereleaked to the press, likely as punishment for being too vocal on race within my college.)The ceaseless coverage of the Oxford Union, and other stories focused on students, is about aggravating existing fears that people may have about the children in their lives – that they might be influenced by radical ideas, that ideologies popular on campus will become a diktat that they absorb until they are unrecognisable to those who love them. The right is evidently desperate for any opportunity to unmask these kids. That’s why a 20-year-old student no one had ever heard of who laughed at something inappropriate suddenly becomes the face of “the hypocrisy of woke orthodoxy”. We have been told that universities face a crisis of free speech, and that students must be ready to beshocked or offendedas part of their education. But should a student outrage liberal or conservative sentiments, the right seeks to discipline them.It is not that students should never be reported on. The question should be: who is harmed? The female students at Warwick University were evidently harmed by the misogyny and culture of sexual assault exposed by theWarwick “rape chat”. And an ableism row at the Oxford Union six years ago, after a blind Ghanaian student wasdragged by his anklesfrom a debate event, was evidently worth being brought to public attention. But however offensive or disgraceful you find Abaraonye’s edgy comments, who did he harm, and who can you say was reasonably put at risk? If students are to be preached to about the values of free speech and tolerating dissent and provocation, then why should they not pick the path of theedgelordin response?Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

This means that climate politics can no longer focus only on preventing future catastrophes. It must now also encompass struggles over how society manages climate impacts already reshaping economic and social life. Insurance markets, housing, water and land use policies, national labor markets, and local economies – all will need to be radically remade as we adapt to a changed and increasingly volatile climate.To date, climate adaptation has focused on theenvironmentalimpacts of climate change: strengthening seawalls against sea level rise, improving flood control systems, and retrofitting buildings for extreme weather events. But this infrastructure-centric framing sidesteps questions about the institutions that will condition how people experience thepoliticalimpacts of climate change. Should we allow property insurance markets to operate freely, or should the federal government backstop high-risk regions? Do we maintain disaster aid systems that only protect property owners, or do we guarantee equitable recovery support? Do we leave workers laboring in extreme heat to their employers’ whims, or do we enact federal protections?These questions are not hypothetical. In the United States alone, a spike innon-renewal ratesacross the homeowners’ insurance industry – even beyond high-risk markets in Florida and California – indicates that climate threatens to trigger a national insurance crisis. In 2023, UPS workers threatened a nationwide strike over on-the-job heat exposure, ultimatelywinningan agreement to install air conditioning in delivery trucks. That same year, after decades of drought left the Colorado River’s reservoirs at historic lows – threatening water supplies for 40 million people – the Biden administrationpaidArizona, Nevada and California $1.2bn to reduce their water usage. How we respond to these political crises – and those to come – will encode fundamentally different visions of society. Yet these struggles remain largely outside the frame of climate politics, which continues to treat adaptation as a technical matter for experts and engineers rather than genuine political contestation.Climate politics has already moved beyond technocratic frameworks when it comes to mitigation. Nearly 30 years ago, the Kyoto protocol represented the prevailing wisdom that market mechanisms would solve climate change. But as emissions kept rising and those markets proved ineffectual, the focus shifted to national-level industrial policy debates – and with it, climate became genuinely political. Recent years have seen any number of political battles, spanning the green capitalism of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act versus the democratic socialism of the Green New Deal to debates over lithium nationalization in Bolivia and coal phase-out compensation in Germany. These are fights about values and mediating between competing interests, not merely carbon accounting.Yet even as climate migrated from the preserve of technocratic elites to more familiar domains of political struggle, it remained restricted to the realm of decarbonization. Even the politically progressive agenda of Zohran Mamdani’s NYC mayoral campaign – whichlinksclimate to the cost-of-living crisis, arguing that rent freezes, universal childcare and free public transit will prevent New Yorkers from fleeing for more affordable, but energy-intensive, life in the suburbs – makes its case through an emissions reductions framework. A truly comprehensive climate politics would apply this same political imagination to adaptation – transforming social institutions not only to prevent future warming, but also to manage the climate impacts already transforming everyday life.The need for this shift becomes clearer once we abandon the apocalyptic framing that has long dominated climate discourse. In insisting that climate change constitutes an all-powerful force that will entirely overwhelm human civilization, climate politics has become blind to the reality that, for most people, climate change will materialize not as something utterly new, but as familiar problems made worse: more people priced out of housing markets after disasters, more workers forced to work during heatwaves, more local industries decimated after extreme weather events.Climate adaptation is not a distinct technical challenge, then, but rather continuous with ongoing political struggles.The terrain of this struggle is beginning to take shape. TheCouncil on Foreign Relations, for example, recently proposed reforms to the property insurance market to expose homeowners to the “full actuarial cost” of living in high-risk areas like California. By contrast, the progressive Climate and Community Institute has proposed a system ofHousing Resilience Agenciesthat would provide comprehensive public disaster insurance. The contrast is stark: one approach uses price signaling to prod people out of vulnerable areas – effectively a form of managed retreat through market pressure – while the other commits public resources that enable them to stay in place safely. But these kinds of policy debates remain few and far between in climate discourse.This is not to suggest that mitigation should be abandoned. But the exclusive focus on preventing climate catastrophe obscures a more immediate reality: climate change is already reshaping our world. The question is not whether we will reshape our institutions to manage climate impacts, but how – and whose vision will prevail.Leah Aronowsky is a historian of science and assistant professor at the Columbia Climate SchoolExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Luckily for him, his prison visitors include powerful friendsSat 1 Nov 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 1 Nov 2025 07.13 EDTShareTwenty years ago, atragic eventchanged the direction of my life. Three teenagers from the banlieueof Clichy-sous-Bois, north of Paris, were returning from a football game one afternoon in late October 2005 when they were chased by police. Zyed Benna, Bouna Traoré and Muhittin Altun had done nothing wrong (an inquiry later confirmed this) but were so disoriented by fear of the police, they hid in an electricity substation. In an awful twist of fate, Zyed and Bouna died by electric shock on 27 October 2005, while Muhittin was severely burned – and scarred for life by the ordeal.Their deaths led to rioting across France – the worst in years. The episode also turned me into a fully committed activist against racism and inequality. Yet for some politicians the response was to criminalise the victims. The interior minister at the time for example, Nicolas Sarkozy. He initially suggested the teenagers had committed burglaryand then declared: “When you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear from the police.”Sarkozy preached a hardline, zero-tolerance approach when it came to criminality. You would think therefore that he would accept his own punishment without complaint. Because today, it is Sarkozy who finds himself behind bars.The former president’s jailing is remarkable: apart from Louis XVI, executed during the revolution, and Philippe Pétain, imprisoned for collaborating with Nazi Germany, no French head of state has ever before served a prison sentence. But thepresident of the court heldthat Sarkozy’s offences were “exceptionally serious acts, likely to undermine citizens’ trust in those who represent them”.What exactly, are these grave offences attributed to our former president?Sarkozy was convicted andsentenced to five years in prisonfor criminal conspiracy in the so-called Libyan campaign-funding case, relating to his 2007 presidential campaign (he denies wrongdoing andhas appealed). He was found guilty of having entered into a pact with Muammar Gaddafi’s regime to secure illegal financing for that campaign. He is said to have allowed close associates to make promises to Libya, notably maintaining contacts withAbdullah al-Senussi– Gaddafi’s brother-in-law, and a terroristconvicted in Francefor the 1989 bombing of a Paris-bound airliner that killed 170 people. The families of those killed in the attack weredeemed by the judgesto be victims of this corrupt pact.In 2005, Nicolas Sarkozy declared: ‘When you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear from the police’But despite adecade-longinvestigation (andrevelationspublished by Mediapart as early as 2011), the involvement ofabout 100 magistratesand a400-page judgment, Sarkozy denounced his conviction as a“violation of the rule of law”.An astonishing number of high-profile supporters rushed to his defence.Immediately after his conviction and before he entered prison, Gérald Darmanin, the justice minister,paid him a visit, claiming he had done so merely “as a friend” andexpressing“a great sadness for Nicolas Sarkozy”. Despitewarningsfrom senior judges about potentially undermining the independence of the judiciary, Darmanin followed this up on Wednesday with a visit to his former mentor, in prison. This has nowprompted a lawsuitagainst the justice minister from a group of 30 lawyers accusing him of bias.Other parts of the political class joined in the outpouring of support. While the mayor of Niceannouncedhis intention to name a square in the city after Sarkozy, Emmanuel Macron himselfreceived the former president at the Elyséebefore his incarceration.Sarkozy was even able tohost a farewell gathering, while his familyorganised a public send-off, where people applauded as he left his home on the day he was taken into custody – someshouting: “Shame on the justice system!”From the moment the verdict was announced, media outlets, almost in unison, handed the microphone to those not only denouncing the court’s decision but insisting on his innocence. To me, one particular testimony perfectly captures the mindset behind this outcry. A close friend of Sarkozy lamentedon a radio showthat prison is “a shock for people like us, its terrible,” before concluding: “We’re not made for that, we’re not animals.” Leaving aside the speciesist undertone of that remark, who, then, are the “animals” deemed deserving of prison?Probably those who cannot afford to have their relatives on the airwaves to defend them. It is worth recalling that criminal conspiracy is punishable by up to10 years in prison– twice the sentence Sarkozy received.In France,almost a thirdof all those in prison are, like Sarkozy, awaiting judgement , and every dayhundredsare placed in custody under immediate enforcement orders. In 2022, for prison sentences of two years or more, the rate of immediate enforcement was 88%. The court granted Sarkozy a privilege rarely afforded to ordinary citizens: he wasnot locked up immediately, but givenseveral weeksto prepare for his detention, during which he attended hisdaughter’s birthday.The French government has been condemned on numerous occasions for the excessive length of pre-trial detention. Did Sarkozy’s friends ever before express concern about that?Worse still, last month France’s chief inspector of prisonswarnedof the “alarming state of disrepair” of many French prisons, plagued by infestations of cockroaches, rats or bedbugs – conditions that infringe the fundamental rights of those held in detention.While Sarkozy, for obvious security reasons, has been given a private cell, Franceranks secondin the EU for prison overcrowding – a serious affront to human dignity.Our principles are violated on a daily basis in our prisons. I am convinced of the intrinsic ineffectiveness of the prison system. I made that case in the foreword of a recently translatedcollection of essaysabout prison abolition. I want a profound rethink of justice – one that is reparative, not dehumanising, and that allows victims to seek more than society’s vengeance on their behalf.But Sarkozy’s political career was defined by an uncompromisingly punitive stance on crime, particularly against repeat offenders. Yet he himself now faces hissecond custodial sentence– the first served by wearing an electronic tag. Today, he is subject to the very penal system he so zealously promoted. Its philosophy is the same one that 20 years ago drove police officers to chase down innocent boys – leading to the deaths of Zyed and Bouna.It is striking, to say the least, to see those who constantly decry the supposed leniency of the justice system – and, like Darmanin, call daily for harsher laws – suddenly decide that such reasoning should not apply to Sarkozy. It is the reaction of the caste, revealing a belief that some lives are unworthy and may endure the cruelty of inhumane detention conditions, while others ought to be spared.The case is serious: a French head of state has been convicted of a criminal conspiracy to receive funding from a foreign power that carried out acts of terrorism against its own citizens. More serious still is to hear this man – who has always championed tougher criminal sentencing – now give the impression he believes he is above the law.Rokhaya Diallo is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

People placed flowers and candles along temporary fencing near the damaged station entrance, as thousands more packed into the square.The disaster inspired Serbia’s largest youth-led movement since the fall of Slobodan Milošević, a hardline leader whodied in 2006 of a heart attackwhile he was being tried on 66 counts of crimes against humanity,including genocide.Protesters had initially demanded a transparent investigation into the disaster, but their calls soon escalated into criticism of corruption and nepotism, as well as calls for early parliamentary elections, which are due in 2027.Many arrived to Novi Sad by bus or car, but in a gesture of continued protest, others marched from Novi Pazar, about 340km (211 miles) south of the capital. It took them a symbolic 16 days to finish the march.View image in fullscreenMourners wait to lay flowers at a memorial service in front of Novi Sad railway station.Photograph: Nenad Mihajlovic/AFP/Getty ImagesThe people of Novi Sad took to the streets to greet the marchers, blowing whistles and waving flags. “I came to bow to the strongest force in the world right now – our students, our youth,” said one Novi Sad resident, Ratko Popovic.The protests have yielded results, including theresignation in January of the former prime minister Miloš Vučević.Vučić has remained defiant and branded demonstrators as western-backed “terrorists”. However, Saturday’s gathering may have shaken him. In a televised public address on Friday, the president made a rare apology for his harsh rhetoric.“I have said some things that I am now sorry for saying,” Vučić said in a TV address that called for dialogue. “All that hatred boiling in our society cannot bring any good. It can only lead to further destruction.”After a year of street protests, Serbia’s students split on what should come nextRead moreThe government has declared Saturday a day of national mourning.Serbia is seeking to join the EU, but Vučić’s crackdown, as well as his close relations with Russia and China, have spooked Brussels.The EU’s commissioner for enlargement, Marta Kos, said on X that the canopy tragedy “is changing Serbia”.“It moved masses to stand for accountability, free expression and inclusive democracy,” Kos said. “They are the same values to lead Serbia into the EU.”The anti-government protests have remained largely peaceful, although in August, theyturned violentwith allegations of police brutality and excessive use of force.In September, 13 people, including the former construction minister Goran Vesić were charged in a criminal case over the disaster.

He was a proud family man who spent a lot of his time with his son, both working with and socially. Peter loved to have meals out with his wife and had a particularly sweet tooth.”Three others involved in the crash, the pilot, 41, and two passengers, a 58-year-old woman and a boy, 10, suffered minor injuries.Analysis of the helicopter’s flight path showed it leaving the airfield at about 10am and flying over Doncaster for about seven minutes before stopping suddenly near Bentley.Lee Needham, who lives in the area, told the BBC that the helicopter came down close to houses, train tracks, industrial units and electrical pylons. “Whoever was piloting the helicopter more than likely saved numerous lives,” he said.South Yorkshire police and the government’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) have launched a joint investigation into the incident.The family said they were supporting the investigation and asked people “to not speculate on the circumstances surrounding the accident”.“We would like to ask for privacy during this incredibly difficult time to allow us to come to terms with what has occurred and grieve for the loss of Peter,” they added.A spokesperson for the AAIB said a team of experts in aircraft operations, engineering and recorded data had been deployed to the site on Thursday.Kuki Helicopters, based at Retford Gamston airport, which is understood to have owned the craft, said it would “continue to support” the agencies involved in the investigation into the crash.The firm, which, according to its website, offers flying lessons and experiences, said in a Facebook post: “At this very sad time, all our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of all those involved in the helicopter incident which happened yesterday.“Our heartfelt condolences are sent to everyone affected by this tragedy, and we will, of course, continue to support relevant agencies involved in the continuing investigation.”Explore more on these topicsHelicopter crashesSouth YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1953, he started out in French cinema in the 1980s, getting some early awards and nominations.He was the hunter in Jean-Jacques Annaud’s 1988 wilderness adventure The Bear. Then in 1990 he got attention for his turn as the hard-nosed secret agent handling Anne Parillaud’s female assassin Nikita, in Besson’s hit film of the same name.View image in fullscreenAnne Parillaud and Tchéky Karyo in Nikita.Photograph: Samuel Goldwyn/AllstarKaryo’s gift for languages – he spoke French, English and Spanish among others – meant he was soon appearing in international productions, such as Ridley Scott’s historical epic 1492: Conquest of Paradise. He later appeared in major Hollywood films including Bad Boys as drug kingpin Fouchet, and the James Bond filmGoldenEyeas the Russian defence minister.He worked steadily through the subsequent decades in cinema and television inFranceand abroad, appearing in films as varied as Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s 2001 whimsical comedy Amélie and Brazilian director Walter Salles’s 1995 thriller Foreign Land.Probably his best known role for UK audiences came late in his career, as French detective Julien Baptiste in two series of the BBC crime show The Missing, andits spinoff Baptiste.Explore more on these topicsFilmGoldenEyeLuc BessonAmelieFranceEuropeBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

Airports affected included facilities in New York City, Austin, Newark, Phoenix, Washington, Nashville, Dallas and Denver. At some airports, delays averaged one hour or more.Trump calls on Republicans to abolish the Senate filibuster ruleRead moreThe shutdown has forced 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers to work without pay.“After 31 days without pay, air traffic controllers are under immense stress and fatigue,” the FAA said late on Friday.“The shutdown must end so that these controllers receive the pay they’ve earned and travelers can avoid further disruptions and delays,” it added.The impact on the system would have been far worse on a typical Friday. However, Halloween evening traffic was 20% lower than usual, which helped mitigate the effects ofstaffing shortages, airline officials said.More than 5,600 flights were delayed on Friday and 500 canceled, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking website.At New York City’s LaGuardia airport, 50% of flights were delayed and 12% canceled, with delays averaging 140 minutes, while Washington DC’s Reagan National airport had a quarter of flights delayed.Airlines are bracing for more flight disruptions.“Coming into this weekend and then the week after, I think you are going to see even more disruptions in the airspace,” the US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, said on Fox News’s America’s Newsroom.On Thursday, air traffic control staffing shortages snarled flights at Orlando, Dallas/Fort Worth and Washington DC, with FlightAware data showing 7,300 flights delayed and 1,250 canceled across the US.Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have all called on Congress to quickly pass a stopgap funding bill known as a “continuing resolution” to let the government reopen amid talks on disputes over healthcare policy.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association’s president, Nick Daniels, on Friday joined the airlines in calling for a continuing resolution.The government shutdown began on 1 October and continues as a federal funding bill has stalled in Congress.Republican lawmakers want to pass a “clean” funding measure with no strings attached while Democrats have demanded talks on extending healthcare subsidies set to expire at year’s end.Airlines have repeatedly called for an end to the shutdown, citing aviation safety risks.The shutdown has exacerbated existing staffing shortages, threatening to cause widespread disruptions similar to those that helped end a 35-day government shutdown in 2019.The FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels, and many had been working mandatory overtime as well as six-day weeks even before the shutdown.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Airline industryAir transportUS federal government shutdownsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The incident came to light after another motorist captured the footage on a dashcam and reported it to the police.The date of the offence predates eight other speeding charges for which Fofana was disqualified from driving for two years in May.The recording, published by the CPS, shows him speeding on the hard shoulder and winding recklessly through traffic.The district judge Julie Cooper sentenced Fofana to an 18-month community order, which includes 300 hours of community service and ordered him to pay £85 costs and a £114 victim surcharge.“You obviously realise there are a lot of young people who look up to you and they would like to be like you and follow you. That’s part of the whole gig,” Cooper told him.“However, they will not be able to afford these expensive cars, with all their additions that keep them safe and you could have some 17-year-old, who has just passed their test, who think they can copy you.“They will not be able to handle their car and do some ridiculous driving manoeuvres and they are dead. You need to be much more responsible about your behaviour.”Prosecutor Rabbi Khan said the other motorist captured Fofana’s white Lamborghini on their dashcam about 4.50pm. Khan told the court: “The witness identified the danger and this defendant was driving on the hard shoulder at speed in a 50mph zone.“The offence is aggravated by an approaching bend that was signposted and he is not indicating when making these manoeuvres. He refused to abide by the road rules at speed.”Fofana was disqualified at Lavender Hill magistrates court in May for eight speeding offences committed while driving his Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a blue Audi and the same Lamborghini Urus.He admitted all the offences and was fined a total of £5,328, plus a £2,131 victim surcharge and £110 costs. On that occasion, he received 38 penalty points on his licence, taking his total to 47. The latest offence predates these speeding charges.His solicitor, Imogen Cox, told the court: “The video speaks for itself – 15 to 20 seconds of driving that are conceded. There is no explanation or excuse for his driving on that day.“He attended voluntarily for an interview at Guildford police station and apologised for driving and said he had learned a valuable lesson about his driving and had no explanation for his driving on that day.“This offence pre-dates the speeding offences, which were all within a seven-month period and tied-up at Lavender Hill. He is essentially of good character, having no criminal convictions against him. He is fit and healthy and able to carry out community work.”The judge said any breach of the new 18-month driving ban was likely to result in a prison sentence. “At the end of the disqualification you cannot drive until you pass an extended driving test and if you drive as a disqualified driver you will almost certainly be sent to prison, and that is career-ending,” she said.Explore more on these topicsRoad safetyChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

Croatia and Bulgaria are the only European nations in the top 10, followed by France in 19th place.Languishing below Britain are the Netherlands, English-speaking Canada, Germany, Israel, Japan and Spain, which is the least nature-connected of the 61 nations surveyed.Bar graph showing the 10 most and least nature-connected nationsNature connectedness is a psychological concept that measures the closeness of an individual’s relationship with other species. Studies have found that people with higher levels of nature connectedness enjoy improved wellbeing and aremore likely to actinenvironmentally friendlyways. Low levels of nature connectedness have beenidentified as one of three major underlying causesof biodiversity loss alongside inequality and the prioritisation of individual, material gains.Researchers from Britain and Austria, led by Miles Richardson,professor of nature connectedness at the University of Derby, found the strongest indicator for a close relationship with nature was high levels of “spirituality” in a society. More religious societies and cultures where there was a preference for faith over science showed high levels of nature connection.In contrast, the study also found that “ease of doing business” – a World Bank measurement of the business-friendly character of a country – was correlated with less nature connection.Although Britain is believed to have one of the highest levels of membership of environmental organisations in the world, this apparently pro-nature indicator was found to have little impact on closeness to nature.More concrete factors found by the study to be linked to a lack of connection with nature included levels of urbanisation, mean income and internet use.“Nature connectedness is not just about what we do, but how we feel, think, and value our place in the living world,” said Richardson, who admitted he was not surprised that Britain languished so low in the nature connection league table.“We’ve become a more rational, economic and scientific society. That’s obviously brought some fantastic benefits but it’s how we balance them with the unforeseen problems,” he said. “How do we reintegrate natural thinking in our very technological world? It’s obviously very difficult to change cultures but it’s about mainstreaming the value of nature, making it integral to our wellbeing, so it becomes respected and almost sacred.”According to Richardson, ways of fostering nature connection could include betteruse of natural environments in NHS treatmentsof mental and public health; developingrights of naturein law, and bringing nature into boardrooms and business decisions through regulations such as biodiversity net gain.He admitted the study revealed a tension between business and the environment. “We still need a functioning economy,” he said. “There’s ways we can rethink the way we do business – bringing nature into decision-making, nature in the boardroom, and biodiversity net gain. They can start to shift the system, where nature isn’t just simply treated as a resource but as a stakeholder.”While bringing nature into urban areas might reinvigorate nature connection in very urban societies, Richardson added: “It’s not just about putting a park in. How do you create sacred urban nature? It’s easy to build a park but it needs to go deeper than that.”The correlation between nature connection and “spirituality” in countries was discovered using measurements of the importance of religion, beliefs in a god and faith in different countries recorded by theWorld Values Survey.Graham Usher, the bishop of Norwich and lead for environmental affairs for the Church of England, said: “We’ve long known that getting out into nature is good for body, mind and soul. In the Gospels we keep encountering Jesus going out to be alone in nature to be with God; he notices the birds of the air and the lilies of the field. I believe that what we notice we begin to love, and what we love we come to treasure, and what we treasure we want to protect. It all starts with children and is why activities like forest school and wild church are important for people and nature.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentReligionHealth & wellbeingNepalBiodiversityWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Sections of the Leeds and Liverpool canal were closed from May to September due to low water levels.Thousands take legal action over ‘widespread pollution’ of three UK riversRead moreWaterways provide free public access to nature for more than 10 million people, save the NHS an estimated £1.5bn annually, support more than 80,000 jobs and act as green corridors for wildlife, according to the Canal & River Trust (CRT).The trust manages about 2,000 miles of waterways, including roughly 80% of Britain’s navigable canals. Nearly 80% of local authorities have a navigable waterway in their area.The collapse of the Bridgewater canal embankment at Dunham Massey on New Year’s Day this year highlighted the network’s vulnerability. Despite being well maintained, a large section gave way after heavy rainfall, flooding neighbouring fields and a nearby sewage works.Nearly 1,000 people were evacuated from their homes and stabilisation has cost about £400,000, with full permanent repair costs unclear. Charlie Norman, the IWA’s director of campaigns, described it as a warning. “Infrastructure can fail catastrophically even when well maintained. Climate pressures alone are enough to cause serious damage.”Norman said underfunding compounded the impact of rising climate pressures. “Decades of erratic government support along with more frequent extreme weather events have left many waterways vulnerable to breaches, closures and mounting maintenance costs. This year’s drought led to the closure of dozens of canals across the country, affecting wildlife, tourism, businesses, and people living on the canals.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Our canals and rivers provide a wide range of benefits, such as connecting people to nature. That is why we are investing more than £480m of grant funding to the CRT to support essential infrastructure maintenance of our much-valued waterways.”The spokesperson said navigation authorities had independent responsibility for maintaining canal networks, safety and resilience against climate change.The CRT receives the largest share of government funding for waterways but rising climate-related demands mean state support remains insufficient to maintain its network.Campbell Robb, the CRT chief executive, said: “Emergency repairs alone cost our charity £10m last winter after eight named storms. We need the support of the public in the unrelenting task to look after and keep the canals open and thriving, including more people volunteering and donating money. The government recognises the role it also needs to continue to play to help our charity keep the network open and safe.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

About 75% fell into red or amber categories, including the Environment Agency and the Cam Conservancy, which acknowledged it could not meet all its commitments.Stoppages, such as at Jesus Green and Baits Bite Lock on the River Cam, show how network isolation harms local businesses and navigation. David Goode, the chair of the Cam Conservancy, said: “Even in a good year our fees barely cover running costs.” He called a £500,000 contribution from the local mayor towards the £1.6m Baits Bite Lock stabilisation a “life-saver” but added: “One-off grants won’t solve longer-term problems.” Jesus Green Lock remains indefinitely closed.The IWA is calling for a government review to define sustainable, long-term funding. Norman said: “Millions now will save billions in the future.”Norman said increased government investment would allow authorities to reinforce infrastructure, reduce flood risk and support water transfer schemes to alleviate drought, protecting navigation, heritage, economic activity and environmental benefits.“Without intervention, this vital, historic network faces irreversible decline by 2050,” Norman said.Explore more on these topicsRiversConservationClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

This makes them highly effective at invading tree roots and bark.Honey fungus is notorious among gardeners and is the UK’s most reported plant disease, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) said.“We started getting emails with photographs of honey fungus mushrooms for us to identify much earlier this year than we usually do,” said a RHS plant pathologist, Dr Jassy Drakulic. She said the damage was caused byArmillaria mellea, which “kills off the water-conducting tissue in roots, preventing plants from taking up water so they die back above ground”.Drakulic said that although healthy plants could be affected, they had ways of walling off infection, so it was “far more likely to cause problems to plants that are already stressed”. The hot, dry summer of 2025 could have provided that stress.The UK’s hottest summer on record may have caused trees to be vulnerable to colonisation of honey fungus mycelium. “We usually see higher numbers of honey fungus root rot cases following drought years,” said Drakulic.This was followed by a warm, damp autumn, ideal for mushroom fruiting. The mushrooms’ role is to release spores and spread to new areas.“Early indications from ongoing RHS research suggest that spores from the mushrooms ofArmillaria melleaare more important in spreading the fungus than previously thought,” said Drakulic, in addition to the underground spread by rhizomorphs or root-to-root contact.Should people be concerned? In gardens, honey fungus can devastate trees and shrubs, but a bumper year of honey fungus may reflect broader ecological changes.“Over the last two decades, climate is altering the fruiting patterns of fungi,” said Henk, adding that mushrooms “are a key part of habitats for invertebrates and food for larger animals, too”.The “concern is about the drought itself”, Drakulic said, “with the volume of mushrooms being a sign of the stress trees are under from climate change and from poor management practices that fail to recycle dead wood back into the soil”.“Research on the biology, ecology and sustainable management ofArmillariaspecies is needed to discover how we can curb their potential for harm now and in future climates,” Drakulic said.Explore more on these topicsFungiBiologyClimate crisisTrees and forestsPlantsnewsShareReuse this content"

There below me, holding in a pool, was the first wild Atlantic salmon I’ve ever seen.At this time of year, salmon run up the Laxey to return to their breeding grounds,and the locals aren’t far behind – angling for them and sea trout in the rivers forms part of the government’s unseen economy. The thing that I needed to look closely at was the tail: if it was square-cut, the fish was a sea trout, but in this case, the concave fin was conclusive.The fish and I were in the middle of Laxey village, whose name is derived from the old Norselaxsaa, meaning “salmon river”. I may have been there by luck, but the fish was not, thanks to the island’s careful management. All wild salmon are under threat, particularly from overfishing at sea, but those in Manx rivers face special dangers.View image in fullscreenA boulder weir in the River Laxey, Isle of Man.Photograph: Tim EarlFurther up the river is theLady Isabella, the world’s biggest waterwheel. It was opened in 1854 to help drain a zinc and lead mine, and is a tourist attraction today. The water in the mine remains heavily polluted and a danger to the river,so the piston rod has been disconnected to ensure thelaxsaacontinues to live up to its name.Not only that, the salmon’s progress is aided by a much-needed flood-prevention scheme. Previous structures could block the salmon’s path for weeks and collected unhelpful debris. They have been replaced by boulder weirs, effectively forming salmon slaloms, allowing the fish to swim around them with ease.Numbers have been helped by a breeding programme at a Manx government facility, which previously only bred rainbow trout for release into the island’s reservoirs. Wild salmon are gathered from the rivers and stripped of eggs and sperm to produce fertile eggs. The adults are returned to the rivers they came from and the eggs reared until the fry are released after three to four months into the same rivers, to ensure that any genetic differences between salmon in the various rivers is preserved. The results of all this work speak for themselves.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsFishCountry diaryRural affairsRiversConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While it was “confident” the “majority” of the 23,500 payments had been “suspended correctly” it urged anyone who had wrongly been sanctioned to call the helpline on their letter for a swift resolution.Flaws in the HMRC benefit fraud crackdown emerged a week ago when politicians in Northern Ireland discovered that payments had been stopped to taxpayers whoreturned home via Dublin airport, across the border.It then transpired that payments had been suspended to families across the UK, including to people who had left and returned through the same airport, and holidays as long ago as three years ago were being flagged as one-way tickets abroad.The HMRC crackdown also affected passengers who had not boarded flights, including one woman whowas refused boardingafter her child fell ill at the departure gate.Among the new cases to have emerged in the last 24 hours were a teacher who made a school trip, booked through her employer, who could not provide a plane ticket to demonstrate she had, in fact, returned to the UK.“One of the main data protection principles is that personal data should be accurate. If you don’t know whether the data is accurate, and that seems to be proven by the experiences that have been set out in the stories, then that really shows that there is a breach if data protection law,” said Eleonor Duhs, barrister and privacy law expert.The ICO said: . “We are in contact with HMRC regarding the issues raised,” a spokesperson said. “Any data-sharing between public bodies must be necessary, proportionate and carried out in line with data protection law. This includes ensuring that data is accurate and fit for purpose, especially when it is being used to make decisions linked to benefit payments.“We expect organisations to demonstrate how their use of personal data meets legal requirements, particularly where decisions may have significant impacts on individuals.”The suspension of child benefit happened after the Home Office shared its travel data, which transpired to be incomplete, to HMRC who implemented the government anti-fraud operation.HMRC insisted it had done nothing wrong in relation to data laws.A spokesperson said: “We’ve not breached any data protection laws regarding our child benefit compliance activity. We adhere to the UK GDPR and other data protection legislation when processing Personal Data.”It also said it “continuously” engaged with the ICO which sits on the Digital Economy Act Governance Board and is “aware of any agreements regarding this exercise”.The Home Office’s own communication with members of the public highlights what appear to be significant caveats.“Any travel history provided should be interpreted as an intention to travel and not as proof of travel. The carrier should be approached directly if the information is required for an official process,” it said in a document sent to a passenger who requested to see their Home Office records, through a “subject access request”.HMRC has apologised twicefor the distress caused to victims, and after an urgent review on Monday suspended the practice of stopping child benefit until it had first checked with recipients.It said it would also now cross-check travel data with pay as you earn (PAYE) tax data it held. “This strikes the right balance between protecting taxpayers’ money and ensuring payments are only suspended when appropriate,” it said.HMRC said it had an agreement in place with the Home Office “which allows us to use travel data to inform our compliance activities” and “to tackle error and fraud”.Duhs said data protection laws required schemes such as this to demonstrate that use of travel data was “necessary” and the purpose of using it was “proportionate” to the desired outcome, in this case saving of up to £350m, according to government declarations.“There is a human rights test to balance here. Under the data protection laws, the use of personal data has to be necessary, there has to be a legitimate aim, and it has to be proportionate to that aim.“We’ve got so many mistakes here it begs the question as to whether this process was done in a way that was proportionate to people’s human rights given the detriment to people’s lives and the distress caused,” Duhs said.Quick GuideContact Lisa O'Carroll about this storyShowIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Lisa using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He was arrested in north London on Sunday and deported to Addis Ababa on Wednesday afterbeing given a £500 discretionary payment.1:32Met police appeal to Epping sex offender to hand himself in – videoAccording to the IMB report, HMP Chelmsford’s release processes were examined after receiving a complaint from an “extremely stressed” vulnerable prisoner who, a few hours before release, had been given no information about where he might live or how to contact his probation officer.“On investigation, we discovered a litany of issues and errors that had led to this situation: the failure of officers to collect the prisoner for his release process briefing; a re-arranged release process briefing cancelled because it clashed with a knife awareness course; and a mix-up over release dates.“While we must assume these instances are rare, we would urge those involved to update their processes to stop prisoners ‘falling through the cracks’,” the report said.Prisoners are supposed to be given help and advice “in the last 12 weeks of their sentence”,according to the MoJ’s website.In response, to the report, Timpson wrote a two-page letter, but did not address the issue of release procedures. “I note you have raised some local issues of concern in your report, which the governor will continue to keep you aware of as work continues,” Timpson wrote.Five more prisoners freed in error after sex offender’s release from Essex jailRead moreAn asylum seeker who crossed the Channel on a small boat on 29 June, Kebatu was housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex. Eight days after his arrival, he made sexually explicit remarks to a 14-year-old girl who was eating a pizza with her friend in Epping town centre.The next day, he sexually assaulted a woman, trying to kiss her. He also tried to kiss the same 14-year-old girl he had made remarks to the day before, having encountered her again by chance.The allegations led topublic disorder outside the hotel in Epping, which became a flashpoint between far-right activists and anti-racism campaigners. It also led to protests outside hotels across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.At the entrance of the prison, Kebatu was observed by a delivery driver returning to the prison several times over an hour and a half, in a “confused” state, only to be turned away. He reportedly told prison officers that he was supposed to be deported, but was told to go towards the town centre.View image in fullscreenKebatu was eventually apprehended in north London after his accidental release.Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PAThe former Met police deputy commissioner Lynne Owens is chairing the investigation into why Kebatu was freed by mistake. David Lammy, the justice secretary, blamed “human error” after a single staff member was suspended. The prison officers’ union and the prisons’ watchdoghave warned ministersnot to scapegoat prison staff for a systemic issue.The suspended member of staff was responsible for going through the paperwork to ensure that the right prisoner was being released under the right conditions. However, the manager was checking paperwork that had already been processed by more senior staff, it is understood.The Ministry of Justice declined to explain whether the department had addressed failings raised in the report because of the ongoing inquiry.Lammy said: “Any release in error is one too many. That is why I have taken immediate action to introduce the strongest release checks ever and launched an independent investigation to get to the bottom of what went wrong.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The 11 people charged, aged from 21 to 35, all travelled to the UK from Thailand via Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.Nine of them appeared at Birmingham magistrates court on Friday, where they were bailed until their next appearance at Birmingham crown court on 28 November 2025.Six men suspected of organising the attempted importation, five of whom were arrested at addresses in Marsh Farm, Luton, and Finchley in north London on 23 October 2024, remain under investigation.NCA branch commander Kevin Broadhead said: “This was an enormous amount of cannabis to be seized from air passengers and would have been extremely profitable for organised crime gangs had it remain undetected.“The charges brought against these individuals are an important moment in our investigation, which remains ongoing.“Anyone who is asked to smuggle drugs into the UK should think very carefully about the potential consequences if caught. The chances of getting caught are high, and it just isn’t worth that risk.”Last year, the NCAsaidthe amount of cannabis seized from smugglers carrying the drug in suitcases to UK airports had tripled in less than a year, with about 15 tonnes of the drug being uncovered at airports by August 2024, compared with 5 tonnes throughout the whole of 2023, and 2 tonnes in 2022.Thailand, Canada and the parts of the US where cannabis is decriminalised and can be legally grown are hotspots for trafficking to the UK. Gangs can make significant profits by selling cannabis trafficked from these countries because they are perceived as being high-quality.There have been a number of high-profile cannabis trafficking cases recently. Former Arsenal footballer Jay Emmanuel-Thomas was sentenced to four years in prison in June after he admitted orchestrating a plot to recruit two women to travel to Thailand and smuggle cannabis back to the UK. Two women, including Thomas’s girlfriend, were caught at Stansted airport with four suitcases each containing 15kg (33lbs) of cannabis.In May, Bella Culley, a 19-year-old student nurse from Billingham, was arrested at Tbilisi airport after being stopped with, it is alleged, 14kg (31lbs) of cannabis worth £200,000 in a travel bag. She had been travelling in south-east Asia but was reported missing in Pattaya, Thailand until her arrest in Georgia.Culley had previously been told she could face up to 20 years in jail or life imprisonment if convicted but her family havepaid£138,000 in a plea-bargain deal that could result in her being handed a two-year jail sentence.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Having had the opportunity to see Reform from the inside, I’ve concluded that the party doesn’t really have the experience or ambition to do that,” he said.Buchan said he wanted to be able to “look my family in the eye and say, ‘that’s not who I am’” after Nigel Farage’s party announced plans toend indefinite leave to remain status.He said “relying on rhetoric and slogans isn’t going to help real families in communities” such as his and “the more I saw ofReform UK, the more uncomfortable I felt to be part of it”.“Things like a proposal to remove indefinite leave to remain from all non-EU residents who are working here perfectly legally is an example that could be devastating for decent people who have built a life here and contribute to our country,” he said.Reform announced earlier this year that it would scrap indefinite leave to remain and replace it with visas that would require people to reapply to live in the UK as part of plans to tighten immigration.The councillor, who won his seat for Reform in a July byelection, said the policy created a “huge amount of fear and anxiety” and accused the party of having “a pretty unfortunate way of treating people”.Reform UK, the Russian spy and rolls of Kremlin cash: the inside story of Nathan GillRead moreA Reform source said: “He got elected in July 2025 as a Reform councillor.

In areas under its control, JNIM is already enforcing dress codes and punishments via courts that, as Human Rights Watch noted in a 2024 report, did not adhere to fair trial standards.On Tuesday the US state department issued its second advisory in a week to its citizens in Mali, urging all US citizens to “depart immediately using commercial aviation”, citing infrastructural problems and the “unpredictability of Bamako’s [the capital] security situation”. On Wednesday, Australia, Germany and Italy also urged their citizens to leave as soon as possible.Observers within and outside Mali say things could escalate faster and that the US’s warnings are the latest indication that the country is on the brink of a third successful coup in five years and the sixth since independence from France in September 1960.“I don’t want to sound too dramatic, but the country is collapsing before our eyes,” a former Malian minister who now lives in exile told the Guardian anonymously. “I would not be shocked if another overthrow happens within the next few days.“Before 31 December, a coup will happen in theSahel,” the former official continued. “Mali will go first and then you’ll have the same domino effect that we’ve seen between 2020 and 2023, with all of these countries falling one after the other.”Sahel-based jihadists are extending their reach. Can a fractured region push back?Read moreMali is grappling with a two-week fuel scarcity due to blockades targeting trucks from neighbouring Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Senegal, by JNIM. Drivers and soldiers have either been kidnapped or killed – or in some cases, both.Landlocked Mali relies mostly on imports to keep its stuttering economy running. In the absence of the fuel trucks, life has come to a standstill in most of Bamako.Long queues in gas stations are a common sight now, and in many parts of the city, there is no electricity. Shops and supermarkets are closed, as many people stay indoors, unable to find transport and prices of food items keep rising. Schools have also been shut down tentatively, until 9 November.Analysts such as Ulf Laessing, the Bamako-based head of the Sahel programme at the German thinkthank KonradAdenauer Foundation, say next week could be pivotal in the lifespan of the current junta.“I think next week will be really bad, because then the existing stocks everybody’s living off will be gone,” he said. “It’s hard to see a way out. It’s just difficult to see how they can resupply the capital in sufficient quantities.”Several analysts approached by the Guardian declined to comment on the matter, saying the regime’s sensitivity about comments deemed to not be strongly in its favour, is at an all-time high.View image in fullscreenA petrol station in Bamako. The crisis has been exacerbated as armed groups block key routes used by fuel tankers, disrupting supply lines to the capital.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyAn Islamic state“So far nobody is demonstrating against the government because I think they know if they brought down this government, then the next one would be an Islamist one so it can also kind of strengthen the regime’s resolve a bit,” said Laessing.In June 2020, civil society, religious groups and opposition parties formed a protest coalition known as the June 5 Movement – Rally of Patriotic Forces (M5-RFP) that spearheaded large-scale protests against the democratically elected president Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, citing corruption and worsening security.Among the M5-RFP’s most visible figures was Mahmoud Dicko, an influential and controversial imam who first came to national spotlight with his role in the 1991 coup of the then president Moussa Traoré. The cleric’s mobilisation played a key role in forcing the collapse of the Keïta government.During one meeting where the regional bloc Ecowas, or the Economic Community of West African States, mediated between the state and M5-RFP, Keïtadropped a shocker. “I was part of the meeting when he told Ecowas leaders that Imam Dicko wants Mali to become an Islamic country under sharia law,” the former minister said. “When he said that, hell broke loose.”Within two months, soldiers led by Assimi Goïta, a young captain, took over government, replacing parliament with the National Transitional Council (NTC). A second coup within a year led to Goïta being sworn in as head of state.However, the junta’s promises have mostly been unfulfilled. The NTC, headed by Col Malick Diaw, scheduled elections for February 2022 but has repeatedly postponed them.In the meantime the death toll from the insurgency has risen sharply; the total since 2012 has exceeded 17,700, with more than two-thirds of that occurring after 2020, according todatafrom the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. JNIM, whose finances have been boosted by several high-profile ransoms paid for abductees, including Emirati citizens, is expanding operations to Benin and Nigeria in coastal west Africa.Human rights groups have also alleged that Mali’s operations with Wagner mercenaries and pro-junta militias comprising hunter militias are rife with abuses.End of the road?The junta’s isolation seems nearly complete.It signed a pact for military assistance with the regimes of Burkina Faso and Niger but the effect of that remains to be seen. Having broken off relations with Ecowas, Mali is also unable to draw on its military resources.In recent years, some foreign diplomatic missions have scaled back their presence just as the junta expelled staff from other groups amid deteriorating relations with the west.Consequently, there have been reports of increasing frustration within the ranks of the army, suggesting internal tensions among the five colonels who staged the first coup. Two of them, Diaw and the defence minister, Sadio Camara, are being mooted as potential successors who could replace Goïta.Meanwhile, Dicko, who has been in exile in Algeria since 2023 after falling out with the government andlosing his diplomatic passport, is expected to return.“Some JNIM people are asking for Dicko to come back so they can negotiate with him instead of the Malian government,” the insider said. “This is their end goal, to turn Mali into an Islamic state and they’re very close.”Explore more on these topicsMaliAfricaAl-QaidaSahelnewsShareReuse this content"

The other three have been released without charge.The heist of the decade - podcastRead moreThe woman was in tears as she appeared at a Paris court, saying she feared for her children and for herself, according to AFP.She has been charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to preparing a crime.The magistrate justified the detention of the woman, who lives in the French capital’s northern suburb of La Courneuve, on the grounds of a “risk of collusion” and “disturbance of public order”.The man was charged with organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to preparing a crime, the Paris prosecutor said.The individual was known to the judicial authorities for previous theft offences, she said.Prosecutor has ‘small hope’ of recovering Louvre jewels thanks to gear left by thievesRead moreHe has been placed in pre-trial detention pending a hearing to take place in the coming days, the prosecutor added.“Both individuals denied any involvement in the events,” Beccuau said.Last month, thieves wielding power toolsraided the Louvre, the world’s most visited art museum, in broad daylight, taking just seven minutes to steal jewellery worth an estimated €88m (£76m).French authorities initially announced the arrest of two male suspects over the Louvre robbery, and this week prosecutors said that police hadarrested five more peopleincluding a main suspect.Adrien Sorrentino, a lawyer for the woman who was remanded in custody, said his client denied the charges against her.“She is devastated,” he told reporters.“This is a spectacular heist, and the decision that has just been made is a spectacular one: a young woman has just been placed in detention despite being presumed innocent.”Sofia Bougrine, a lawyer for one of the people arrested this week but later released, pointed to what she said was the indiscriminate nature of some of the arrests.“In these serious crime cases, we find that waves of arrests look more like drift nets,” Bougrine told AFP.The first two men arrested earlier were charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after“partially admitting to the charges”, Beccuau said earlier this week.They are suspected of being the two who broke into the gallery while two accomplices waited outside.Both lived in the north-eastern Paris suburb of Aubervilliers.One is a 34-year-old Algerian national living inFrance, who was identified by DNA traces found on one of the scooters used to flee the heist. The second man is a 39-year-old unlicensed taxi driver.Both were known to the police for having committed thefts.The first was arrested as he was about to board a plane for Algeria at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.Louvre thieves’ slow-motion getaway using furniture lift was caught on videoRead moreThe second was apprehended shortly after near his home, and there was no evidence to suggest that he was planning to go abroad, prosecutors said.The stolen loot remains missing.The thieves dropped a diamond- and emerald-studded crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, as they escaped.The burglars made off with eight other items of jewellery.Among them are an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise, and a diadem that once belonged to the Empress Eugenie, which is dotted with nearly 2,000 diamonds.The interior minister, Laurent Nuñez, told the French daily Le Parisien: “I remain confident that we will be able to find them.”Explore more on these topicsParisMuseumsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

While the state tends to reliably support Democrats in federal elections, it has a history of flipping between parties in its gubernatorial contests. Experts point out that no party has held the office for three consecutive termssince 1961.Adding to the unpredictability of the race, Republicans have made gains in New Jersey in recent years. In 2021, Ciattarellilost to Murphybyonly three points. And in 2024, the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, carried the state by just5.9 points,down from Joe Biden’s16-pointmargin in 2020.“The Republican party is feeling energized inNew Jersey, specifically after two close showings here in the state,” said Daniel Bowen, an associate professor of public policy at the College of New Jersey.Recentpollsshow a tight race, with Sherrill leading Ciattarelliby single digits.A Ciattarelli win, Bowen said, would be “huge for the Republican party” and it would show that “the Maga brand of politics can win in a place like New Jersey, highly educated, wealthy, not rural, urban state.”By contrast, a Sherrill win, Bowen said, could signal a rejection of Maga politics and point to a “broader blue wave response across the country to what theTrump administrationhas been doing as we think forward to the 2026 midterm elections.”In Elizabeth, New Jersey, on Wednesday, Sherrill met with about 100 people at the O’Donnell Dempsey senior citizen center to discuss affordability, housing, healthcare, immigration and stopping Trump.Among those in the room was 71-year-old Evelyn Velez, who said she was backing Sherrill because there “has to be somebody that’s going to stand up to the administration that’s in Washington DC right now”.“We need somebody that’s gonna fight for the working class, who’s gonna fight for health insurance, lower taxes, and I think she is the best candidate,” Velez, a lifelong New Jersey resident, said.Another supporter, Kim Nesbitt Good, 69, said she felt confident that Sherrill would win and supported her because she was “not about hate, she’s positive, and that’s what we need, somebody that’s positive, someone that’s interested in the country, and the people in this country”.While both candidates have focused much of their campaigns on local issues like cost of living and taxes, national politics and Trump have loomed large.A recent pollfound that52% of New Jersey voters said Trump was a “major factor” in their choice for governor. Sherrill has frequently sought totie Ciattarelli to Trumpand his policies, while Ciattarelli has made efforts to link Sherrill to Governor Murphy, who, according torecent polling, has a 34% approval and 50% disapproval rating in the state. By comparison, the same survey found that Trump holds a 45% approval rating in the state.The contest has drawnmillions of dollars in spendingand endorsements from national political figures. Ciattarelli hascampaignedwith Trump allies, including the Florida representativeByron Donaldsand Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump himself also recentlyspokefor about 10 minutes at a virtual “tele-rally” for Ciattarelli.On the Democratic side,former president Barack Obama,Pennsylvaniagovernor Josh Shapiro, Marylandgovernor Wes Moore, Michigangovernor Gretchen Whitmerand former transportation secretaryPete Buttigieghave allbeen campaigningfor Sherrill.In a recent interview, Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, toldPoliticothat he wasn’t focused on whether Democrats “overperform or underperform” in this race. “What I care about is making sure we win,” he said. “At the end of the day, we know that the Republicans are feeling very bullish about their chances in New Jersey.In Morris county, one of the five New Jersey counties thatflippedfrom blue to red in the 2024 election , about 20 people gathered at a cafe on Wednesday morning to meet the county sheriff, Jim Gannon, Ciattarelli’spick forlieutenant governor.Among them was Mike Lombardi, 35, who said his top concerns were “electric bills, crime, immigration”. He said he believed that Ciattarelli and Gannon were the “ideal candidates to lead New Jersey”.Lombardi, who said that he had been involved with voter outreach for Ciattarelli, said this year’s race felt different because of the “energy around the Ciattarelli campaign”.Another supporter, 45-year-old Nick Steenstra, nodded in agreement and said that Ciattarelli was the change that New Jersey needed.Still, Steenstra recognized the challenge ahead. “There are a lot more registered Democrats in the state,” he said, adding that to win, Ciattarelli needed to turn out not just Republicans but also the unaffiliated voters in the state, of which there aremore than 2 million.One thing that experts are closely watching in this race is voter turnout. In 2021,only 40% of eligiblevotersparticipatedin New Jersey’s gubernatorial election.“Which side is more motivated to vote is probably going to ultimately decide this,” Shields said, noting that the race “may be defined by how energized Democratic voters are or are not”.Whatever the outcome, analysts say that the implications will probably extend beyond New Jersey.On the Republican side, Shields said people were watching “what the impact of the Trump administration, what the impact of the sort of national politics are on the Republican candidate in a state that tends to vote blue federally”.And on the Democratic side, Shields said “there are a lot of questions about the Democratic party nationally and unifying the Democratic party between the more progressive side and the more moderate side” so they will be watching to see “how Sherrill tries to unify the Democratic party, and is it successful?”.Brigid Harrison, professor of political science and law at Montclair State University, agreed and said that a Ciattarelli victory would be a boost for Republicans heading into 2026.But if Sherrill wins, Harrison said, “it’s a much different and kind of nuanced narrative”.“You see this ongoing tension in the Democratic party between the more moderateDemocratswho are saying: ‘Look, we need to get the folks that migrated to the Republican party back on board’ and progressives who are saying: ‘We need to come at this from a more radical agenda,’” she said.A Sherrill win, Harrison said, could be viewed as “a shot in the arm for those moderates who will want to claim the mantle, saying how we move forward as a party is through policies that are middle of the road.”Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansDemocratsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, as it happens, the same query crops up when shopping for a yacht. “Oh, you’d never get it off that decking,” the other half of a young couple replies as they size up one of the £2m triple-decker yachts moored at the recentSouthamptoninternational boat show.Top boat manufacturers descended on the port city from across Europe to show off bigger, better and bolder yachts than ever before, as well as lines of smaller sailing and motor boats. But the show, once a must-attend of the season alongside exhibitions in Cannes and Monaco, has shrunk by about 30% this year, according to some vendors’ estimates.Some of the changes were part of an effort to cut the show’s costs, but it is not difficult to see why it might be smaller this year: flags advertising advice on inheritance tax and pensions blow in the wind, and chatter about the government’s budget this month swirls around the pontoons amid fears that higher taxes will curb wealthy buyers’ spending power.As Rachel Reeves examines ways to repair the public finances, shehas said those with the “broadest shoulders” should pay their “fair share”. The exact method the chancellor will use to tax the wealthy is unclear. Reeves has previously ruled out imposing a new“wealth tax”but other options have been floated including raising the rate of capital gains tax; levying national insurance on rental income and creating higher council tax bands.Bill Stringer, of the boat broker Key Yachting, says sales are harder than ever to secure this year. “We are in a soft spot,” he says. “There is a lot of uncertainty in the world. Clients do have money but they are more cautious and the budget is on people’s minds.”Sales of vessels under 50 metres are down 12%, driven by a sharp drop in sailing yacht sales in the 30- to 40-metre range, according to SuperYacht Times. Sales of motor yachts between 30 and 40 metres are flat.Stringer adds: “Buyers are delaying because they want to see what happens in the budget. We have had a couple of people say they were going to sell their business at the beginning of the year, but they are going to push it back.“Sales are hard to come by, but possible. It is not availability of money, it is uncertainty that stops people from making decisions.”‘Sod it – let’s buy a boat’View image in fullscreen‘Would you get wine stains out of that decking?’Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianPressure is building in some corners of the UK’s luxury boat market, too. Princess, which is based in Plymouth, and its Poole-based rival Sunseeker International are the leaders in sector – and last year the former laid out plans to cut its hourly paid workforce by about 260 roles.Its chief executive, Will Green, told employees that 2024 had been “the most challenging commercial conditions in the company’s history”, and that Labour’s first budget had “severely impacted” its recovery plan.Now, as the industry braces for Labour’s second budget, marketing to the millionaires shopping at the Southampton show is critical.About 90,000 visitors came to the show over the course of 10 days, a mix of hobbyists and serious buyers, who tour the yachts lined up on the pontoons. These are imposing vehicles, several close to 30 metres long, with most kitted out with luxurious double bedrooms, en suite bathrooms, marble-top kitchens and huge media units.The sector says it contributes £4.7bn gross value to the UK economy – and at the show it is easy to see why. The crowd has some big spenders among it: a pro doing flips on a jetski draws in a group of middle-aged men eyeing up a potential new toy.A shipyard stage brings live music to the show each day, as well as food trucks and a Guinness bar. It certainly helps to keep the mood buoyant. Phil Dollin, of Inspiration Marine Group, one of the biggest boat dealerships in the UK, says that even with concerns mounting over tax, there are still some buyers willing to take the plunge. His group represents Privilege Catamarans, as well as Hanse, Dehler and Moody sailing yachts.“When there is a change of government policy, it tends to be fairly negative towards the higher net worth individuals, and they get nervous and hold on to their money,” he says.“But then another year goes by and it dawns on them they have only gotten older. We now seem to be at that stage: they’re thinking, sod it, let’s just get on with it.”Dollin, whose average sale is worth about £400,000, says it is changes to inheritance tax on pensions that has most upset his buyers, most of whom are aged between 60 and 70 years old. From April 2027,defined contribution pension pots will be pulled into the IHT net.“It is brutal,” he says. “They are feeling very attacked. There is definitely ill feeling towards the tax regime at the moment.”A cap on how much people can give as gifts before they pay inheritance tax – currently not applicable if the donor lives for a further seven years – is reportedly being considered, which could affect boat owners. However, mooted higher property taxes could still make boats an attractive proposition for consumers looking to invest a lump sum.Still, boats are complicated assets to manage: when buying a yacht in the UK, the primary taxes are VAT and customs duty, which can vary depending on where you buy the vessel and where you intend to use it. Luckily for UK yacht owners, the EU has a “temporary admission” scheme where boats that paid UK VAT can cruise in EU waters for up to 18 months at a time without incurring European VAT on the boat itself.But like cars, yachts gradually depreciate in value, though typically at a slower rate. In 2024, the price for a used yacht of more than 30 metres dropped by 7.9% on average, according to SuperYacht Times.The budget also isn’t the only factor deterring buyers. “We did not think that the cost-of-living crisis and higher interest rates would have affected the market, but it seems to have done,” Stringer adds. “The other driver is that new boat prices have gone up dramatically in the past five years – back in 2010, a dentist, lawyer or headteacher could buy a boat out of their salary. Now you either have to have someone die, or sell your business.”Cash buyers aboardView image in fullscreen‘It is a complex affair buying a boat.’Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThere is, however, an elite group of buyers who can simply afford to shoulder a higher tax bill as well as a brand new boat. Stuart Brotherton, a sales network director at Ancasta, one of the biggest marine brokers in Europe, says the group has had its best September ever for sales, securing more than €20m (£17m) from the Cannes and Southampton shows combined.The group sells across a wide spectrum of models, with yachts ranging from €15,000 to more than $22m.“Sales have been across all of our brands, right from a small Beneteau sailing boat to agreeing a deal for a 30-metre (96ft) Sanlorenzo,” he says. The luxury yacht costs more than £4m.“Some people do get carried away. They get boat show fever, then speak to their accountant and realise it is the wrong time to pull out a load of money.“Sometimes we can get them to take out finance, but some people are just against borrowing money.”Most of the serious shoppers perusing the show are cash buyers, Stringer says.“There is loads of marine finance around but it is super expensive, I don’t know why anyone would do that,” he says.“It is a complex affair buying a boat. It is very emotional, and family, partner, finance – all of that needs to fall in place.”Explore more on these topicsLuxury goods sectorSouthamptonnewsShareReuse this content"

The farm said it had expanded its range of sides and turkey sizes this year to meet what it expects will be even higher demand.Data from the online retailer Ocado shows searches for Thanksgiving have jumped 440% year on year, while pumpkin spice is up more than 550%. Ocado’s sales data also indicates American food has grown in popularity among shoppers: sales of Herr’s buffalo blue cheese curls are up 410% year on year, and Newman’s Own ranch dressing by more than 202%.Research commissioned by the firm found 42% of gen Z and millennials say they have attended a Thanksgiving meal in the UK, and 16% plan to attend or host the holiday for the first time this November. More than half (53%) believe US holidays such as Thanksgiving and American-style Halloweens are becoming bigger fixtures in the British calendar.Dan Elton, the chief customer officer at Ocado Retail, said: “We’re seeing this love of American food culture translating into what people are buying … from ranch dressing and marshmallows, to mac and cheese.”According to the market research company Mintel, interest in American-style food has risen sharply in the past two years, particularly among younger consumers. More than half of British adults (58%) have ordered or are interested in ordering southern US dishes such as Louisiana gumbo. That figure has grown from 52% in early 2024 to 67% by mid-2025, peaking at 81% among gen Z – those born approximately between 1997 and 2012. In the same period, one in five Britons visited an American-style restaurant, rising to nearly one in three younger consumers.“UK interest in Thanksgiving reflects a growing appetite for American food,” said Trish Caddy, the associate director of food service research at Mintel. “It’s less cultural adoption, more culinary celebration. This taps into a wider experience-driven eating trend where people seek themed menus, social connection and limited-edition offerings.”London restaurant CUT at 45 Park Lane has extended its Thanksgiving service in response to a surge in bookings. “We’re now doing around 180 covers throughout the day and have opened Bar 45 for the whole week, serving Thanksgiving-inspired snacks like pecan pie, turkey croquettes and bacon-wrapped dates,” said the culinary director, Elliott Grover.He added that bookings had roughly doubled year on year but this has also been due to them opening up further covers to meet demand. It’s popular with lots of American guests, but also many others who simply want to experience it for the first time, Grover said.In May, the Guardian reported a rise in Americans moving to the UK for political reasons as Donald Trump assumed the presidency. US applications for UK citizenshiphit a record high last year at more than 6,100, a 26% increase from 2023. There was a 40% year-on-year rise during the final three months of 2024, coinciding with the time of Trump’s re-election.At Whole Foods Market UK, the demand around Thanksgiving now rivals the buildup to Christmas. “The moment our online ordering for the holiday goes live, we see a rush of customers eager to secure their meal,” said Izzie Peskett, the head of marketing. “It’s become a real occasion here, whether people are hosting American friends or simply recreating that classic, comforting spread at home.”While American expats remain part of the audience, Peskett says curiosity among British shoppers has grown rapidly. “Thanksgiving is now less about where you’re from and more about embracing the warmth and generosity of the occasion,” she said.“Our customers come for the quality and authenticity of classic dishes, from pumpkin and pecan pies, cornbread stuffing, green beans, sweet potatoes and, of course, our organic turkeys.”Explore more on these topicsThanksgivingFoodRetail industryConsumer spendingShareReuse this content"

A non-answer elicited an eye roll and a tut. “Oh god, I feel like I’m back at school,” sighed the woman, 62-year-old Corinna Schröder.The museum advertises Langelinck’s tours, which cost €7, as “grumpy” and “highly unpleasant”, though that might still be an understatement. Over the course of the 70-minute walk, the ponytailed art historian points fingers into visitors’ faces, tells them off for checking their phones or sitting down, and berates them for their general ignorance, all while stomping through the palatial corridors of the Kunstpalast at breakneck speed.View image in fullscreenCorinna Schröder is singled out from the crowd on the tour.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianIn spite of the rudeness, or perhaps because of it, the twice-monthly “Grumpy Guide” tour has been a surprise hit, with each one since the launch in May sold out. Anyone looking to book a spot will have to wait until next year.“I never insult visitors directly, based on their personality or their appearance, but I insult them as a group,” said Carl Brandi, 33, the performance artist who conceived of and performs as the aggressive Langelinck. “My contempt is directed at an inferred ignorance that may not even exist. But I try to make them feel as ignorant as possible.”Asked to explain the tour’s popularity, Brandi said people “enjoy the emotional ride”. “We all know comedy or cabaret formats where the performer’s bad mood or aggressive attitude is key to the show, it’s just not something we’re used to seeing in museums. And unlike in a comedy show, there’s no barrier between the character and the audience here,” he said.View image in fullscreenJoseph Langelinck in full flow.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianThe Kunstpalast director, Felix Krämer, was inspired to commission Brandi’s act partly by the viral success of “rude waiter” restaurants, such asKaren’s Diner, in Sydney, or Rome’s Cencio la Parolaccia, though impolite service staff are hardly an alien concept on the banks of the Rhine. Waiters at brewery pubs in Düsseldorf and neighbouring Cologne, colloquially known asKöbesse, areknown for their brash wit.“There are many parts of Europe where you get something like a local pride in your native bad-mood tradition,” Brandi said. The Austrian playwright Peter Handke’s 1966 “anti-play”Offending the Audience, in which an actor challenges the public’s “thoughtless thinking”, was a more highbrow reference point.Under pressure to justify subsidies and state support, museums across Europe are looking for novel ways of attracting different and younger audiences via non-elite formats: Stuttgart’s House of History hostsnudist eveningsin which visitors can stroll naked among the exhibits, and the Netherlands’ Museum Voorlinden offerssocks-only toursfor those who want to appreciate works of art in shoeless silence.View image in fullscreen‘The way he criticised the curation of the museum was ingenious,’ one visitor said.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianThe Langelinck character both caters to and subverts such curatorial fashions, for the thought of art as entertainment is one of the many things that disgust him. At the entrance to the Kunstpalast’s permanent collection, visitors are encouraged to take pictures and share them on social media, and to question the distinction between high and low art. “From Aldi to Rubens,” says one wall text set against neon colours. Throughout the museum, oil paintings are juxtaposed with everyday objects, including chairs, glass trinkets and an original Volkswagen Beetle – a tendency that infuriates the ill-tempered guide.As he races from exhibit to exhibit, his disgruntlement shifts from the visitors to the museum and its curators. Brandi has fitted his character with a backstory: he is a distant relation to Johann Wilhelm von der Pfalz, the Elector Palatine, from whose vast collection most of the artworks on display at the museum are drawn. Langelinck’s bitterness, the audience soon realises, comes from a sense of wounded personal pride.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The side-by-side hanging of Ellen Louise Clacy’s 19th-century oil painting of the Great Plague and Eadweard Muybridge’s near-contemporary early photographs of humans and animals in motion are dismissed as a platitude, designed for shares on social media.View image in fullscreen‘You may as well have walked into a furniture shop,’ Langelinck complains at one point on the tour.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianBy the end of the tour, Langelinck appears on the verge of a personal breakdown, apoplectically ringing the bell inside a plaster belltower made by the artist Inge Mahn in 1971.Brandi said: “In fine art museums there is always a kind of power imbalance between the museum’s assertion that ‘we can decide what is worth seeing here’ and the visitors, who more or less have to comply.“And to turn this power imbalance on its head and say what some people might believe anyway when they go to a museum – that the museum has no idea, they’re just showing you anything – I think people find that refreshing.”After 70 minutes of being snapped and shouted at, most visitors agreed. “I thought it was very funny and clever,” said Lothar Richter, 68, who had made a spontaneous visit to the gallery and tagged along on the tour. “The way he criticised the curation of the museum was ingenious.”Schröder enjoyed the evening too, in spite of her ticking off. Which is not to say she is keen to repeat the experience. “Maybe next time I visit the museum I will just go for fun.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyMuseumsArtEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Shimmering icons of empowerment or Pygmalion projects for middle-aged A&R men? Here’s a radical idea – they’re both. Two become one, baby. That’s the sense you get from Girlbands Forever (Sat, 9.20pm, BBC Two), the documentary executive produced by Louis Theroux charting the fortunes of 90s bands such asAll Saints, Eternal,Atomic KittenandMis-Teeqthrough to 00s starsLittle Mix. If that lineup speaks to your elder millennial soul the way it does mine, climb on board, carefully. I need some nostalgia, like I’ve never needed nostalgia before.Of course we want the gossip, fallouts and scandals. Band members interviewed for the three-part series are happy to supply. Kelle Bryan from Eternal reveals they were sent to a facility in the countryside and put on controlled diets to manage their weight (though the head of EMI UK denies all knowledge). Kerry Katona tells how a journalist turned up at her mother’s house with a bag of cocaine to get her to sell a story. Melanie Blatt ofAll Saintssays that when she discovered she was pregnant, she was told to abort.Girlbands Forever could have been a cynical exercise: see who’s desperate enough to want to be in this, dredge up their worst moments while viewers make assessments about which of them has the nicest house. Instead, it has sensitivity and scope, as interested in charting the social mores these artists created, were crucified by, or changed in some way.I’m not sure things have improved. Attractive celebrities once took pains to hide their relationships, to maintain an illusion of being sexually available. These days, we’ve exploded the notion of privacy, and realised relationships can be cannibalised on social media for cachet. Progress! Black artists once worked five times as hard for a 20th of the attention. Imagine. The show is refreshingly unequivocal that the addition of a slender, blond, white woman could transform a band’s fortune. While our pop culture lens has widened, it’s hardly pointing in a different direction.It’s the old footage that breaks your heart. They are such vibrantly talented children. Look at Atomic Kitten meeting Westlife for the first time, all teenage flirtation. Check out the “steely, non-choreography” of the early, surlySugababes. There is adorable footage of Mutya on a Michael Barrymore show, in which she appears to literally be a baby. I’m glad the doc gets into the Sugababes’ revolving door policy. One of the funniest things to happen in music this century, it’s also a living manifestation of the Ship of Theseus philosophical paradox. Let’s not get into that.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Melanie Blatt, Natalie Appleton, Shaznay Lewis and Nicole Appleton as All Saints performing at The Mobo awards in 1997.Photograph: JMEnternational/Getty ImagesSpice Girls are the silverbacks in the ring, who came from nowhere and conquered the globe with their debut single. None feature here, yet it’s interesting to hear from established artists who floundered in the wake of the Jenny-come-latelies. Some profess to being underwhelmed by Wannabe, while their five-way demographic appeal is presented as a triumph of marketing. “Girl Power? That was EMI power,” scoffs producer Pete Waterman.The music industry comes out of this badly (though Piers Morgan comes out of it worse than anyone). A repeating pattern we’re shown is that when band members get pregnant, the sentence handed down from male management is the same: you’ve destroyed the band. In this context, seeing Blatt perform at Party in the Park with her pronounced baby bump showing, sexy and defiant as ever, is a punk-rock, sea-change vision. Still the coolest person in the room, she had reservations about appearing here at all. “Hello, I’m Mel from the 90s” is how she introduces herself. Oh, she dope.Another repeating pattern: talented but frustrated girls break ties with their Henry Higgins founders and succeed in their own way. No matter how these bands started, what they become is up to them. Without always feeling empowered, they were avatars of it for younger generations. They represented the joy of being in a gang of girls, often working-class, travelling the world and living a dream. The world needs that. Plus you can’t go wrong with a TV soundtrack of songs including Never Ever, Sounds of the Underground and Scandalous. You know what to do. Push the button.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherDocumentaryFactual TVPop and rockAll SaintsLittle MixSugababesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The host,Rick Mercer, was doing a series in which people well known for one kind of accomplishment, such as writing, astonished viewers by doing something different and entirely unrelated, such as rolling a joint.“I want you to be a hockey goalie,” Rick said.“Oh, I don’t think so,” I said. “Couldn’t I just maybe bake a pie or something?”“No. You gotta be a goalie.”“Why?”“Because it’ll be funny. Trust me.”So I was a goalie, in a full set of pads, with gloves and a stick.There I am on YouTube, still goalie-ing it up; and, yes, it is kind of funny.I wore my own little white figure skates with black socks over them to make them look like hockey skates. But you can’t slide and stack the pads in figure skates, so those feats were performed by a body double – an accomplished women’s hockey player. With her face mask on, you can’t tell that it isn’t me. It’s the job of the body double to take the risks you yourself are too sedate or chicken or unaccomplished to take.I wish I could have a body double in my real life, I thought. It would come in so handy.Of course, I do have one. Every writer does. The body double appears as soon as you start writing. How can it be otherwise? There’s the daily you, and then there’s the other person who does the actual writing. They aren’t the same. But, in my case, there are more than two. There are lots.Some months after my sixth novel,The Handmaid’s Tale, had been published, I was doing a book event to promote it. During audience question time – with open mics, which many folks present used to deliver sermons – a man gave his opinion.“So, The Handmaid’s Tale is autobiography,” he said. It wasn’t a question.“No, it’s not,” I said.“Yes, it is.”“No, it’s not. It’s set in the future,” I said.“That’s no excuse,” he said.He was wrong, of course. Within my own lived experience, I had not donned a red outfit and a white bonnet and been coerced into procreating for the top brass of a theological hierarchy. But, in a very broad sense, he was right. Everything that gets into your writing has gone through your mind in some form. You may mix and match and create new chimeras, but the primary materials have to have travelled through your head.While discussing my novelCat’s Eyewhen it first appeared, I was evasive. Was the novel based on my own personal experience? Well, I would say, judging from the large number of letters from many different countries relating similar and worse experiences, it would appear to have reflected universals. This was true. Letters poured in, from erstwhile children, from their siblings, from their parents: accounts of lifelong trauma inflicted by girls on other girls, men saying they’d never understood until now what was going on among the girls in Grade Four, despairing parents wondering what to do about the misery being inflicted on their girl by other girls. When I did public book signings, some women would break down in tears while thanking me for writing the book.“You knew a Cordelia,” I would say. Yes. They had.View image in fullscreenAtwood after winning the 2000 Booker prize award.Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PACat’s Eye was nominated for the Booker prize, and Graeme and I went to the dinner in London. I’d made myself a stretchy, strapless, silver-sequined top to be worn under a black jacket, though I hadn’t quite finished it and had fastened it up at the back with big safety pins. I’m sure the book proceedings were riveting, though I was preoccupied: would my elasticized silver top escape from its safety pins and go sproinging across the room?My silver top was to no avail. “Atwood fails to win Booker,” as the Canadian press was now in the habit of saying. However, no prize depends on your own active participation: it’s not an athletic contest, so you can’t exactly fail at it. More like Best Pig in Show: the pig stands there looking fat as someone else pins a ribbon on it. I did get a nice handbound copy of my own book, however.Alias Grace was shortlisted for the Booker prize, but didn’t win it. The head of the jury was the formidable toughieCarmen Callil, once of the feminist press Virago, who announced in her speech that we’d had enough of colonials and the Celtic fringe, and that it was time for an English man to win.By this time, I had a running contest going on with novelistBeryl Bainbridgeas to which of us could get nominated for the Booker the most times without actually winning. So far, we were even-steven. I received a lot of mail about Alias Grace. Some writers wanted to know if they were related to Grace. (Unlikely.) Some fans made the quilt that Grace makes at the end of the book – “The Tree of Paradise” – and sent me pictures of it, and in some cases the actual quilt.But then in 2000The Blind Assassinwon the Bookerprize. Whew, I thought. I no longer have to deal with reporters asking me why I didn’t win it, only with the ones who’ll be saying why I shouldn’t have.We were on a publicity tour forThe Testamentsin London when Graeme woke in the night with a terrible headache. By six in the morning he couldn’t speak, or move his eyes, one of his arms, and one of his legs. I called an ambulance. The nice paramedics arrived. Because the hotel was very old, the elevators were too small to accommodate a gurney, so they’d brought a wheelchair. At first Graeme refused to bend his legs so they could get him into it. He feared they would take him to a hospital and try to save him by doing an operation on him. But I had vowed I wouldn’t let that happen. I told him it would be all right, and we finally got him into the ambulance. I promised him that I would follow his wishes, and he relaxed. We held hands, as we’d been doing so frequently in the past year.I called my director of operations, Lucia Cino, who – thankfully – had come with us from Italy to London. I don’t know what I would have done without her help. She worked the phone and emails, telling all the publishers and agents what had happened and explaining that the book tour they’d arranged would have to be postponed and possibly cancelled. Friends and relatives were informed. Meanwhile, the ambulance took Graeme and me to the hospital and Graeme had an MRI. Together with the doctors, I looked at the images. Graeme had had a massive cerebral hemorrhage. “There’s nothing we can do,” said the doctors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They must have had to deal with many tearful people pleading with them to restore their doomed loved ones to health.I’d told Jess and Matthew that maybe they shouldn’t fly over, as Graeme wasn’t likely to be conscious for long – the brain bleed was vertical and moving down, and would hit the brain stem quite soon, which would shut off his breathing. Of course they came anyway. They were in time for a smile and a squeeze of the hand from Graeme. He knew they were there.Earlier in the year, he’d talked all the kids through the event we all knew was coming. “Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine,” he’d told them. “But it will be hard on her.” By “her” he meant me.

One or the other of us has to go.”Shakespeare’s Prosperosaid, “We are such stuff / As dreams are made on, and our little life  / Is rounded with a sleep.” It’s soothing to know so many others have passed through these doors – the door of dying, the door of grieving – but then there are the minutes, the hours, the days, the mundane details before those doors finally open. Graeme had a strong heart. It would take a while for it to stop.The hospital decided on palliative care, and provided us with a mattress on the floor of Graeme’s room. The two kids and I took turns sleeping on it, while walking back and forth over Primrose Hill to the bed and breakfast that the writer Xandra Bingley had found for us on her street. We ate in cafes, blurry from lack of sleep. We drank coffee. How could the mornings be so crisp and beautiful? How could the evenings be so pink and calm?Giddiness had set in, as it often does at solemn moments. Why is that? The release of tension – the tension of waiting?We played Graeme’s favourite music for him, and bird calls, and sea sounds. We talked to him. We told him that we loved him. Did he hear? No way of knowing.He had the stroke on 13 September and died on 18 September, at noon. We sat with him for a while, knowing and not knowing at the same time. All these days we’d been telling the hospital lady who wheeled soup around on a cart at lunchtime that, no, we didn’t want any soup. It occurred to us that the poor soup lady might come to the room, go in, and find a corpse, so Jess stopped by the desk, gave the room number, and said, “He won’t be needing any soup.” Pause. “Because he’s dead.”View image in fullscreenAtwood with Gibson in 2017.Photograph: Leonardo Cendamo/Getty ImagesThen we went cackling off to the elevator. Giddiness had set in, as it often does at solemn moments. Why is that? The release of tension – the tension of waiting? The universal desire to laugh in church? Plain old denial? He can’t possibly be just … gone. We can all believe three things simultaneously: the person is in the ground. The person is in the Afterlife. The person is in the next room. You keep expecting to see him.Even when you know it’s coming, a death is a shock. Shock as in electrical shock: you’re stunned, you can’t place yourself. You wander around in hyperspace; you appear focused, but you’re not all there. Somehow you go through the motions. Afterwards, you won’t quite remember what happened during this time. That’s why friends and neighbours gather around and bring food: they know you aren’t fully present.Many have walked this pathway, over thousands and thousands of years. Many more will find themselves travelling on it in the future. Yet the death of a beloved one is still hard to grasp.Xandra Bingley gave us all dinner that evening. Odd how lightheaded we were – almost jolly. The next day we packed up Graeme’s things. Matthew stayed behind to take care of what are euphemistically called “the arrangements”. Canada House was a great help – the certificates, how to arrange the plane transfer of the ashy remains, all that – having done this a lot before. They had a procedure. Canadians, it seemed, had a habit of dying in London.Margaret Atwood’s 10 best books – ranked!Read moreThen I took a plane to New York. Jess accompanied me. I watched Minions on the plane’s back-of-seat screen. That’s what you need in moments of deep gloom: total idiocy.Did I get off the plane and walk on to Seth Meyers show? It seems I did. A book tour is a form of showbiz: the show must go on. Right after that, I staggered off to a dinner thrown for me by my US publisher. To the friends who came, I seemed functional, but that isn’t how I felt. A robot had taken me over and was doing the conversations and spooning up the dessert, and I was trapped inside it.Some people were surprised that I continued with the book tour for The Testaments.

Fifty years after his brutal murder, the director’s vision of fascism is more urgent than everWith mystery still surrounding Pier Paolo Pasolini’s death, the poet and film-maker’s warnings of corruption and rising totalitarianism offer a chilling message for our timesOlivia LaingSat 1 Nov 2025 05.12 EDTLast modified on Sat 1 Nov 2025 05.14 EDTSharePier Paolo Pasolini was murdered at around midnight on 2 November 1975. His blood-soaked body was found the next morning on waste ground in Ostia, on the outskirts of Rome, battered so badly the famous face was almost unrecognisable. Italy’s premier intellectual, artist, provocateur, national conscience, homosexual, dead at the age of 53, his scandalous final film still in the editing suite. “Assassinato Pasolini,” the next morning’s papers announced, alongside photographs of the 17-year-old accused of his murder. Everyone knew his taste for working-class hustlers. A hookup gone wrong was the instant verdict.Some deaths are so suggestive that they become emblematic of a subject, the deceiving lens through which an entire life is forever after read. In this weirdly totalitarian mode of interpretation, Virginia Woolf is always walking towards the Ouse, the river in which she drowned herself. Likewise, Pasolini’s entire body of work is coloured by the seeming fact that he was murdered by a rent boy, the crowning act of a relentlessly high-risk life.But what if this was the intention; the malevolent cunning with which his assassination was designed? What if, rather than the instant martyrdom of a bullet to the head, Pasolini was killed in such a way as to make it seem that he had sought out his own destruction, a rightful punishment, at least in the eyes of conservatives, for the manifest perversions with which his art as well as life were rife?Furthermore: what if this reputational as well as actual murder was designed to drown out – contaminate, confuse – the warnings he’d been issuing with increasing ferocity in the final years of his short life? “I know” was the central refrain in afamous essaypublished a year before his death in Il Corriere della Sera, Italy’s leading newspaper. What Pasolini knew, and what he refused to remain silent about, was the nature of power and corruption during Italy’s brutal 1970s; the so-called “Years of Lead”, named for an epidemic of assassinations and terrorist attacks by both the extreme left and right. What he knew, in short, was that fascism was not over, and that the right would metastasise, returning in a new form to claim power over a populace stupefied by the tawdry blandishments of capitalism. Was Pasolini wrong in his predictions? I think we all know the answer to that.View image in fullscreenPier Paolo Pasolini in 1961.Photograph: Giancarlo BOTTI/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesPasolini was born in Bologna in 1922, the year that Mussolini became dictator, to a military family. He spent a formative spell in his mother’s home town of Casarsa, in the remote rural region of Friuli, after his father was arrested for gambling debts. The schism between his parents grew more serious as the second world war took hold. Susanna was a schoolteacher who loved literature and art, while Carlo Alberto was an army officer and avowed fascist, who would spend most of the war in Kenya in an English prisoner-of-war camp.Pasolini studied literature at Bologna University, but when bombing made the city too dangerous he retreated with his mother and younger brother, Guido, to Friuli. He was obsessed with the beauty of the region and its pure, archaic dialect, his mother tongue, spoken by peasants and almost unknown to literature. In 1942, he published his first volume of poems, Poesie a Casarsa, written in dialect. But during the chaotic years of fighting that followed the Italian armistice, not even Friuli was safe. Guido joined the resistance and was executed in the hills by a rival group of partisans, a tragedy that bound Susanna and her adored surviving son even more tightly together.Pockmarked hustlers and petty thieves, often homophobic, usually straight – it was these boys he set at the heart of his life and workPart of the allure of Friuli was erotic. It was here Pasolini discovered his sexuality, his magnetic attraction to peasant and street boys. It soon brought him into conflict with authority. In the late 1940s he was charged with corruption of minors because of a supposed sexual act with three teenagers. Though he was later absolved, the scandal drove him and Susanna to move again, this time to Rome.They stepped straight into the seething city of Bicycle Thieves: a Rome in ruins, its slums populated by a new urban proletariat, escaping the deprivations of the rural south. Pasolini found work as a teacher and immersed himself in another secret language,Romanaccio, the street dialect spoken by the wild youths he befriended.Ragazzi di vita, he called them in the 1955 novel that made his reputation: the boys of life. Pockmarked hustlers and petty thieves, slim-hipped and amoral, often homophobic, nearly always straight. It was these boys he set at the heart of his books, his films, his poems and his life.You can glimpse Pasolini in photographs of this period, a slight, slender figure with bandy legs, a mackintosh over his smart suit, dark hair slicked back from an intense, sharp-cheekboned face. A watcher, a driven artist, a passionate football player. He found his way to Cinecittà, the famous Roman movie studio, as a scriptwriter. He assisted Fellini with Nights of Cabiria, and then he was off on his own, writing and directing Accattone,a 1961 neo-realist account of a pimp – played by a real-life street kid, Franco Citti – and his blighted life in a Roman slum.Lesser artists might have mined that seam for years, but Pasolini soon revealed the exceptional depth and idiosyncrasy of his talent. He made explicitly political films such as Pigstyand Theorem, animated by his loathing for the complacent bourgeoisie. He told the life of Christ in The Gospel According to St Matthew and he took up classical stories too, creating raw and visceral adaptations of Oedipus Rex and Medea, starring Maria Callas, as well as Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales, The Decameron by Boccaccio and The Arabian Nights in The Trilogy of Life.By his 50s, he was globally famous, a controversial figure, constantly under attack. He was tipped for the Nobel prize in literature but had also been subject to 33 trials on trumped-up chargesThere is nothing in all of cinema like these films, which are bawdy and poetic, visually sublime and heavily invested in the realm of ideas. Many of them star Pasolini’s great love and long-term companion, Ninetto Davoli, a shambling naif from Calabria with an infectiously broad grin. Pasolini’s tendency to use amateur actors gives his films a strange, unsteady realism, as if a Renaissance painting had come to life.By his 50s, he was globally famous, a controversial figure, constantly under attack. He was tipped for the Nobel prize in literature but had also been subject to 33 trials on trumped-up or invented charges, including public obscenity, contempt of religion and, weirdest of all, attempted robbery; his weapon a black pistol loaded with a golden bullet. Pasolini didn’t even own a gun.View image in fullscreenA scene from Pasolini’s 1975 horror film, Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyHis art was never doctrinaire but it was always political. He’d joined the Communist party in his youth, and was rapidly expelled for his unconcealed homosexuality. He was as often criticised by the left as the right, but though he was a thorn in everybody’s side, he remained allied to communism and the radical left. In the 1970s, he became exceptionally vocal on political matters, using the essays in Il Corriereto discuss industrialisation, corruption, violence, sex and the future of Italy.In the most famous, published in November 1974 and known in Italy asIo so, or “I know”, he claimed he knew the names of those involved in “a series of coups instituted for the preservation of power”, including the fatal Milan and Brescia bombings. During these Years of Lead, the far right deployed the so-called “strategy of tension” to smear the left and shift the country to a more authoritarian basis. Pasolini believed that among those responsible were figures in the government, the secret service and the church. He referred to a novel he was writing, Petrolio, in which he intended to lay these corruptions bare. “I believe it is unlikely that my ‘novel in progress’ may be wrong, that is to say that it may be disconnected from reality, and that its references to real persons and facts may be inaccurate,” he added.The last film is the bleakest. No horror film in all the intervening years has come close to Salò (1975), no hacked-up torture porn approaches its icy formal perfection or anguished moral intent. A version of De Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom transposed to the Italian countryside in the final days of the second world war, it is a terrifying masque about fascism and compliance, an accounting of both sides of the totalitarian coin. Like De Sade’s own writing, it’s about power, not pleasure: who possesses it and whom it destroys. It’s an apocalyptic masterpiece that remains unbearable to watch; “off the reservation, proscribed”, as the writer and critic Gary Indiana observed in a screen essay extolling its still-radioactive capacity to wound the viewer.I set my new novel, The Silver Book, around the making of Salò. I wanted to imagine Pasolini at work, in a tight Missoni sweater and dark glasses, running from scene to scene with the Arriflex camera held lightly at his shoulder, overseeing the construction of turds from crushed biscuits and chocolate for the infamous shit-eating scene. He didn’t bully his collaborators, like Fellini did. He was loved and admired, and also lonely, separate. The compulsive cruising, night after night: in a poem called Solitude he wondered if it was simply a way to be alone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

He had publicly repudiated his joyous, erotic Trilogy of Life. Now sex equalled death and pain. As for utopia, no possibility remained. And yet, when an interviewer asked him who was the intended audience for Salò, he said in all seriousness: everyone. He still believed art could perform its counter spell, could shock the populace awake. He hadn’t lost hope.One of the theories of Pasolini’s death is that he was lured to Ostia to recover some reels of Salò that had been stolen a few months earlier. I took up this story in my novel but I decided not to directly describe Pasolini’s murder, in which he was beaten, his groin shattered, his ear almost severed, before being run over by his own silver Alfa Romeo, causing his heart to burst. The boy who served a decade for his murder had a few tiny spots of blood on him, and no injuries, though he had apparently beaten a man to death. Another sentence fromIo sohints at what probably took place: “I know the names of the sombre and important people who lurk behind the tragic youths who chose the suicidal fascist atrocities or the common criminals, Sicilian and otherwise, who offered their services as killers and assassins.”Pasolini saw what was coming. Like the rarest artists, he had the gift of second sight, which is another way of saying that he paid attention, that he watched and listened and knew how to interpret the signs. On his last afternoon, he was by chance interviewed for La Stampa. A few days after his death, his final recorded words were published in a sold-out issue, a prophecy from beyond the grave.He talked about how ordinary life was becoming distorted by the desire for possessions, because everyone was taught that “wanting something is a virtue”. He said it affected every aspect of society, though the poor might use a crowbar to get their spoils, while the rich relied on the stock exchange. He said, referring to his nightly excursions into the shadow world of Rome, that he descended into hell and brought back the truth.What is the truth, the journalist asked. The evidence, Pasolini said, of “a shared, compulsory and wrong education that pushes us to own everything at any price”. He described everyone as victims in this, thinking no doubt of Salò, where victims and perpetrators are locked together in a terrible dance. And he described everyone as guilty, because of their willingness to ignore the costs in favour of their own lucrative private gain. It wasn’t about individual culpability or good and bad actors, he added. It was a totalising system, though unlike in Salò there was a way to escape, to undo the sinister, seductive spell.View image in fullscreenPasolini behind the camera on the set of Il Fiore delle Mille e una Notte in 1974.Photograph: Sunset BoulevardAs ever, his language was more that of the poet than the politician: dense with metaphor, spooky with warnings. “I go down into hell and I discover things that don’t disturb the peace of others,” he said. “But be careful. Hell is rising towards the rest of you.” Right at the very end of the conversation, it is as if he becomes frustrated by the interviewer’s continued attempts to make him clarify his position. “Everybody knows that I pay for my own experiences in person,” he says. “But there are also my books and my films. Maybe I’m wrong, but I keep on saying that we are all in danger.”The journalist asks how he thinks he, Pasolini, can avoid this danger. It is getting dark and there is no light on in the room where they are talking. Pasolini says he will think about the question overnight, that he will answer in the morning. But in the morning he is dead.I think Pasolini was right, and I’m certain that the warnings he kept uttering were why he was killed. He saw the future we’re now in long before anyone else. He saw that capitalism would corrode into fascism, or that fascism would infiltrate and take over capitalism, that what appeared benign and beneficial would corrupt and destroy old forms of life. He knew that compliance and complicity were lethal. He warned about the ecological costs of industrialisation. He foresaw how television would transform politics, though he was dead before Silvio Berlusconi came to power. I do not think the ascent of Trump, a politician formed in Berlusconi’s mould, would have surprised him very much.He wasn’t perfect. He was infected with nostalgia for a rural peasant Italy, the cost of which he was wilfully blind to. He was against abortion and mass education; he took the side of the French police against the students in 1968. His poetry can be self-indulgent, his paintings are bad. He paid for sex with rent boys who stayed the same age as he grew older, and on the other hand he took them seriously, listened to them, found them work, provided a steady source of support. He was a visionary and an artist of unshakeable moral conviction. He would not shut up.The timing of his death makes it seem as if Salò was his final, desolate statement but even on his last night he was talking over dinner about his next film. There was more work to come, unimaginable in its shape, unprecedented in its form. He ate steak, he went cruising. He was hungry, you see. He was on the side of life, always.The Silver Book by Olivia Laing will be published on 6 November by Hamish Hamilton. A 50th anniversaryscreeningof Salò will take place on 11 November at the Barbican, London.Explore more on these topicsBooksBiography booksFictionLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Liam was slapped with a lifetime ban from Cathay Pacificdue to the band’s alleged bad behaviour on the flight over. (The ban was sealed when Liam told an Australian reporter, “I don’t give a flying fuck … I’d rather walk.”) Noel got in hot water for commentshe made about Princess Diana, then Liam was hauled in front of Brisbane magistrates court, charged with assault after allegedly head-butting a fan who wanted a photo. The fandropped the charges, though Liam later called the alleged head-butt “justice”, adding: “The geezer put a camera in my face and I told him not to.”But other than the handwringers, Australian fans seemed delighted with it all. The Gallaghers’ particular tetchy, laddish swagger has always played very well here, as hasthe drama of their on-off relationship. And the music too, of course: both What’s the Story (Morning Glory)? and Wonderwall went to No 1 in 1995, while in 2013 Triple J listeners voted Wonderwall the best song of the past 20 years. The affection remained even after Noel went on Triple J and said: “You fucking need us more than we need you. Your lives and the people that listen to your radio station and listen to Radiohead and fucking Blur and Robbie Williams – your lives would be lessened without me and my brother and it’s as simple as that.”Oasis review – a shameless trip back to the 90s for Britpop’s loudest, greatest songsRead moreBut in Marvel Stadium on Friday night, the first of Oasis’ five sold-out Australian shows on their world reunion tour, it was clear some of the country’s warm feelings were returned when Liam and Noel walked out to deafening screams, hands clasped above their heads.“G’day Australia,” Liam said. “Did you miss us? Because we missed you.”View image in fullscreenOasis’ first Australian show, at Marvel Stadium, Melbourne, on Friday night.Photograph: Big Brother RecordingsIt was noticeable how many in theMelbournecrowd looked to be in their 20s and 30s, the fans who never got the chance to see Oasis the first time around.“I never thought this was going to happen,” Liam (a different one) told the Guardian, at the show with his friend – also called Liam. “We’ve always talked about it, but we said no, it’ll never happen. I’ve seen Noel and Liam separately but I am too young to have seen Oasis, so this very cool.”“I have relatives in Manchester who couldn’t get tickets and now I am going here – so they hate me,” the other Liam added.Ali and Anna, both 28, grew up on Oasis because their parents were fans – but unlike others, they bought tickets the night before. “I followed all the drama about dynamic pricing in the UK and how people were paying exorbitant prices – I didn’t want to pay $400 for a ticket, that’s crazy,” Anna says. “So we bought them for $115 last night.”View image in fullscreen‘It was noticeable how many in the Melbourne crowd looked to be in their 20s and 30s, the fans who never got the chance to see Oasis the first time around.’Photograph: Big Brother RecordingsCompare that with Sharon, a British-Australian who last saw Oasis live in 1998; she was due to go to their last concert before they broke up, in 2009, but couldn’t get a babysitter and missed the show.“I have waited 27 years to see them again,” she says. “I am ecstatic. I told my husband, if they ever get back together, I don’t care what it costs me. When it was announced last year, I even booked accommodation in London but couldn’t get tickets. But then they came here.”“I’m glad they didn’t have a punchup and split before they got here,” adds Kerri. She’s also a longtime fan – just not enough of one to fork out for the merch: “Seventy bucks for a bucket hat seems a bit much.”‘Without a parka, I’ll look like an idiot’: Oasis fans’ fashion at the reunion tourRead moreBut the bucket hats were out in full force, as were the anoraks and the Adidas gear – regardless of temperatures. “Come to Australia, they said,” a very sweaty Liam said towards the end, peeling his trademark anorak from his neck. “Don’t bring your parka mate, its going to get fucking roasty.”Oasis are now 32 shows into a 41-gig world tour, but by all accountsthey’ve sounded this polished from the get go. There are no signs of the old mardiness that used to derail their shows, when Liam would pick fights with the audience – though he still stalks the stage like he’s squaring up, albeit while holding maracas. Instead, the mood was euphoric and mischievous; the tang of weed and beer hung in the air all night and, during Champagne Supernova, someone even launched a flare. “Naughty, naughty, naughty,” Liam said.View image in fullscreenLiam Gallagher with his maracas.Photograph: Big Brother RecordingsThe Gallaghers seem to have softened into a cheeky friendliness in their 50s. At the end of a soaring rendition of Don’t Look Back at Anger from the crowd, Noel jumped back on the mic to poke fun: “Aan-gah? What the fuck is aan-gah?” Liam meanwhile, queried Australia’s drug habits (“Are you still sniffing cocaine? You’ll grow out of it”) then dedicated Bring It On Down to “the classic glue sniffers”.But all good things must come to an end. “I’m a princess these days, and I need to go to fucking bed,” Liam announced. His signoff was rather sweet, as Gallaghers go: “Listen, nice one for putting up with us over the years. We appreciate it, we fucking love you.”At their very first reunion show, in Cardiff in July, the crowd cheered when the brothers left with“a very perfunctory clap on the back”; after four months on the road, the brothers are now up to full bear hugs.

I don’t do hats, so I need a hood, but hoods tend to make coats look sort of … dweeby? Also, it’s impossible to look elegant in that horrible shiny fabric that most raincoats come in. Lululemon is known for activewear, but – I guess because it approaches fashion from a functional point of view – it makes great non-gym pieces too. (I’ve written before aboutthe brand’s travel trousers.)This jacket is waterproof but not shiny, with a classy matt finish, and has a hood that detaches (you can fold it into one of the big patch pockets) so you can keep your hair dry en route and then enter a room not looking like you’re in an anorak.Introducing the scardiganView image in fullscreenScarf-neck cardigan£36 at M&SThe twinset is back, but not as you know it.

I’m not wild about super jokey decor, such as baubles in the shape of glittery Stanley cups or whatever; I feel they detract from rather than add to the magic of Christmas, if that makes sense. But these velvet mushrooms are just kitsch enough to be fun without being cheesy. Also, this might be me overthinking tree dressing, but I find it useful to have some decorations that clip on to branches and sit in spaces above them, to balance out hanging baubles.Paris fashion week style, Uniqlo pricesView image in fullscreenJW Anderson x Uniqlo lamb’s wool polo jumper£34.90 at UniqloThe grey long-sleeved knit polo top has taken over from the black polo neck as the foundation stone of your cold-weather wardrobe.

It is a brilliant pan. As I turn on the heat to crisp the skin on my chicken thighs on the stove top, I can prep the vegetables I will then roast in the same pan. There is a soothing rhythm to this type of cooking, where most of the work is done in the oven. Here, I use jerusalem artichokes, the most delicious of autumn vegetables, parboiled in lemon juice to make them more digestible and then roasted with garlic and onions, until beautifully caramelised, and it’s a marvellous thing to put down on the kitchen table.Crispy chicken and pancetta with roast jerusalem artichokesThe crisp chicken and sweet onions are scented with rosemary and flecked with cubes of pancetta for bursts of salty fat.Prep5 minCook1 hr 30 minServes48bone-in skin-on chicken thighs700g jerusalem artichokesSalt and black pepperJuice of½ lemon4 tbsp olive oil120g diced pancetta2-3 sprigs rosemary1 head garlic3 red onions,peeled, halved and cut into 1cm slices2 tbsp apple balsamic vinegarTake the chicken out of the fridge and leave to come to room temperature. Scrub the jerusalem artichokes in cold water with wire wool or similar, then halve or quarter them, depending on their size; discard any skinny or gnarled ends (don’t worry about bits of skin in the nooks and crannies, because you’re going to simmer them). Put the artichokes in a pan of salted water, add the lemon juice, bring to a boil, then simmer for 15-20 minutes, until they are tender to the point of a knife.Meanwhile, prep the chicken. Generously season the thighs all over. Put a 28-32cm wide shallow ovenproof pan or casserole on a medium heat, add a splash of the oil and the pancetta, then lay in the chicken thighs skin side down. Run your hand down the rosemary sprigs to strip the leaves into the pan, then cut the head of garlic in half, prise apart the cloves (reserve one clove for the salad below) and drop into the pan; discard any skins that fall off. Leave to cook for eight to 10 minutes, until the chicken starts to brown.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Lift the chicken thighs out of the pan, add the onion and artichokes, season generously and stir. Pour over the remaining olive oil and the vinegar, and roast the veg for 20 minutes. Return the chicken thighs to the pan on top of the vegetables and cook for a further 35-40 minutes, until the chicken is brown and crisp and the vegetables caramelised and delicious. Serve with the apple, parsley and hazelnut salad below.Apple, parsley and hazelnut salad with pickled red onionView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ apple, parsley and hazelnut salad with pickled red onion.A crunchy salad to accompany the crisp chicken.

It’s given me such a great sense of freedom and clarity that I was thinking: I should do the same for my recipes. This one, for example, I would file under “magic”, because it comes together (mostly) from the store-cupboard, both in that easy way in which you throw things into a pot until they alchemise, but also because tahini and beans, together with a lemon, can, magically, become the most soothing antidote to cold weather.Tahini beans with basil and pine nutsPrep15 minCook40 minServes2-34 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to finish2 red onions, peeled and finely chopped1 tsp fine sea salt2 lemons, zest of 1 peeled off in strips, then both juiced, to get 5 tbsp4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced5 tbsp sun-dried tomato paste2 tsp aleppo pepper2400g tins butter beans in water, not drained1 vegetable stock cube3 tbsp tahini½ tsp freshly ground black pepper3 tbsp (30g) pine nutsFlatbreads, to serve15g fresh basil, leaves tornPut the oil in a large saucepan on a medium to low heat and, when hot, add the onions, salt and the strips of lemon peel, and cook, stirring, for eight minutes, until very soft and translucent. Add the garlic and fry for a minute or so, just until the smell of raw garlic disappears.Stir in the tomato paste and aleppo pepper, cook for four to five minutes, then tip the beans and their water into the pot. Cook for 10 minutes, then crumble in the stock cube and add the tahini, black pepper and 600ml boiling water. Mix well, turn down the heat to a simmer and leave to bubble away gently for 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice, cook for a further five minutes, then take off the heat.Toast the pine nuts in a small, dry frying pan, stirring so they don’t burn, for four to five minutes, until they turn golden.Heat the flatbreads, then distribute the beans between two or three shallow bowls. Scatter the toasted pine nuts and basil leaves on top, drizzle with plenty of extra-virgin olive oil and serve with the flatbreads alongside.Join Meera Sodha at a specialeventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou be the judgelive.

But after 30 viewings without finding their dream home, it was time for a change of plan.“I was getting disheartened – I thought we’d never find anything,” says Jess, 33. “Some houses were lovely but weren’t to our taste. I’d have felt guilty ripping out a new kitchen or bathroom just because we didn’t like it, so we decided to buy a home that actually needed the work done.”Renovation projects were about £90,000 cheaper than “turnkey” homes (those that are finished and ready to move into), giving the Sowerbys more budget for the project. In February 2019 they got the keys to their 1930s semi-detached house on a cul-de-sac in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and got to work.“It had been empty for six months and was cold, damp, dated and musty. But it felt like a home,” says Jess, who has documented their renovation on the Instagram pageThe House that Colour Built.View image in fullscreenJess Sowerby and her husband, Rick, bought their house in Rochdale for £155,000 in February 2019.Photograph: Jess SowerbyAs house prices continue rising, many buyers are looking to renovation projects as a cost-effective way of getting on the ladder. The average first-time buyer home cost £229,094 in August this year, according to the estate agency Hamptons, which analysed Land Registry data. It was £156,453 in August 2015.However, fixer-uppers can go for considerably less than the average.About 7% of the properties listed on the property website Zoopla are fixer-uppers. Wales, south-east England and Yorkshire and the Humber are the regions with the most properties falling into this category, and two- and three-bedroom houses are the most common renovation projects on the portal.Lack of choice in their area is another reason why some opt for a property that needs work.Steve Lees, from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), says: “Doer-uppers are a real opportunity to do a deep retrofit, and you can really add value if you improve the property’s energy efficiency rating.“Ultimately, it’s the chance to make your home your own.”Where to startThere are various things to consider when you are starting on this journey and checking out potential properties.Lees says you should research the local area and amenities. Consider things such as transport links, crime rates and schools, just as you would for any home purchase. And look at previous transaction prices for similar properties nearby.Next, consider the structure. “Look around internally and externally. Use all of your senses,” he says.“Look for obvious defects: cracks in the walls, the roof, signs of damp. Is there anything that would stop you getting a mortgage? Some lenders won’t accept certain construction types.”For any property requiring major work, it is worth getting a structural survey done. This will identify any potential issues and help you formulate a budget and timeline for the renovation.View image in fullscreen‘It’s good to know our hard work was worth it,’ says Jess Sowerby, ‘but we’re not planning to sell.’Photograph: Jess SowerbyWhen looking at properties, focus on the layout and flow, says Jess Sowerby. And consider elements that will be difficult or more expensive to change, such as walls and windows.“Remind yourself that the disgusting wallpaper, awful carpet and paint colours are not permanent,” she says. “It’s about the bones of the house – the things that are going to matter.”The Sowerbys’ house needed a full rewire; it had damp, and all of the walls required skimming or replastering. The carpets needed replacing; the wallpaper was peeling off; and the original doors and staircase had been boarded over so needed stripping, sanding and filling.An extension was their biggest cost at about £35,000, including three large skylights and bifold doors. They also spent £2,500 on a new front door and surrounding windows, and £6,000 on the rewire.But not all jobs require such a big outlay. Painting and decorating are some of the easiest and cheapest ways to put your stamp on a home. Zoopla says it costs about £2,495 to decorate a house, and just over £3,500 for a simple garden revamp.To add value, restore period features – particularly if the property is more than 100 years old. The find-a-tradesperson website Checkatrade estimates that restoring doors, floors and fireplaces can add up to 30% to the value.An extension isn’t cheap, but the extra space will definitely add value. A single-storey extension can add 5%-8% to a house’s value, says Checkatrade, and a loft conversion 20%. Meanwhile, installing solar panels can reduce your energy bills as well as adding value – up to 14%, according to the site.Jess and Rick Sowerby, who rented a house nearby while they did the work, used YouTube videos and Instagram to learn new skills. If you have a tradesperson on site, shadow them, or ask a local building merchant for advice.Doing a good chunk, or all, of the work yourself can cut costs, but expect things to take longer. Jess and Rick did quite a bit of the work themselves and used tradespeople for the electrics, plumbing and the extension.“It [going down theDIYroute] saved us about £15,000, but I wish I’d known how long it was going to take. I assumed about six months, but that was naive,” says Jess.Have a backup planEvery budget needs a contingency. Lees recommends factoring in an extra 15%-20% for the unexpected.Chris Husson-Martin, at the Salisbury branch of the estate agent Hamptons, says: “Unexpected issues invariably arise, particularly with elements that aren’t immediately visible, like electrics or drainage.“One client discovered a well beneath their kitchen tiles. They ultimately transformed it into a stunning feature, but such surprises can significantly impact budgets and timelines if you’re unprepared.”The biggest unexpected cost for the Sowerbys was £5,000 to install piling for their extension after they were advised that not doing so could result in subsidence. Piling is the process of building a type of deep foundation where, typically, columns made of steel or concrete are bored or driven into the ground.View image in fullscreenThe Sowerbys’ renovations took 15 months of hard graft and cost about £50,000.Photograph: SuppliedYou should check whether you can get help with the costs, says Husson-Martin. “Various government grants and loans are available for renovations such as insulation and heating system upgrades.”Some councils offer empty home grants to homebuyers and landlords to help with renovating a property that has been unoccupied long-term, though the amounts and eligibility criteria vary, so check with your local authority.And some buyers may want to consider a green mortgage: some lenders offer a lower interest rate or cashback where energy efficiency upgrades are being carried out.Living offsite means you can escape the dust, but it comes with extra costs. You may have to rent somewhere nearby while the work is being done, and also pay for things such as temporary storage of possessions. Home insurance may be more expensive for an unoccupied property.After 15 months of hard graft, the Sowerbys moved into their home in May 2020. The couple, now parents to one-year-old Guy, bought the house for £155,000 and spent £50,000 on their renovation. In August, their home was valued at £350,000.“It’s good to know our hard work was worth it,” says Jess. “But we’re not planning to move. If you’ve put your heart and soul into something, why would you sell it? I’m too sentimental.”Three jobs that could cost youThe roof“A damaged roof can lead to damp, mould and poor energy efficiency, but it’s often hard to spot,” says Alex Peters, of Checkatrade. Check exterior tiles and look in the loft for cracks or water damage. A roof inspection costs about £250, and a drone survey about £200.AsbestosA commonly used material until the 1970s, asbestos can only be safely removed by professionals, so stop work immediately if you suspect its presence. Be wary of vinyl or lino floor tiles, old electrics or insulation. An asbestos survey costs from £200 to £1,000, and removal will typically cost anything from £950 to £3,750.Structural damageBefore choosing paint colours, check the structural integrity of the property. “Identify load-bearing walls and address any cracks, water damage or foundation issues before starting any other projects, as these may affect your overall plans,” says Peters.Renovation mathsAverage costs for common jobs, according to Checkatrade:New central heating systemAverage cost of installing a gas system: £5,250 including labour.Rewiring the electricsAn average of £6,225 plus VAT for a three-bed house (includes labour), or £4,800 plus VAT for a two-bed flat (includes labour).Knocking down wallsCost to remove a load-bearing wall: £3,300 plus VAT (includes labour), based on a project cost of £1,500 and three days’ labour.Damp proofingDifficult to give an average as there are many variables. However, the cost of a full damp proofing course could typically come in at £5,000.Replastering wallsOne small room: about £1,400 plus VAT (includes a day’s labour). A larger room: about £2,500 plus VAT (includes three days’ labour).Installing double glazed windowsFor a basic casement window, the price starts at £500 and averages at £1,000. Plus £250-£300 a day for each double glazing installer.Roof repair£110 to £160 a sq metre for plain tile on a pitched roof (this varies depending on the type of roof and material). Labour will be on top and will depend on the size of area.Removing asbestosBetween £950 and £3,750 – this is for asbestos roof removal. This is labour costs – skip hire and so on is likely to be extra.Source: CheckatradeExplore more on these topicsPropertyHome improvementsDIYInteriorsConsumer affairsHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Haaland recently shared the daily routine that he believes keeps him at the top of his game on and off the pitch.Photograph: YoutubeMorning is supposed to begin with a simple cup of coffee, a splash of raw milk and a sweetener. Which doesn’t sound that bad. But after opening the milk carton I realise this isn’t going to be a brew to savour. Hard, curdled blobs of fat sit on top and a tangy scent escapes the bottle. I reluctantly pour the milk into my coffee and an oily film soon settles on top.The taste is bearable but the swirling blotches are off-putting.

Never again. Thankfully, this is followed by a reliable breakfast staple: fried eggs and some sourdough toast.Haaland’s daily routine also includes a rather intimate assisted stretching session, an ice bath and some time in front of a red light therapy machine. Sadly, his masseurMarioisn’t available to contort my legs. But Ingrid Raphael, an aesthetician, is able to squeeze me in for an LED light therapy treatment.Like Haaland, I’ve also got a giant teddy bear roommate.

It is absolutely unparalleled in its capability to aid ageing,” she says.View image in fullscreenBear necessities: Haaland at home.Photograph: YoutubeAfter having my face cleansed and pads placed over my eyes, LED lights of varying colours are shone over my face.

My reward? A whiteout …An epic rail trip to Sweden’s Arctic north ends with a surreal skiing experience – and waffles for breakfast while sitting out a snowstormKevin RushbySat 1 Nov 2025 03.00 EDTShareThe light coming through the sleeper train window wakes me. It’s nearly time. Climbing down the ladder past the other snoozing occupants, I head into the corridor. A few hours ago there were only trees, an endless unfurling ribbon of spruce and birch. Now there is snow, vast banks of it. And sometimes, when the train roars through a big drift, great spumes of white blast out on either side, blocking any view.In the restaurant car, I watch the map on my phone as a blue dot approaches a straight dashed line. A frozen lake and distant pale mountains appear. Then at 6.09am we cross the Arctic Circle. Forty-eight hours previously, I had been in London St Pancras station, queueing for the Eurostar. Now, five trains later, never having left terra firma, I am in the Arctic. Most of my fellow travellers are Swedes with hefty bags of skis and well-stocked sledges that look expedition-ready. With their weathered faces and lean muscle, they look intimidatingly capable.View image in fullscreenMy plan is a mini-expedition of my own: to ski to thehighest mountain hutin the Swedish Arctic, and get back down in one piece. Because I have never used the particular type of skis required for going uphill, the plan seems ambitious.The train passes through the mining town ofKiruna, then skirts the 43-mile (70km) long lake of Torneträsk. A pair of moose graze on the stunted birch trees. There are no more pines; we have passed beyond their limit of endurance. All around is the ethereal pale beauty of the hills, their summits soft with wind-puffed quiffs of snow powder.At Björkliden, I disembark. The ski station is right next to the railway, which has almost reached its northernmost limit, curling through one more ski village, Riksgränsen, before heading west to the Norwegian port of Narvik. Within two hours of arriving, I am on skis, gingerly tackling a beginners’ slope.Skiing in the Swedish Arctic has some immediate obvious differences to more southerly locations. After the spring equinox, the days are longer. By mid-May there is no darkness at all. You ski under the midnight sun. The weather is changeable and people pay special attention to the wind: the chill factor can be extreme. But there are similarities, too: I am still a wobbly skier. I take it easy. I spend a lot of time talking to veterans of the climb up to Låktatjåkko mountain hut.“It’s 9km,” they tell me. “The last bit can be a challenge.”I practise putting on my skins: long bands that fit over the underside of the skis and make them refuse to go backwards, even downhill. I cannot help wondering if it might be easier to walk, but I am soon corrected. “It’s going to snow heavily tonight. You would just sink up to your waist. And you need the skis to get back down.”View image in fullscreenIn hut pursuit: the writer skiing up towards Låktatjåkko.The advice is to wait for the supply wagon to leave at 10am. It’s a tracked snowplough and will create a route to follow. There are also marker poles every 25 metres. I’m advised to wear an avalanche alarm and carry a lightweight folding shovel.At 10am the next morning, I am outside the hotel, watching a company of Swedish soldiers in white combat suits ski away. The snowcat is loading up with food. There are passengers too. The driver confirms that it is often possible to go up without skiing at all, but there are no more seats.My respect for polar explorers has reached an all-time high. My respect for Sweden, too. What a marvellous country!I set off in the wake of its broad tracks. The ski skins work well. The sun is out, there is no wind and the views are stupendous. Five minutes later, I’m in a whiteout, struggling to spot the next marker pole, the snowcat long gone and its tracks fast disappearing. The temperature is -6C, and the wind is in my face and strengthening. I start counting steps. Despite the cold, I am down to two layers of clothing, wishing I had remembered the advice of the explorer Leo Houlding: “Be bold, start cold.” My respect for polar explorers has reached an all-time high. My respect for Sweden, too. What a marvellous country! They trust people to know their limits, look after themselves and be as tough as reindeer jerky. In my case, I’m not sure their trust is entirely well placed.The final climb, as promised, is a tough one, but then the hut comes into sight, almost buried in snow, looking like the last frozen outpost on the far side of a freezing galaxy. It takes time to find the door.View image in fullscreenLåktatjåkko mountain hut.Photograph: Wolfgang Kaehler/AlamyInside, the custodians, Vilma and Kicki, are preparing waffles with cloudberry jam, and the log burner in the snug is roaring. This astonishing retreat was constructed in the late 1930s and is now an acknowledged classic of its type, with simple bunkrooms, cosy public areas and a sauna. The only other guests are Martin and Johan, local skiers who have just made the harder ascent from Riksgränsen.I munch through a plate of waffles. The top of the mountain is a tantalising 200 metres above the hut. I really want to make it. “Don’t ski,” advises Vilma. “Use snowshoes and just keep heading north.”When blue sky reappears, I strap on the snowshoes and set off. I manage about 100 metres of the climb before the whiteout returns. Using a compass I plod on, but the lack of any visible markers is playing weird tricks on me. I spot a snowmobile up ahead, manned by two soldiers, but as I approach, the soldiers transform into swans and fly away. At that moment, I walk face-first into a snowbank.I spot a snowmobile, manned by two soldiers, but as I approach, they transform into swans. This is my initiation into whiteout disorientationThis is my initiation into whiteout disorientation. Some skiers have reported feeling that they are moving when stationary; others, the opposite. Unhindered by visual reference points, the brain constructs its own reality.I check my altimeter. I am 30 metres below the summit, but I can’t see how to get around this snowbank. My own tracks are now disappearing, so I return to the hut on a compass bearing and reward myself with more waffles.The few day-trippers are gone, the fire is warm and the storm outside howling. Martin and Johan watch the weather anxiously from their armchairs. “Look,” shouts Martin at one point, “blue sky! I think it’s clearing.” But by the time he reaches the window, the whiteout has resumed. The evening passes in a fug of beer, stories and laughter.View image in fullscreenWaffles with cloudberry jam are served in Låktatjåkko mountain hut.Photograph: Mattias FredrikssonIn the morning, the storm is still raging when the snowcat arrives. Martin and Johan are willing to ski down with me, but fearing I will hold them up, I cadge a lift. The next day, I move to Riksgränsen. There is a choice of accommodation, ranging from the boisterous fun of the main hotel to the superlative charm ofNiehku Mountain Villa. Built in the old railway turntable buildings and decorated with a fascinating display of historical photos, this boutique hotel also has an excellent restaurant.Alight here for the aurora borealis: on the Arctic Circle train to northern SwedenRead moreThe next morning, the weather has improved and I am treated to a perfect day on the mountains, happily tootling around on blue runs while watching the experts carve powdery curves down near-vertical mountain slopes.

Other countries including the UK and the US soon followed suit.But why does it still exist? Only about a third of countries practice the biannual time shift, most of them in Europe and North America. And it’s not wildly popular in those countries. A 2025Gallup pollfound that 54% of Americans say they’re ready to scrap the practice, and a 2025surveyby Travelodge found 57% of Brits are ready to get rid of it as well. People are divided on what should take its place, though – in the US, 48% of Americans say they would rather keep permanent standard time, while a 2024YouGov surveyshows 59% of Brits would rather keep permanent summer time, or daylight saving time.For sleep experts, however, there is no question as to which time is preferable.“What matters most to our long-term health is aligning our societal clocks with human biology,” says Dr Natalie Dautovich, senior research fellow at the National Sleep Foundation (NSF), and associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. “Standard time best matches our natural circadian rhythms and the sun’s timing.”A number of professional medical organizations, including the NSF, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and the British Sleep Society (BSS) have all advocated for permanent standard time.So as we prepare to “fall back” into standard time, here’s what you need to know about the health effects of our biannual time change.What is daylight savingtime?For those who might be blissfully unaware: in the spring, countries that practice daylight saving shift their clocks forward by one hour. The date varies from country to country: in the UK, it’s the last Sunday in March; in the US, it’s the second Sunday in March. This means that everyone loses one hour of precious sleep; if you typically wake up at 7am, for example, waking up the morning after the clock shift will feel like waking up at 6am.Daylight saving time lasts for roughly eight months, until the clocks shift back to standard time in the fall. This occurs on the last Sunday in October in the UK, and the first Sunday in November in the US.When does daylight savingtime end in 2025?In the US, DST ends on Sunday 2 November, and starts again on Sunday 8 March 2026.In the UK, DST ended on Sunday 26 October, and starts again on Sunday 29 March 2026.What are the health risks of daylight savingtime?“The sun is the potent regulator of our internal clock, [also known as] our circadian rhythm,” says Dr Anita Shelgikar, professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School, and president of the AASM.The brightness of the sun in the morning signals to our bodies that it’s time to wake up and be alert, and the darkness in the evening tells our bodies that it’s time to wind down and go to sleep.Night owls versus early birds: who is superior according to science?Read moreDuring standard time, our internal clocks, the sun and clock time are all more or less aligned. But during DST, our bodies get confused by the mismatch between the environment and our internal clock, Shelgikar explains: the darker mornings make it more difficult to wake up, and brighter evenings make it more difficult to go to sleep.This disruption can have serious health effects, including sleep disturbances and a rise in health issues like heart attacks and strokes, says Dr Pablo Castillo, neurologist and sleep medicine expert at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.The day after clocks “spring forward” is especially dangerous, he adds: “Both sleep loss and circadian misalignment can lead to nonrestorative sleep, motor vehicle accidents, increased cardiovascular events, and an upsurge in hospital admissions.”Indeed, one 2020studyfound that the shift to DST led to a 6% spike in traffic accidents – possibly due to groggy, sleep-deprived drivers.How can one adapt to the time change?Fortunately, as it’s autumn, we’re headed into an easy transition – we get to sleep in for an hour and realign our internal clocks with the sun. “There is no evidence of harm when we go back to standard time,” says Castillo.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there are some things you can do to make it less painful. Dautovich suggests:Getting ahead of the change by “gradually shifting bedtime and wake-up time by 15-20 minutes in the days leading up to the clock change”;Getting exposure to sunlight first thing in the morning “to help reset the biological clock”;Avoiding “caffeine, alcohol and heavy meals” close to bedtime; andMaintaining a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends.And don’t forget to prioritize the amount of sleep you get, says Shelgikar. “The recommendation is for adults to get at least seven hours of sleep a night,” she says.Daylight saving haters rejoice: scientists confirm it’s bad for healthRead moreStill, truly addressing the disruptive nature of DST requires more than sleep hacks, argues Dr Elizabeth Klerman, professor of neurology at Massachusetts general hospital and in the division of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School.“Some of this is a public policy issue,” she says, pointing to recenteffortsin Congress to eliminate the time switch. (Ultimately, legislators were split on whether to adopt permanent standard time or permanent DST and efforts to eliminate the switch were unsuccessful.) “There are a lot of moving parts,” Klerman says. “It’s not just our biology, it’s economics and politics.”Does DST save energy?When the US briefly adopted permanent DST in the early 1970s in response to a growing energy crisis, it quicklybecame clearthat the shift didn’t reduce energy consumption as intended. Also, people hated it.Even if the argument that DST saved energy was theoretically possible, or ever true, it no longer holds, say experts.“Modern energy use has evolved such that daylight savings time no longer provides a measurable energy benefit,” says Dr Dean Foreman, president of the US Association for Energy Economics (USAEE).The original argument for DST – that it helps farmers – is completely untrue, Foreman adds. “Farmers actually resisted it,” he says, because the shift can disrupt livestock and harvest schedules.Experts note that any energy saved on lighting during DST may be offset by people needing to run their air conditioners for longer since the sunlight keeps the temperature warmer for longer.What are the arguments in favor of DST?During DST, there is less sunlight in the morning but more in the evening. For the roughly 40% of Americans,includingPresident Trump, who support permanent DST, this extra hour helps stimulate the economy. With more sunlight after work, the thinking goes, people are more likely to do things outside their homes, like shopping, dining or participating in outdoor events and activities.But research has suggested that the costs of DST may be greater than the benefits. Onestudyfrom the London School of Economics estimated that the toll DST takes on people’s health costs economies over €750 ($875) per capita each year.It’s uncertain if or when countries will ever scrap the biannual time shift. In the meantime, enjoy your extra hour of sleep in November.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In areas under its control, JNIM is already enforcing dress codes and punishments via courts that, as Human Rights Watch noted in a 2024 report, did not adhere to fair trial standards.On Tuesday the US state department issued its second advisory in a week to its citizens in Mali, urging all US citizens to “depart immediately using commercial aviation”, citing infrastructural problems and the “unpredictability of Bamako’s [the capital] security situation”. On Wednesday, Australia, Germany and Italy also urged their citizens to leave as soon as possible.Observers within and outside Mali say things could escalate faster and that the US’s warnings are the latest indication that the country is on the brink of a third successful coup in five years and the sixth since independence from France in September 1960.“I don’t want to sound too dramatic, but the country is collapsing before our eyes,” a former Malian minister who now lives in exile told the Guardian anonymously. “I would not be shocked if another overthrow happens within the next few days.“Before 31 December, a coup will happen in theSahel,” the former official continued. “Mali will go first and then you’ll have the same domino effect that we’ve seen between 2020 and 2023, with all of these countries falling one after the other.”Sahel-based jihadists are extending their reach. Can a fractured region push back?Read moreMali is grappling with a two-week fuel scarcity due to blockades targeting trucks from neighbouring Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Senegal, by JNIM. Drivers and soldiers have either been kidnapped or killed – or in some cases, both.Landlocked Mali relies mostly on imports to keep its stuttering economy running. In the absence of the fuel trucks, life has come to a standstill in most of Bamako.Long queues in gas stations are a common sight now, and in many parts of the city, there is no electricity. Shops and supermarkets are closed, as many people stay indoors, unable to find transport and prices of food items keep rising. Schools have also been shut down tentatively, until 9 November.Analysts such as Ulf Laessing, the Bamako-based head of the Sahel programme at the German thinkthank KonradAdenauer Foundation, say next week could be pivotal in the lifespan of the current junta.“I think next week will be really bad, because then the existing stocks everybody’s living off will be gone,” he said. “It’s hard to see a way out. It’s just difficult to see how they can resupply the capital in sufficient quantities.”Several analysts approached by the Guardian declined to comment on the matter, saying the regime’s sensitivity about comments deemed to not be strongly in its favour, is at an all-time high.View image in fullscreenA petrol station in Bamako. The crisis has been exacerbated as armed groups block key routes used by fuel tankers, disrupting supply lines to the capital.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyAn Islamic state“So far nobody is demonstrating against the government because I think they know if they brought down this government, then the next one would be an Islamist one so it can also kind of strengthen the regime’s resolve a bit,” said Laessing.In June 2020, civil society, religious groups and opposition parties formed a protest coalition known as the June 5 Movement – Rally of Patriotic Forces (M5-RFP) that spearheaded large-scale protests against the democratically elected president Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, citing corruption and worsening security.Among the M5-RFP’s most visible figures was Mahmoud Dicko, an influential and controversial imam who first came to national spotlight with his role in the 1991 coup of the then president Moussa Traoré. The cleric’s mobilisation played a key role in forcing the collapse of the Keïta government.During one meeting where the regional bloc Ecowas, or the Economic Community of West African States, mediated between the state and M5-RFP, Keïtadropped a shocker. “I was part of the meeting when he told Ecowas leaders that Imam Dicko wants Mali to become an Islamic country under sharia law,” the former minister said. “When he said that, hell broke loose.”Within two months, soldiers led by Assimi Goïta, a young captain, took over government, replacing parliament with the National Transitional Council (NTC). A second coup within a year led to Goïta being sworn in as head of state.However, the junta’s promises have mostly been unfulfilled. The NTC, headed by Col Malick Diaw, scheduled elections for February 2022 but has repeatedly postponed them.In the meantime the death toll from the insurgency has risen sharply; the total since 2012 has exceeded 17,700, with more than two-thirds of that occurring after 2020, according todatafrom the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. JNIM, whose finances have been boosted by several high-profile ransoms paid for abductees, including Emirati citizens, is expanding operations to Benin and Nigeria in coastal west Africa.Human rights groups have also alleged that Mali’s operations with Wagner mercenaries and pro-junta militias comprising hunter militias are rife with abuses.End of the road?The junta’s isolation seems nearly complete.It signed a pact for military assistance with the regimes of Burkina Faso and Niger but the effect of that remains to be seen. Having broken off relations with Ecowas, Mali is also unable to draw on its military resources.In recent years, some foreign diplomatic missions have scaled back their presence just as the junta expelled staff from other groups amid deteriorating relations with the west.Consequently, there have been reports of increasing frustration within the ranks of the army, suggesting internal tensions among the five colonels who staged the first coup. Two of them, Diaw and the defence minister, Sadio Camara, are being mooted as potential successors who could replace Goïta.Meanwhile, Dicko, who has been in exile in Algeria since 2023 after falling out with the government andlosing his diplomatic passport, is expected to return.“Some JNIM people are asking for Dicko to come back so they can negotiate with him instead of the Malian government,” the insider said. “This is their end goal, to turn Mali into an Islamic state and they’re very close.”Explore more on these topicsMaliAfricaAl-QaidaSahelnewsShareReuse this content"

His father, Yusuf Qaradawi, was a prominent Islamist scholar associated with the Muslim Brotherhood who lived in exile until his death.The Egyptian-Turkish activist was also an active supporter of pro-democracy protests in Egypt, and was sentenced in absentia in Egypt on charges of criticising the judiciary.It was the UAE, however, not Egypt, that managed to convinceLebanonto arrest Qaradawi after his video in Syria, under charges of “fake news” and “disturbing public security”.It circulated an arrest warrant for the dissident through the Arab Interior Ministers Council, a little known transnational organisation that fosters security cooperation between Arab states.Lebanese authorities, under the previous government led by the former prime minister Najib Mikati, complied with the UAE’s request. It extradited Qaradawi to the UAE on 8 January, despite the fact that he was neither a citizen of the UAE nor of Lebanon.The brazenness of his arrest, which showed that a person could be spirited away to a country where they were not a citizen because of a video they posted on social media, has created a chilling precedent for freedom of expression in the Middle East.Qaradawi was extradited over the protests of his lawyers and of rights groups including Amnesty International, which warned that he could face torture if sent to the UAE.Lebanon’s then government dismissed their concerns and justified its decision by saying the UAE promised to respect Qaradawi’s human rights.Those pledges that his rights would be assured in the UAE, his legal counsel said, proved to be false.Qaradawi has been held in solitary confinement for more than 10 months, with no access to sunlight, in an undisclosed location. These conditions amount to torture, his lawyers say.To date, he has not had access to a lawyer nor has he been officially charged with a crime.“Lebanon hastily approved the extradition on the basis that Abdulrahman’s human rights would be upheld. That promise lies in tatters,” said Rodney Dixon, the international legal counsel for Qaradawi.Dixon added that even though it was the former Lebanese government that approved the extradition, the current government still had a legal obligation to right the wrong of its predecessor and seek Qaradawi’s return.“Governments may change but obligations do not. Lebanon was responsible for sending him there, now it must do everything possible to bring him back,” he said.A spokesperson for the Lebanese prime ministry said the extradition did not take place under the current government. They did not comment further.The UAE did not respond to a request for comment but had previously told the New York Times Qaradawi’s detention complied with human rights standards.A group of UN special rapporteurs have expressed concern over the conditions of Qaradawi’s detention, saying that his rights have been violated.“Our worst fears that Mr al-Qaradawi would face grave human rights violations if he was extradited to the UAE appear to have been justified,” theUN experts said in March.His family also expressed concerns, as they had been allowed to see him for only two 10-minute visits since he was detained.“It’s been nearly a year since Abdulrahman was taken from us. The thought of him held alone in a cell, without sunlight, fresh air, or charges brought against him, is heartbreaking,” his family told the Guardian.“We will not stop until Abdulrahman is safe. All we want is to see him back home surrounded by his family, reading us one of his poems again.”Qaradawi’s popularity in the Arab world long preceded his visit toSyria. He built a large online following and spoke at political events.He notably was a supporter of Hamas and praised its 7 October 2023 attack, which killed about 1,200 people in Israel. He dedicated a poem toYahya Sinwar, the group’s late leader.Rights groups say his detention creates a dangerous precedent in the region, where any government displeased with a person’s opinion can have them flown thousands of miles away to be imprisoned.Dixon said: “If governments can hunt down their critics across borders and imprison them, then no one is safe. That’s why the UN and the international community must act now to stamp out this behaviour or risk setting a precedent that endangers us all.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Only Paul Kagame, the authoritarian leader of Rwanda, regularly wins by a landslide.A Sudanese massacre foretold: the grim familiarity of the RSF’s rampage through El FasherRead moreRights groups including Amnesty International cited a pattern of enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings in Tanzania ahead of the polls.In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019, saying they were “alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression” ahead of elections.Protests eruptedduring Wednesday’s vote for president and parliament, with some demonstrators tearing down banners of Hassan and setting fire to government buildings and police firing teargas and gunshots, according to witnesses.Demonstrators were angry about the electoral commission’s exclusion of Hassan’s two biggest challengers from the race and what they described as widespread repression.In April, Tundu Lissu, the vice-chair of the main opposition party, Chadema, wasarrested and charged with treason and cybercrime offences. His party, which had led calls for a boycott of the election unless electoral systems were reformed, was later disqualified from participating.Last month, Luhaga Mpina, the leader of ACT-Wazalendo, another opposition party, was also disqualified, meaning Hassan contested only lesser-known opponents from minor parties.Government critics were also abducted and arrested in the run-up to the election.Tanzania’s main opposition party said on Friday hundreds of people had been killed in the protests, while the UN human rights office said credible reports indicated at least 10 people were killed in three cities.The government dismissed the opposition’s death toll as “hugely exaggerated” and has rejected criticisms of its human rights record.With Reuters and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsTanzaniaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Speaking at the inauguration ofan exhibition in Madrid dedicated to the Indigenous women of Mexico, Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, reflected on the countries’ joint history.“It’s a very human history and, like every human history, it’s had its light and its shadows,” he said. “And there has also been pain – pain and injustice towards the Indigenous people to whom this exhibition is dedicated. There was injustice and it’s right to recognise that today and to be sorry for that, because it is also part of our shared history, and we can neither deny nor forget it.”His words came four days after Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum,renewed calls for an apology. “We agreed with the letter that was sent by president López Obrador and we are still waiting for a reply,” she said.Sheinbaum welcomed Albares’s comments, saying they went some way towards recognising the wrongs of the past.“It’s a first step and it speaks to the importance of what we’ve always said: that apologies ennoble governments and peoples,” she said. “It’s not humiliating, it’s just the opposite. Congratulations to the foreign minister of the Spanish government, particularly in thisYear of the Indigenous Woman.”The conquest ofMexicobegan in 1519 when Hernán Cortés led hundreds of soldiers, equipped with horses, carrying diseases such as smallpox and abetted by Indigenous groups at odds with the Aztecs, to Mexico City, then known as Tenochtitlán.The Spanish sacked the city two years later and proceeded to convert the Indigenous populations to Catholicism.Explore more on these topicsIndigenous peoplesMexicoAmericasSpainnewsShareReuse this content"

If they do not fulfil activities – such as completing job applications or attending meetings with job providers – their payments can be suspended.Sometimes defective, maybe unlawful: what can be done about Australia’s crisis-ridden welfare system?Read moreAccording to the Antipoverty Centre, the data shows this is still frequently occurring, despite new rules offering a five-day grace period for people to contact their job provider before their payments are blocked. However, the majority of suspensions are lifted before a person’s income is impacted.“The numbers are so unimaginably high, it is actually easy to lose sight of how crazy this all is,” said Kristin O’Connell, a spokesperson for the Antipoverty Centre.In the past, such suspensions could lead to cancellations. But since March, all cancellations have been paused because the government cannot say if they were happening legally.The data on suspension actions was collated from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR), the Department of Social Services and the NationalIndigenous AustraliansAgency, which runs the remote Community Development Program (CDP).Sign up: AU Breaking News emailJobseeker recipients, those on the disability support pension, some youth allowance recipients and people on parenting payments are all captured in the data.But the number of individuals affected could not be determined, as some people will have multiple suspensions. About 30% of the 37,000 people in the CDP received more than five payment suspensions in the latest quarter.“It just gives you a sense that there are some people for whom the whip is being used so relentlessly, they can’t escape it,” O’Connell said.People with a disability and Indigenous Australians are overrepresented in the data. About 33% of all suspensions affected those with a disability, and at least 26% of all suspensions affected First Nations people.Previous reporting from Guardian Australia shows jobseekers are having theirpayments suspended while in hospital for psychosisorafter having a brain tumour removed, despite sending paperwork to Centrelink saying they were receiving medical treatment.During a Senate estimates hearing last month, the DEWR secretary, Natalie James, said the system “was not always operating as intended”.She said the government was looking into whether providers are making illegal decisions around suspensions and cancellations.“There are thousands of decisions being made in any week under these provisions,” she said.“Humans are not perfect, and obviously, as we’ve found out, nor are our systems.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They included increasing resolution times to five days, ensuring suspensions over missed appointments did not apply if the person was working at the time and the issuing of warnings for a first breach of a mutual obligation requirement.“The department regularly monitors key aspects of the TCF system, including how providers make decisions under it,” the spokesperson said.“Where incorrectly or inappropriately applied non-compliance action is identified, including payment suspensions, the department overturns these decisions and gives feedback to providers about why those decisions were reversed.”Explore more on these topicsCentrelinkWelfareInequalityDisabilityIndigenous AustraliansnewsShareReuse this content"

The other three have been released without charge.The heist of the decade - podcastRead moreThe woman was in tears as she appeared at a Paris court, saying she feared for her children and for herself, according to AFP.She has been charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to preparing a crime.The magistrate justified the detention of the woman, who lives in the French capital’s northern suburb of La Courneuve, on the grounds of a “risk of collusion” and “disturbance of public order”.The man was charged with organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to preparing a crime, the Paris prosecutor said.The individual was known to the judicial authorities for previous theft offences, she said.Prosecutor has ‘small hope’ of recovering Louvre jewels thanks to gear left by thievesRead moreHe has been placed in pre-trial detention pending a hearing to take place in the coming days, the prosecutor added.“Both individuals denied any involvement in the events,” Beccuau said.Last month, thieves wielding power toolsraided the Louvre, the world’s most visited art museum, in broad daylight, taking just seven minutes to steal jewellery worth an estimated €88m (£76m).French authorities initially announced the arrest of two male suspects over the Louvre robbery, and this week prosecutors said that police hadarrested five more peopleincluding a main suspect.Adrien Sorrentino, a lawyer for the woman who was remanded in custody, said his client denied the charges against her.“She is devastated,” he told reporters.“This is a spectacular heist, and the decision that has just been made is a spectacular one: a young woman has just been placed in detention despite being presumed innocent.”Sofia Bougrine, a lawyer for one of the people arrested this week but later released, pointed to what she said was the indiscriminate nature of some of the arrests.“In these serious crime cases, we find that waves of arrests look more like drift nets,” Bougrine told AFP.The first two men arrested earlier were charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after“partially admitting to the charges”, Beccuau said earlier this week.They are suspected of being the two who broke into the gallery while two accomplices waited outside.Both lived in the north-eastern Paris suburb of Aubervilliers.One is a 34-year-old Algerian national living inFrance, who was identified by DNA traces found on one of the scooters used to flee the heist. The second man is a 39-year-old unlicensed taxi driver.Both were known to the police for having committed thefts.The first was arrested as he was about to board a plane for Algeria at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.Louvre thieves’ slow-motion getaway using furniture lift was caught on videoRead moreThe second was apprehended shortly after near his home, and there was no evidence to suggest that he was planning to go abroad, prosecutors said.The stolen loot remains missing.The thieves dropped a diamond- and emerald-studded crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, as they escaped.The burglars made off with eight other items of jewellery.Among them are an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise, and a diadem that once belonged to the Empress Eugenie, which is dotted with nearly 2,000 diamonds.The interior minister, Laurent Nuñez, told the French daily Le Parisien: “I remain confident that we will be able to find them.”Explore more on these topicsParisMuseumsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

People placed flowers and candles along temporary fencing near the damaged station entrance, as thousands more packed into the square.The disaster inspired Serbia’s largest youth-led movement since the fall of Slobodan Milošević, a hardline leader whodied in 2006 of a heart attackwhile he was being tried on 66 counts of crimes against humanity,including genocide.Protesters had initially demanded a transparent investigation into the disaster, but their calls soon escalated into criticism of corruption and nepotism, as well as calls for early parliamentary elections, which are due in 2027.Many arrived to Novi Sad by bus or car, but in a gesture of continued protest, others marched from Novi Pazar, about 340km (211 miles) south of the capital. It took them a symbolic 16 days to finish the march.View image in fullscreenMourners wait to lay flowers at a memorial service in front of Novi Sad railway station.Photograph: Nenad Mihajlovic/AFP/Getty ImagesThe people of Novi Sad took to the streets to greet the marchers, blowing whistles and waving flags. “I came to bow to the strongest force in the world right now – our students, our youth,” said one Novi Sad resident, Ratko Popovic.The protests have yielded results, including theresignation in January of the former prime minister Miloš Vučević.Vučić has remained defiant and branded demonstrators as western-backed “terrorists”. However, Saturday’s gathering may have shaken him. In a televised public address on Friday, the president made a rare apology for his harsh rhetoric.“I have said some things that I am now sorry for saying,” Vučić said in a TV address that called for dialogue. “All that hatred boiling in our society cannot bring any good. It can only lead to further destruction.”After a year of street protests, Serbia’s students split on what should come nextRead moreThe government has declared Saturday a day of national mourning.Serbia is seeking to join the EU, but Vučić’s crackdown, as well as his close relations with Russia and China, have spooked Brussels.The EU’s commissioner for enlargement, Marta Kos, said on X that the canopy tragedy “is changing Serbia”.“It moved masses to stand for accountability, free expression and inclusive democracy,” Kos said. “They are the same values to lead Serbia into the EU.”The anti-government protests have remained largely peaceful, although in August, theyturned violentwith allegations of police brutality and excessive use of force.In September, 13 people, including the former construction minister Goran Vesić were charged in a criminal case over the disaster.

This month he will be sentenced at the Old Bailey after pleading guilty to taking bribes to make statements in favour of Russia during his tenure as a member of the European parliament.In modern British politics, it is an almost unique fall from grace – perhaps with parallels to the story ofJohn Stonehouse, the high-flying Labour MP recruited as a spy for Czech intelligence in the early 60s.But Gill’s humiliation isn’t just personal. His links to Russia raise awkward questions for Reform UK, and for its leader, Nigel Farage – Gill was a key lieutenant of his when they were both in Brussels. While Farage has beentrying to distance himself from Gill, multiple sources who worked with them in Brussels have told the Guardian that the two men used to be close.View image in fullscreenFarage (left), then Ukip leader, and Gill before a plenary session at the EU headquarters in Brussels in June 2016, just after the Brexit vote.Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty ImagesThe moment of Gill’s downfall dates back to July 2021 and the arrivals queue at Washington DC’s Dulles international airport.FBI agents stopped Oleg Voloshyn, a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician close to Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch sometimes known in his native country as the “dark prince” and a long-term ally and friend of Vladimir Putin.It was less than a year before Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkraineand Medvedchuk had been charged with treason, and his TV channels, conduits for Russian propaganda, had been taken off the air.Voloshyn, his envoy to the west, was in the crosshairs of US authorities.The FBI extracted WhatsApp messages from Voloshyn’s phone in which he discussed secretly paying Gill. Voloshyn was released after three hours of questioning, but he and Medvedchuk were both named the following year by the US as agents of a Kremlin plot to install a puppet government in Ukraine.Farage insists ex-Reform UK Wales leader convicted of bribery is ‘bad apple’Read moreNow in Moscow, Voloshyn was Gill’s co-accused, albeit beyond the reach of British authorities. Two months later in September 2021, after the stop at Dulles airport, counter-terrorism police arrested Gill at Manchester airport.On his phone, police found messages that showed he had reached an agreement with Voloshyn. According to prosecutors, Gill accepted cash on at least eight occasions to make specific statements and opinions benefitingRussia.The amount has yet to be disclosed, but various amounts totalling in excess of at least £10,000 were mentioned in WhatApp messages between him and Voloshyn.Looking back on them now, the public statements appear subtle, but they provided the mood music in the west for a propaganda war being waged by the Kremlin to paint Ukraine’s pro-western leaders as repressive.For his cooperation in this covert PR campaign, Gill received “xmas presents” and “post cards” – coded references to money. They were his reward for making speeches in the European parliament and giving TV interviews scripted by Voloshyn.View image in fullscreenGill arriving at the Old Bailey in September, charged with bribery and of conspiracy to commit bribery.Photograph: Yui Mok/PASpeaking to the Guardian via email, Voloshyn denied allegations made by the US and UK that he had acted at the direction of Russia’s FSB spy agency.He insisted the payments – typically £4,000 or £5,000 each – were merely media appearance fees, rather than bribes. He described Gill as a “humble” father of five who was “definitely not rich” and was the “victim of a geopolitical conspiracy”.The tangled story of Gill and Voloshyn raises questions about how Russia has attempted to cultivate contacts across British political life.David Coburn and Jonathan Arnott, two other MEPs who were part of Farage’s Ukip bloc in Brussels, visited Ukraine with Gill on an October 2018 trip. During the visit, Coburn, Gill and Arnott appeared on camera in interviews with 112 Ukraine, a pro-Russian channel affiliated with Medvedchuk.Six weeks later, the three would make similar statements during a debate in the European parliament on 11 December that touched on press freedom in Ukraine and the question of whether it should be allowed to join the EU.1:06Nathan Gill questions press freedom in Ukraine in European parliament – videoGill spoke first. While saying he had “every sympathy with Ukraine”,he added: “It is wrong to fight repression with repression.” Prosectors in Britain say he had received a script for the speech from Voloshyn on 7 December 2018.Arnott and Coburn followed,with the formercalling on the Ukrainian government to ensure freedom of the press “against a backdrop of violence against journalists [and] the proposed closure of TV channels”.Coburnthen accused Kyiv’s leadersof being “found wanting” on freedom of the press, accusing them of “plotting” to close the channel 112 Ukraine and questioning whether Ukraine was fit for EU membership. Gill and Coburn sat on the channel’s new “international” board, along Voloshyn and others.There is no suggestion that either Coburn or Arnott took bribes in the same way as Gill.Nigel Farage claims Russia was provoked into Ukraine warRead moreContacted by the Guardian, Arnott rejected any suggestion that he had links to Russia or was acting in its interests and pointed to another part of his speech in which he said “the best response to a loss of freedom is increased freedom”.He added: “I think that provides a bit of background and context to what I was saying in the speech and explains where I was coming from. Russia’s suppression of free speech should not be countered by Ukraine also suppressing free speech.”Attempts have been made to contact Coburn.In correspondence with the Guardian, Voloshyn claims the broadcaster 112 Ukraine “should have” covered the MEPs’ travel costs on their 2018 trip. In fact, declarations by the three to the European parliament record their tickets as having been paid for by the European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights, a front created by Russian intelligence agents with the same name as a genuine organisation.The cutout’s president, Janusz Niedźwiecki, was arrested in 2021 in his home country, Poland, on suspicion of espionage for Russia. Arnott said if he had been aware the money for his trip may have come from Russian assets “obviously I would not have participated in any visit on such a basis”.Farage has faced questions about the extent of contact he may have had with Voloshyn. Nadia Sass, Voloshyn’s wife, a 112 Ukraine journalist, last year posted a photo on X of herself with Farage, which appears to have been taken outside the European parliament in about 2018, saying she would “miss Nigel Farage and his team”.Another tweet included a picture of Farage holding a T-shirt with the logo “Leave and Let Die #brexit”, apparently taken in Gill’s Strasbourg office in 2018. Voloshyn said Sass had given it to Farage because she wanted to promote her political T-shirt business. He claims he has never spoken to Farage.View image in fullscreenFarage, then head of the Brexit party, and Gill visiting a vape shop in Merthyr Tydfil in 2019.Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty ImagesA spokesperson said: “Nigel Farage meets thousands of people every single year. Many hundreds of them will ask to have a photo taken with him. He was deeply shocked and angered by the actions of Mr Gill and condemns them in every possible way.”They added that Farage did not have any knowledge of Gill’s “shameful activities”.But Niedźwiecki and Voloshyn appear to have also widened their net beyond the various incarnations of parties by Farage. Both were named in warning emails sent to all MPs at Westminster in July 2021 and January 2022 by the speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle.A number of MPs are understood to have come forward to the security services after Hoyle warned them that Voloshyn was working to gain the support of a number of politicians in parliament for policies in support of Russian state objectives.Sir John Whittingdale, a former minister and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Ukraine, said he had first come across Voloshyn when he was “the right hand man” toKostyantyn Gryshchenko, who served as Ukraine’s foreign minister under its Moscow-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych.“I went to observe an election around 2012 and I did see him once at his request in Westminster [in 2018] with Nadia Sass [Voloshyn’s wife]. As I recall they were complaining about restrictions and harassment of her TV channel by the government,” Whittingdale told the Guardian.“He has now been identified as a Russian asset, though at the time I knew him he was working for the [previous] Ukrainian government, which was quite pro-Russian.”Labour steps up attacks on Farage and Reform over pro-Russia stanceRead moreThere is no indication that Whittingdale or other Tory MPs such as Mark Pritchard, who was due to appear on a panel at an event in London with Sass, were compromised by any association with him.Instead, the heaviest price is expected to be paid by Gill,whose guilty pleain September to eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019 took prosecutors by surprise.An ashen-faced Gill had entered the plea after earlier appearances at Westminster magistrates court, where he had been ordered to surrender his passport and register with police at Anglesey, the Welsh island where he lives with his wife and children.Before entering politics, he had practised in Anglesey for six years as a Mormon bishop. Anglesey had also been the base for an earlier business running care home services founded by his family and operating mainly in Hull. That business collapsed with debts of £116,000 after the 2008 financial crisis hit.Attempts to build a political career followed, with early failures at gaining election at council and devolved level before finally becoming a Ukip MEP in 2014.From the misery of a struggling business and electoral failure, Gill found himself at the centre of Brussels politics, rubbing shoulders with the eclectic milieu of international visitors and lobbyists at the European parliament. A hitherto unnoticed interest in international affairs bloomed.Farage has been trying to distance himself from Gill,telling the BBCthat he was “stunned” when he found out his party’s former leader in Wales took bribes.Challenged on whether he questioned Gill over the statements, Farage said: “I didn’t know anything about it; all I knew was that he’d been to Ukraine. I told him not to go, he defied me and went, I was completely unaware of any statements that he made.”However, multiple sources who worked with Farage and Gill in Brussels and Strasbourg said the two men had been close.View image in fullscreenFarage and, behind him, Gill after a historic vote for the Brexit agreement at a session of the European parliament on 29 January 2020.Photograph: Thierry Monasse/Getty ImagesGill was described variously as Farage’s “enforcer” and “right-hand man” by some who recalled they had adjoining offices. One former Ukip MEP from that time told the Guardian: “Gill was in the thick of organising. He was the right-hand version of Farage. His office was right beside Farage’s.”“Nathan had a unique place in the party,” another source said. “He was the centre of gravity in Wales, and David [Coburn] was at the centre in Scotland. I found David quite difficult – he could be very outspoken. He was very loyal to Nigel.”Gill also had personal vulnerabilities of the sort foreign intelligence agencies look to seize upon.Alex Phillips, formerly a media adviser to Gill and someone who also served alongside him as a Brexit party MEP, said: “There is a tragic backdrop to this. They clearly targeted someone who was financially vulnerable.”Phillips told the Guardian she was “as shocked as everyone” when Gill was arrested, adding that she voluntarily went to speak to the Metropolitan police and let them know that she had known nothing about his secret activities.“I don’t believe he was cunning enough to really believe in what he became involved in. It’s quite sad really.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It was a rare moment of relief after years of fear and loss. On Tuesday night he gave an interview to a local NGO urging people to return to their homes in northern Gaza now that fighting had stopped. Just half an hour later, Zein was dead, killed in an Israeli bombing on the school where he had been sheltering in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.He died without being able to fulfil his vow to his wife that they would return to Beit Lahia and pitch a tent over the rubble, eager to be home even if their house was no longer there.“When the most recent truce was announced, Abu Luay felt so happy and relieved,” said his wife, Maryam, using a family name for him. “He told me that finally the bloodshed would stop and people could live in peace. Sadly, that feeling didn’t last. Israel violated the ceasefire again.”Zein was one of 115 people killed and 352 injured during 24 hours of Israeli bombardment ofGazathis week, according to the Gaza health ministry. The strikes came after Hamas returned body parts of a hostage whose remains Israeli troops had recovered two years before, and Palestinian militants attacked Israeli troops in southern Gaza.It was the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire was put in place on 10 October and one of the deadliest days in the whole of the two-year war.The bombings were just the latest in a series of Israeli violations of the three-week-long ceasefire in Gaza. After the initial enthusiasm over the ceasefire announcement, worry has set in among the people of Gaza. They are fearful that the ceasefire does not mean an end to the war but just less frequent and more random bursts of violence they are unable to predict. That randomness makes their own futures hard to imagine, much less to plan.Hussain Abu Munir feels the uncertainty of the ceasefire on his daily commute to work. He travels in a bus filled with other medical professionals displaced to southern Gaza to their workplaces in northern Gaza.To gather so openly with other medical professionals is already unnerving after two years of war where medical workers have become targets. At least 1,722 healthcare workers were killed during the war in Gaza, according to Medical Aid forPalestine. But the journey itself, through the Netzarim checkpoint into northern Gaza, makes Abu Munir fear for his life.“Each day we go and return, it feels like embarking on a dangerous, uncertain journey, without protection or assurance,” said the 40-year-old nurse. “My biggest fear is not for myself but for my children, whom I leave alone in the south when I go to work.”He said he was afraid Israel might close the Netzarim checkpoint while he was at work, meaning he would be unable to return to his children.On Wednesday, Israeli shells began to be fired seemingly at random as Abu Munir approached the Netzarim checkpoint. People screamed for the buses to stop but they managed to make it through unharmed.“We didn’t encounter any direct targeting on our way, but the truth is that no one can guarantee our safety,” Abu Munir said.View image in fullscreenIn Gaza the normal staples of childhood – play and learning – have been overtaken by the grim logistics of survival.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesDespite the bombing and high death toll this week, international mediators said they were confident the ceasefire would hold. Donald Trump said nothing would jeopardise the truce, while the US vice-president, JD Vance, downplayed the violence as “skirmishes”.After their statements, Israel struck Gaza again on Wednesday, this time saying it was targeting a Hamas weapons cache that was to be used in an imminent attack.The continued strikes are disturbing for those in Gaza, who worry they are being led into the same sort of ceasefire that prevails in Lebanon, where Israel carries out airstrikes daily despite a year-old truce.To Ikram Nasser, a 36-year-old English teacher, the ceasefire has so far been a disappointment. She had hoped it would provide the safety required to return her own children and her students back to the classroom after two years of interrupted education.She has watched children regressing socially as the normal staples of childhood – play and learning – have been overtaken by the grim logistics of survival.“Many have become more aggressive and rough, not because they chose to but because of the reality they’ve been forced to live. These children now chase after food distributions, aid trucks or even water tankers,” Nasser said.In the first days of the ceasefire, it seemed there would be a chance to return those children back to normality. More tents were turned into classrooms and children began to line up outside, eager to learn.“Some even arrive as early as seven in the morning, an hour before lessons begin, simply because they’ve missed learning and the feeling of normal life they were deprived of for so long,” Nasser said.This week of bombings, however, has shattered any illusions that life in Gaza could soon return to normal, for children or for adults.“Even now, we don’t feel safe,” Nasser said. “Every day brings a new violation of the ceasefire. The situation remains extremely difficult, for us as mothers and as teachers. We no longer trust the ceasefire will hold.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson said numerous ambulances, tactical commanders and its hazardous area response team were at the scene, adding: “We can confirm we have transported multiple patients to hospital.”One witness who was on the train recalled seeing someone move through the carriage warning others: “They’ve got a knife, I’ve been stabbed.”The witness told Sky News the man was “extremely bloodied” and that by the time the train stopped “they were basically on the floor”.“That person ended up collapsing on the floor. They were taken to an ambulance pretty much straight away,” he said.Witnesses say people wounded by the attack were seen sprinting through the train away from somebody with a knife.Later on, armed police were seen directing their weapons at a man standing on a platform with a large blade, a witness said. The man was then incapacitated with a taser and restrained.One witness said they saw between six and eight people who were wounded, while another said up to 12 may have been injured.Police said the attack happened on the 6.25pm train service from Doncaster to London King’s Cross, shortly after the LNER train left Peterborough station.View image in fullscreenThe scene at Huntingdon station on Saturday evening.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesKeir Starmer said the incident was “deeply concerning” and urged people to follow police advice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His fur flutters as he turns, his neat button nose sniffs the air, and his eyes soften with a smile. For years, design details of the bear forPaddington the Musical, directed by Luke Sheppard, have been kept top secret. Now here he is, in his blue duffel coat and red hat. A quiet theatrical marvel. “What we’re doing,” says producer Sonia Friedman, “has never been done before.”Standing around 1.2 metres (just under 4ft) tall, the bear is beautifully round, all belly and sloping shoulders. He is not an exact replica of the Paddingtons we’ve seen in illustrations or movies, but something new. His shaggy, caramel fur has a gentle wave, and his white snout is dotted with a brown nose, ideal for sniffing out trouble. Around his neck sits a label, threaded through an old piece of string, asking for someone to look after him.View image in fullscreenSandwiched together … the principal cast of Paddington the Musical.Photograph: Jay BrooksWhen fellow producer Eliza Lumley first had the idea of doing a musical of Michael Bond’s Paddington in 2016, the immediate question was how to do the bear. “We wanted to see if it was possible to have Paddington on stage,” says Friedman, who joined the team two years in. “Just Paddington.” They tested out every idea, finding puppetry to be “gorgeous”, Lumley says, but “slightly whimsical”. The presence of puppeteers also complicated the desire to have this bear alone on stage, lost at a train station and waiting to be found.Paddington Bear given UK passport by Home OfficeRead moreThe innovative answer for this stage adaptation, written by Jessica Swale with music by Tom Fletcher, began to emerge when Neal Scanlan, creature effects artist and designer of Star Wars’ Chewbacca, pointed them towards Tahra Zafar. Having conjured creatures for Star Wars, English National Opera and that pesky monkey for PG Tips, Zafar now boasts the imponderably lovely title of “Paddington Bear designer”.“We looked back at the books and Peggy Fortnum’s beautiful illustrations,” says Zafar, “and all the different versions of Paddington over the years.” The influence of Fortnum’s designs is particularly apparent; where the movie Paddington’s face leans towards realism, Zafar’s design has Fortnum’s wide, teddy-like quality. Zafar describes the technological routes they explored as “quite fancy”, but they kept returning to simpler ideas that captured the bear’s purity. “We wanted to create something that you respond to with your heart.” The result is part toy, part real. Part tech, part costume, part magic.0:51Paddington the Musical bear revealed – videoThe heavy padded bear suit is then brought to life by the skill and partnership of two performers: Arti Shah and James Hameed. Over years of workshops, the duo have formed a unique synchrony that allows us to believe we are watching a walking, talking, singing – and occasionally dancing – Peruvian bear. Shah’s experience as a creature performer for film has prepared her for physically playing the bear, while Hameed provides the voice, with the twinned nature of the role never hidden from the audience. At a recent workshop, a child supplied a more fitting description of Hameed’s role when she marched up to him and announced: “You’re Paddington’s soul.”Hameed also remotely puppeteers Paddington’s facial expressions using a control panel. This means he is in charge of the bear’s infamous hard stare. These controls were originally a separate role, but through workshops, they found that the instinctual relationship between the pair cut any delay in Paddington’s reactions. As an avid gamer, Hameed was thrilled.View image in fullscreenThe bear necessities … James Hameed and Arti Shah.Photograph: Jay BrooksPhysically performing inside the bear requires immense strength, stamina and skill. “Before we started rehearsals I sat in the sauna for a whole week, every day, in my blacks,” says Shah. “It was a way of training my mind. The bear is not as hot as the sauna.” She has experience with such unusual performance constraints. When she was in the movie Attack the Block, she was required to run on all fours in a costume that weighed half her bodyweight and had arm extensions. “This is so much lighter,” she laughs.While eight shows a week creates new physical challenges (actors Abbie Purvis and Ali Sarebani are alternate Paddington performers), the theatre also brings new joys; this musical will be Shah’s first experience of taking a bow. “It hasn’t sunk in,” she says. “I’m just humbled and excited to be doing this, especially being a female Asian of short stature. To show my young son, who has been diagnosed with my condition, that anything is possible.” An enormous fan of the books and movies, her son is frequently found singing Fletcher’s songs from the show. “I’m doing this for him,” Shah says.For many of the team, the bear holds an emotional resonance that goes beyond nostalgia for bedtime stories. “Paddington means something different to everyone,” Hameed says. “My father came over in the 70s from Pakistan, looking for a home. For my British mum, Paddington was manners, tea and marmalade sandwiches. For my dad, he was a visualisation of his own story.”When Bond first wrote A Bear Called Paddington in 1958, he described an evacuee’s label around the character’s neck that read: “Please look after this bear.” The team behind Paddington the Musical evidently takes this role seriously. Zafar mentions a label her team have sewn on to the bottom of one of Paddington’s paws: “Made in Peru.”“It’s quite subtle,” Zafar says. “I don’t think anyone’s going to see it, but we know it’s there.” It’s a mark of the care and attention that has gone into crafting this bear. “I think when you really love making something, that love gets transferred to the thing you’re creating. I’m hoping that’s what you see in Paddington. All that love on stage.”Paddington the Musical is at the Savoy theatre, London.Explore more on these topicsMusicalsPaddingtonActingChildrenTheatreWest EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was a proud family man who spent a lot of his time with his son, both working with and socially. Peter loved to have meals out with his wife and had a particularly sweet tooth.”Three others involved in the crash, the pilot, 41, and two passengers, a 58-year-old woman and a boy, 10, suffered minor injuries.Analysis of the helicopter’s flight path showed it leaving the airfield at about 10am and flying over Doncaster for about seven minutes before stopping suddenly near Bentley.Lee Needham, who lives in the area, told the BBC that the helicopter came down close to houses, train tracks, industrial units and electrical pylons. “Whoever was piloting the helicopter more than likely saved numerous lives,” he said.South Yorkshire police and the government’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) have launched a joint investigation into the incident.The family said they were supporting the investigation and asked people “to not speculate on the circumstances surrounding the accident”.“We would like to ask for privacy during this incredibly difficult time to allow us to come to terms with what has occurred and grieve for the loss of Peter,” they added.A spokesperson for the AAIB said a team of experts in aircraft operations, engineering and recorded data had been deployed to the site on Thursday.Kuki Helicopters, based at Retford Gamston airport, which is understood to have owned the craft, said it would “continue to support” the agencies involved in the investigation into the crash.The firm, which, according to its website, offers flying lessons and experiences, said in a Facebook post: “At this very sad time, all our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of all those involved in the helicopter incident which happened yesterday.“Our heartfelt condolences are sent to everyone affected by this tragedy, and we will, of course, continue to support relevant agencies involved in the continuing investigation.”Explore more on these topicsHelicopter crashesSouth YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The incident came to light after another motorist captured the footage on a dashcam and reported it to the police.The date of the offence predates eight other speeding charges for which Fofana was disqualified from driving for two years in May.The recording, published by the CPS, shows him speeding on the hard shoulder and winding recklessly through traffic.The district judge Julie Cooper sentenced Fofana to an 18-month community order, which includes 300 hours of community service and ordered him to pay £85 costs and a £114 victim surcharge.“You obviously realise there are a lot of young people who look up to you and they would like to be like you and follow you. That’s part of the whole gig,” Cooper told him.“However, they will not be able to afford these expensive cars, with all their additions that keep them safe and you could have some 17-year-old, who has just passed their test, who think they can copy you.“They will not be able to handle their car and do some ridiculous driving manoeuvres and they are dead. You need to be much more responsible about your behaviour.”Prosecutor Rabbi Khan said the other motorist captured Fofana’s white Lamborghini on their dashcam about 4.50pm. Khan told the court: “The witness identified the danger and this defendant was driving on the hard shoulder at speed in a 50mph zone.“The offence is aggravated by an approaching bend that was signposted and he is not indicating when making these manoeuvres. He refused to abide by the road rules at speed.”Fofana was disqualified at Lavender Hill magistrates court in May for eight speeding offences committed while driving his Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a blue Audi and the same Lamborghini Urus.He admitted all the offences and was fined a total of £5,328, plus a £2,131 victim surcharge and £110 costs. On that occasion, he received 38 penalty points on his licence, taking his total to 47. The latest offence predates these speeding charges.His solicitor, Imogen Cox, told the court: “The video speaks for itself – 15 to 20 seconds of driving that are conceded. There is no explanation or excuse for his driving on that day.“He attended voluntarily for an interview at Guildford police station and apologised for driving and said he had learned a valuable lesson about his driving and had no explanation for his driving on that day.“This offence pre-dates the speeding offences, which were all within a seven-month period and tied-up at Lavender Hill. He is essentially of good character, having no criminal convictions against him. He is fit and healthy and able to carry out community work.”The judge said any breach of the new 18-month driving ban was likely to result in a prison sentence. “At the end of the disqualification you cannot drive until you pass an extended driving test and if you drive as a disqualified driver you will almost certainly be sent to prison, and that is career-ending,” she said.Explore more on these topicsRoad safetyChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

The 11 people charged, aged from 21 to 35, all travelled to the UK from Thailand via Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.Nine of them appeared at Birmingham magistrates court on Friday, where they were bailed until their next appearance at Birmingham crown court on 28 November 2025.Six men suspected of organising the attempted importation, five of whom were arrested at addresses in Marsh Farm, Luton, and Finchley in north London on 23 October 2024, remain under investigation.NCA branch commander Kevin Broadhead said: “This was an enormous amount of cannabis to be seized from air passengers and would have been extremely profitable for organised crime gangs had it remain undetected.“The charges brought against these individuals are an important moment in our investigation, which remains ongoing.“Anyone who is asked to smuggle drugs into the UK should think very carefully about the potential consequences if caught. The chances of getting caught are high, and it just isn’t worth that risk.”Last year, the NCAsaidthe amount of cannabis seized from smugglers carrying the drug in suitcases to UK airports had tripled in less than a year, with about 15 tonnes of the drug being uncovered at airports by August 2024, compared with 5 tonnes throughout the whole of 2023, and 2 tonnes in 2022.Thailand, Canada and the parts of the US where cannabis is decriminalised and can be legally grown are hotspots for trafficking to the UK. Gangs can make significant profits by selling cannabis trafficked from these countries because they are perceived as being high-quality.There have been a number of high-profile cannabis trafficking cases recently. Former Arsenal footballer Jay Emmanuel-Thomas was sentenced to four years in prison in June after he admitted orchestrating a plot to recruit two women to travel to Thailand and smuggle cannabis back to the UK. Two women, including Thomas’s girlfriend, were caught at Stansted airport with four suitcases each containing 15kg (33lbs) of cannabis.In May, Bella Culley, a 19-year-old student nurse from Billingham, was arrested at Tbilisi airport after being stopped with, it is alleged, 14kg (31lbs) of cannabis worth £200,000 in a travel bag. She had been travelling in south-east Asia but was reported missing in Pattaya, Thailand until her arrest in Georgia.Culley had previously been told she could face up to 20 years in jail or life imprisonment if convicted but her family havepaid£138,000 in a plea-bargain deal that could result in her being handed a two-year jail sentence.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

If you can’t visit a doctor, don’t worry, he will save you a dance.”The former US president stopped in the afternoon in Norfolk, Virginia, to stump for the former representative who at 55% support among voters leads the Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, by 14 points, according to aYouGov surveyconducted from 17 to 28 October.Obama later spoke in Newark, New Jersey, on behalf of theUS representative Mikie Sherrill, whom 51% of voters favor, as compared with Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican state assembly member, who has 42% support, according to the same report.Obama spoke after Sherrill, continuing his criticism of Trump and his policies. “We’ve got a president who deployed the national guard in American cities and claimed to be stopping crime waves that don’t actually exist,” Obama said. “We’ve got masked ICE agents in unmarked vans pulling people in off the streets, including US citizens, on the suspicion that they don’t look like real Americans.“It’s like every day is Halloween except it’s all tricks and no treats,” Obama said amid reports of immigration raids taking place inChicago and Los Angeleseven on Halloween night.He highlighted Sherrill’s experience as a navy helicopter pilot, federal prosecutor and mother of four, saying it made her “the kind of leader who understands the mission”. “She knows who she’s supposed to serve,” Obama said.Earlier Saturday, Obama called New York mayoral candidateZohran Mamdaniand offered to be a “sounding board” if the 34-year-old Democratic frontrunner wins the election. He also praised Mamdani’s campaign, a spokesperson confirmed to Reuters.“Zohran Mamdani appreciated President Obama’s words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city,” said Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec.Mamdani, a Uganda-born state assembly member, has polled well ahead of his main rival, former New York governorAndrew Cuomo, before the 4 November general election.The 4 November elections, in states that have flipped back and forth between Republican and Democratic governors, are seen as indicators of how the country feels about Trump and the two parties in the off-year race.“There is absolutely no evidence Republicans’ policies have made life better for you, the people of Virginia,” Obama said atthe rally. “They have devoted enormous energy trying to entrench themselves in power and punishing their enemies and enriching their friends and silencing their critics.”“It’s time to point America in a better direction by electing Abigail Spanberger as your next governor,” Obama added.Virginia voters will be electing a female governor for the first time. Spanberger is a former CIA analyst who served three terms in Congress; Earle-Sears became lieutenant governor in 2022, making her the first woman of color to hold a statewide office inVirginia.In anOctober debate, Earle-Sears, a US Marine Corps veteran, focused on culture-war issues like transgender women in sports.“Are you going to change in a gym where men are nude in the locker rooms?” Earle-Sears asked Spanberger. “Are you going to do that, Abigail? I don’t think you will. What about your girl children?”Spanberger responded that there should never be nude men in women’s locker rooms and that decisions on transgender athletes competing in girls’ sports “should be made between parents and educators and teachers in each community. It should not be dictated by politicians.”At the rally Saturday, Spanberger said her opponent was “focused on the wrong things”.“We need a governor who will recognize that Virginians are struggling to afford the rising costs in healthcare, housing and energy,” said Spanberger, who was the first Democrat to win her district in almost 50 years.The former president touted Spanberger’s rank as one of themost bipartisanmembers of the House.“Abigail has real, practical plans to grow the economy and strengthen Virginia schools and lower the cost of everything from housing to healthcare to energy, and she is willing to reach across the aisle to make it happen,” Obama said.He referenced the thousands of federal workers who havelost their jobsbecause of the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal spending. An estimated750,000workers have also been furloughed amid the government shutdown.Obama backs California’s Proposition 50 to counter Texas redistrictingRead moreVirginia, right next to Washington DC, has a large federal workforce and has beenespecially hurtby those job cuts.One rally attendee, Tanya Keller, a 60-year-old Norfolk resident, said she supports Spanberger because she thinks Spanberger is rational and concerned about people losing federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid coverage.Obama “reminded us what is at stake, what is important and how we have to fight being divided”, said Keller, who has volunteered for Spanberger’s campaign.Meanwhile, in New Jersey, the race has centered on Trump’s policies. Sherrill, a former navy helicopter pilot and federal prosecutor, focused ina debatelast month on the impact of tariffs on grocery prices and of the “big, beautiful bill” on healthcare and utility costs. She said that Ciattarelli refused to stand up to Trump.“He’ll do whatever Trump tells him to do,” she said. “All he says is: ‘Trump’s right.’”Explore more on these topicsBarack ObamaVirginiaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!”The warning of possible military action came after Nigeria’s president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump announcing the day before that he was designating the west African country “a country of particular concern” for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.In a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.“Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,” Tinubu said. “Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.”Trump on Friday said “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and “radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter”.Trump’s comment came weeks after the US senatorTed Cruzurged Congress to designate Africa’s most populous country a violater of religious freedom with claims of “Christian mass murder”.Nigeria’s population of 220 million people is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.Wole Soyinka, Nigerian Nobel laureate and Trump critic, says US visa revokedRead moreAttacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated attacks targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.Kimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to protect citizens of all religions.“The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion,” Ebienfa said in a statement on Saturday. “Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.”Nigeria was placed on the country-of-particular-concern list by the US for the first time in 2020 over what the state department called “systematic violations of religious freedom”. The designation, which did not single out attacks on Christians, was lifted in 2023 in what observers saw as a way to improve ties between the countries before the then-secretary of state Antony Blinken’s visit.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNigeriaUS foreign policyUS politicsUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

Airports affected included facilities in New York City, Austin, Newark, Phoenix, Washington, Nashville, Dallas and Denver. At some airports, delays averaged one hour or more.Trump calls on Republicans to abolish the Senate filibuster ruleRead moreThe shutdown has forced 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers to work without pay.“After 31 days without pay, air traffic controllers are under immense stress and fatigue,” the FAA said late on Friday.“The shutdown must end so that these controllers receive the pay they’ve earned and travelers can avoid further disruptions and delays,” it added.The impact on the system would have been far worse on a typical Friday. However, Halloween evening traffic was 20% lower than usual, which helped mitigate the effects ofstaffing shortages, airline officials said.More than 5,600 flights were delayed on Friday and 500 canceled, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking website.At New York City’s LaGuardia airport, 50% of flights were delayed and 12% canceled, with delays averaging 140 minutes, while Washington DC’s Reagan National airport had a quarter of flights delayed.Airlines are bracing for more flight disruptions.“Coming into this weekend and then the week after, I think you are going to see even more disruptions in the airspace,” the US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, said on Fox News’s America’s Newsroom.On Thursday, air traffic control staffing shortages snarled flights at Orlando, Dallas/Fort Worth and Washington DC, with FlightAware data showing 7,300 flights delayed and 1,250 canceled across the US.Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have all called on Congress to quickly pass a stopgap funding bill known as a “continuing resolution” to let the government reopen amid talks on disputes over healthcare policy.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association’s president, Nick Daniels, on Friday joined the airlines in calling for a continuing resolution.The government shutdown began on 1 October and continues as a federal funding bill has stalled in Congress.Republican lawmakers want to pass a “clean” funding measure with no strings attached while Democrats have demanded talks on extending healthcare subsidies set to expire at year’s end.Airlines have repeatedly called for an end to the shutdown, citing aviation safety risks.The shutdown has exacerbated existing staffing shortages, threatening to cause widespread disruptions similar to those that helped end a 35-day government shutdown in 2019.The FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels, and many had been working mandatory overtime as well as six-day weeks even before the shutdown.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Airline industryAir transportUS federal government shutdownsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

To show that I love America just as much as you do?” the audience member asked, after pointing out that Vance’s wife, Usha, is Hindu and they are raising their children in an interfaith marriage.Vance said that his wife grew up in a Hindu household “but not a particularly religious family” – and noted that when he met his wife they would have both considered themselves agnostic or atheist.Vance converted to Catholicism in his 30s after being raised in a loosely evangelical family. He was baptized into the church in 2019 just as he started to become a prominent supporter ofDonald Trump, who chose Vance as his running mate when he successfully ran for a second presidency in 2024.“My views on public policy and what the optimal state should look like are pretty aligned with Catholic social teaching,” Vance, a former US senator for Ohio,saidat the time of his baptism. “I saw a real overlap between what I would like to see and what the Catholic church would like to see.”At the Turning Point USA event, Vance said that he and his wife eventually decided to raise their kids as Christians.“Our two kids go to Christian school. Our eight-year-old just did his first communion a year ago. That’s how we decided to come to our arrangement,” Vance said, to roaring applause. “As I’ve told her, and as I’ve said publicly, and as I’ll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends: do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing I was moved by in church? Yes. I honestly do wish that, because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope that eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.“But if she doesn’t,” Vance went on to say, “God says that everybody has free will, so that doesn’t cause a problem with me. That’s something that you work out with your friends, your family, the person you most love.”Usha Vance has publicly stated that she doesn’t intend to convert to Christianity. In June, she told conservative blogger Meghan McCain that while the family has made church “a family experience … the kids know that I’m not Catholic”.“They have plenty of access to the Hindu tradition, from books that we give them to things that we show them to visit recently to India, and some religious elements of that visit,” Usha Vance said.The executive director of the Hindu American Foundation was critical of Vance’s remarks,tellingthe New York Times that the vice-president was “basically saying that … this aspect of [Usha] is just not enough”.“That’s a lot of uncertainty in the community,” Suhag Shukla said to the outlet. “This just added kind of fuel to those fears.”JD Vance did nothing as Trump cuts cost his Ohio home town millions. Will it reshape the city council?Read moreAfter his comments Wednesday, Vancerepliedto a social media post – which has since been taken down – that said “it’s weird to throw your wife’s religion under the bus, in public, for a moment’s acceptance by groypers”, a term for certain far-right extremists.Vance called the comment “disgusting” and an example of “anti-Christian bigotry”. He said that his Christian faith “tells me the Gospel is true and is good for human beings”.“[Usha] herself encouraged me to re-engage with my faith many years ago. She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage – or any interfaith relationship – I hope she may one day see things as I do,” hewrote.“Regardless, I’ll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she’s my wife.“Yes, Christians have beliefs. And yes, those beliefs have many consequences, one of which is that we want to share them with other people. That is a completely normal thing, and anyone who’s telling you otherwise has an agenda.”Explore more on these topicsJD VanceUS politicsChristianityHinduismReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Hemet privatelywith the president last January, andhailed him as “one tough SOB”during an unprecedented address at last summer’s Republican national convention.Biggest US labor unions fuel No Kings protests against Trump: ‘You need a voice to have freedom’Read more“When he was running, the first time he was saying the truth about Trump,” Hooker said, suggesting O’Brien made his early attacks on Trump just to win election as Teamsters president. “Now that he’s elected, he has decided to go along with Trump and everything that he’s done. But not just Trump, also the ruling class, the employer class, billionaire class, because that’s who Trump represents. He doesn’t represent the workers.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump looks on as Sean O’Brien, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, speaks at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesAfter O’Brien’s convention speech, the Teamsters – one of the largest unions in the US, representing more than 1.3 million workers – controversiallydeclined to endorse a candidatein November’s presidential election. The union had endorsed every Democrat on the ticket since 2000.The Teamsters deferred comment to the O’Brien slate’s campaign. O’Brien and his campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.With O’Brien up for re-election next year, Hooker, the secretary-treasurer and principal officer of Teamsters Local 623 in Philadelphia, is leading a rivalslateof other union leadership candidates against O’Brien’s slate.The election will take place November 2026. Hooker’s campaign is currently gathering union signatures to make the ballot for the Teamsters national convention in June, where they will vie for5%of delegates to make the ballot for the November election.Born and raised a preacher’s son around Fayetteville, North Carolina, Hooker began working at UPS shortly after high school in 1999 while attending Drexel University. As a package handler at a UPS warehouse near Philadelphia international airport, he became disillusioned with union leadership as a shop steward with the Teamsters when grievances about their contract were dismissed.His bid to lead Local 623 came up short in 2016. But in 2020, the married father of fourbecamethe first Black man to ever lead the union, which represents workers at companies including UPS and Greyhound.Now Hooker is running to replace O’Brien at the top of one of the most influential unions in the US, due to frustrations over his decision to align with Trump, the 2023 UPS contract as UPS recentlyreportedcutting 48,000 jobs, and allegations of intimidation against criticizing O’Brien’s administration.View image in fullscreenRichard Hooker Jr, secretary-treasurer and principal officer of Teamsters Local 623, walks during a portrait in Philadelphia on 27 October.Photograph: Kriston Jae Bethel/The Guardian“You have your supposed leader flirting with someone who does not care if you have a pension – someone who does not care if you have healthcare, who does not care if you have the[National Labor Relations Board], if you have protect protections at the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] or[Occupational Safety and Health Administration],” said Hooker. “If you align yourself with someone who is OK with being in a relationship with that type of person, then they have no business being a labor leader, because what you’re doing is you’re putting your members and the rest of the working class in jeopardy.“I get the whole bipartisanship, I get working across the aisle. I get that. But when someone has a history of annihilating workers and the working class, then we have no business being with that person.”Hooker also wants the Teamsters to re-affiliate with the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US. He would be the first Black man to lead the union. He has already started to receive harassment after launching his campaign, including an anonymous voicemail left at his office earlier this week which used racist language.View image in fullscreenTeamsters Local 623 offices in Philadelphia on 27 October.Photograph: Kriston Jae Bethel/The GuardianRepublicans and Trump have oftencitedO’Brien inclaimsthat Republicans are making inroads with labor and the working class, including from the Republican senator Markwayne Mullin, whosparredwith O’Brien during a Senate hearing in 2023, but recentlyappearedon his podcast.Since Trump took office in January, the fallout from O’Brien’s relationship with Trump has intensified. Teamsters has also faced criticism for hiring Peter Cvjetanovic – whose face became a symbol of the 2017 Unite the Right white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia – for an administrative job at the union’s headquarters in Washington DC. Cvjetanovic was later reportedly fired.O’Brien has maintained regular communication with Trump throughout his presidency, heclaimedin an interview earlier this year with the Hollywood Reporter, while making several appearances on conservative media shows, including podcasts led byTucker Carlson,Megyn Kelly, andBari Weiss, where he said Trump’s presidency so far was “a solid B” grade for the Teamsters.Under O’Brien, Teamsters has alsosignificantly shiftedits political donations, pouring money into Republican congressional candidates and groups rather than predominantly Democrats.“What has the union got from Trump?

Even the president himself admitted to being surprised by the sweeping result.Jiménez argues that Milei needs more time. He said that, despite the setbacks, he voted for the president’s party because the opposition had “been in power too long and done too much harm”.Argentinians such as Jiménez, who are struggling to make ends meet, are now the majority.Aftertaking office in December 2023, Milei, an economist and former TV pundit, launched a deep “chainsaw” austerity plan, cutting federal spending, freezing wages and pensions, halting public works and slashing subsidies.To meet his zero-deficit target, he also introduced a “shock therapy” approach to the peso, initially devaluing it by almost 55%.On one hand, the libertarian managed to bring inflation down from more than 211% in 2023 to 32% annually by September 2025 – still high by global standards, but a level Argentinians had not seen in years.On the other hand, average incomes have fallen sharply, dragging down purchasing power, while household debt has risen and the poverty rate climbed above 50% before recently easing to 31.6%.View image in fullscreenA man walks past graffiti reading ‘Milei swindler’ in Buenos Aires.Photograph: Juan Mabromata/AFP/Getty ImagesNicolás Pedrosa, a 40-year-old mobile phone shop owner in Buenos Aires, voted for Milei in the 2023 presidential election. “Today, I deeply regret it … I wanted change, but it was too drastic,” he said.“The middle class no longer exists; you’re either poor or rich,” said Pedrosa, adding that customer traffic in his shop practically disappears by the 15th of the month as many people’s salaries have run out by then.Four months ago, in an attempt to diversify and boost sales, he started selling perfumes and incense alongside the usual phone cases and chargers. “You have to be an all-rounder to survive these days,” he said.After the initial devaluation of the peso, one of Milei’s main measures to curb inflation was burning through reserves to sell dollars and prop up the currency’s value – which, according to many analysts, has left the pesoartificially strong.To keep selling dollars, the president turned in April to a $20bn loan from the International Monetary Fund – $14bn of which has already been disbursed – and recently to a $40bn bailout from the US.The president has also lifted restrictions and lowered tariffs on imports, a move that is driving domestic industry into a “great depression”, according to Luciano Galfione, the president of Fundación Pro Tejer, which represents the textile sector.Textile manufacturers faced two problems, he said: as “the purchasing power of society has fallen dramatically”, people are buying fewer clothes, and those who can still afford them often opt for imported products, which, with the “cheap” dollar, have become more affordable.Even one of Argentina’s greatest passions is being affected. Domestic wine sales – which account for about 70% of production – fell by 17.1% in August, according to areportby the Center for Argentine Political Economy (CEPA). With the stronger peso, Argentine wine has also become more expensive abroad, and export volumes between January and August were down 8.4% from the same period last year.View image in fullscreenA protest against cuts to pensions and benefits at the Argentine National Congress in Buenos Aires, now a weekly demonstration.Photograph: Catriel Gallucci Bordoni/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“We’re not against imports; what we don’t agree with is having to compete under such absolute inequality,” said Galfione, who estimates the textile sector alone has lost 300 companies and 12,000 jobs since Milei took office.Across all sectors, between 205,000 and 250,000 formal jobs – those subject to labour laws – have been lost in Argentina over the same period, mostly in construction and manufacturing, and about 18,000 businesses have closed.“When formal jobs are lost, people have to find some way to earn an income to survive. And what usually happens is that informality increases,” said Roxana Maurizio, a professor of labour economics at the University of Buenos Aires, adding that informal workers now account for 43.2% of the labour force and that half of them don’t earn enough to get by.Despite most socioeconomic indicators showing no improvement in living standards, the “cheap” dollar, somewhat contained inflation, rejection of the opposition and fears of losing the US bailout were widely seen askey factors behind Milei’s victory.As a result, the president’s party went from a modest presence to the largest bloc when combined with the seats of the centre-right PRO, the party of former president Mauricio Macri, which has already allied itself with Milei.The bloc still falls short of the minimum majority needed to pass reforms, and the president already has three in mind – labour, tax and pensions – meaning Milei will have to seek further alliances.“He can’t fix the economy overnight when it’s been a mess for years,” said Jiménez. “I know people who are unhappy who voted for him [in 2023] and thought we were going to become a world power in a year, but he never said that.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But it’s easy to stand by your man when victory is in sight. A more significant rendition came at nil-nil, when the pressure was still firmly on and Dominik Szoboszlai had just squandered a glorious chance to punish the kind of lackadaisical defending that would ultimately prove Aston Villa’s downfall. Support for Slot was unequivocal when it mattered most.Slot hails ‘special’ Salah for reaching 250 goal Liverpool milestone in Aston Villa winRead moreLiverpool, the Premier League’s crisis club before kick-off after six defeats in seven games, sit third in the table after starting an important week with a deserved win against Villa. A first clean sheet in 11 games reflected a more controlled performance from thePremier Leaguechampions and, as Slot admitted, a change in fortune. Unai Emery’s team struck the woodwork twice when the game was delicately poised but would prove the perfect guests for a team and head coach in need of recovery.A terrible mistake by Emiliano Martínez presentedMohamed Salahwith his 250th Liverpool goal before more poor defending enabled Ryan Gravenberch to double the hosts’ advantage early in the second half. Slot was appreciative of both the personal backing and the collective endeavour needed to halt the slide. “It meant a lot,” he said of hearing his name. “Especially because it happened at nil-nil and not when we were leading or top of the league but in a difficult moment for me.”An incontrovertible factor in Liverpool’s dramatic slump had been their habit of conceding first and having to then take more risks while chasing the game. It almost happened for an eighth game in succession when Morgan Rogers split the home defence with a superb ball into Ollie Watkins. The Villa striker returned possession to his England colleague and he stepped across Conor Bradley to curl a shot towards the far corner. Giorgi Mamardashvili was well beaten in theLiverpoolgoal but Rogers’ effort struck the far post and rebounded clear.It was a reprieve that Slot’s side desperately needed with only five minutes on the clock and confidence low. It was also the cue for a highly entertaining, flowing contest. Both teams threatened repeatedly. Liverpool performed with far more aggression and urgency than of late with Szoboszlai a marauding presence again and Salah looking much sharper as he tormented Lucas Digne. Villa looked dangerous every time they broke the Liverpool press. They took some almighty risks to do so, however, and were close to gifting the champions the breakthrough twice before Martínez landed the visitors in it in first-half stoppage time.View image in fullscreenRyan Gravenberch fires home Liverpool’s second goal in the 58th minute.Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty ImagesThe Villa goalkeeper erred earlier in the game when dragging a poor clearance straight to Andy Robertson. He escaped on that occasion when the recalled left-back’s shot looped off Pau Torres and landed in his arms. Next up with a gift was Boubacar Kamara, who put Torres in trouble with a needless return pass that Szoboszlai intercepted with ease. The Liverpool midfielder found himself with only Martínez to beat but stroked a tame shot straight at him. A rare blemish on the Hungary captain’s night.Villa struck the woodwork a second time when Matty Cash made an ambitious attempt for Mamardashvili’s top corner. The right-back’s shot took a slight deflection off Virgil van Dijk before the Georgia international superbly tipped it on to the bar.Hugo Ekitiké had been anonymous at the head of Liverpool’s attack but, like all good strikers, made his first meaningful contribution count when heading Szoboszlai’s beautiful cross inside Martínez’s bottom corner. Liverpool celebrations, and attached sense of relief, were cut short, however, when the video assistant referee disallowed the header for a clear offside against Ekitiké. Liverpool celebrations, and attached sense of relief, soon flooded back thanks to Martínez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A quite dreadful ball went straight to Salah instead. The much-scrutinised striker made light work of his second goal in two games, sliding the ball around Torres and into an unguarded Villa net for the latest milestone in his phenomenal Liverpool career.To Emery’s despair, the Villa defence were not done with dangerous over-elaboration and presenting Liverpool with opportunity. Just before the hour Martínez squared another risky pass to Torres who, under pressure, swiped a clearance towards Van Dijk. Liverpool worked the ball to Gravenberch in space and the influential midfielder let fly from 20 yards with a shot that took a touch off both Ezri Konsa and Torres before beating the wrongfooted Villa keeper.Slot’s reaction, indeed the reaction of the Liverpool team and support, encapsulated the release of pressure.

During a brief postgame media session, he repeatedly deflected questions, responding several times with some version of “Go ask the coaching staff.”7ft 4in (at least) of menace: the Victor Wembanyama Era is already here | Lee EscobedoRead moreAt one point during the game, Morant appeared disengaged, even walking a few steps away from the bench area during a timeout in the second half. Asked afterward what went wrong, he again said, “Go ask them,” referring to the coaches. When pressed on whether he felt he should have played more, Morant replied: “According to them, probably don’t play me, honestly. That’s basically what the message was after. It’s cool.”Morant actually played eight minutes and 25 seconds in the fourth quarter – more than any other Memphis player – and logged 16 minutes and 11 seconds in the second half, second only to Jaren Jackson Jr. He missed all seven of his shots after halftime.The suspension is the latest in a string of disciplinary issues for the 25-year-old guard. Morant was suspended twice in 2023 for separate incidents involving firearms, which cost him 33 games and roughly $8.3 million in salary.The first was an eight-game ban after he appeared intoxicated while displaying a gun during a live stream from a Denver-area nightclub. Later that year, he was suspended 25 games for brandishing a firearm in a car during another live stream – despite prior assurances to the league that he would not repeat such behavior.Last season, Morant was fined $75,000 for making a gun-like hand gesture after hitting a three-pointer, which theNBAdeemed “inappropriate.” The league noted he had previously been warned that the gesture “could be interpreted in a negative light.”Morant, who is in the third year of a five-year, $197.2m contract, is averaging 20.8 points per game through six outings this season.Explore more on these topicsNBA CupMemphis GrizzliesLos Angeles LakersNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The trapped energy, the collisions. The sense of something always but never really happening.Oh yes. Watching the full 90 minutes of Chelsea’s narrow but still comfortable 1-0 defeat of Tottenham was like staring at one of those hypnotic drunken city centre brawls that appear on social media from time to time, where nothing ever really seems to start or stop, where the whole thing is just a kind of tortured flailing, but one that must also be pored over endlessly in the comments.João Pedro ends goal drought as Chelsea earn narrow victory at TottenhamRead moreA man in a red hoodie is doing air kung fu kicks. Haymakers are being thrown at no one in particular. Someone falls through a fire door. Yellow-jacketed man tries to break it up, wanders off, comes back waving a bin lid. It is undeniably mesmerising. Energy of some kind is definitely being expended. But you can’t help thinking if only someone could actually land a blow, just one, they could put the whole thing to bed pretty quickly.It was fitting it should be Moisés Caicedo who provided that moment of incision atTottenham HotspurStadium. Not just because he was the best player on the pitch, but because this was also a game that might have been designed just to showcase his own extreme skillset, the king of broken play, the Maradona of the crash tackle.It was also fitting the goal was made by counterpressing, the only effective creative element on the pitch. And fitting in a poor Spurs performance that it should be Xavi Simons who made the vital mistake. Simons is a good passer, but was basically chased, harried and generally beaten up during his time on the pitch. There are games, styles, formations that will suit the very specific talents of Simons. Spurs offered none of those things here.Simons it was who gave a short pass to Micky van de Ven close to his own goal. Cue Caicedo, all over it like a one man zombie horde, walking through challenges, lunges, blocks. The ball eventually bobbled to João Pedro, who put it away.Caicedo was excellent here. He is remarkably strong and utterly focused on protecting and using the ball. In stoppage time at the end of 90 minutes he took the ball from Mohammed Kudus, was bumped over three times, got up, sprawled back down windmilling to win it back, a footballer who always seems to be bursting through windows, leaping across ravines, his own one-man Indiana Jones-style chase scene.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank tries to urge his team on but Tottenham had a day to forget.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAOtherwise, well what? Perhaps this game can be added to the list of things that demand Mikel Arteta has NO EXCUSES if Arsenal don’t win the league. Certainly watching this kind of thing it becomes clearer why Arsenal are so good, so coherent, so settled, so free of glitches by comparison.Tottenham Hotspur Stadium had been a feverish, bitty, gusty kind of place at kick-off. And from the start this was like a chess match, just not a very good chess match, a chess match where neither team had any knights or a queen.Thomas Frank bobbed up repeatedly, a little fraught from the start, waving a notepad, whirling his arms, looking as ever like a legendary pan-European warehouse rave impresario glimpsed furiously chewing gum in the VIP section of an Oslo jam factory all-nighter.Strange things kept happening. Lucas Bergvall had to be dragged off the pitch after suffering a concussion early on. Somebody threw two empty Jack Daniel’s hotel miniatures on to the pitch as Kevin Danso was preparing to take a throw. Six minutes after coming on midway through the second half, Jamie Gittens could be seen calling urgently for something from the Chelsea bench. Finally a pair of gloves was hurled on to the field. He pulled them on urgently. At that point he had touched the ball exactly zero times.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Players and fans took great pleasure in winning this, the most pissy and spiky of all not-quite-local London derbies. The team showed spirit and will. The real takeaway was what this game said about Tottenham, and about the state of the league in general.Spurs could have gone second had they won. It is clearly a false position. This is a half-finished construction site of a team, a pile of sticks leaning against a wall, some plasterboard, some abandoned paint brushes.Salah and Gravenberch secure welcome win for Liverpool against Aston VillaRead moreHere Spurs were just really poor. They seemed always to be passing backwards. Even the set pieces were confused. But then Frank is being asked to create something coherent out of the leftovers of discontinued regimes, and a squad that looks short on talent, all the while playing three games a week.Clearly something isn’t quite right. There seemed to be communication issues between Frank’s staff and the players at times, even between the manager and his players at the end. But Frank is also in a very strange situation, in charge of a team that going into the match were third in the league, but also under pressure to find a way of playing, of winning at home, of generating attacking patterns.The entire setup is unforgivably vague. Here is a club that have had six people calling themselves the head coach in the last five and a half years, that have cartwheeled around making odd signings – £110m this summer on two very standard attackers – all the while constructing a world-class ground in which to stage events to pay back the debt on their world-class ground. What kind of team are they expecting to have at the end of this? A settled one? One with a clear sense of identity and purpose?You might also ask why the Premier League so often does this to itself. Why does any functioning team have to emerge through a fug of incoherence, bodged planning, zigzagging strategy? Imagine if these hugely wealthy and powerful sports clubs could be run coherently, just for a while. This was a meeting of the most expensively assembled squad in world football against the team with the best stadium in the world. It didn’t exactly look like it.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But an air of unpredictability lingers over the five boroughs, with hopefuls humbled, and favorites frustrated, as they embark on a challenging 26.2-mile tour of the city.“I’m really scared,” Olympic champion Sifan Hassan, who has won the London, Chicago and Sydney marathons, told reporters on Friday. Throughout her life, she said, people have told her that New York – which she is about to race for the first time – is “so hard”.The New York City Marathon’s real heroes finish after dark | Callum JonesRead moreHassan will headline Sunday’s race alongside Eliud Kipchoge, often hailed as the greatest marathoner of all time, who is also making his debut in the city. Both ran the Sydney marathon, which Hassan won, just nine weeks ago.New York City is no place for world records, or meticulously-crafted race plans. On the first Sunday of November, a blank canvas is stretched around the world’s biggest stage. At the front of a 55,000-strong pack of runners, expectations quickly fall by the wayside.Some World Major marathons, like Chicago and Berlin, are famously flat and fast. New York, with five bridges along the course and an undulating finale through Central Park, is an altogether different beast.Fiona O’Keeffe was not interested in chasing records or beating the clock this time around. “What I was looking for this fall was just a really competitive race,” she explained in an interview. “Racing is the fun part of what we do.”And so, early on Sunday, O’Keeffe will line up among a stacked elite field on Staten Island with an open mind. “Anything can happen on race day,” she said.When it comes to the marathon, few know this better. In February 2024 O’Keeffe won the US Olympic Trials with astunning debutthat raised high hopes for the Games last summer. She wasforced to withdrawabout a mile into the race in Paris, however; scans would later reveal a femoral stress fracture.“It’s just interesting – having experienced the very high-high of the trials, and then obviously my Olympic experience was pretty rough,” O’Keeffe told the Guardian. “So I think I’ve seen both sides of the coin now.”View image in fullscreenEliud Kipchoge and Sifan Hassan both ran the Sydney marathon, which Hassan won, just nine weeks ago.Photograph: Fairfax Media“The sport is simple,” she added. “I really do love to run. And I’m so grateful for the people that have supported me through all of this. So [I’m] kind of just leaning into that side of it, more than dwelling on, you know, what it could have been.”Spanning almost 15 months later, the road back has been long. Training with the Puma Elite Running Team in Raleigh, North Carolina, O’Keeffe did not want to return to the marathon until she was back at her best.“I expect it to be a tough race, but I’m excited for that,” she said. “I’m excited to see how it plays out and how it unfolds and see what can happen if I just keep putting myself in it, and trusting myself when those moves do happen.”O’Keeffe and Hassan, who won the Sydney marathon just nine weeks ago, will face strong competition in the elite women’s field. Former champions Sheila Chepkirui, Sharon Loekdi and Hellen Obiri will also toe the line. A strong American contingent includes Olympic bronze medalist Molly Seidl, Emily Sisson and Susanna Sullivan, fresh off a strong performance at September’s world championships in Tokyo.The men’s field, led by Kipchoge, likewise includes plenty of contenders, including former champions Abdi Nageeye and Albert Korir; 2024 Olympic bronze medalist Benson Kipruto; and Alexander Mutiso, who won the LondonMarathonlast year. The Americans Hillary Bor and Joe Klecker will also both make their respective marathon debuts.View image in fullscreenRunners get drinks at a hydration station as they compete in last year’s New York City Marathon.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/AFP/Getty Images“I always thought being in the stadium, with the track races, was the biggest thing in our sport,” said Britain’s Patrick Dever, who previously focused on the 5,000m and 10,000m, and will make his marathon debut on Sunday. “But after having been around these major marathons, you realize how much of a spectacle they are.”Dever, who, like O’Keeffe, trains with Puma Elite, has been steeling himself for the longer distance. “You’re just out there for such a longer period of time, so you just have way more time in your own head to talk yourself out of it, or keep yourself calm,” he said. “The biggest thing I’ve been trying to work on in these long runs is just not panicking in my head a little bit if things aren’t feeling right.“I feel like I’m fully prepared, going into the race, knowing that it’s for sure not going to feel good the whole way. There’s going to be periods in the race where I’ll probably want to drop out. I feel like you just have to be okay with that, and just try not to pay attention to how you’re feeling at any one point.”New Yorkers will turn out in force to cheer, amplifying the highs and cushioning the lows, as tens of thousands of runners – from first-timers and fundraisers to big dreamers and distinguished veterans – parade through the city.Kipchoge has two Olympic and 11 World Major marathon titles, and remains the only person to haverun the distance in less than two hours. He is running New York City amid speculation that he is preparing to retire from elite marathoning, and has trailed a “huge announcement” after the race.“I want to experience, I want to go through it,” Kipchoge told reporters. “I want to actually see the two million people who are lining up around the course. I want to pass all the bridges in New York, the best places in New York – actually to see, with my eyes, wave to the people. This is the best city, where everything is here.”Explore more on these topicsNew York City MarathonMarathonMarathon runningAthleticsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Giorgi Mamardashvili leaves his goal and sidefoots into touch. The sense of expectation is palpable. Michael Kayode trots over from right-back to the opposite flank to take the throw-in. He dries the ball, measures his run, steps back and then in one languid fluid movement hurls the ball in to the near post. Liverpool clear. Two minutes later, it happens again. This time, Mamardashvili tries to play the ball to Bradley, who miscontrols to concede the throw-in. And this time, Kayode’s throw is flicked on by Kristoffer Ajer and volleyed home by Dango Ouattara. There are still only five minutes of Brentford’s game against Liverpool played. Welcome to the modernPremier League.Only nine of the 241 goals scored in the Premier League going into this weekend have come from throw-ins, but it feels like far more. Forty-five have come from corners – 18.7%. Were that proportion to be maintained over the season it would present a remarkable leap on the high of 14.2% from 2010-11. The reality is there’s likely to be a regression to the mean: if a glance at the proportion of goals scored from corners shows anything, it’s that there really isn’t much of a pattern at all. The proportion hovered at 11 or 12% most years to 2009, since when it has been at 13-14% – a trend which, if anything, goes against the assumption that everybody stopped taking corners seriously in the peak years ofguardiolismoonly to rediscover their love of a booming inswinger last season (when, in fact, the proportion of goals from corners fell to its lowest level since 2013-14).Football Daily | Tactics derived from AI? ‘The algorithms are watching’Read moreYet something is clearly going on. To watchArsenal’s win over Crystal Palacefollowed byReal Madrid’s victory against Barcelonalast Sunday was to witness two extremely different interpretations of the sport (although even in Spain, just under 14% of goals this season have come from set plays). The suddenness of the change in the approach in England has been remarkable, all the more so for how evident it is among elite sides. It’s as though the past two decades of patient approach work, controlling the game through possession, have been swept away, an unfortunate phase English football went through and now regrets. It seems barely believable that the game allowed itself for a time to be convinced by the early data boffins that set plays weren’t really that important, that fans were misguided in their excitement at a corner.It turns out that if teams weren’t regularly creating chances from set plays, they were just doing them wrong. But even if this is in effect English football growing out of its gap-year affectations, snuffing out the joss sticks and putting the beads and the kaftan back in the drawer, it’s still worth asking why it’s done so now, and what it may mean for the future.View image in fullscreenEmiliano Martínez appeals for a foul as Tottenham swing in a corner against Aston Villa.Photograph: John Patrick Fletcher/Action Plus/ShutterstockTo an extent this is an evolution of the influence of data. Corners are fixed points, much easier to analyse and control than the chaotic fluidity of open play. Runs, feints and blocking moves can be rehearsed in training and repeated to order in games. It may even be that set plays represent the most efficient way to break down a low block, which elite sides have increasingly found themselves facing as the financial inequalities within the game make it less and less feasible for the majority of opponents to take them on in open play.But it’s also to do with circumstance. In January, Pep Guardiola acknowledged that Bournemouth, Brighton and Newcastle were at the cutting edge of the game. “Modern football,” he said, “is not positional, you have to ride the rhythm.” That was widely taken as meaning that runners were essential, an acceptance that hisjuego de posiciónhad become predictable. But his broader point was that the packed modern calendar meant there was such a toll on players, so little time to recover, that the precise planning required for his preferred style had become impossible.What is possible, though, is planning set pieces, something Mikel Arteta seems to have recognised before anybody else. Arsenal have scored seven goals from corners this season, more than anybody else in the Premier League; that represents 44% of their total, a higher proportion than anybody else.Is this, then, the future? Is this what football is to be, a series of set plays – throw-ins or corners, the odd free-kick – interspersed with brief passages of action? One of the most obvious effects of earlyguardiolismowas the return of the diminutive technical midfielder. Barcelona may persist with Pedri and Fermín López, Liverpool are doing their best with Florian Wirtz and Alexis Mac Allister, but is the future of midfielders for them to be hulking figures, grafters and tacklers who may be able to get on the end of a corner?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s more than 40 years since the notoriously athletic former West Germany international Hans-Peter Briegel was declared the footballer of the future, but the sport still accommodates a range of heights and shapes. Tactical styles come and go.Guardiolismois in retreat in the face of the set-piece orthodoxy, but a new challenge will arise.Football over its history has proved remarkably flexible and resilient; unlike, say, rugby union or hockey, it has very rarely needed law changes to resolve tactical issues.The International Football Association Board, concerned by a fall in ball-in-play time as players prepare for long throws, isconsidering a 30-second limiton taking a throw (although if this is a decision based on entertainment, it’s arguable that Brentford fans derive more pleasure from the anticipation of Kayode than they would from a quickly taken throw that leads to the ball being lost) but the reality is that defenders will probably work out a way of clearing throws – which may even be as simple as picking centre-backs for how well they can mark and head rather than their range of passing – and the present trend will fade away.Football exists in a state of constant evolution. After the possession-heavy years ofguardiolismo, the game as an exercise of strategy and technique, this season has brought a reversion to something more physical.

Instead they are just making them favourites for thePremier Leaguecrown after extending their lead at the top. The Gunners have reached such a level of expertise, they even scored from a Burnley long throw.Headers from Viktor Gyökeres and Declan Rice were the difference on a straightforward afternoon in Lancashire forArsenal. The hosts failed to have a shot on target as Arsenal secured a seventh win in a row without conceding in all competitions, a statistic that will strike fear into the heart of their rivals.Tottenham v Chelsea: Premier League – liveRead more“It’s a really tough place to come, they’d lost once in 18 months [at Turf Moor] against Liverpool in the last kick of the game by a penalty,” Mikel Arteta said. “We started the game exceptionally well. I think the first half is one of the best that we’ve played; scored two goals, generated another two or three big chances and conceded nothing.”“Set piece again, olé olé,” was the chant ringing out from the away end after a tough start against a high-energyBurnleyside. Rice swung the corner to the back post from where Gabriel Magalhães knocked the ball back to the centre of the goal and Gyökeres, who would have to go off injured at half-time, nodded in from a yard for Arsenal’s 12th set-piece goal in the Premier League this season.“The goal took the wind out of us a little bit,” Scott Parker said. “It was a set-play goal that we worked a lot this week. But it took the edge off of us a little bit and then the second goal as well.”From this point, Arsenal dominated possession. Every corner award resulted in a roar from the travelling fans and a tense moment of silence from the majority, worried about what would come. Great efforts were made to keep Martin Dubravka from getting off his line to claim and he did well punch one Rice inswinger away from under the bar as the pressure increased.Burnley were unable to make it a contest, keeping 11 men behind the ball to make life as difficult as possible. Dubravka did well against Bukayo Saka, when the winger was through one-on-one, to ensure the lead was not doubled.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice shows his delight after making it 2-0.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesArsenal were beginning to open Burnley up, tiring them out from having so much of the ball, with Saka and Eberechi Eze providing the speed to make the most of the gaps. Saka saw another opportunity repelled by Dubravka and Leandro Trossard had the rebound blocked on the line. Burnley were holding on and working hard to do so.The second Gunners goal did come from a long throw, it just happened to be a Burnley one. Arsenal cleared the ball and countered quickly, ending with Trossard clipping to the onrushing Rice to finally give Dubravka no chance, breaking the hosts’ spirit in the process.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The atmosphere was subdued, accepting of their second Premier League home defeat since promotion, knowing their survival will not be decided by the visit of the likes of Arsenal. “They’re just a very, very good team,” said Parker. “They’re a team that I believe have every single ingredient to go and win the league this year.”There was no great urgency from Arsenal to find a third and they were happy to cede possession to Burnley, maybe with an eye on Tuesday’s trip to Slavia Prague. Arsenal were able to stroll through the second half, with Rice in control of midfield, rightly confident Burnley did not have the quality to break them down on their way to yet another shut out. “If we play with that desire, with that focus, with that discipline, we will win a lot of games,” Arteta said.Arsenal have never lost here in the Premier League and their latest victory showed Arteta’s machine is able to navigate difficult trips without concern.

His side came close to winning, but Dyche was left angered afterManchester Unitedscored the opener from a corner awarded by the assistant referee Akil Howson on the far side of the pitch. Replays showed it was unclear whether the Forest full-back Nicolò Savona kept the ball in play.Dyche was booked for his protests in defeatlast Sunday at Bournemouth, where Marcus Tavernier scored directly from a corner. Here, Casemiro headed in one taken by Bruno Fernandes to earn United a first-half lead.Forest rallied, scoring twice in 102 second-half seconds, but Amad Diallo’s stunning volley ensured the post-match discourse was dominated by the award of a 33rd-minute corner. “I just can’t understand it, you’re an assistant referee and 70-odd yards away, you’ve got a goal and a net in the way, but apparently you can see,” Dyche said.“I’ve got a better view and I’m not in the right position. That’s got to be wrong in the current climate. I’m a big fan of VAR. Someone has got to be able to overrule these decisions, just really quickly, [it would take] only five seconds.“For me, that’s five seconds of VAR: ‘Bang, that’s it, done, wrong decision.’ It is really, really frustrating two weeks on the trot.

I want to be talking about my team.”The damage for Forest could have been even worse had Murillo, after Matthijs de Ligt kept alive another corner, not made a miraculous goalline intervention to prevent Diallo from snatching victory in the third of at least five minutes of second-half stoppage time.

The boisterous Igor Jesus challenged for a high ball in the area, getting the better of three United black shirts, and then the ball broke.Savona was hungrier than Diogo Dalot and the Italian controlled the ball with the studs of his left boot before prodding in. Benjamin Sesko put the ball back on the spot as Forest savoured the moment and it took a while for United to return to life.Forest pushed for a third goal, Hudson-Odoi and Igor Jesus sending efforts wide, but United stayed alive and Diallo produced a stunning equaliser. Fernandes earlier hit a post with a clever effort from distance and it spoke volumes that Amorim admitted United would have lost this game last season, suggesting his team has discovered a valuable “big-team” mentality.“In the past, if we had this kind of bad five minutes and suffered two goals, we didn’t recover,” he said. “Today it is a different feeling. You can sense that. We could not win this game but we were not going to lose … that is a feeling that a big team sometimes has to have.“We had a big opportunity to win in the end and my feeling is we dropped two points here and should’ve done better.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestManchester UnitedSean DycheRuben Amorimmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Earps, who retired from international football before the summer’s European Championship, described a breakdown in the relationship between the two goalkeepers and with the Lionesses’ manager, which led to her telling Wiegman thatshe was rewarding “bad behaviour”by recalling Hampton.Mary Earps: ‘I don’t look back with bad blood. It worked out well for everybody’Read more“I think Hannah is fine,” Bompastor said. “It’s tough because Hannah is an athlete but also a person and it is never nice to hear these comments. The only thing I want to say about Hannah is that, since I joined Chelsea, she has grown so much. She’s such a professional athlete and also a good person. We have a really good relationship together and I want to show her my support in this situation.”The Chelsea manager continued: “I just feel like with what I read in terms of comments coming fromMary Earps, it is not acceptable not to show respect to your teammate or your manager. We are talking about Hannah but I am also raising my voice for Sarina. I just think when you use some words saying something about someone who won the European Championship three times in a row, you should probably think about it before you speak. Hannah has been fine with us and all the club, myself, the staff and the players are all behind her.“If you look at what Hannah said in the previous comments about Mary Earps then what Mary is saying about her now, one of them is class and Hannah is the class one.”Despite the furore, the Chelsea goalkeeper was predictably named in the lineup, as she has been for every league game this season. Bompastor made just two changes for their last match against Paris FC, with Lucy Bronze and Ellie Carpenter both coming back into the fold.View image in fullscreenEllie Carpenter jumps into the arms of Sandy Baltimore after giving Chelsea an early lead.Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesThey were coming up against a confident but not complacent London City Lionesses who are enjoying an impressive start to their first WSL season. This was not the first time Jocelyn Prêcheur has faced Bompastor on the sidelines and he will have been well aware of the challenge that faced his team. Finding stability and consistency has been key for Prêcheur and with the owner, Michele Kang, watching, it was the perfect opportunity to see how they can perform against the country’s top side.London City made a slow start and fell behind inside six minutes. Chelsea issued an early warning when Erin Cuthbert pounced on a lax pass from Wassa Sangaré. The defender recovered brilliantly to block the shot but it was a sign of what was to come.Quick GuideManchester City 1-0 West HamShowManchester City extended their winning run to six matches with a 1-0 victory over West Ham to keep the pressure on Chelsea at the top of the Women's Super League. Aoba Fujino opened the scoring in the first half before Gracie Prior struck the crossbar in the second period.West Ham stay rooted to the foot of the table having lost all seven of their matches, and have now failed to score in four straight games.City dominated throughout at the Joie Stadium and took a deserved lead with 26 minutes gone. Shelina Zadorsky lost the ball to Vivianne Miedema who drove towards the visitors' area before playing in Fujino who struck first time.Rehanne Skinner's struggling side came close to drawing level just 10 minutes later when Viviane Asseyi's shot clipped the top of the bar.Prior nearly doubled City's advantage in the 70th minute when she rose highest to meet Yui Hasegawa's free-kick only for her header to hit the bar before Miedema inadvertently blocked Fujino's follow-up.Laura Blindkilde Brown wasted another good opportunity for the hosts with 10 minutes remaining before Khadija Shaw snatched at a chance in the closing stages.PA MediaPhotograph: John Clifton/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There was a rare start for Guro Reiten and the 31-year-old was integral to the opening goal when Sandy Baltimore ran on to her sweeping pass out to the left.

Freya Godfrey registered the visitors’ first shot on target early on and Goodwin had yet more opportunities while Aggie Beever-Jones and Nathalie Björn came close.Chelsea consolidated their victory in the closing stages asSam Kerrmarked her league return to Stamford Bridge in style.

        "Content": "Mary Earps. Photograph: Laura Stevens/The Guardian; Hair and make up: Constance HaondFormer England goalkeeper reveals full story behind her international retirement, her problems with eating and alcohol, and why she’d struggle on The TraitorsRead an exclusive extract from Mary Earps’ bookByDonald McRaeSat 1 Nov 2025 06.00 EDTShare“I’ve learned a lot about what truly matters in life,”Mary Earpssays on a quiet and cloudy afternoon as, at Paris Saint-Germain’s training centre on the outskirts of the French capital, the former England goalkeeper reflects on the achievements and drama of her last five years. “My life has accidentally come into the court of public opinion. People talking about your performance comes with the territory but when it starts to become about your character, and assumptions people make about you, that can be really, really challenging.”Between 2020 and 2023 Earps overcame depression, a drinking problem, eating issues, won the Euros with England, forced Nike to change their attitude to female goalkeepers, saved a penalty in a World Cup final and wonthe BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year.Since then she has been surprised by Sarina Wiegman, England’s manager, recalling Hannah Hampton after previouslyremoving the young keeper from the squad. Earps believes Hampton’s attitude and behaviourdisrupted the harmonious atmosphereamong the goalkeepers before England won the Euros in 2022. She felt let down and describes Wiegman’s usual clarity and direct communication becoming opaque and distant as the manager wavered over selecting Earps or Hampton.Mary Earps extract: ‘I felt sick and anxious. Then came the words I’d waited 12 months to hear’Read moreAmid turmoil and distress Earpsretired from international footballthis year. She then faced “multiple character assassinations” from people who assumed her ego could not bear being replaced as England’s No 1.Earps stayed silent while she watched England win the Euros this summer, withHampton playing a starring role, and she has now found peace without international football.“At first I found it difficult because of this great sense of injustice I have,” Earps says with a light laugh that belies the strength of her feelings. “I was like: ‘Gosh, I can’t believe this is what people think about me. It’s so far from the truth.’ Sometimes it made me question myself: ‘Is that really how I am?’ But now I try to have as much of a thick skin as I can. I don’t think you survive without it.”Earps’snew autobiography, serialised in the Guardian, is a deep cut above the usual sporting celebrity book. It is stark, authentic and crammed with startling revelations. When I ask her which parts of the book make her feel the most emotional Earps says: “Those pages about being bullied …”As “the girl who played football” she “was often alone”. On one occasion a girl who was two years older than Earps, instructed a friend to “slap her”. Earps fought back “and they chased me round the school till I found sanctuary in the PE department office. It was horrifying.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps in happier times with England, after the victory over Sweden at Bramall Lane during Euro 2022.Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty ImagesShe was sustained by her family and a burning obsession to become a great goalkeeper. Earps also grew used to the harsh coaching regime at junior England camps where, during one-on-one sessions, “I felt like the sole ambition was to make me cry.”Coaches also made casual remarks about her weight with numbing regularity. Earps felt isolated until, in later years, some of her England teammates shared similarly jarring experiences.“The world has changed,” she asserts calmly. “It just wouldn’t happen now. But it’s a part of who I am and with me struggling at school, and never feeling liked or accepted, [the remarks about her weight] really compounded that. It definitely amplified a thing in my head of never being good enough. That [knocks] your self-esteem as a young person.”The book captures Earps living alone, “with death counts mounting”, during the first Covid lockdown, “shovelling down biscuits instead of meals” and binge-drinking vodka.She was “annihilating my fitness” and her worry “about being big and bulky was back with an angry vengeance.”Was she scared? “I don’t think I had enough energy to be concerned for myself. That probably sounds really ugly but I was navigating a very difficult and dark time. I don’t look back and recognise that person, who didn’t have any zest for life. I’m just grateful I found my way out because not everybody does.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps saves Jenni Hermoso’s penalty in the 2023 Women’s World Cup final in Sydney.Photograph: Australian Associated Press/AlamyEarps is warm and often amusing company and it seems incongruous we should discuss such painful memories when she remains one of the world’s best and most highly paid female keepers. “I try to speak honestly because in social media everything looks glitz and glamour all the time. We should be open and have that sense of humanity and community the world is losing.”She never came close to trying to take her life but Earps admits she thought of how she might end it. This happened, she says, “more often than I would have liked”.Two years later Earpswould be the best goalkeeper at the Eurosand help England win the tournament. Another year on, in 2023, she won the Golden Glove at the World Cup – where Englandlost to Spain in the final. Earpsalso stood up to Nikewhen the corporate giant failed to make her goalkeeper’s jersey available as a replica kit. It appeared to be institutionalised sexism and Earps says: “I just recognised something wrong and I’ve got a really strong sense of injustice.”She smiles. “I always feel like I’m sticking my head above the parapet – it’s a recurring theme. It’s about being unapologetically myself and standing up for what I believe in.”At a pre-World Cup media day she was asked about Nike’s lack of interest in female goalkeepers. Her replysparked a campaignwhich forced the company to apologise and make amends. “My proudest achievement is not the result,” Earps says. “It’s the fact I had the courage to answer honestly. The alternative, which seems crazy, was to say nothing. Or I could have complained to Nike privately and nothing would have happened. But because I answered the question, the public pressure and my performances created this change.”Earps’s transformation from her lowest point had been helped enormously by Wiegman’s arrival as England manager in 2021. She felt trusted by Wiegman who made her feel “invincible” while “she constructively tried to always challenge me. I felt like I could be honest while she always had my back.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps and her England teammates interrupt Sarina Wiegman’s press conference after the win over Germany in the Euro 2022 final at Wembley.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Uefa/Getty ImagesIn 2022, Earps writes: “Sarina took absolutely no nonsense when it came to bad behaviour and created a culture where it would be addressed head-on to the point of isolating or removing people from the camp who wouldn’t adhere … Non-collegiate behaviour was not tolerated. We came back to the news that Hannah had been dropped from the squad: her behaviour behind the scenes at the Euros had frequently risked derailing training sessions and team resources. ”Earps describes how Wiegman “would stand in front of everyone and say: ‘This is the situation. This is why this person is not training. This person needs to be managed.’ That gave everyone real clarity.”I ask Earps to offer some examples of how Hampton, allegedly, undermined the “collegiate” atmosphere. “I don’t want to go into the specifics because it’s not my place. I don’t want to speak badly about anybody else either. But unfortunately this played a part in my Euros experience and England situation.”Pressed to explain more, Earps says: “I think we had different ideas of what being a teammate should be. I think there was a mismatch, a misalignment, of values.”Did Earps discuss her misgivings with Hampton? “There was a lot of conversation and a lot of effort to try and [change] the situation. I took my role as a leader very seriously and always wanted the goalkeeper group to be as harmonious as possible. I’d experienced non-harmonious goalkeeper groups and didn’t feel that brought the best out of people. I have a real affinity for goalkeepers … and I can’t speak highly enough of [Ellie] Roebuck and the way she helped me at the Euros. She messaged me yesterday to say I should go on The Traitors. I told her I’d be a terrible traitor because I’m a terrible liar.“You’ve got to give a lot of credit to Roebuck because [as the former No 1] she could have been awful to me. She could have been an arsehole – pardon the French. But she wasn’t. It not just about what she gave me, but also what she gave the team. It’s a really tricky role and she did it incredibly well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I wish that it wasn’t, but I genuinely wish her and the team well. She is a very good goalkeeper and I’ve tried to draw a line under all that. I have messaged her privately to say: ‘Look, no bad blood.’”Her relationship with Wiegman deteriorated after the manager’sturn towards Hampton. Wiegman said “everyone deserves a second chance” but it was troubling to Earps that the atmosphere towards her became “neutral” and far less communicative than before. The unspoken changes left Earps feeling “like a frog that had been placed in tepid water with the heat gradually turned up”.Earps details “an energy shift” between her and Wiegman. “It felt like something was off. You can’t put your finger on it and there’s nothing majorly wrong, like no one’s speaking to you in a crazy way or being mean to you. But you just feel this isn’t how it used to be.”Wiegman appeared to have lost her usual clarity and direct way of communicating and, Earps says: “It was an unusual experience for me and also the squad. It was difficult for everybody.”I wanted to look back and celebrate. We both could have done that. It caused unnecessary bad feeling for no reasonEarps on Sarina WiegmanThe manager finally explained that Hampton’s distribution skills were superior but she told Earps she wouldn’t accept her retirement. Earps agreed reluctantly to stay for the Euros only to revert to her original decision when she concluded that Wiegman no longer followed her closely at PSG.If Wiegman had been transparent at the outset would Earps have remained with the squad? “I don’t know how those conversations would have gone. But a big dynamic at play was making the situation untenable.”In a public statement Wiegman said she was disappointed in Earps. She also had to be nudged by Lucy Bronze to say a few words when Earps left the squad. “I don’t think you should get into who’s right and who’s wrong,” Earps says. “We’d had a relationship that spanned the best part of four years. I still have a tremendous amount of respect [for Wiegman].”Earps “felt like I’d been trudging and troopering on, and I’d been so vulnerable, at times in tears. I just wanted to look back and celebrate what had been. We both could have done that. It caused unnecessary bad feeling for no reason.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps found the knockout stages of the Euros ‘difficult to watch, but I genuinely loved it’. Photograph: Laura Stevens/The Guardian; Hair and makeup: Constance HaondShe sounds composed and without bitterness: “The manager always has the right to make whatever decision for the greater good of the team. Ultimately, she’s won three back-to-back Euros and is incredibly successful. I don’t look back with bad blood. I can give my point of view but also give credit where it’s due. It worked out well for everybody. The team went on and won the second Euros back-to-back, an incredible achievement. Sarina won her third, and I took care of myself mentally and physically and chose to end my international career on my terms, a little bit.”Earps foundthe knockout stages of the Euros“difficult to watch, but I genuinely loved it. I’ve got fantastic friends there, friends I hope remain for the rest of my life. It feels like family.”She also negotiated painful terrain with her own family. During the last World Cup she made a strong decision to support her partner, Kitty, who overheard Earps’s parents talking dubiously about their relationship. Kitty lives with Earps in Paris and the goalkeeper’s face lights up: “She’s tells me the unadulterated truth. She’s a great person to have in my corner.”Did her parents struggle with Earps’s sexuality? “Definitely at the beginning there were elements of that. People make mistakes and hurt you – but the strength of relationships comes from navigating those moments. We talked and worked through it.”I feel very lucky that I live in such a beautiful place after all I’ve been throughMary Earps on life in ParisEarps has frozen her eggs, in the hope of becoming a mother one day, as she wants to play for PSG as long as she can. She loves Paris and rocks in delight: “I call the Eiffel Tower ‘Eileen’ and get so excited.”Come on, Eileen? “Exactly. That’s what I say to her when she’s about to start flashing. I feel very lucky that I live in such a beautiful place after all I’ve been through, the highs and lows. You get caught up in that and in chasing the next trophy and next objective. I still have that hunger to achieve so much at such a fantastic club but you take stock and think: ‘Wow, isn’t this a beautiful, beautiful city?’ It’s given me a different perspective on the urgency of life.”Earps cackles. “I’m 32 now, don’t look a day over 18! I’m going to play as long as I can, because I bloody love this game.”Serenity, as much as certainty, courses through her now. “This is a real home away from home. It’s a really relaxed lifestyle and I can focus on football and maximise every last bit of potential I have in me before, unfortunately, the legs give out.”Earps looks up and, after a thoughtful pause, she says: “Every season is sacred now.”Mary Earps: All In by Mary Earps (Bonnier Books, £22).

The sale of the Championship club is being managed by the administrator Begbies Traynor, which was appointed last month to run Wednesday by the owner, Dejphon Chansiri, as an alternative to liquidation after he failed to pay players and staff on time in five of the past seven months.In documentation circulated to potential buyers last week, Begbies Traynor demanded they demonstrate access to £50m in proof of funds in order to be considered, but the sale itself is an open auction with the ultimate price determined by the level of the bids. Ashley is understood to have provided sufficient proof of funding to enter the process, enabling him to begin conducting due diligence and giving him access to Wednesday’s accounts and data room.Championship: managers under fire as Norwich, Leicester and Saints slumpRead moreThe 61-year-old has the advantage of being known to the EnglishFootball Leaguemeaning, if a sale price is agreed by Begbies Traynor, it would likely approve the transaction quickly as there are no questions over the source and sufficiency of his funding.Ashley has not been directly involved in football sinceselling Newcastle to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fundfour years ago, although he did buy Coventry’s CBS Arena the following year, which he subsequently sold back to the club for £40m this summer, more than double the purchase price.Ashley has made no secret of his strategy of targeting distressed sporting assets, with Wednesday undoubtedly fitting this profile. The Frasers Group director previouslyheld talks with Derbyand Reading when they were facing financial difficulties in recent years before their sales to Nigel Clowes and Rob Couhig respectively.Ashley will face competition for Wednesday, which is likely to drive up the price, with Kris Wigfield of Begbies Traynor saying this week: “There are already four or five interested parties that look like the real deal.” One of them is believed to be the American billionaire John McEvoy, who holds minority stakes in the National Hockey League team Nashville Predators and Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies, while there is also interest from at least one British and one other American group.View image in fullscreenThe lettering of Dehphon Chansiri’s name has been removed from the stands at Hillsborough.Photograph: James Holyoak/PABegbies Traynor, which has previously sold Bolton, Wiganand the rugby union club Worcester Warriors, is targeting a quick sale, but under EFL rules Wednesday have to remain on the market for at least 28 days after entering administration, which took place on 24 October. “By the end of November, if things go well, we might know who’s going to buy the football club,” Wigfield said.Wednesday appear doomed to relegation to League One after beingdocked 12 points by the EFLfor entering administration, which left them on minus-six points at the foot of the table, withfurther sporting sanctions expectedto follow for Chansiri’s financial misdemeanours.An independent commission has been appointed to hear charges relating to the late payment of player wages last March and May, while after an EFL regulation change in the summer, an independent club financial review panel will determine the outcome of charges regarding the late payment of wages in June, July and September. Both cases are likely to lead to further points deductions, while Wednesday are also prohibited from paying fees for players until the summer of 2027.Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayMike AshleyChampionshipFootball LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Ryan Gravenberch added a second to end a run of four successive league defeats forLiverpooland lift Slot’s side to third in the table. Salah’s strike capped a vastly improved performance from the Egypt international.Salah and Gravenberch secure welcome win for Liverpool against Aston VillaRead more“It’s huge,” Slot said of Salah’s latest Liverpool milestone. “It is almost unbelievable if you score 250 goals, let alone 250 goals for one club. You don’t see that much in football any more. Apart from the goal he had a very good performance. When we had to play long, we mainly played to him and he held the ball and the team could come to him. What I liked was that he also helped the team defensively as well. After the first goal he was helping Virgil [van Dijk] around the halfway line. I liked his performance tonight. For him to score is not special but 250 is special.”Salah admitted he has not been happy with his performances this season but was adamant Liverpool will return to form after a summer of upheaval. “I said at the beginning it is a very tricky season for us, we have a few new players, very good signings, but they need time to adapt to the team and we lost a few good players as well. We just need time to adapt and know each other’s games and we will be fine.”Slot thanked the Anfield crowd for singing his name at nil-nil and backing him through “a difficult moment” after six defeats in the previous seven games. He added: “I’m happy with what I saw not only from the players but also the support we got from the fans was what we needed. Maybe we were a bit more on the lucky side than we have been in the last few weeks, so a mistake from their goalkeeper and a deflection led to two of our goals, but these are the margins we are talking about.”Unai Emery lamented the Martínez mistake that handed Liverpool the lead but took responsibility for it. The Villa manager said: “We try to play with personality and take good positioning. It was easy for Salah. It was a huge mistake but it is my responsibility and I accept it. We build a team here through the style we want through the club. We must avoid huge mistakes like today but it is part of our process and we are trying to identify how we build.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotAston VillaMohamed SalahnewsShareReuse this content"

We have to enjoy him. May he continue scoring for Madrid, for himself, for his history. He still has a lot left to achieve and I have no doubt he will.

Bade’s own goal from a Raphaël Guerreiro cutback crowned a dominant first half for the hosts and killed off the game.Jackson headed over the bar from close range in the 50th and Guerreiro fired just wide a little later, with Bayern introducing Kane, Diaz and Olise on the hour but failing to score again.Genoa, Serie A’s bottom side, have parted company with Patrick Vieira by mutual agreement after a winless start to their campaign, with three draws and six losses.The former France midfielder took over last November whenGenoawere 17th and helped the club avoid relegation, finishing 13th.

Almost nine years to the day since Ireland’s milestone first victory in the fixture, the All Blacks gained revenge at Soldier Field thanks to tries from Ardie Savea, Tamaiti Williams, Wallace Sititi and Cam Roigard.Ireland 13-26 New Zealand: rugby union Test – as it happenedRead moreIreland initially overcame the controversial third-minute dismissal of Beirne for a high tackle on Beauden Barrett, who landed three conversions, to lead through a Tadhg Furlong score and eight points from Jack Crowley. But the All Blacks underlined their class in the second half to cruise to victory deservedly.The back-row Savea, who came off the bench in the 2016 loss, said: “That was nine years ago, but it is nice to come here and rectify that. We’ll enjoy tonight and celebrate the win.”Talk ofIreland’s landmark 40-29 successfuelled the buildup to a sold-out showdown. Irish hopes of repeating that result suffered a swift setback when the lock Beirne was sent to the sin-bin for an upright challenge on Barrett, pending a review. New Zealand were also dealt an early blow, with Scott Barrett, their captain, limping off.The fly-half Crowley scored a penalty to give Andy Farrell’s side the lead in the stop-start opening before Beirne’s punishment was upgraded to a 20-minute red card by the French referee Pierre Brousset. In spite of Ireland’s temporary numerical disadvantage, the prop Furlong – one of four members of the 2016 team in Ireland’s matchday squad – powered over for the opening try in the 16th minute, only for the All Blacks to hit back quickly through a superb score from Savea after losing the centre Jordie Barrett to a knee injury.Ireland v New Zealand has developed into a genuine rivalry in recent years, with each side beginning the day with five wins apiece from the past 10 meetings, including the previous clash in the United States. After a big buildup, this encounter was more scrappy than scintillating, not helped by frequent stoppages, which often quelled the capacity crowd.View image in fullscreenNew Zealand’s Fabian Holland wins a lineout at the home of the Chicago Bears NFL team.Photograph: Erin Hooley/APIain Henderson eventually replaced Beirne before Caelan Doris made his first appearance since suffering a shoulder injury in May after James Ryan was temporarily forced off for a head injury assessment. Ireland carried a 10-7 lead into the break, which Crowley increased by three points by slotting over a straightforward penalty after missing an earlier attempt.New Zealand had been well below their free-flowing best but led for the first time in the 63rd minute when Jordie Barrett added the extras after the replacement prop Williams bulldozed over. Scott Robertson’s team quickly added a third try to take control of the contest. Barrett brilliantly held his pass for the charging Damian McKenzie, who raced into Ireland’s 22 and popped the ball to Sititi to claim his first Test try, with the successful conversion making it 21-13.The scrum-half Roigard wriggled over to extinguish any prospect of an Ireland fightback as Farrell’s first match leading Ireland since his sabbatical with the British & Irish Lions ended in defeat before Dublin appointments with Japan, Australia and South Africa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England bossed the match, scoring four tries to one, and dominated the skies as both teams reverted to a kicking battle.Even though Borthwick lamented a lack of accuracy in the wide channels, citing numerous line-breaks that were left unconverted, he was pleased with the control his players maintained. “There was a period where the game was tight in very difficult conditions against an Australian side that are tough and really well drilled,” he said.Pollock proves the key before England cavalry seal victory over AustraliaRead more“But as I watched our team, I thought they were really composed, really composed and knew what to do next. The players were really clear on what they were attempting to do.”Along with scores from Ben Earl, Alex Mitchell and Luke Cowan-Dickie, on his 50th appearance for his country, Henry Pollock dotted down in a player-of-the-match performance off the bench. One of six British & Irish Lions among the replacements, Pollock injected energy and pace in the closing stages.“He’s a ball of energy,” Borthwick said of Pollock, who scored his third England try in his fifth match. “I love having that character in the squad. We’ve got a great blend of personalities developing within the team.”The No 8 came on after 51 minutes along with four other forwards. South Africa’s Springboks have won two World Cups with a similar tactic, known as the Bomb Squad, while France have also adopted this ploy.Maro Itoje was asked if England had come up with a nickname for their grouping. “I don’t think so,” said the captain. “The guys who came off the bench were fantastic. You always want the guys to come off the bench to add and pick up the energy, pick up the intensity of the team, and they definitely did that. They were all, to a man, fantastic.”View image in fullscreenAustralia head coach, Joe Schmidt, conceded that England’s strength in depth turned the match in their favour.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PALast season, England made a habit of letting leads slip as they lost several games late on. “Finishing games off, there’s a number of factors that come to finishing those games off,” Borthwick said. “Sometimes you go through some painful experiences. But this is a squad that is eager to learn. So we’ll address those issues we can learn from. And there’ll be plenty when we review it, we could do better. So the aim is to be a better team next Saturday.”Australia’s coach, Joe Schmidt, cut a frustrated figure and conceded that England’s bench proved to be the difference between the sides. “They really did step up the level of intensity and the physical combat that they brought,” he said. “Until that time, the game was really well balanced.”The Wallabies’ captain, Harry Wilson, gave credit to England’s pack, putting it on a par with those of the Springboks and New Zealand, but blamed his own side’s wastefulness for the result. “We were a team that prides ourselves on being quite accurate there and a few of us definitely let the team down there, and we just weren’t as accurate throughout the whole game,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAutumn Nations SeriesEngland rugby union teamAustralia rugby union teamAustralia sportRugby unionSteve BorthwicknewsShareReuse this content"

And, boy, there were not many echoes here of rugby’s greatest upset – quite possibly sport’s – bar the names of the teams and the inimitable fellow sitting in Japan’s coaching box, Eddie Jones. South Africa were 43-point favourites in 2015 and a mere 37 this time, but the reality of lopsided rugby was all too formidably asserted.Instead, it was Wembley that echoed, the lower tier around two-thirds full. South Africa, nine of whose squad play their rugby in Japan, wanted to organise this run-out to bring together their squad from around the world before the big one next Saturday against France. As an exercise it worked well enough, the Springboks utterly dominate from start to finish, notching up nine tries in the process.Pollock proves the key before England cavalry seal victory over AustraliaRead more“It’s interesting,” said Jones, “that in the 10 years since that game, South Africa have won two World Cups. What Ithat result did was refocus South African rugby on its DNA. Japan, though, hasn’t really developed its system to meet the demands of international rugby. It’s a real challenge for us. There are quality players in Japan. We just need to find a way to fast-track them.”These days, South Africa are indisputably the best team in the world, and Japan some way shy of where they were 10 years ago. Michael Leitch, at one end of the spectrum, the talisman of 2015, is still there in the back row, aged 37. A full-back, Japan fielded the student Yoshitaka Yazaki, an amateur, who showed he is smart indeed when he went over for Japan’s solitary try, 10 minutes or so after the break, a tap and dart from a penalty during a rare phase of Japan pressure. Alas, they were 33-0 down at that point.But that was it for romance in the suburbs of London. South Africa opened with a standard lineout and drive for their first try after three minutes, finished by their captain and talisman in the back row, Siya Kolisi. Then up stepped the latest star of South African rugby.Let us not reach for any hyperboles just yet. Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu has been mentioned in the same breath as Dan Carter more than a few times, but we will settle here for saying he is really quite good. He took the record for points in a Test match this year, with his 37 against as formidable an opponent as Argentina, so he was always likely to look comfortable against Japan.View image in fullscreenWilco Louw is swamped by teammates after scoring South Africa’s fifth try.Photograph: Cat Goryn/Action Images/ReutersThat he did. He weighed in with two tries, both individualist and brilliant, not dissimilar to You Know Who, who was the same age, 23, when he turned in the performance of the age against the Lions in 2005. Certainly, this bears no comparison with that masterclass, but, having converted Kolisi’s try, he followed up his own up-and-under to score South Africa’s second 10 minutes later, before showing off his running skills for another five minutes after that.Running on an arc, he dummied inside Dylan Riley and beat the long-levered, grasping Jack Cornelsen to canter to the posts in imperious style. All right, this was a friendly against overpowered opposition, but he will be around for some time. It is not as if they do not already have Handré Pollard, sitting in the stands for this. The Springboks’ depth is the envy of the world.The new term these days is “hybrid player” and the two coaches are just the type to peddle its use. Japan had Tiennan Costley on their bench, a back-row forward who covered the wing – and indeed came on in that position. But South Africa boast the prototype in Kwagga Smith.Quick GuideMatch detailsShowSouth AfricaKolbe; Hooker (Reinach 71), Kriel, De Allende, Arendse; Feinberg-Mngomezulu (Libbok 54), Reinach (G Williams 54); Nche (Steenekamp 19), Marx (Grobbelaar 45), Porthen (Louw 45), Snyman, De Jager (Nortje 69), Kolisi (capt; Esterhuizen 45), Mostert, Wiese (Smith 45)TriesKolisi, Feinberg-Mngomezulu 2, penalty, Louw, Arendse 2, Esterhuizen, KrielConsMngomezulu 3, Libbok 4JapanYazaki; Ishida, Riley, Lawrence (Costley 54), Osada; Lee (Greene 69), Fujiwara (Fukuda 66); Kobayashi (Iwaihara 65), Sato (Hirao 66), Takeuchi (Tamefusa 65), Cornelsen, Dearns (capt).

He came on to play in the back row – seems only natural – and thought he had one try from a lineout, which was chalked off, before powering over round the fringes for one that stood.That was South Africa’s seventh. Either side of it, Kurt-Lee Arendse, one of who knows how many electric runners the Springboks have at their disposal, scored twice. He picked up when Yazaki spilled an up-and-under and coasted home, before a Cheslin Kolbe – there’s another one – break put him over for his second.Both sides enjoyed a lap of the famous pitch, but the match itself will not live on like its more famous iteration 10 years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Van der Merwe’s second of the night came when he danced past two defenders to score on the left and Dobie notched his second after some fine play from Stafford McDowall.Graham got his second when he finished off a scintillating move on the right and completed his hat-trick four minutes after the restart. Rowe got in on the act in the 57th minute after being played in by Dobie and Scotland ran in four tries in the closing 10 minutes, with Stafford McDowall, George Horne, Dobie and Ollie Smith all capitalising on American fatigue to cross the whitewash.Gregor Townsend, the Scotland head coach, said: “Obviously we had more ball than we probably would get normally against a top 10 team. I thought the effort was outstanding. Of course next week will be a different opposition, one of the top teams in the world, but what we worked on in training, we got that out on the pitch so it’s a good start to the campaign.“Everybody’s aware of the step up next week. We obviously know New Zealand are going to test us in different ways than the USA weren’t able to do.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsRugby unionSouth Africa rugby teamJapan rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamUSA rugby union teamAutumn Nations SeriesUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone senses the shift, from the veterans of past champions to the new faces of the league. The Spurs are a basketball dynasty-in-waiting.The 7ft 4in (at least) forward from France signals an inevitable domination. Armed with a guard-like dribble, Defensive Player of the Year-type blocks, and Splash Brother-caliber three-pointers, San Antonio has become ground zero for the next great NBA team. For thesecond time this century.The peerless A’ja Wilson may already be the WNBA’s greatest ever player | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreThe “MVP leap” talk no longer feels premature. Barring injury, the 21-year-old Frenchman will finish top five in voting while earning All-NBA first team and Defensive Player of the Year honors. How? By continuing to attack from the perimeter like a wing, reject screens while drawing contact, before finishing over other seven-footers like a dangling modifier. He’s tighter with the ball now – quicker decisions, zero hesitation, smoother footwork, cleaner finishes through traffic. The neophyte tremble is gone. He catches, drives and dictates a dish or dunk. In the post, you can see the fingerprints of Hakeem Olajuwon’s influence: jab steps, drop steps, and pivots with balance. (That’snot an accident.) On defense, he’s warping possessions with an eight-foot wingspan.Against Dallas in last month’s season opener, Anthony Davis thought he had a layup. Until Wemby unfolded from nowhere to erase it, leaving AD begging for a goaltend. Ha. Riddle me this: what do you do when he blocks with one hand, rebounds with the other, and is somehow already pushing the ball in transition before the defense can process what happened? What about when he runs the floor like a guard, draws fouls in tight spaces, and forces teams into panic rotations? We don’t judge on how you choose to cope. Especially now that he’s attacking the paint more, initiating from the elbow, curling off pin-downs, and punishing doubles with kick-outs. Prayers up.As the Spurs build upon their franchise-best 5-0 start, the league is scrambling to survive. History has shown that generational stars need three to four seasons of lottery picks to build the supporting cast around their star. Thanks to a combination of shrewd discernment and luck, the Spurs added Wemby to the best young core of the 21st century.The Spurs had eight lottery picks in the last sixNBAdrafts. Of them, only Joshua Primo has flopped. Rob Dillingham, taken eighth in 2024, was traded on draft night to the Minnesota Timberwolves for an unprotected first-round pick in 2031 and a 2030 first-round pick swap. Gold. The 2022 Dejounte Murray trade was another heist, netting three first-rounders and a swap: a 2023 pick via Charlotte (from New York), a 2025 first, a 2026 swap, and a 2027 first. A fleece. This summer they used the No 14 pick on high-upside defensive wing Carter Bryant, rounding out one of the league’s richest young talent pools.View image in fullscreenWembanyama turns back a shot by Zion Williamson of the New Orleans Pelicans during an October game.Photograph: Chris Graythen/Getty ImagesThe rest of their picks were used to build out the surrounding core of three-and-D, multi-dimensional wings: three-leveldawgDevin Vassell in 2020 (11th), defensive switchblade Jeremy Sochan in 2022 (ninth), Wemby first in 2023, last season’s Rookie of the Year dunking demon Stephon Castle fourth, and jumbo-sized table-setter Dylan Harper second in June. Look at that group. Everyone plays defense. Everyone can score. Athletic. Smart. Big. It’s not hyperbolic to say it’s the most promising young core in NBA history. Where OKC had a trio, San Antonio has a full-blown rotation.It’s early, but Castle’s growing aggression has been one of the most notable developments. He’s no longer just cutting or filling lanes; he’s initiating and seeking contact. That confidence, paired with his size and defensive versatility, makes him an ideal connective piece between San Antonio’s shooters and playmakers.Meanwhile, highly touted Harper was singled out as the biggest non-Wemby standout of camp and preseason. His downhill pressure forces rotations; his reads – whether to finish or kick – show poise beyond his age. The footwork is polished, the handle holds up against full-court pressure, and his ability to impact the game even coming off the bench underscores just how deep this roster runs.With Harper and Castle complementing Wembanyama, the Spurs can toggle between two-big lineups and multi-guard looks, layering defensive switchability with offensive unpredictability. There’s an emerging identity here, capable of adapting to nearly any matchup or tempo.Consider the poverty and pain that most NBA fans endure. For New York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers fans, it has been decades since they last reached relevance. The Spurs were already the paradigm of winning this century – five championships between 1999 to 2014 from a total of six appearances, solidifying their hegemony over 15 years. After a generation featuring Hall of Fame-caliber players like Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard, they now enjoy the best prospect since LeBron James in Wembanyama. No dynasty has seen such a rapid return to relevance behind once-in-a-lifetime talents.The other 29 NBA teams should win their championship while they can, as the Spurs will be a true contender starting this year. You read that right. The rebuild is done. There are no positional holes on this roster. The Spurs fortified the frontcourt with the summer’s best signing in Luke Kornet, adding his championship experience to Harrison Barnes’ Golden State Warriors ring, to add shooting, shot blocking and rebounding next to Wemby. Star big men typically see massive drop-offs in defense when they take the bench. Kornet ensures they remain formidable all 48 minutes.Kornet’s intelligence as a roll man and soft hands make him elite in the dunker spot. We saw that synergy early this season in the two-man game with Wembanyama – defenders must step up on inverted pick-and-rolls because of Wemby’s shooting and driving gravity. That pressure opens decision points: spray-outs to shooters or interior finds to Kornet at the rim. Bring two to the ball, and Wemby will make you pay. Pick your poison.Ancillary pieces like three-and-D ensemble player Justin Champagnie, crafty stretch-big Kelly Olynyk, and do-it-all bruiser Keldon Johnson round out the rotation. The team still lacks more than one dead-eye “sniper”, but that’s less concerning if they continue generating open threes through drive-and-kick actions. The real issue isn’t whether shots fall, especially if their offense consistently generates quality looks. Some opponents, especially length-heavy and switchable groups like the Thunder, may try to flatten that creation by switching or staying home on shooters to test San Antonio’s half-court engine.Last season, the Spurs shot a combined 39% from three on 29 attempts per game, a quietly solid mark that hints at latent spacing potential if volume rises. There’s so much optionality in this system: layered counters, wrinkles, and inverted actions that simply didn’t exist in previous years. At the matrix of it all is Wemby.This summer, hedisappeared into a vegan monasteryin the mountains of China, spending 10 days with monks. Over the duration he spoke to no one, returning hairless, patient and planetary. Shit has gotten real. Last season, they traded spare parts for All-Star De’Aaron Fox. This gives them three starter-level lead guards. Fox is currently out with injury. When he’s back, what do those three-guard lineups – Fox, Castle, Harper – actually look like? There’s real intrigue there: constant rim pressure, two-way guard play, nonstop pace, and, at minimum, quality guard play for all 48 minutes.Early results are strong, but not spotless. They’ve jumped out to leads and watched them shrink – or flat-out vanish – against Brooklyn and Toronto. GOAT coach Greg Popovich’s successor, Mitch Johnson, has laid a foundation that looks real: sixth in offensive rating, second in defensive rating and first overall in net rating. It will take time to mesh, but once they add Fox’s pace, it’s a two-man game that punishes every coverage: drop, switch, double, blitz, doesn’t matter.What makes them scarier is the lineup flexibility. They have three dynamic guards that can mix and match. They can play big with Kornet or Olynyk and still spread you out – because Wemby can curl, roll, or run point from the slot.Defensively, new assistant coach Sean Sweeney has built disruption around his long guards – Castle, Champagnie, Harper, and Johnson – by having them pick up early, chase through actions instead of switching, and funnel everything toward Wemby’s reach. He rises. He folds. He reappears. They’ve turned the widely spammed “zoom handoff” into a trap, closing gaps before they open. Wemby anchors it all, a deterrent and destroyer rolled into one, allowing the rest to press higher and close out harder, knowing the backline is covered. It’s everything, everywhere, all at once. And it’s only going to get worse – for everyone else. There’s no stopping what’s coming. In fact, it’s already here.Explore more on these topicsVictor WembanyamaSan Antonio SpursNBABasketballUS sportsLuka DončićNikola JokićfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it failed, as the Dodgersmanaged just four hitsand one run against Blue Jays rookie Trey Yesavage and his bullpen. Roberts made a couple more minor changes before Game 6, however, inserting steely veteran Miguel Rojas into the lineup at second base and batting ninth while pushing Tommy Edman to center field and hitting eighth, hoping to get more out of the bottom of his lineup. “I just felt, again, the net sum of having both those guys in there, that’s how we had to construct it, and I feel great about it,” Roberts said before the game.Gausman, the Blue Jays’ 34-year-old ace, started the contest by retiring the first seven batters he faced, challenging hitters with his fastball while getting four straight strikeouts with his splitter. Edman jumped on a first-pitch fastball in the top of the third inning and sent it over the glove of a leaping Vladimir Guerrero Jr for a stand-up double. The hit put a man on base for leadoff hitterShohei Ohtanifor just the eighth time all series, exactly what Roberts wanted with the lineup shuffle. With first base open, Blue Jays manager John Schneider intentionally walked the Japanese star before Will Smith made them pay, hitting a double to the left field wall and scoring Edman to put the Dodgers up 1-0. “If there is an obvious chance, take the bat out of his hands, yeah, we’re going to do it,” Schneider said about Ohtani. “Again, man, they have really good hitters up and down their lineup, so you’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t sometimes.”KIKÉ, DO YOU LOVE ME?#WORLDSERIESpic.twitter.com/WQx5nFbdXa— MLB (@MLB)November 1, 2025Mookie Betts, meanwhile, was moved to the cleanup spot after hitting just 3-for-23 (.130) with no extra-base hits through the first five games of the series. “I don’t want to speak on anybody else,” Betts said after Game 5. “But for myself, I’ve just been terrible.” After Freddie Freeman drew a walk to load the bases, Betts jumped on a fastball and drove it through the infield gap to score two more runs, making it 3-0. “We talked about letting the game come to him a little bit and he got a huge hit for us,” Roberts said.Addison Barger took back some of the momentum in the bottom of the inning, igniting the 44,710 Blue Jays fans in attendance at the Rogers Centre when he hit a leadoff double into left field before George Springer drove him in with a single. But nobody else had much luck against Dodgers superstar Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who had command of all six of his pitches while mixing up his sequencing throughout the game, keeping the Blue Jays hitters guessing en route to pitching six innings with five hits, one run, and five strikeouts. “He’s a damn good pitcher,” Schneider said afterwards.With the outlier third inning behind them, both Gausman and Yamamoto picked up where they left off, throwing strikes and keeping hitters from both teams off the score sheet. Both managers went to their bullpens in the seventh inning, as Gausman finished with three hits, three runs, and eight strikeouts in six innings. “I thought it was eerily similar to Game 2 between him and Gaus,” Schneider said. “I don’t want to overlook what Kev did too, coming out of the chute the way he did and just the one inning again. And they had a couple big swings.”Neither team truly threatened again until the bottom of the ninth, when Dodgers closer Rōki Sasaki re-entered the game after throwing 25 pitches in the eighth inning and lost command of his splitter, hitting Alejandro Kirk on the hand. After the speedy Myles Straw entered the game for Kirk, Barger hit a line-drive double that wedged into the bottom of the left-field wall, causing outfielder Justin Dean to give up on the ball and signal to the umpires that it was stuck. Straw and Barger both scored easily when Dean jogged to the ball, but the umpires determined that it was in fact stuck and therefore ruled the hit a ground rule double. “You kind of like the way that was kind of unfolding and who was due up and things like that,” Schneider said after the game. “But, yeah, it just didn’t work out tonight.“Baseball happens sometimes.”Roberts once again seemed to push the right buttons as he gave Sasaki the hook in favor of projected Game 7 starter Tyler Glasnow with just one out and two on in the ninth. “I just felt that Roki wasn’t as sharp,” Roberts said. “I was looking for somebody that can get some swing-and-miss and some kind of elite stuff and that’s why I decided to go with Glasnow.”View image in fullscreenDodgers second baseman Miguel Rojas (72) fields a throw to force out the Blue Jays' Addison Barger (47) at second to turn a game-ending double play on Friday night.Photograph: Frank Gunn/APGlasnow got his first hitter, Ernie Clement, to pop out before Andrés Giménez. hit a hard line-drive to left fielder Enrique Hernández. Hernández got a good jump on the ball and caught it on the move before noticing that Barger had ranged too far off the second base bag towards third, hoping to score the tying run. Rojas called for the ball at second and Hernández threw a dart there, getting the force-out for the game-ending double-play. “Kiké just gets great jumps. He is one of my favorite baseball players to watch. He’s one of the headiest baseball players I’ve ever been around,” Roberts said.“Miggy [Rojas] played the heck out of second base and made some huge plays,” Roberts added. “We were hoping for that kind of energy infusion tonight. We got that from Miggy.”As the World Series comes to an end in Game 7 on Saturday night, the stakes couldn’t be higher. The Dodgers and the biggest star in baseball are hoping to go back-to-back for the first time since the New York Yankees won three straight titles from 1998 through 2000. At the same time, they could break baseball after fielding a team with the biggest payroll in MLB history, affecting theupcoming labor negotiationsbetween the players union and the owners – some of whom believe that the lack of a salary cap has created an uneven playing field for the other 29 teams in Major League Baseball. “We’re going to leave it out there,” Roberts said of Saturday night’s decider “I don’t think that the pressure, the moment’s going to be too big for us. We’ve got to go out there and win one baseball game. We’ve done that all year.”While the stakes might not seem quite as straightforward for the Jays, it’s about the potential to unite a country of 40m people: to inspire a new generation of Canadian boys and girls to fall in love with baseball. It’s also a chance for their hometown hero, Guerrero Jr, to etch himself into the history books, making him a Canadian immortal with a postseason nobody in the country has ever witnessed before.“See you tomorrow,” Schneider said. “It’s going to be electric here. These guys, it’s business as usual, although it’s coming down to one game. These guys are really good at kind of just turning the page.“That will take a while to kind of unpack. That’s a wild ending. I love the way we played … but we’re going to be ready to play tomorrow. Everyone’s going to be ready to play.”The winner of the 2025World Serieswill be decided 24 hours from now in downtown Toronto. The only question remaining is, on the sport’s biggest stage, who will emerge as the hero? “It’s the two best words in sports,” Schneider said. “Game 7.”Explore more on these topicsWorld SeriesLos Angeles DodgersToronto Blue JaysShohei OhtaniBaseballUS sportsMLBShareReuse this content"

About a month later, conspiracy theories abound, and avideopurporting to show an iPhone keyboard changing a user’s spelling of the word “thumb” to “thjmb” has racked up more than 9m views.“There’s a lot of different forms of autocorrect,” said Jan Pedersen, a statistician who did pioneering work on autocorrect for Microsoft. “It’s a little hard to know what technology people are actually employing to do their prediction, because it’s all underneath the surface.”One of the godfathers of autocorrect has said those waiting for an answer might never know just how this new change works – especially considering who is behind it.Kenneth Church, a computational linguist who helped to pioneer some of the earliest approaches to autocorrect in the 1990s, said: “WhatAppledoes is always a deep, dark secret. And Apple is better at keeping secrets than most companies.”The internet has beenrumbling about autocorrectfor the past few years, since even before iOS 26. But there is at least one concrete difference between what autocorrect is now and what it was several years ago: artificial intelligence,or what Apple termed, in its release of iOS 17, an “on-device machine learning language model” that would learn from its users. The problem is, this could mean a lot of different things.In response to a query from the Guardian, Apple said it had updated autocorrect over the years with the latest technologies, and that autocorrect was now an on-device language model. They said that the keyboard issue in the video was not related to autocorrect.Autocorrect is a development on an earlier technology: spellchecking. Spellchecking started in roughly the 1970s, and included an early command in Unix – an operating system – that would list all the misspelled words in a given file of text. This was straightforward: compare each word in a document with a dictionary, and tell a user if one does not appear.“One of the first things I did at Bell Labs was acquire the rights to British dictionaries,” said Church, who used these for his early work in autocorrect and for speech-synthesis programs.Autocorrecting a word – that is, suggesting in real time that a user might have meant “their” as opposed to “thier” – is far harder. It involves maths: the computer has to decide, statistically, if by “graff” you were more likely referring to a giraffe – only two letters off – or a homophone, such as “graph”.In advanced cases, autocorrect also has to decide if a real English word you’ve used is actually appropriate for context, or if you probably meant that your teenage son was good at “math” and not “meth”.Up until a few years ago, the state-of-the-art technologywas n-grams, a system that worked so well most people took it for granted – except when it seemedunable to recognise less-common names, prudishly replaced expletives with unsatisfying alternatives (something which can be ducking annoying) or apocryphallychanged sentencessuch as “delivered a baby in a cab” to “devoured a baby in a cab.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They make statistical predictions on what you’re likely to say based on what you’ve said before and how most people complete the sentence you’ve begun. Different engineering strategies affect what data an n-gram autocorrect takes in, says Church.But they are state-of-the-art no longer; we’re in the AI era.Apple’s new offering, a “transformer language model”, implies a technology that is more complex than old autocorrect, says Pedersen. A transformer is one of the key advances that underpins models such as ChatGPT and Gemini – it makes these models more sophisticated in responding to human queries.What this means for new autocorrect is less clear. Pedersen says that whatever Apple has implemented, it is likely to be far smaller than familiar AI models – otherwise it could not run on a phone.But crucially, it is likely to be far harder to understand what is going wrong in new autocorrect than in previous models, because of the challenges of interpreting AI.“There’s this whole area of explainability, interpretability, where people want to understand how stuff works,” said Church. “With the older methods, you can actually get an answer to what’s going on. The latest, greatest stuff is kind of like magic. It works a lot better than the older stuff. But when it goes, it’s really bad.”This article was amended on 1 November 2025.

Trump’s budget would push millions into poverty and must be stoppedSat 1 Nov 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 1 Nov 2025 19.01 EDTShareDemocrats in theUS Senatemust stand with the working families of our country and in opposition toDonald Trump’s authoritarianism. They must not cave in to the president’s attacks on the working class during this ongoing government shutdown. If they do, the consequences will be catastrophic for our country.This may be the most consequential moment in American history since the civil war. We have a megalomaniacal president who, consumed by his quest for more and more power, is undermining our constitution and the rule of law. Further, we have an administration that is waging war against the working class of our country and our most vulnerable people.While Trump’s billionaire buddies become much, much richer, he is prepared to throw 15 million Americans off the healthcare they have – which could result in 50,000 unnecessary deaths each year. At a time when healthcare is already outrageously expensive, he is prepared to double premiums for more than 20 million people who rely on the Affordable Care Act. At a time when the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth, Trump is prepared, illegally, to withhold funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap, despite a $5bn emergency fund established by Congress. That decision would threaten to push 42 million people – including 16 million children – into hunger.And all of this is being done to provide $1tn in tax breaks to the 1%.Let’s be clear: this government shutdown did not happen by accident. In the Senate, 60 votes are required to fund the federal government. Today, the Republicans have 53 members while the Democratic caucus has 47. In other words, in order to fund the government the Republican majority must negotiate withDemocratsto move the budget forward. This is what has always happened – until now. Republicans, for the first time, are simply refusing to come to the table and negotiate. They are demanding that it is their way or the highway.To make matters worse, the Republican contempt for negotiations is such that the House speaker, Mike Johnson, has given his chamber a six-week paid vacation. Unbelievably, during a government shutdown – with federal employees not getting paid, millions facing outrageous premium increases and nutrition assistance set to expire for millions more – Republicans in theHouse of Representativesare not in Washington DC.Day after day, Trump shows his contempt for the constitutional role of Congress and the courtsTrump is a schoolyard bully. Anyone who thinks surrendering to him now will lead to better outcomes and cooperation in the future does not understand how a power-hungry demagogue operates. This is a man who threatens to arrest and jail his political opponents, deploys the US military into Democratic cities and allows masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to pick people up off the streets and throw them into vans without due process. He has sued virtually every major media outlet because he does not tolerate criticism, has extorted funds from law firms and is withholding federal funding from states that voted against him.Day after day he shows his contempt for the constitutional role of Congress and the courts.Given that reality, does anyone truly believe that caving in to Trump now will stop his unprecedented attacks on our democracy and working people?Poll after poll shows that the Americans understand the need for strong opposition to Trump’s unprecedented and dangerous agenda. They understand that the Republican party is responsible for this shutdown. And, despite the Democratic party’s all-time low approval rating, independents and even a number of Republicans are now standing with the Democrats in their fight to protect the healthcare needs of the working families of our country.What will it mean if the Democrats cave? Trump, who already holds Democrats in contempt and views them as weak and ineffectual, will utilize his victory to accelerate his movement toward authoritarianism. At a time when he already has no regard for our democratic system of checks and balances, he will be emboldened to continue decimating programs that protect elderly people, children, the sick and the poor while giving more tax breaks and other benefits to his fellow oligarchs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would be a sellout of a working class that is struggling to survive in very difficult economic times. Democrats in Congress are the last remaining opposition to Trump’s quest for absolute power. To surrender now would be an historic tragedy for our country, something that history will not look kindly upon.I understand what people across this country are going through. My Democratic colleagues and I are getting calls every day from federal employees who are angry about working without pay and Americans who are frantic about feeding their families and making ends meet. But my Democratic colleagues must also understand this: Republicans are hearing from their constituents as well. There is a reason why 15 Republican Senators are finally standing up to Trump and, along with every member of the Democratic caucus, support funding Snap benefits.There is a reason why 14 Republican members of the House are on record calling for the extension of tax credits for the Affordable Care Act. Understandably, Republicans do not want to go home and explain to their constituents why they voted to double or, in some cases, triple healthcare premiums. They do not want to go home and explain why they are throwing large numbers of their constituents off healthcare. They do not want to go home and explain why they are taking food off the tables of hungry families.We are living in the most dangerous and pivotal moment in modern American history. Our children and future generations will not forget what we do now. Democrats must not turn their backs on the needs of working people and allow our already broken healthcare system to collapse even further. Democrats must not allow an authoritarian president to continue undermining our constitution and the rule of law. The choice is clear. If the Democrats stand with the American people, the American people will stand with them. If they surrender, the American people will hold them accountable.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025OpinionDonald TrumpUS SenateHouse of RepresentativesDemocratsHungerInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

He is enthusiastic about deregulation and handing the private sector all the freedom it needs to exploit workers and resources to boost profits.But what Trump’s America First agenda cannot live with is tariff-free trade. He also resists anti-trust and anti-corruption laws, low budget deficits, and the abolition of barriers to foreign investment that qualify as central tenets of the Washington consensus.And Trump is not alone. Since the 2008 financial crash, most people have questioned the outcomes that flow from neoliberalism.A group of renowned economists joined this debate with the idea of seeking a new consensus around ideas and gaining evidence of what works when thinking about how economies thrive and prosper in the 21st century.The resulting book, just published, could prove to be a successor to the wishlist drawn up in Washington 36 years ago.It’s a timely attempt to wrest back the economic agenda from the current chaosAfter a conference in London and the sponsorship of the London School of Economics, it has quickly become known asthe London consensus. Not with the idea of reinventing some form of economic colonialism directed from the UK capital, but because the world’s best economists gathered in London and most were associated at some point – whether they were a former finance minister of Chile or Bank of England policymaker – with the LSE.It won’t surprise anyone that the proposals are a long way from being described as Trumpian.Philosophically, the London consensus pursues aims that are entirely rejected by Trump and his followers.Trump’s backers – such as the Heritage Foundation and itsauthoritarian Project 25scheme – promote the idea that success comes with building a high wall around your home and a protective financial shield for your family. The government’s job is to support this project with low taxes, unfeasibly high state spending and an extra wall around the country itself, preventing outsiders from gaining undue access.View image in fullscreenThe London Consensus: one of the book’s messages is that increasing inequality will not help our young people to thriveNigel Farage has a similar message, as does the AfD boss Alice Weidel in Germany, the National Rally president Jordan Bardella in France and Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni.It’s a timely attempt to wrest back the economic agenda from the current chaos because many middle-income households in almost every country, from Mexico and South Africa to Britain and the US, are questioning whether to follow a more individualistic path for the sake of their family or join with their neighbours in a collective effort to improve their lives.With ashrinking number of good jobs, a significant rise in property prices and spike in the costs of food and energy, the pressure is on families who aspire to better themselves.One of the messages from the London consensus is that bettering oneself at the expense of others, and thereby increasing inequality, will not help young people to thrive. Not even the children of middle-income parents who have benefited from extensive support – whether from private education, private health or a deposit for a home (surrounded by high walls) – will ultimately feel better if high rates of crime and corruption lurk beyond the garden gate. That high levels of inequality hold back economic progress is empirically proven.Another message relates to how we judge progress. It rejects the emphasis on simply putting more money in people’s pockets as the main aim for a politician. A higher income is relatively easy to measure using gross domestic product. It is a single number that everyone knows is bad when it goes down.The wellbeing of individuals and households is a much better guide to progress. It is something Keir Starmer recognises and it is why Wes Streeting has commissioned more mental health appointments and Peter Kyle, the business secretary, continues to advance the employment rights bill.Mental health is a good measure to watch on the dashboard of indicators by which the London consensus would have us judge success. First, it is classless. Everyone knows someone who is angry, depressed or lonely and could do with, at the very least, some talking therapy.Second, all the evidence points to huge benefits from tackling these modern ills, from better physical health and higher job participation rates to greater involvement in community affairs.The US can avoid spending money in this area because it denies the victims of capitalism a ticket to ride, leaving them to fester on the side of the road.Trump’s supporters may never read the evidence contained in the many chapters of the London Consensus. There are discussions on how to achieve universal healthcare, “foster green and inclusive productivity growth” and maintain sustainable government spending that would probably horrify them.Hopefully, US state governors and prime ministers across the world will ask their staff to read the book, leading us away from the Washington consensus to a better place.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsEconomics viewpointDonald TrumpTariffsInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

The Maga bigwigs Stephen and Katie Miller, on the other hand, appear to have connected over their shared love of terrorizing immigrant children.The political power couple, who married in 2020,bondedduring Donald Trump’s first term, whenStephen helped engineerafamily-separation policyat the border that rippedmore than 5,000 children, as young asfour months old, from their immigrant parents. At the time, Miller (then going by her maiden name, Waldman) was an immigration spokesperson, and a big fan of Stephen’s hardline policies. “DHS sent me to the border to see the separations for myself – to try to make me more compassionate – but it didn’t work,” she told MSNBC’s Jacob Soboroffin 2018, according to his book on the border policy, Separated. The book also quotes Miller saying she didn’t expect tochange her mind: “My family and colleagues told me that when I have kids I’ll think about family separation differently. But I don’t think so.”Fast-forward to the present day and the married couple now share three young children. Stephen is White House deputy chief of staff and possibly the mostdangerous manin the Trump administration. Miller, meanwhile, quit a mysterious role at Elon Musk’s private ventures back in May tostart a podcastabout motherhood as part of an apparent plan to recruitmore women to Maga. Yep, the woman who couldn’t muster up any compassion for kids in cages is now a momfluencer.Miller seems to have been correct in her earlier assessment: having kids hasn’t made her think differently about family separation, a practice that attorneys and former immigration officials allegehas been revived. What has changed, however, is the fact that she’s now weaponizing her poor children against anyone who dares challenge her. And now that her husband is Trump’s right-hand man, she’s not just going after immigrants – she’s threatening to strip one of her critics of US citizenship.This week, Miller appeared onPiers Morgan’s YouTube show, along with a panel that included the leftwing commentator Cenk Uygur, to discuss Islamophobic attacks on the New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Miller kicked off the discussion with an incomprehensible point about the anti-Israel movement and then accused Uygur of “using coded language to attack American Jews and to say that we should not be here and we should not be in existence”.Uygur retorted by saying she was lying, adding: “It’s very normal for a Miller to be completely and utterly lying.” Anepic meltdown ensued.“Piers, quite frankly, I’m really sick and tired of this racist bigoted rhetoric that can comes from people like you against my husband, against my family and my children,” Miller yelled. (Uygur had said nothing about Miller’s children.) “I am raising Jewish children in this country … ”“Who brought your children into this?” Uygur then said. “What a weirdo.”Miller, who doesn’t appear to have much experience being challenged during an interview, then started ranting at Piers Morgan about how Uygur saying “the Millers lie” is coded language for them being Jewish. After some more screaming,she also told Uygur: “You better check your citizenship application and hope that everything was legal and correct … because you’ll be just like Ilhan Omar,” a frequent subject of Republican attacks.You can watch thewhole thingfor yourself but the bottom line is this: the wife of the US homeland security adviser apparently threatened to denaturalize someone because she didn’t like the fact he criticized her.This, to be clear, is hardly some one-off. Threatening to deport your critics, even those with American citizenship, seems to be Maga policy now. The representative Nancy Mace, a Trump loyalist, for example,has saidshe would “love to see” Omar, a progressive representative, “deported back to Somalia”.Various Republicans are also threatening to deport Mamdani; indeed, Miller’s meltdown occurred during a discussion about how the representative Randy Fine of Florida and Andy Ogles of Tennessee have been pushing the federal justice department toinvestigate Mamdani’s citizenship. (Mamdani was born in Uganda, moved to the US at age seven and became a citizen in 2018.) Fine, who has suggested Omar is a “Muslim terrorist” and called forGaza to be nuked,recently demandedthe federal government “review every naturalization of the past 30 years – starting with Mamdani”.Fine doesn’t really need to be demanding this, by the way, because the government is already on it. Back in June, the justice department announced plans to prioritize efforts to strip somenaturalized Americansof their US citizenship. Barack Obama, I should note, also led adenaturalizationpush – but the difference between that and Trump 2.0 is the way in which the president is using deportation fears to chill political speech and intimidate his enemies.While people of color are the main target of these attacks, even some privileged white people are being threatened with deportation or the loss of their citizenship because of their opinions – a terrifying throwback toMcCarthyism. Back when Musk and Trump were feuding, for example, the president responded to a question on whether he’d deport the South African tech billionaireby saying: “I don’t know, we’ll have to take a look.” And, in July, Trump said he was thinking ofrevoking the citizenship of Rosie O’Donnell, an American-born comedian and actor who has repeatedly criticized the president. To be clear, Trump can’t legally take away the citizenship of someone born in the US. But as we all know by now, Trump rarely seems to look at the law as an impediment.Expect more of this. TheTrump administrationhas made it very clear to 24.5 million naturalized Americans in the US that they’d better keep their mouths shut to keep their passports. Ultimately, Miller’s threat on Piers Morgan’s show wasn’t just directed at Uygur, it was a warning to everyone in America: criticize Maga and there will be consequences.Kat Abughazaleh, who is running for Congress, says she has been indicted by the DoJ for protesting ICEAbughazalehcalled the charges“yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This means that climate politics can no longer focus only on preventing future catastrophes. It must now also encompass struggles over how society manages climate impacts already reshaping economic and social life. Insurance markets, housing, water and land use policies, national labor markets, and local economies – all will need to be radically remade as we adapt to a changed and increasingly volatile climate.To date, climate adaptation has focused on theenvironmentalimpacts of climate change: strengthening seawalls against sea level rise, improving flood control systems, and retrofitting buildings for extreme weather events. But this infrastructure-centric framing sidesteps questions about the institutions that will condition how people experience thepoliticalimpacts of climate change. Should we allow property insurance markets to operate freely, or should the federal government backstop high-risk regions? Do we maintain disaster aid systems that only protect property owners, or do we guarantee equitable recovery support? Do we leave workers laboring in extreme heat to their employers’ whims, or do we enact federal protections?These questions are not hypothetical. In the United States alone, a spike innon-renewal ratesacross the homeowners’ insurance industry – even beyond high-risk markets in Florida and California – indicates that climate threatens to trigger a national insurance crisis. In 2023, UPS workers threatened a nationwide strike over on-the-job heat exposure, ultimatelywinningan agreement to install air conditioning in delivery trucks. That same year, after decades of drought left the Colorado River’s reservoirs at historic lows – threatening water supplies for 40 million people – the Biden administrationpaidArizona, Nevada and California $1.2bn to reduce their water usage. How we respond to these political crises – and those to come – will encode fundamentally different visions of society. Yet these struggles remain largely outside the frame of climate politics, which continues to treat adaptation as a technical matter for experts and engineers rather than genuine political contestation.Climate politics has already moved beyond technocratic frameworks when it comes to mitigation. Nearly 30 years ago, the Kyoto protocol represented the prevailing wisdom that market mechanisms would solve climate change. But as emissions kept rising and those markets proved ineffectual, the focus shifted to national-level industrial policy debates – and with it, climate became genuinely political. Recent years have seen any number of political battles, spanning the green capitalism of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act versus the democratic socialism of the Green New Deal to debates over lithium nationalization in Bolivia and coal phase-out compensation in Germany. These are fights about values and mediating between competing interests, not merely carbon accounting.Yet even as climate migrated from the preserve of technocratic elites to more familiar domains of political struggle, it remained restricted to the realm of decarbonization. Even the politically progressive agenda of Zohran Mamdani’s NYC mayoral campaign – whichlinksclimate to the cost-of-living crisis, arguing that rent freezes, universal childcare and free public transit will prevent New Yorkers from fleeing for more affordable, but energy-intensive, life in the suburbs – makes its case through an emissions reductions framework. A truly comprehensive climate politics would apply this same political imagination to adaptation – transforming social institutions not only to prevent future warming, but also to manage the climate impacts already transforming everyday life.The need for this shift becomes clearer once we abandon the apocalyptic framing that has long dominated climate discourse. In insisting that climate change constitutes an all-powerful force that will entirely overwhelm human civilization, climate politics has become blind to the reality that, for most people, climate change will materialize not as something utterly new, but as familiar problems made worse: more people priced out of housing markets after disasters, more workers forced to work during heatwaves, more local industries decimated after extreme weather events.Climate adaptation is not a distinct technical challenge, then, but rather continuous with ongoing political struggles.The terrain of this struggle is beginning to take shape. TheCouncil on Foreign Relations, for example, recently proposed reforms to the property insurance market to expose homeowners to the “full actuarial cost” of living in high-risk areas like California. By contrast, the progressive Climate and Community Institute has proposed a system ofHousing Resilience Agenciesthat would provide comprehensive public disaster insurance. The contrast is stark: one approach uses price signaling to prod people out of vulnerable areas – effectively a form of managed retreat through market pressure – while the other commits public resources that enable them to stay in place safely. But these kinds of policy debates remain few and far between in climate discourse.This is not to suggest that mitigation should be abandoned. But the exclusive focus on preventing climate catastrophe obscures a more immediate reality: climate change is already reshaping our world. The question is not whether we will reshape our institutions to manage climate impacts, but how – and whose vision will prevail.Leah Aronowsky is a historian of science and assistant professor at the Columbia Climate SchoolExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s about finding one that’s workable – for the community, for the economy and for natureSat 1 Nov 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 1 Nov 2025 22.04 EDTShareVictoria’s Healesville Sanctuary is helping to protect and restore the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot which is predicted to be extinct within five years.With only 50 known to be left in the wild, a major breeding program aims to release up to 20 pairs of the migratory birds annually.It’s just one of several threatened species programs supported by the sanctuary near Melbourne, which attracts about 400,000 people every year – many of them schoolchildren – who visit to learn about and experiencenature.It’s a case study that the author of the 2021 review into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, Graeme Samuel, keeps front of mind.Because the “pure politics” of the debate, he says, obscures what the conversation is about – nature – and its intrinsic value to our communities.Joy and division: Albanese may feel like a rock star but beware the unknown pleasures of weak opposition | Peter LewisRead moreAnd it’s not about environmentoreconomy. It’s both.The EPBC Act, the latest iteration of which has just hit the federal parliament, touches on everything from “productivity to renewable energy, mining, nature and climate goals, the housing crisis, cultural heritage, and resources and energy security”.It’s a big moment, or it could be.As former Treasury secretary Ken Henry has said, with “glistening ambition” Australia can “build an efficient, jobs-rich, globally competitive, high-productivity, low-emissions nature-rich economy”.But if you want to see a case study of politics in action, look no further than nature law reform, or the lack of it.The last significant federal reform in this space happened under the Howard government a full quarter of a century ago.That version of the actis undeniably no longer fit for purpose in the face of massive loss of plants and animals and historically significant technological and industrial change.Successive reports have detailedcatastrophic loss of speciesthat is “ongoing and accelerating”. Meanwhile, business describes cumbersome environmental regulation as“the new enemy of progress”.“Without faster project approvals we will never meet our net zero ambitions, for instance,” says Bran Black, the CEO of theBusinessCouncil of Australia.It’s threading those two needles simultaneously that has been the problem.And inevitably, that has led to a long-running game of political point-scoring.It’s a fine playing field but there are no winners.It will be five years in January since Samuel delivered his review of the act, commissioned by then environment minister Sussan Ley under the Morrison government.At the time, she indicated qualified acceptance of the review recommendations, and released a pathway for reform which didn’t progress due to the 2022 change of government.Coming in with high expectations from those who care about the natural environment, the Albanese government subsequently released its ill-fated “nature positive plan”, also based on Samuel’s report. That legislative package was shelved before the 2025 election, in a definitive broken promise by Labor followingpressure from business interests in Western Australia.Now it’s a question of whether Labor, theCoalitionand the Greens can come up with a compromise to deliver what Samuel describes as a “massive leap forward for nature”, and for our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsInstead of outright rejecting the legislation or seeking to delay progress by breaking it into separate bills which she opposed during the last parliament, Ley could take the package as a win.She started it, after all.And the Greens, always looking for the moral high ground, will need to apply some cost-benefit analysis to opposing a bill that’s undoubtedly a vast improvement on what currently exists after a five-year process.I hate to say it, but 80% is probably about as good as it’s going to get.The absence of an explicit climate trigger is problematic, however new national environmental standards would require development proposals to explicitly consider climate impact.Provisions around offsets have been tightened so they can’t be used unless every attempt has been made to mitigate or avoid damage to nature. Meanwhile, the bill enables more certainty for business for more efficient and effective decision-making.All of these things warrant careful analysis to make sure they’re as watertight as they can be. Crossbenchers are rightly critical of being landed with a 1,500-page bill this week for a likely House vote next week.It has been five years; the government should at least allow time and scope for constructive amendments that make the lawbetter.And the minister should have to convince the Australian people – not just other parliamentarians – that the “national interest” provision not only won’t butcan’tbe misused to give the green light to nature-wrecking projects, or indeed, the other way around.Former industry minister Ed Husic is right to flag that ministerial discretion to override decisions could be a back door to open-slather development in the hands of a future government.AnotherJuukan Gorge, anyone?“We’ll do the right thing,” won’t wash in the Trump era.There’s no such thing as a perfect legislative solution. It’s about finding one that’s workable – for the community, for the economy and for nature.And, as Samuel rightly says, for our kids.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionEndangered speciesLaw (Australia)Labor partyCoalitionAustralian GreensBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

It has not turned out to be a big deal for my life or career, but at the time it felt monumental: racist hate mail was sent to my college for months; the Conservative MP Bob Blackman called for my prosecution; and tabloid journalists turned up at my home and harassed my mother (it was August, a famously slow news month). I received a lot of support from the student population, alumni and the police (and none from the university, bar a few kind academics), but it cast a shadow over the rest of my time there – I worried about what future I could have or what employer would hire me if they were to Google my name and see I had attracted scandal. Mostly I wondered why this was national news.I found myself revisiting those memories when considering the storm aroundGeorge Abaraonye, the now ousted Oxford Union president-elect who attracted significant media attention for laughing at the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk in September. In a WhatsApp group, Abaraonye wrote: “Charlie Kirk got shot, let’s fucking go”, and on his Instagram account wrote: “Charlie Kirk got shot loool”. This was seen as especially egregious as in May this year Abaraonye had debated Kirk on the subject of toxic masculinity at the Oxford Union. Abaraonye apologised for the posts, stating that he wrote these messages before realising the shooting was fatal, and they were intended to highlight the irony of someone so pro-gun being shot. But then he doubled down,saying: “My words were no less insensitive than his – arguably less so.”I have no judgment to pass on Abaraonye’s messages. But log on to any social media site during a major tragic event and you’ll see that laughing at inappropriate jokes is part of the furniture. The Titan submersible, Luigi Mangione’s alleged killing of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Prince Philip dying and indeed Charlie Kirk. Five years on, I still see memes and jokes by rightwing provocateurs making a mockery of George Floyd’s death. Whatever your assessment of the rights and wrongs of people laughing at tragedy, a question remains: if this is such a regular fixture of online life, then why was Abaraonye singled out?View image in fullscreenCharlie Kirk and George Abaraonye during a debate at the Oxford Union in May 2025.Photograph: Oxford UnionIt’s an easy answer. We are abnormally and unethically obsessed with what students get up to at university, and any action is immediately defined as being within the public interest even where it is broadly inconsequential. This is especially the case with Oxbridge students, with those institutions seen as finishing schools for entry into UK elite life. Abaraonye had the unfortunate timing of having volunteered himself for a position there that came with a title, meaning he wasn’t just an obscure student but someone with some importance. He also has long dreadlocks, wears grey tracksuit bottoms to union debates and didn’t get straight As in his A-levels, an almost too-good-to-be-true apparition of what sticklers for decorum or fogey alumni would consider as driving the corruption of a storied institution.What followed the news of Abaraonye’s comments exposes two issues: the hypocrisy of the right’s panic over campus “free speech”, and the dog-eat-dog environment that has been engineered by the media’s intrusion into university spaces.Universitiesare meant to be spaces where students come, thinking they have one of the world’s greatest minds, and thrash out ideas, make provocative statements and forge political convictions, which they may well ditch once they nab a Goldman Sachs graduate role. It’s also a space where they will make mistakes. This is the reality of campus free speech. But presented with the opportunity to discredit and stamp out someone confident and progressively minded who might become a future force in, say, politics, law or journalism, the media seem to want to crack the egg before it hatches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes, students try to settle personal or political scores by calling in the media. It is likely another student screenshotted and leaked Abaraonye’s messages to fit him up. (I had a similar experience, where my comments about a misnamed “Jamaican” beef and mango stew in a food feedback page at my college wereleaked to the press, likely as punishment for being too vocal on race within my college.)The ceaseless coverage of the Oxford Union, and other stories focused on students, is about aggravating existing fears that people may have about the children in their lives – that they might be influenced by radical ideas, that ideologies popular on campus will become a diktat that they absorb until they are unrecognisable to those who love them. The right is evidently desperate for any opportunity to unmask these kids. That’s why a 20-year-old student no one had ever heard of who laughed at something inappropriate suddenly becomes the face of “the hypocrisy of woke orthodoxy”. We have been told that universities face a crisis of free speech, and that students must be ready to beshocked or offendedas part of their education. But should a student outrage liberal or conservative sentiments, the right seeks to discipline them.It is not that students should never be reported on. The question should be: who is harmed? The female students at Warwick University were evidently harmed by the misogyny and culture of sexual assault exposed by theWarwick “rape chat”. And an ableism row at the Oxford Union six years ago, after a blind Ghanaian student wasdragged by his anklesfrom a debate event, was evidently worth being brought to public attention. But however offensive or disgraceful you find Abaraonye’s edgy comments, who did he harm, and who can you say was reasonably put at risk? If students are to be preached to about the values of free speech and tolerating dissent and provocation, then why should they not pick the path of theedgelordin response?Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

With the US backing away, now is the moment when other nations must step upSat 1 Nov 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 1 Nov 2025 11.46 EDTShareWith the once-familiar pillars of the old world order crumbling and the US stepping away fromaction on climate crisis, it falls to others to assume global environmental leadership. Those leaders who understand the urgency should seize the opportunity afforded byBrazil hosting Cop30this month to build a coalition of committed countries determined to turn back the climate deniers.Many now see China – the mostsuccessful manufacturerof solar, wind, battery and electric vehicle technologies – as the global low-carbon powerhouse. But itsnational emission goals, recently submitted to the UN, are underwhelming and it is unclear whether China is willing to take up the mantle of climate leadership.It is the EU, Norway and the UK who have led the west in sustaining green industrial policies through thick and thin, and who are, along with Japan, themain providers of climate financeto the global south. Yet today the EU looks uncertain of itself, under pressure from major sectorslobbying to weaken climate targetsand fromfar-right partiesseeking to move the continent away from the once solid cross-party consensus on net zero goals.The severity of the storms that havehit Jamaica this weekwill add to the rising frustration felt by the climate-vulnerable states led by Barbados’s prime minister, Mia Mottley. SoKeir Starmer’s decision to attend Cop30and to adopt, with Ed Miliband, a fresh leadership role is highly significant. For it is time to lead in a new way, not just by increasing public and private investment to prevent ever-rising floods, fires and droughts, but by focusing mitigation and adaptation policies on saving and improving lives now. This ranges from increasing the capacity to grow food on the thousands of acres of parched land to preventing the500,000 annual deathsthat excessively hot weather now causes by addressing the poverty-related health problems – intensified for example by floods and waterborne diseases – that contribute toeight million early deathsevery year.A decade ago, theParis climate agreementcommitted the international community to holding the rise in the Earth’s temperature to well below2C above preindustrial levels, and trying to limit it to 1.5C. Since then, successive UN climate conferences have accepted the science and reinforced 1.5C as the agreed target. Progress has been made, especially as renewables have fallen in price. Yet we are very far from being on track. The world isalready around 1.5C warmer, and global emissions are still rising.Over the next few weeks, the last of the high-emitting powers will announce theirnational climate targetsfor 2035, including the EU, India and Saudi Arabia. But it is already clear that a huge “emissions gap” between rich and poor countries will remain. Though Paris included a ratchet mechanism – countries agreed to strengthen their commitments every five years – the next stocktaking and reset is not until 2028, and so we are headed for 2.3C-2.7C of warming by the end of this century.View image in fullscreenFlooded streets in Black River, Jamaica, after Hurricane Melissa, 30 October 2025.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APAs the World Meteorological Organisation hasjust reported, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are now rising at their fastest ever rate, withcatastrophic economic and ecological impacts. Nasa’s satellitesshowthat extreme weather events are now occurring at double the intensity of the average recorded in the 2003-2020 period. Weather-related damage to businesses and infrastructure cost nearly half a trillion dollars ($451bn)in 2022 and 2023 combined. Allianz’s Günther Thallinger recentlywarnedthat “entire regions are becoming uninsurable” as key asset classes degrade “in real time”. Record droughts in Africa caused acute hunger for23 million peoplein 2023 – to which should be added the malaria, diarrhoea and other deaths linked to the global rise in temperature.But countries are not yet on course even to contain the damage. The Paris agreement contains no provisions for national climate plans (they are called “nationally determined contributions” for a reason) to be discussed and revised. Four years ago, atCop26 in Glasgow, when the last set of plans was pronounced inadequate, countries agreed to come back the following year with stronger ones. But only one country did. Fouryears on, just67out of 197have sent in plans, which add up to only a 10% reduction in emissions when we need a 60% cut tostay within 1.5C.Starmer can help shape the future of the world at Cop30. He can’t let fear of Farage stop him |  Michael JacobsRead moreThis is why Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’stwo-day leaders’ summit on 6 and 7 November, in advance ofCop30in Belém, will be so critical. Other leaders should now follow Starmer’s example and lay the ground for a far more ambitious Belém declaration than the one now on the table.First, the vast majority of countries should commit not only to defending the Paris accord but to accelerating the implementation of their existing climate plans. As innovations transform our net zero options and with green technology costs falling, decarbonisation, which Miliband is proposing for the UK, is possible at speed elsewhere in transport, homes, industry and agriculture. Allied to that,Brazil has called foran expansion of carbon pricing and carbon markets.Second, countries should declare their determination to achieve by 2035 the goal of$1.3tn in public and private financefor the global south, from where most of future global emissions will come. The leaders should endorse the joint Brazil-Azerbaijan “Baku to Belém roadmap” mandated at Cop29 toshow how it can be done: it includes innovative new ideas such asmultilateral development bank and climate fund guarantees,debt swaps,andmobilising private capital through “reinvestment”, all of which will allow countries to strengthen their emissions pledges.Third, countries can pledge support for Brazil’sTropical Forest Forever Facility, which will halt tropical deforestation while providing employment for Indigenous populations, itself an exemplar for innovative ways the public sector should be mobilising private investment to achieve the sustainable development goals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would demonstrate that they are committed not only to getting the world back on track, but to affirming, as we commemorate the80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, that multilateral rules-based cooperation is still possible. It would prove that prosperity, to be sustained, has to be shared. This month, when both Cop30 and theG20 convene, is the time to remind leaders that future generations will judge them. They will ask whether or not, at this critical moment, when the world faced a choice between progress and retreat, they rose to the challenge of our times and gave people hope.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsCop30OpinionClimate crisisKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Luckily for him, his prison visitors include powerful friendsSat 1 Nov 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 1 Nov 2025 07.13 EDTShareTwenty years ago, atragic eventchanged the direction of my life. Three teenagers from the banlieueof Clichy-sous-Bois, north of Paris, were returning from a football game one afternoon in late October 2005 when they were chased by police. Zyed Benna, Bouna Traoré and Muhittin Altun had done nothing wrong (an inquiry later confirmed this) but were so disoriented by fear of the police, they hid in an electricity substation. In an awful twist of fate, Zyed and Bouna died by electric shock on 27 October 2005, while Muhittin was severely burned – and scarred for life by the ordeal.Their deaths led to rioting across France – the worst in years. The episode also turned me into a fully committed activist against racism and inequality. Yet for some politicians the response was to criminalise the victims. The interior minister at the time for example, Nicolas Sarkozy. He initially suggested the teenagers had committed burglaryand then declared: “When you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear from the police.”Sarkozy preached a hardline, zero-tolerance approach when it came to criminality. You would think therefore that he would accept his own punishment without complaint. Because today, it is Sarkozy who finds himself behind bars.The former president’s jailing is remarkable: apart from Louis XVI, executed during the revolution, and Philippe Pétain, imprisoned for collaborating with Nazi Germany, no French head of state has ever before served a prison sentence. But thepresident of the court heldthat Sarkozy’s offences were “exceptionally serious acts, likely to undermine citizens’ trust in those who represent them”.What exactly, are these grave offences attributed to our former president?Sarkozy was convicted andsentenced to five years in prisonfor criminal conspiracy in the so-called Libyan campaign-funding case, relating to his 2007 presidential campaign (he denies wrongdoing andhas appealed). He was found guilty of having entered into a pact with Muammar Gaddafi’s regime to secure illegal financing for that campaign. He is said to have allowed close associates to make promises to Libya, notably maintaining contacts withAbdullah al-Senussi– Gaddafi’s brother-in-law, and a terroristconvicted in Francefor the 1989 bombing of a Paris-bound airliner that killed 170 people. The families of those killed in the attack weredeemed by the judgesto be victims of this corrupt pact.In 2005, Nicolas Sarkozy declared: ‘When you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear from the police’But despite adecade-longinvestigation (andrevelationspublished by Mediapart as early as 2011), the involvement ofabout 100 magistratesand a400-page judgment, Sarkozy denounced his conviction as a“violation of the rule of law”.An astonishing number of high-profile supporters rushed to his defence.Immediately after his conviction and before he entered prison, Gérald Darmanin, the justice minister,paid him a visit, claiming he had done so merely “as a friend” andexpressing“a great sadness for Nicolas Sarkozy”. Despitewarningsfrom senior judges about potentially undermining the independence of the judiciary, Darmanin followed this up on Wednesday with a visit to his former mentor, in prison. This has nowprompted a lawsuitagainst the justice minister from a group of 30 lawyers accusing him of bias.Other parts of the political class joined in the outpouring of support. While the mayor of Niceannouncedhis intention to name a square in the city after Sarkozy, Emmanuel Macron himselfreceived the former president at the Elyséebefore his incarceration.Sarkozy was even able tohost a farewell gathering, while his familyorganised a public send-off, where people applauded as he left his home on the day he was taken into custody – someshouting: “Shame on the justice system!”From the moment the verdict was announced, media outlets, almost in unison, handed the microphone to those not only denouncing the court’s decision but insisting on his innocence. To me, one particular testimony perfectly captures the mindset behind this outcry. A close friend of Sarkozy lamentedon a radio showthat prison is “a shock for people like us, its terrible,” before concluding: “We’re not made for that, we’re not animals.” Leaving aside the speciesist undertone of that remark, who, then, are the “animals” deemed deserving of prison?Probably those who cannot afford to have their relatives on the airwaves to defend them. It is worth recalling that criminal conspiracy is punishable by up to10 years in prison– twice the sentence Sarkozy received.In France,almost a thirdof all those in prison are, like Sarkozy, awaiting judgement , and every dayhundredsare placed in custody under immediate enforcement orders. In 2022, for prison sentences of two years or more, the rate of immediate enforcement was 88%. The court granted Sarkozy a privilege rarely afforded to ordinary citizens: he wasnot locked up immediately, but givenseveral weeksto prepare for his detention, during which he attended hisdaughter’s birthday.The French government has been condemned on numerous occasions for the excessive length of pre-trial detention. Did Sarkozy’s friends ever before express concern about that?Worse still, last month France’s chief inspector of prisonswarnedof the “alarming state of disrepair” of many French prisons, plagued by infestations of cockroaches, rats or bedbugs – conditions that infringe the fundamental rights of those held in detention.While Sarkozy, for obvious security reasons, has been given a private cell, Franceranks secondin the EU for prison overcrowding – a serious affront to human dignity.Our principles are violated on a daily basis in our prisons. I am convinced of the intrinsic ineffectiveness of the prison system. I made that case in the foreword of a recently translatedcollection of essaysabout prison abolition. I want a profound rethink of justice – one that is reparative, not dehumanising, and that allows victims to seek more than society’s vengeance on their behalf.But Sarkozy’s political career was defined by an uncompromisingly punitive stance on crime, particularly against repeat offenders. Yet he himself now faces hissecond custodial sentence– the first served by wearing an electronic tag. Today, he is subject to the very penal system he so zealously promoted. Its philosophy is the same one that 20 years ago drove police officers to chase down innocent boys – leading to the deaths of Zyed and Bouna.It is striking, to say the least, to see those who constantly decry the supposed leniency of the justice system – and, like Darmanin, call daily for harsher laws – suddenly decide that such reasoning should not apply to Sarkozy. It is the reaction of the caste, revealing a belief that some lives are unworthy and may endure the cruelty of inhumane detention conditions, while others ought to be spared.The case is serious: a French head of state has been convicted of a criminal conspiracy to receive funding from a foreign power that carried out acts of terrorism against its own citizens. More serious still is to hear this man – who has always championed tougher criminal sentencing – now give the impression he believes he is above the law.Rokhaya Diallo is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So what does the writer make of our dystopian world?‘From (finally) being given the Booker prize to the day her partner died’:an exclusive extractfrom Margaret Atwood’s memoirSat 1 Nov 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 1 Nov 2025 08.45 EDTShareMargaret Atwood is doing her grocery shopping in her local supermarket in Toronto, and it is taking longer than usual. This is not because The Handmaid’s Tale author turns 86 this month, but because she is checking the provenance of every item before it goes in her trolley: California satsumas out; Canada spuds in. Atwood is a passionate environmentalist, but at the moment she is more worried about boycotting anything that comes from over the border in the US than air miles. “Elbows up!” she declares, taking a furious stance in the fruit and veg aisle.Back in her kitchen she shows me aYouTube skitof Canadian prime minister Mark Carney and comedian Mike Myers in the national hockey kit to explain the significance of “Elbows up”, a growing gesture of Canadian resistance. “Oh, they’re angry. They’re furious,” she says of the reaction to President Trump’sproposed plans to make Canada the 51st state of America. “We’ve not got a very big army. If they wanted to invade they could do so. But I don’t think they would. Do they have any idea what it would be like to try to occupy a hostile Canada? It would not be a joke.” Trump would have to deal with Atwood, for starters.I get hate mail, just like everybody. I don’t get as many weird sexual invitations as I used to, but I still get someView image in fullscreenT-shirt and skirt: Ulla Johnson fromholtrenfrew.com. Shawl:nouveaurichevintage.ca“I think they are worried I’m going to drop dead before the book is out,” she says of her publishers, wielding a large tray, laden with two coffee pots (one decaf), a plate of biscuits and a tin of muffins, down the stairs into her back garden, a late-summer wilderness, surrounded by maples, linden trees and silver birches. Her publishers are doing their best to stop her overexerting herself. It is an impossible task: just the week before my visit, Atwood made headlines by writinga short storyin response to a proposed ban on books with “explicit sexual content” in Alberta.The plan was withdrawn. “The Albertans are an independent-minded bunch,” she says. She has recently been fitted with a pacemaker (hence the decaf) and is on medication that will make her turn blue if she goes in the sun. Last winter, her 88-year-old brother Harold was up on his roof with a chainsaw to deal with a fallen tree, she tells me. Their mother was still clearing leaves from the roof in her 80s. I hope you don’t go up on the roof, I say, looking up at the turrets. “Only the flat bits,” she shoots back.The book in question is her memoir, Book of Lives, a whopping 624 pages edged in shocking pink to match her outfit on the cover. Since 1961, Atwood has published an average of a book a year, includingmuch‑loved novelsCat’s Eye, The Robber Bride, Alias Grace, The Blind Assassin, the MaddAddam trilogy, and the now canonical The Handmaid’s Tale and its sequel The Testaments. She has turned her hand to every genre – poetry, essays, graphic novels, even libretti – except autobiography, always insisting that she had no interest in writing about herself.The memoir is what you can remember. And what you mostly remember is catastrophes and stupid things“I’m an old-fashioned novelist. Everything in my novels came from looking at the world around,” she says. “I don’t think I have much of an inner psyche.” Two impressive water features threaten to drown out her distinctive low murmur. Everything she says is salted with irony. “I felt so left out during the age of neurosis, when everyone was supposed to go to a shrink. I went to therapy once. He was bored with me. I didn’t have anything interesting to say.”She finally gave in to the new book on the condition that it would not be autobiography, but “a memoir of sorts”, as the subtitle has it. “The memoir is what you can remember,” she clarifies. “And what you mostly remember is catastrophes and stupid things.”Written in the chatty, no-nonsense style of her essays, the book marches through the decades: the depression, the second world war, McCarthyism, the shooting of JFK, 9/11, the Iraq war, Trumpism and the pandemic all get a mention. But this is not her take on global affairs or the issues that matter most to her – women’s rights, the environment, freedom of expression, literature. She did all that in her 2022 collected essaysBurning Questions, another doorstopper, to which Book of Lives is the personal companion piece. Here, novels are given genesis stories, debts are repaid, scores are settled: the college boys who spiked her drink; the writer who turned her into a man-killing octopus (“I know who you are, or were, male person”); the Globe journalist who said her kitchen was gloomy, and worse. “Dead people, mostly,” she says now. “But, as far as living people go, truth is an absolute defence.”Was it as enjoyable to write as it is to read?“It was fun in parts,” she says. “But the parts where people are dying were not fun.”The memoir is bookended by her childhood in the Canadian outback and the death, in 2019, of her partner of many decades, the writerGraeme Gibson, giving it an almost novelistic arc. Gibson died while Atwood was in the UK on a publicity tour for The Testaments. She carried on with the tour. Their relationship is the great love story of the book; his death the major catastrophe. “Boo-hoo,” she says quietly now. Her recent short stories, poems and especially the later chapters of the memoir are heartbreaking in their descriptions of loss. But she doesn’t do grief in public, she says.The couple bought the house, now almost camouflaged by trees, in 1985. It was formerly a cult house, apparently, one of four on this wholesomely Canadian street. The walls were covered with orange shag-pile carpet, “so you couldn’t hear the screams”, she jokes grimly. Today, the walls are covered with paintings, including a large portrait of Gibson by an artist friend, Atwoodian publishing memorabilia – and books (a war section, a witches section, a Canadian history section). If there is anything cultish, it is in the many gifts that the author has been sent from fans: a knitted Atwood figure in Handmaid’s robes guarding the downstairs toilet; a tiny handmade library of all her novels, so miniature they need tweezers to be taken out. It’s not all good. “I get hate mail, just like everybody,” she says. “I don’t get quite as many weird sexual invitations as I used to, but I still get some.”The cult of Atwood, 21st-century seer and saint, has been growing steadily. In 2019, she was the first female author to make the cover ofTime magazinesince Toni Morrison two decades before. Her name comes up every year around Nobel time – her popularity probably counts her out.If the States were a full totalitarianism we would not be filming The Testaments at all. We’d be in jail, in exile, or deadView image in fullscreenDress: Greta Constantine fromholtrenfrew.comHaving lived through a publishing epoch that was dominated by postwar male American novelists (Roth, Updike, Bellow) and then the Brits (Amis, McEwan, Rushdie), there is some satisfaction that a tiny female writer from Toronto, a city barely on the literary map when Atwood started out, should have the most enduring reach. “I expect it annoys a lot of people,” she says drily. But she shakes off her status as one of the most famous authors on the planet. “Number one, I’m still alive,” she reminds me. “Which makes me the oldest living whatnot of my generation. Number two, Canadians don’t do ‘most famous’.”If she is “screamingly famous”, as she puts it in the memoir, “it’s an accident of history”, she says. “It’s because of the conjunction of the television series with actual political events.” The2017 Hulu adaptationof her 1985 classic The Handmaid’s Tale catapulted her on to the world stage. Filming began in the summer of 2016 and was still under way in November. “The election happened. Trump won,” she says. “Everybody involved woke up the next morning and thought, ‘We’re in a different show!’ Not because the show changed. It didn’t. Scripts did not change. The frame changed. Instead of thinking, ‘Oh, cute, fantasy’, people thought, ‘Oh my God, here it comes.’”At a time whenabortion has been made illegal in certain states, and people entering the US are having theirphones checked for anti-Trump views, her vision of a future America as a totalitarian theocracy in The Handmaid’s Tale seemedterrifyingly prescient. The red handmaid gowns became a global symbol of female protest, phrases from the novel were printed on placards and T-shirts. “Make Margaret Atwood Fiction Again” became a rallying cry.Nearly a decade since the TV series launched, filming has just finished in Toronto on the first season of The Testaments, in which the author has another cameo. For her first, sheappeared, fleetingly, to give Elisabeth Moss a fierce slap as one of the aunts in the original. She is forbidden to say more about the new series. Naturally, Ann Dowd returns as Aunt Lydia.“The States is not a totalitarianism – yet,” she says. “Though moving towards a concentrated-power structure. If it were a full totalitarianism we would not be filming The Testaments at all. We’d be in jail, in exile, or dead.”Back in 1985, when The Handmaid’s Tale was published, the storming of the Capitol would have been unimaginable. “The wall was still up, the cold war was still on. America was a beacon of light, freedom, democracy, you name it.” she says. “The wall comes down in 1989. People think world conflict is over. We’re just going to go shopping and we’ll all be fine. Capitalism has won. But if you destabilise a world order like that, people come in to fill the vacuum.”She pauses to allow a wasp that has settled on her pastry to fly away. “It’s this time of year. They’ve finished their reproductive cycle and they’ve got time on their hands,” she says, before taking a bite. “Napoleon Bonaparte, ‘I am the revolution’. Stalin, same thing. Trump, ‘America,c’est moi!Je suis America!’”She feels bad for the States right now. “They’re losing their world-leader status and China is going to take over if they keep on going this way,” she says. “People go, ‘Boo, Americans!’ It’s not Americans. Half of them, at least, are not at all in favour of what’s going on at all.”In one of the essays in Burning Questions, Atwood recalls advice on how to escape a crocodile: zigzag. It might serve as a description of a conversation with the author, which can swerve alarmingly across subjects and centuries: from Brexit (“A mistake. Guess what!”) back 8,000 years toDoggerland(when Britain was physically joined to Europe), from the French Revolution to zombies. You have to be wary of the teeth and the tail. As she confesses in the memoir, she has a reputation for “eviscerating interviewers”. If she has mellowed it is because journalists no longer ask why she writes such miserable novels, or if she shouldn’t do something about her hair. You still know when you’ve asked a stupid question. “And why is that, Lisa?” she will ask in a querulous, slightly scary voice.Margaret Eleanor Atwood was born on 18 November 1939. This historically ominous date, two and a half months after the onset of the second world war, shaped her worldview; the idea that power can shift quickly, devastatingly and anywhere informs nearly everything she has written.Her father, Carl, was an entomologist, and her mother, Margaret, was a school teacher before she got married. Atwood’s first years were spent in a succession of cabins in the woods of Ontario and Quebec, playing with snakes and toads with her brother Harold. Her nickname was Peggy.“You have no fear,” a later boyfriend would tell her. This fearlessness, put to tackling different sorts of snakes and toads in later life, is one of the most striking qualities of the memoir. “Not quite,” she says now. “I’m wary of bears and thunderstorms, particularly lightning.” Harold was nearly struck by lightning. “Up in the north, those are the things you’re afraid of. Drowning, a close third.”When Atwood was nine, the family moved to Toronto after her father got a job at the university. Her sister Ruth was born. She attended a proper school for the first time. In her handed-down pinafores, she was unprepared for the “unpredictable, oblique, underhanded, and byzantine nature of the power politics practised by nine- and 10-year-old girls”, she writes in the memoir. It was here that she met Sandra Sanders, who, 40 years later, would become the fictional tormentor Cordelia in her novel Cat’s Eye (often described as Lord of the Flies for girls). She learned never to be afraid of bullies again.View image in fullscreenAtwood with copies of her fourth novel Life Before Man in Los Angeles, 1980.Photograph: Wally Fong/APThe young Peggy was following in her father’s footsteps towards a career in biology. One Friday when she was 16, she was crossing the school football pitch when a four-line poem came into her head. And that was it. She was a poet. She still has the button from the dress she was wearing that day. “Never throw out anything that might be useful,” she advises now.She won a scholarship to Harvard. Every building would later be immortalised in The Handmaid’s Tale, including the Harvard Wall where the executed bodies were displayed. The college was not amused. Her first job with a market research company made its way into her debut The Edible Woman, published in 1969. It was all material.Finding a boyfriend was never a problem. “They just appeared, like mushrooms after the rain.” There’s her first teenage romance, “naturally he had a car”, the Very Nice Boyfriend of her early 20s (he’s still alive), a tryst with a poet one night in a park in Edmonton, and a prolific, nonfiction Canadian author, “The Ill-Omened Lover”, who made the mistake of considering himself the serious writer in the relationship. He’s still alive, too. She’s not telling.“Nobody thought much of it. It just happened,” she says of the general jumping into bed. “I think we probably had more fun than this generation.” In the late 60s, she married her on-off boyfriend Jim Polk, whom she had met at Harvard, “one of the odder things to happen to both of us”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He looked at Atwood and thought “canoe trips”. His first gift was a sturdy pair of work boots. They were both married to other people at the time. “In the 1970s everybody’s marriage exploded,” she says breezily.The next 48 years were filled with shared adventures: renovating farms, long visits to Europe and Australia, annual escapes to Pelee Island, in Ontario, for the spring migration, setting up various writerly and environmental projects – and canoe trips. He was so supportive of her writing that a journalist once wrote: “Every writer should be married to Graeme Gibson”, a slogan Atwood had printed on a T-shirt as a present.View image in fullscreenAtwood being interviewed in a hotel room while her partner Graeme Gibson and their daughter Jess look on, 1982.Photograph: Ross Anthony Willis/Fairfax Media/Getty ImagesTheir daughter Jess (her first name is Eleanor, Atwood’s middle name) was born in 1976. For the first time, she didn’t embark on a novel for two years. “The baby was much more important.” She wanted more children. “I would have settled for three or four,” she says now. But Gibson already had two sons from his first marriage. He also didn’t want to marry again; she did. This bothered her greatly, especially as she was hailed as a feminist role model for “having a baby outside of wedlock”. Both these disappointments are dusted off by her alter ego, an “Inner Advice Columnist” she deploys in the memoir whenever anything threatens to get too intimate. “Oh, for heaven’s sake! Many would give the shirt off their back to have your luck in men. Suck it up. Cherish your child. Get another cat.”“Of course it rankled,” she says. “But who was going to support them?” At the time they were barely making ends meet on two writers’ incomes. Today she considers herself to have three children, including her two stepsons, and three “grandkids”. “That’s enough,” she says. Gibson’s eldest, Matthew “was a better son to me than most sons are to their mothers”. Jess, an art historian, lives in Brooklyn with her partner and nine-year-old son. They spent lockdown, which came shortly after Gibson’s death, with Atwood in Toronto. Jess’s first collection of short storiesThe Good Eyewill be published next May, with a novel to come as part of a three-book deal. They are both wary of too much fuss being made of the connection, for fear it should “attract snipers”, she says. “I’ve had my child attacked in the press before.”The Handmaid’s Tale came about thanks in part to a winter spent in a fisherman’s cottage in Blakeney, Norfolk, in 1983, which was so grim she abandoned the novel she was working on. The family left for West Berlin. She rented an electric typewriter with a German keyboard and finally began the novel that she had been putting off, because it was “too weird, even for me”.Famously,the author’s rulewas only to include atrocities that had actually happened. The Pinochet regime in Chile, the baby-stealing of the Argentine generals, the fear and secrecy behind the iron curtain – all went in. When it was finished she sent the manuscript to the novelist Valerie Martin. “I think you are gonna make a lot of money,” she replied. She was right.The Handmaid’s Tale was her first of six appearances on the Booker shortlist. In 1986, she lost out to Kingsley Amis’s The Old Devils (who reads that now?). She won for The Blind Assassin in 2000, and again, controversially, for The Testaments in 2019, alongsideBernardine Evaristo, the first black female winner, for Girl, Woman, Other. “It couldn’t have gone better for me,”Evaristo has saidof their joint win.View image in fullscreenAtwood with Bernardine Evaristo, with whom she shared the 2019 Booker prize.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty ImagesAfter the success of the TV show, Atwood was increasingly expected “to do the right thing for women in all circumstances”, she explains, “with many different right things projected on to me from readers and viewers”. She has always chafed against her role as high priestess of the sisterhood. “What do we mean exactly by equality?” she will say. “Equality for who?” And there are no shortage of morally repugnant female characters in her fiction, from Zenia in The Robber Bride to Cordelia and Aunt Lydia.In 2017, she provoked afuroreby weighing in on the case of the novelist and lecturerSteven Gallowaywho was suspended from the University of British Columbia after an accusation of sexual misconduct, latercleared of all but one of the accusations in an internal investigation, although “he was fired anyway”, Atwood says. It seemed “a clear case of guilty without trial”, she writes in the memoir. Galloway did admit to an affair with a student, for which he apologised.“All I did was sign a letter asking for due process,” she says now. “Please read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. You can find it on the internet. Note: women’s rights are a subset of human rights. You can’t have one without the other.”Her views were seen as goingagainst the growing #MeToo movement, which she described as “a symptom of a broken legal system” in a 2018 op-ed entitled “Am I a Bad Feminist?”. “#MeToo is no longer the unquestionable thing that it was for a while,” she says. “Now people are talking about the manosphere. There wasn’t a manosphere, now there is one.”Her reluctance to takea clear standon the gender culture wars has also been seen as a betrayal by some feminists. By way of an answer now, she points out that one of the most“banned” books in the US is a children’s book called Tango Makes Threeabout two male penguins in a zoo who are given an egg to raise by the zoo keepers. “True story. The books being banned the most in the US right now are LGBTQ. As well as anything with race,” she says. “But I got in trouble with trans activists, too, forretweeting a piece that worried about the disappearance of the word ‘woman’. Go figure.”People have been attacking me since 1972. Been there, done that, several times on different issuesView image in fullscreenT-shirt: Ulla Johnson fromholtrenfrew.com. Shawl:nouveaurichevintage.caShe is wary of ideological absolutes. Is it true? Is it fair? Andcui bono? Who profits? She will ask on any issue. As a novelist, it is her job to ask questions, and, as she likes to points out, she can’t get sacked for her answers.Does she ever fear being cancelled, or being perceived to be on the wrong side of history? “People have been attacking me since 1972,” she replies. “Been there, done that, several times on different issues.” History doesn’t have “sides”, she corrects me. “It isn’t a road leading inevitably somewhere, as the Marxists and their Bible-induced teleology used to have it. Trends come and go. No one can predict the future with dead certainty.”Her oracular reputation means she is often asked about where the world is going. “Is there hope?” has replaced “Why do you hate men?” as a favourite question at events. As someone with a special interest in the darkest periods of humanity, and who lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis, she usually brushes aside apocalyptic gloom. Not so much recently. “It’s really pretty unsettled right now,” she says. “World power is shifting, old certainties are no longer certain. Of course we have had unsettled times in the past but we forget. It is the scariest of times.”She is often asked “quite stupidly”, she says, if she is the same person now as she was when she was young. “If I were, we would really be in trouble,” she says. “Your perspective changes as you move through time. How could it not? Time never stops.”When an old person dies, “it is not a tragedy”, she reflects, “it is the culmination of their life”. An elderly friend has elected to die next month. Medically assisted dying has been legal in Canada since 2016. Gibson was diagnosed with dementia the following year. By the end he could no longer remember the names of his beloved birds. “Certainly, Graham would have done that had he not had a massive cerebral haemorrhage,” she says.“I have used up my thread,” she writes at the end of the memoir, an allusion to the mice in Beatrix Potter’s The Tailor of Gloucester. “No more twist.”This does not mean no more books. “I’ve told my life up to the end of this chapter,” she makes clear. She is not about to retire anytime soon. “Who knows?” is all she will say. And then she is on to talking about herlatest Substack. She started it as a distraction after Gibson died and to raise money for their Pelee Island bird centre. She loves being able to comment on the world, and anything else that takes her fancy (highlights include a Halloween video and one of her tap-dancing in a hospital gown after her pacemaker was fitted). “It’s fun.” How does she find the time? “I’m a writer,” she replies.Can Xue and László Krasznahorkai are joint favourites to win 2025 Nobel prize in literatureRead moreThe next day we meet for the photoshoot at her old college, Victoria, at the University of Toronto (the students’ pub, The Cat’s Eye, was named in her honour). As she walks across the campus, there are audible gasps from students, and a boy politely asks for a selfie to send to his mum. If she were worried about her legacy – she’s not: “Other people decide that” – she clearly has a new generation of readers. The author gamely joins in a dance routine two girls are rehearsing on the lawns. One of the college staff recalls how on one visit a student produced a Sharpie and asked Atwood to sign his backside. She obliged, apparently. She can’t remember signing any bottoms, she says later, “but it sounds like the sort of thing I might do”.She rifles through the clothes the stylist has bought, like Meryl Streep in the Devil Wears Prada. “No. No. Maybe. Definitely not.” A couple of suitably gothic outfits are settled on. But she is not to be persuaded into heels. The makeup artist tells Atwood that she has launched her own range of products; finding Canadian-made cosmetics is tricky, apparently. Atwood insists on getting photos to post on Instagram. “Elbows up!” they chorus.Having a cup of tea between pictures, in a long purple satin cloak, her sparkly trainers peeping out the bottom, she looks like an off-duty Elizabeth II. “I’ve had tea with the queen,” she says. “Not recently, obviously.

Shimmering icons of empowerment or Pygmalion projects for middle-aged A&R men? Here’s a radical idea – they’re both. Two become one, baby. That’s the sense you get from Girlbands Forever (Sat, 9.20pm, BBC Two), the documentary executive produced by Louis Theroux charting the fortunes of 90s bands such asAll Saints, Eternal,Atomic KittenandMis-Teeqthrough to 00s starsLittle Mix. If that lineup speaks to your elder millennial soul the way it does mine, climb on board, carefully. I need some nostalgia, like I’ve never needed nostalgia before.Of course we want the gossip, fallouts and scandals. Band members interviewed for the three-part series are happy to supply. Kelle Bryan from Eternal reveals they were sent to a facility in the countryside and put on controlled diets to manage their weight (though the head of EMI UK denies all knowledge). Kerry Katona tells how a journalist turned up at her mother’s house with a bag of cocaine to get her to sell a story. Melanie Blatt ofAll Saintssays that when she discovered she was pregnant, she was told to abort.Girlbands Forever could have been a cynical exercise: see who’s desperate enough to want to be in this, dredge up their worst moments while viewers make assessments about which of them has the nicest house. Instead, it has sensitivity and scope, as interested in charting the social mores these artists created, were crucified by, or changed in some way.I’m not sure things have improved. Attractive celebrities once took pains to hide their relationships, to maintain an illusion of being sexually available. These days, we’ve exploded the notion of privacy, and realised relationships can be cannibalised on social media for cachet. Progress! Black artists once worked five times as hard for a 20th of the attention. Imagine. The show is refreshingly unequivocal that the addition of a slender, blond, white woman could transform a band’s fortune. While our pop culture lens has widened, it’s hardly pointing in a different direction.It’s the old footage that breaks your heart. They are such vibrantly talented children. Look at Atomic Kitten meeting Westlife for the first time, all teenage flirtation. Check out the “steely, non-choreography” of the early, surlySugababes. There is adorable footage of Mutya on a Michael Barrymore show, in which she appears to literally be a baby. I’m glad the doc gets into the Sugababes’ revolving door policy. One of the funniest things to happen in music this century, it’s also a living manifestation of the Ship of Theseus philosophical paradox. Let’s not get into that.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Melanie Blatt, Natalie Appleton, Shaznay Lewis and Nicole Appleton as All Saints performing at The Mobo awards in 1997.Photograph: JMEnternational/Getty ImagesSpice Girls are the silverbacks in the ring, who came from nowhere and conquered the globe with their debut single. None feature here, yet it’s interesting to hear from established artists who floundered in the wake of the Jenny-come-latelies. Some profess to being underwhelmed by Wannabe, while their five-way demographic appeal is presented as a triumph of marketing. “Girl Power? That was EMI power,” scoffs producer Pete Waterman.The music industry comes out of this badly (though Piers Morgan comes out of it worse than anyone). A repeating pattern we’re shown is that when band members get pregnant, the sentence handed down from male management is the same: you’ve destroyed the band. In this context, seeing Blatt perform at Party in the Park with her pronounced baby bump showing, sexy and defiant as ever, is a punk-rock, sea-change vision. Still the coolest person in the room, she had reservations about appearing here at all. “Hello, I’m Mel from the 90s” is how she introduces herself. Oh, she dope.Another repeating pattern: talented but frustrated girls break ties with their Henry Higgins founders and succeed in their own way. No matter how these bands started, what they become is up to them. Without always feeling empowered, they were avatars of it for younger generations. They represented the joy of being in a gang of girls, often working-class, travelling the world and living a dream. The world needs that. Plus you can’t go wrong with a TV soundtrack of songs including Never Ever, Sounds of the Underground and Scandalous. You know what to do. Push the button.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherDocumentaryFactual TVPop and rockAll SaintsLittle MixSugababesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His fur flutters as he turns, his neat button nose sniffs the air, and his eyes soften with a smile. For years, design details of the bear forPaddington the Musical, directed by Luke Sheppard, have been kept top secret. Now here he is, in his blue duffel coat and red hat. A quiet theatrical marvel. “What we’re doing,” says producer Sonia Friedman, “has never been done before.”Standing around 1.2 metres (just under 4ft) tall, the bear is beautifully round, all belly and sloping shoulders. He is not an exact replica of the Paddingtons we’ve seen in illustrations or movies, but something new. His shaggy, caramel fur has a gentle wave, and his white snout is dotted with a brown nose, ideal for sniffing out trouble. Around his neck sits a label, threaded through an old piece of string, asking for someone to look after him.View image in fullscreenSandwiched together … the principal cast of Paddington the Musical.Photograph: Jay BrooksWhen fellow producer Eliza Lumley first had the idea of doing a musical of Michael Bond’s Paddington in 2016, the immediate question was how to do the bear. “We wanted to see if it was possible to have Paddington on stage,” says Friedman, who joined the team two years in. “Just Paddington.” They tested out every idea, finding puppetry to be “gorgeous”, Lumley says, but “slightly whimsical”. The presence of puppeteers also complicated the desire to have this bear alone on stage, lost at a train station and waiting to be found.Paddington Bear given UK passport by Home OfficeRead moreThe innovative answer for this stage adaptation, written by Jessica Swale with music by Tom Fletcher, began to emerge when Neal Scanlan, creature effects artist and designer of Star Wars’ Chewbacca, pointed them towards Tahra Zafar. Having conjured creatures for Star Wars, English National Opera and that pesky monkey for PG Tips, Zafar now boasts the imponderably lovely title of “Paddington Bear designer”.“We looked back at the books and Peggy Fortnum’s beautiful illustrations,” says Zafar, “and all the different versions of Paddington over the years.” The influence of Fortnum’s designs is particularly apparent; where the movie Paddington’s face leans towards realism, Zafar’s design has Fortnum’s wide, teddy-like quality. Zafar describes the technological routes they explored as “quite fancy”, but they kept returning to simpler ideas that captured the bear’s purity. “We wanted to create something that you respond to with your heart.” The result is part toy, part real. Part tech, part costume, part magic.0:51Paddington the Musical bear revealed – videoThe heavy padded bear suit is then brought to life by the skill and partnership of two performers: Arti Shah and James Hameed. Over years of workshops, the duo have formed a unique synchrony that allows us to believe we are watching a walking, talking, singing – and occasionally dancing – Peruvian bear. Shah’s experience as a creature performer for film has prepared her for physically playing the bear, while Hameed provides the voice, with the twinned nature of the role never hidden from the audience. At a recent workshop, a child supplied a more fitting description of Hameed’s role when she marched up to him and announced: “You’re Paddington’s soul.”Hameed also remotely puppeteers Paddington’s facial expressions using a control panel. This means he is in charge of the bear’s infamous hard stare. These controls were originally a separate role, but through workshops, they found that the instinctual relationship between the pair cut any delay in Paddington’s reactions. As an avid gamer, Hameed was thrilled.View image in fullscreenThe bear necessities … James Hameed and Arti Shah.Photograph: Jay BrooksPhysically performing inside the bear requires immense strength, stamina and skill. “Before we started rehearsals I sat in the sauna for a whole week, every day, in my blacks,” says Shah. “It was a way of training my mind. The bear is not as hot as the sauna.” She has experience with such unusual performance constraints. When she was in the movie Attack the Block, she was required to run on all fours in a costume that weighed half her bodyweight and had arm extensions. “This is so much lighter,” she laughs.While eight shows a week creates new physical challenges (actors Abbie Purvis and Ali Sarebani are alternate Paddington performers), the theatre also brings new joys; this musical will be Shah’s first experience of taking a bow. “It hasn’t sunk in,” she says. “I’m just humbled and excited to be doing this, especially being a female Asian of short stature. To show my young son, who has been diagnosed with my condition, that anything is possible.” An enormous fan of the books and movies, her son is frequently found singing Fletcher’s songs from the show. “I’m doing this for him,” Shah says.For many of the team, the bear holds an emotional resonance that goes beyond nostalgia for bedtime stories. “Paddington means something different to everyone,” Hameed says. “My father came over in the 70s from Pakistan, looking for a home. For my British mum, Paddington was manners, tea and marmalade sandwiches. For my dad, he was a visualisation of his own story.”When Bond first wrote A Bear Called Paddington in 1958, he described an evacuee’s label around the character’s neck that read: “Please look after this bear.” The team behind Paddington the Musical evidently takes this role seriously. Zafar mentions a label her team have sewn on to the bottom of one of Paddington’s paws: “Made in Peru.”“It’s quite subtle,” Zafar says. “I don’t think anyone’s going to see it, but we know it’s there.” It’s a mark of the care and attention that has gone into crafting this bear. “I think when you really love making something, that love gets transferred to the thing you’re creating. I’m hoping that’s what you see in Paddington. All that love on stage.”Paddington the Musical is at the Savoy theatre, London.Explore more on these topicsMusicalsPaddingtonActingChildrenTheatreWest EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fifty years after his brutal murder, the director’s vision of fascism is more urgent than everWith mystery still surrounding Pier Paolo Pasolini’s death, the poet and film-maker’s warnings of corruption and rising totalitarianism offer a chilling message for our timesOlivia LaingSat 1 Nov 2025 05.12 EDTLast modified on Sat 1 Nov 2025 05.14 EDTSharePier Paolo Pasolini was murdered at around midnight on 2 November 1975. His blood-soaked body was found the next morning on waste ground in Ostia, on the outskirts of Rome, battered so badly the famous face was almost unrecognisable. Italy’s premier intellectual, artist, provocateur, national conscience, homosexual, dead at the age of 53, his scandalous final film still in the editing suite. “Assassinato Pasolini,” the next morning’s papers announced, alongside photographs of the 17-year-old accused of his murder. Everyone knew his taste for working-class hustlers. A hookup gone wrong was the instant verdict.Some deaths are so suggestive that they become emblematic of a subject, the deceiving lens through which an entire life is forever after read. In this weirdly totalitarian mode of interpretation, Virginia Woolf is always walking towards the Ouse, the river in which she drowned herself. Likewise, Pasolini’s entire body of work is coloured by the seeming fact that he was murdered by a rent boy, the crowning act of a relentlessly high-risk life.But what if this was the intention; the malevolent cunning with which his assassination was designed? What if, rather than the instant martyrdom of a bullet to the head, Pasolini was killed in such a way as to make it seem that he had sought out his own destruction, a rightful punishment, at least in the eyes of conservatives, for the manifest perversions with which his art as well as life were rife?Furthermore: what if this reputational as well as actual murder was designed to drown out – contaminate, confuse – the warnings he’d been issuing with increasing ferocity in the final years of his short life? “I know” was the central refrain in afamous essaypublished a year before his death in Il Corriere della Sera, Italy’s leading newspaper. What Pasolini knew, and what he refused to remain silent about, was the nature of power and corruption during Italy’s brutal 1970s; the so-called “Years of Lead”, named for an epidemic of assassinations and terrorist attacks by both the extreme left and right. What he knew, in short, was that fascism was not over, and that the right would metastasise, returning in a new form to claim power over a populace stupefied by the tawdry blandishments of capitalism. Was Pasolini wrong in his predictions? I think we all know the answer to that.View image in fullscreenPier Paolo Pasolini in 1961.Photograph: Giancarlo BOTTI/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesPasolini was born in Bologna in 1922, the year that Mussolini became dictator, to a military family. He spent a formative spell in his mother’s home town of Casarsa, in the remote rural region of Friuli, after his father was arrested for gambling debts. The schism between his parents grew more serious as the second world war took hold. Susanna was a schoolteacher who loved literature and art, while Carlo Alberto was an army officer and avowed fascist, who would spend most of the war in Kenya in an English prisoner-of-war camp.Pasolini studied literature at Bologna University, but when bombing made the city too dangerous he retreated with his mother and younger brother, Guido, to Friuli. He was obsessed with the beauty of the region and its pure, archaic dialect, his mother tongue, spoken by peasants and almost unknown to literature. In 1942, he published his first volume of poems, Poesie a Casarsa, written in dialect. But during the chaotic years of fighting that followed the Italian armistice, not even Friuli was safe. Guido joined the resistance and was executed in the hills by a rival group of partisans, a tragedy that bound Susanna and her adored surviving son even more tightly together.Pockmarked hustlers and petty thieves, often homophobic, usually straight – it was these boys he set at the heart of his life and workPart of the allure of Friuli was erotic. It was here Pasolini discovered his sexuality, his magnetic attraction to peasant and street boys. It soon brought him into conflict with authority. In the late 1940s he was charged with corruption of minors because of a supposed sexual act with three teenagers. Though he was later absolved, the scandal drove him and Susanna to move again, this time to Rome.They stepped straight into the seething city of Bicycle Thieves: a Rome in ruins, its slums populated by a new urban proletariat, escaping the deprivations of the rural south. Pasolini found work as a teacher and immersed himself in another secret language,Romanaccio, the street dialect spoken by the wild youths he befriended.Ragazzi di vita, he called them in the 1955 novel that made his reputation: the boys of life. Pockmarked hustlers and petty thieves, slim-hipped and amoral, often homophobic, nearly always straight. It was these boys he set at the heart of his books, his films, his poems and his life.You can glimpse Pasolini in photographs of this period, a slight, slender figure with bandy legs, a mackintosh over his smart suit, dark hair slicked back from an intense, sharp-cheekboned face. A watcher, a driven artist, a passionate football player. He found his way to Cinecittà, the famous Roman movie studio, as a scriptwriter. He assisted Fellini with Nights of Cabiria, and then he was off on his own, writing and directing Accattone,a 1961 neo-realist account of a pimp – played by a real-life street kid, Franco Citti – and his blighted life in a Roman slum.Lesser artists might have mined that seam for years, but Pasolini soon revealed the exceptional depth and idiosyncrasy of his talent. He made explicitly political films such as Pigstyand Theorem, animated by his loathing for the complacent bourgeoisie. He told the life of Christ in The Gospel According to St Matthew and he took up classical stories too, creating raw and visceral adaptations of Oedipus Rex and Medea, starring Maria Callas, as well as Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales, The Decameron by Boccaccio and The Arabian Nights in The Trilogy of Life.By his 50s, he was globally famous, a controversial figure, constantly under attack. He was tipped for the Nobel prize in literature but had also been subject to 33 trials on trumped-up chargesThere is nothing in all of cinema like these films, which are bawdy and poetic, visually sublime and heavily invested in the realm of ideas. Many of them star Pasolini’s great love and long-term companion, Ninetto Davoli, a shambling naif from Calabria with an infectiously broad grin. Pasolini’s tendency to use amateur actors gives his films a strange, unsteady realism, as if a Renaissance painting had come to life.By his 50s, he was globally famous, a controversial figure, constantly under attack. He was tipped for the Nobel prize in literature but had also been subject to 33 trials on trumped-up or invented charges, including public obscenity, contempt of religion and, weirdest of all, attempted robbery; his weapon a black pistol loaded with a golden bullet. Pasolini didn’t even own a gun.View image in fullscreenA scene from Pasolini’s 1975 horror film, Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyHis art was never doctrinaire but it was always political. He’d joined the Communist party in his youth, and was rapidly expelled for his unconcealed homosexuality. He was as often criticised by the left as the right, but though he was a thorn in everybody’s side, he remained allied to communism and the radical left. In the 1970s, he became exceptionally vocal on political matters, using the essays in Il Corriereto discuss industrialisation, corruption, violence, sex and the future of Italy.In the most famous, published in November 1974 and known in Italy asIo so, or “I know”, he claimed he knew the names of those involved in “a series of coups instituted for the preservation of power”, including the fatal Milan and Brescia bombings. During these Years of Lead, the far right deployed the so-called “strategy of tension” to smear the left and shift the country to a more authoritarian basis. Pasolini believed that among those responsible were figures in the government, the secret service and the church. He referred to a novel he was writing, Petrolio, in which he intended to lay these corruptions bare. “I believe it is unlikely that my ‘novel in progress’ may be wrong, that is to say that it may be disconnected from reality, and that its references to real persons and facts may be inaccurate,” he added.The last film is the bleakest. No horror film in all the intervening years has come close to Salò (1975), no hacked-up torture porn approaches its icy formal perfection or anguished moral intent. A version of De Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom transposed to the Italian countryside in the final days of the second world war, it is a terrifying masque about fascism and compliance, an accounting of both sides of the totalitarian coin. Like De Sade’s own writing, it’s about power, not pleasure: who possesses it and whom it destroys. It’s an apocalyptic masterpiece that remains unbearable to watch; “off the reservation, proscribed”, as the writer and critic Gary Indiana observed in a screen essay extolling its still-radioactive capacity to wound the viewer.I set my new novel, The Silver Book, around the making of Salò. I wanted to imagine Pasolini at work, in a tight Missoni sweater and dark glasses, running from scene to scene with the Arriflex camera held lightly at his shoulder, overseeing the construction of turds from crushed biscuits and chocolate for the infamous shit-eating scene. He didn’t bully his collaborators, like Fellini did. He was loved and admired, and also lonely, separate. The compulsive cruising, night after night: in a poem called Solitude he wondered if it was simply a way to be alone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

He had publicly repudiated his joyous, erotic Trilogy of Life. Now sex equalled death and pain. As for utopia, no possibility remained. And yet, when an interviewer asked him who was the intended audience for Salò, he said in all seriousness: everyone. He still believed art could perform its counter spell, could shock the populace awake. He hadn’t lost hope.One of the theories of Pasolini’s death is that he was lured to Ostia to recover some reels of Salò that had been stolen a few months earlier. I took up this story in my novel but I decided not to directly describe Pasolini’s murder, in which he was beaten, his groin shattered, his ear almost severed, before being run over by his own silver Alfa Romeo, causing his heart to burst. The boy who served a decade for his murder had a few tiny spots of blood on him, and no injuries, though he had apparently beaten a man to death. Another sentence fromIo sohints at what probably took place: “I know the names of the sombre and important people who lurk behind the tragic youths who chose the suicidal fascist atrocities or the common criminals, Sicilian and otherwise, who offered their services as killers and assassins.”Pasolini saw what was coming. Like the rarest artists, he had the gift of second sight, which is another way of saying that he paid attention, that he watched and listened and knew how to interpret the signs. On his last afternoon, he was by chance interviewed for La Stampa. A few days after his death, his final recorded words were published in a sold-out issue, a prophecy from beyond the grave.He talked about how ordinary life was becoming distorted by the desire for possessions, because everyone was taught that “wanting something is a virtue”. He said it affected every aspect of society, though the poor might use a crowbar to get their spoils, while the rich relied on the stock exchange. He said, referring to his nightly excursions into the shadow world of Rome, that he descended into hell and brought back the truth.What is the truth, the journalist asked. The evidence, Pasolini said, of “a shared, compulsory and wrong education that pushes us to own everything at any price”. He described everyone as victims in this, thinking no doubt of Salò, where victims and perpetrators are locked together in a terrible dance. And he described everyone as guilty, because of their willingness to ignore the costs in favour of their own lucrative private gain. It wasn’t about individual culpability or good and bad actors, he added. It was a totalising system, though unlike in Salò there was a way to escape, to undo the sinister, seductive spell.View image in fullscreenPasolini behind the camera on the set of Il Fiore delle Mille e una Notte in 1974.Photograph: Sunset BoulevardAs ever, his language was more that of the poet than the politician: dense with metaphor, spooky with warnings. “I go down into hell and I discover things that don’t disturb the peace of others,” he said. “But be careful. Hell is rising towards the rest of you.” Right at the very end of the conversation, it is as if he becomes frustrated by the interviewer’s continued attempts to make him clarify his position. “Everybody knows that I pay for my own experiences in person,” he says. “But there are also my books and my films. Maybe I’m wrong, but I keep on saying that we are all in danger.”The journalist asks how he thinks he, Pasolini, can avoid this danger. It is getting dark and there is no light on in the room where they are talking. Pasolini says he will think about the question overnight, that he will answer in the morning. But in the morning he is dead.I think Pasolini was right, and I’m certain that the warnings he kept uttering were why he was killed. He saw the future we’re now in long before anyone else. He saw that capitalism would corrode into fascism, or that fascism would infiltrate and take over capitalism, that what appeared benign and beneficial would corrupt and destroy old forms of life. He knew that compliance and complicity were lethal. He warned about the ecological costs of industrialisation. He foresaw how television would transform politics, though he was dead before Silvio Berlusconi came to power. I do not think the ascent of Trump, a politician formed in Berlusconi’s mould, would have surprised him very much.He wasn’t perfect. He was infected with nostalgia for a rural peasant Italy, the cost of which he was wilfully blind to. He was against abortion and mass education; he took the side of the French police against the students in 1968. His poetry can be self-indulgent, his paintings are bad. He paid for sex with rent boys who stayed the same age as he grew older, and on the other hand he took them seriously, listened to them, found them work, provided a steady source of support. He was a visionary and an artist of unshakeable moral conviction. He would not shut up.The timing of his death makes it seem as if Salò was his final, desolate statement but even on his last night he was talking over dinner about his next film. There was more work to come, unimaginable in its shape, unprecedented in its form. He ate steak, he went cruising. He was hungry, you see. He was on the side of life, always.The Silver Book by Olivia Laing will be published on 6 November by Hamish Hamilton. A 50th anniversaryscreeningof Salò will take place on 11 November at the Barbican, London.Explore more on these topicsBooksBiography booksFictionLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Did you miss us?’ Oasis kicks off Australia tour with euphoric showThe bucket hats were out in force at Marvel Stadium as Liam and Noel Gallagher made a polished – and even affectionate – return to MelbourneSian CainFri 31 Oct 2025 20.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 21.41 EDTShareThe first time Oasis played in Australia, in 1998, the controversies piled up to the point that some journalists speculated it was a media strategy. Liam was slapped with a lifetime ban from Cathay Pacificdue to the band’s alleged bad behaviour on the flight over. (The ban was sealed when Liam told an Australian reporter, “I don’t give a flying fuck … I’d rather walk.”) Noel got in hot water for commentshe made about Princess Diana, then Liam was hauled in front of Brisbane magistrates court, charged with assault after allegedly head-butting a fan who wanted a photo. The fandropped the charges, though Liam later called the alleged head-butt “justice”, adding: “The geezer put a camera in my face and I told him not to.”But other than the handwringers, Australian fans seemed delighted with it all. The Gallaghers’ particular tetchy, laddish swagger has always played very well here, as hasthe drama of their on-off relationship. And the music too, of course: both What’s the Story (Morning Glory)? and Wonderwall went to No 1 in 1995, while in 2013 Triple J listeners voted Wonderwall the best song of the past 20 years. The affection remained even after Noel went on Triple J and said: “You fucking need us more than we need you. Your lives and the people that listen to your radio station and listen to Radiohead and fucking Blur and Robbie Williams – your lives would be lessened without me and my brother and it’s as simple as that.”Oasis review – a shameless trip back to the 90s for Britpop’s loudest, greatest songsRead moreBut in Marvel Stadium on Friday night, the first of Oasis’ five sold-out Australian shows on their world reunion tour, it was clear some of the country’s warm feelings were returned when Liam and Noel walked out to deafening screams, hands clasped above their heads.“G’day Australia,” Liam said. “Did you miss us? Because we missed you.”View image in fullscreenOasis’ first Australian show, at Marvel Stadium, Melbourne, on Friday night.Photograph: Big Brother RecordingsIt was noticeable how many in theMelbournecrowd looked to be in their 20s and 30s, the fans who never got the chance to see Oasis the first time around.“I never thought this was going to happen,” Liam (a different one) told the Guardian, at the show with his friend – also called Liam. “We’ve always talked about it, but we said no, it’ll never happen. I’ve seen Noel and Liam separately but I am too young to have seen Oasis, so this very cool.”“I have relatives in Manchester who couldn’t get tickets and now I am going here – so they hate me,” the other Liam added.Ali and Anna, both 28, grew up on Oasis because their parents were fans – but unlike others, they bought tickets the night before. “I followed all the drama about dynamic pricing in the UK and how people were paying exorbitant prices – I didn’t want to pay $400 for a ticket, that’s crazy,” Anna says. “So we bought them for $115 last night.”View image in fullscreen‘It was noticeable how many in the Melbourne crowd looked to be in their 20s and 30s, the fans who never got the chance to see Oasis the first time around.’Photograph: Big Brother RecordingsCompare that with Sharon, a British-Australian who last saw Oasis live in 1998; she was due to go to their last concert before they broke up, in 2009, but couldn’t get a babysitter and missed the show.“I have waited 27 years to see them again,” she says. “I am ecstatic. I told my husband, if they ever get back together, I don’t care what it costs me. When it was announced last year, I even booked accommodation in London but couldn’t get tickets. But then they came here.”“I’m glad they didn’t have a punchup and split before they got here,” adds Kerri. She’s also a longtime fan – just not enough of one to fork out for the merch: “Seventy bucks for a bucket hat seems a bit much.”‘Without a parka, I’ll look like an idiot’: Oasis fans’ fashion at the reunion tourRead moreBut the bucket hats were out in full force, as were the anoraks and the Adidas gear – regardless of temperatures. “Come to Australia, they said,” a very sweaty Liam said towards the end, peeling his trademark anorak from his neck. “Don’t bring your parka mate, its going to get fucking roasty.”Oasis are now 32 shows into a 41-gig world tour, but by all accountsthey’ve sounded this polished from the get go. There are no signs of the old mardiness that used to derail their shows, when Liam would pick fights with the audience – though he still stalks the stage like he’s squaring up, albeit while holding maracas. Instead, the mood was euphoric and mischievous; the tang of weed and beer hung in the air all night and, during Champagne Supernova, someone even launched a flare. “Naughty, naughty, naughty,” Liam said.View image in fullscreenLiam Gallagher with his maracas.Photograph: Big Brother RecordingsThe Gallaghers seem to have softened into a cheeky friendliness in their 50s. At the end of a soaring rendition of Don’t Look Back at Anger from the crowd, Noel jumped back on the mic to poke fun: “Aan-gah? What the fuck is aan-gah?” Liam meanwhile, queried Australia’s drug habits (“Are you still sniffing cocaine? You’ll grow out of it”) then dedicated Bring It On Down to “the classic glue sniffers”.But all good things must come to an end. “I’m a princess these days, and I need to go to fucking bed,” Liam announced. His signoff was rather sweet, as Gallaghers go: “Listen, nice one for putting up with us over the years. We appreciate it, we fucking love you.”At their very first reunion show, in Cardiff in July, the crowd cheered when the brothers left with“a very perfunctory clap on the back”; after four months on the road, the brothers are now up to full bear hugs. Who knows – Sharon may not need to wait another 27 years to see Oasis again.Explore more on these topicsOasisMelbournePop and rockLiam GallagherNoel GallagherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My reward? A whiteout …An epic rail trip to Sweden’s Arctic north ends with a surreal skiing experience – and waffles for breakfast while sitting out a snowstormKevin RushbySat 1 Nov 2025 03.00 EDTShareThe light coming through the sleeper train window wakes me. It’s nearly time. Climbing down the ladder past the other snoozing occupants, I head into the corridor. A few hours ago there were only trees, an endless unfurling ribbon of spruce and birch. Now there is snow, vast banks of it. And sometimes, when the train roars through a big drift, great spumes of white blast out on either side, blocking any view.In the restaurant car, I watch the map on my phone as a blue dot approaches a straight dashed line. A frozen lake and distant pale mountains appear. Then at 6.09am we cross the Arctic Circle. Forty-eight hours previously, I had been in London St Pancras station, queueing for the Eurostar. Now, five trains later, never having left terra firma, I am in the Arctic. Most of my fellow travellers are Swedes with hefty bags of skis and well-stocked sledges that look expedition-ready. With their weathered faces and lean muscle, they look intimidatingly capable.View image in fullscreenMy plan is a mini-expedition of my own: to ski to thehighest mountain hutin the Swedish Arctic, and get back down in one piece. Because I have never used the particular type of skis required for going uphill, the plan seems ambitious.The train passes through the mining town ofKiruna, then skirts the 43-mile (70km) long lake of Torneträsk. A pair of moose graze on the stunted birch trees. There are no more pines; we have passed beyond their limit of endurance. All around is the ethereal pale beauty of the hills, their summits soft with wind-puffed quiffs of snow powder.At Björkliden, I disembark. The ski station is right next to the railway, which has almost reached its northernmost limit, curling through one more ski village, Riksgränsen, before heading west to the Norwegian port of Narvik. Within two hours of arriving, I am on skis, gingerly tackling a beginners’ slope.Skiing in the Swedish Arctic has some immediate obvious differences to more southerly locations. After the spring equinox, the days are longer. By mid-May there is no darkness at all. You ski under the midnight sun. The weather is changeable and people pay special attention to the wind: the chill factor can be extreme. But there are similarities, too: I am still a wobbly skier. I take it easy. I spend a lot of time talking to veterans of the climb up to Låktatjåkko mountain hut.“It’s 9km,” they tell me. “The last bit can be a challenge.”I practise putting on my skins: long bands that fit over the underside of the skis and make them refuse to go backwards, even downhill. I cannot help wondering if it might be easier to walk, but I am soon corrected. “It’s going to snow heavily tonight. You would just sink up to your waist. And you need the skis to get back down.”View image in fullscreenIn hut pursuit: the writer skiing up towards Låktatjåkko.The advice is to wait for the supply wagon to leave at 10am. It’s a tracked snowplough and will create a route to follow. There are also marker poles every 25 metres. I’m advised to wear an avalanche alarm and carry a lightweight folding shovel.At 10am the next morning, I am outside the hotel, watching a company of Swedish soldiers in white combat suits ski away. The snowcat is loading up with food. There are passengers too. The driver confirms that it is often possible to go up without skiing at all, but there are no more seats.My respect for polar explorers has reached an all-time high. My respect for Sweden, too. What a marvellous country!I set off in the wake of its broad tracks. The ski skins work well. The sun is out, there is no wind and the views are stupendous. Five minutes later, I’m in a whiteout, struggling to spot the next marker pole, the snowcat long gone and its tracks fast disappearing. The temperature is -6C, and the wind is in my face and strengthening. I start counting steps. Despite the cold, I am down to two layers of clothing, wishing I had remembered the advice of the explorer Leo Houlding: “Be bold, start cold.” My respect for polar explorers has reached an all-time high. My respect for Sweden, too. What a marvellous country! They trust people to know their limits, look after themselves and be as tough as reindeer jerky. In my case, I’m not sure their trust is entirely well placed.The final climb, as promised, is a tough one, but then the hut comes into sight, almost buried in snow, looking like the last frozen outpost on the far side of a freezing galaxy. It takes time to find the door.View image in fullscreenLåktatjåkko mountain hut.Photograph: Wolfgang Kaehler/AlamyInside, the custodians, Vilma and Kicki, are preparing waffles with cloudberry jam, and the log burner in the snug is roaring. This astonishing retreat was constructed in the late 1930s and is now an acknowledged classic of its type, with simple bunkrooms, cosy public areas and a sauna. The only other guests are Martin and Johan, local skiers who have just made the harder ascent from Riksgränsen.I munch through a plate of waffles. The top of the mountain is a tantalising 200 metres above the hut. I really want to make it. “Don’t ski,” advises Vilma. “Use snowshoes and just keep heading north.”When blue sky reappears, I strap on the snowshoes and set off. I manage about 100 metres of the climb before the whiteout returns. Using a compass I plod on, but the lack of any visible markers is playing weird tricks on me. I spot a snowmobile up ahead, manned by two soldiers, but as I approach, the soldiers transform into swans and fly away. At that moment, I walk face-first into a snowbank.I spot a snowmobile, manned by two soldiers, but as I approach, they transform into swans. This is my initiation into whiteout disorientationThis is my initiation into whiteout disorientation. Some skiers have reported feeling that they are moving when stationary; others, the opposite. Unhindered by visual reference points, the brain constructs its own reality.I check my altimeter. I am 30 metres below the summit, but I can’t see how to get around this snowbank. My own tracks are now disappearing, so I return to the hut on a compass bearing and reward myself with more waffles.The few day-trippers are gone, the fire is warm and the storm outside howling. Martin and Johan watch the weather anxiously from their armchairs. “Look,” shouts Martin at one point, “blue sky! I think it’s clearing.” But by the time he reaches the window, the whiteout has resumed. The evening passes in a fug of beer, stories and laughter.View image in fullscreenWaffles with cloudberry jam are served in Låktatjåkko mountain hut.Photograph: Mattias FredrikssonIn the morning, the storm is still raging when the snowcat arrives. Martin and Johan are willing to ski down with me, but fearing I will hold them up, I cadge a lift. The next day, I move to Riksgränsen. There is a choice of accommodation, ranging from the boisterous fun of the main hotel to the superlative charm ofNiehku Mountain Villa. Built in the old railway turntable buildings and decorated with a fascinating display of historical photos, this boutique hotel also has an excellent restaurant.Alight here for the aurora borealis: on the Arctic Circle train to northern SwedenRead moreThe next morning, the weather has improved and I am treated to a perfect day on the mountains, happily tootling around on blue runs while watching the experts carve powdery curves down near-vertical mountain slopes. It looks amazingly dangerous, but these locals know their limits. And so do I. Taking the easy route down, I make it to the cafe and order waffles with cloudberry jam.The trip was provided byVisit Sweden.

It is a brilliant pan. As I turn on the heat to crisp the skin on my chicken thighs on the stove top, I can prep the vegetables I will then roast in the same pan. There is a soothing rhythm to this type of cooking, where most of the work is done in the oven. Here, I use jerusalem artichokes, the most delicious of autumn vegetables, parboiled in lemon juice to make them more digestible and then roasted with garlic and onions, until beautifully caramelised, and it’s a marvellous thing to put down on the kitchen table.Crispy chicken and pancetta with roast jerusalem artichokesThe crisp chicken and sweet onions are scented with rosemary and flecked with cubes of pancetta for bursts of salty fat.Prep5 minCook1 hr 30 minServes48bone-in skin-on chicken thighs700g jerusalem artichokesSalt and black pepperJuice of½ lemon4 tbsp olive oil120g diced pancetta2-3 sprigs rosemary1 head garlic3 red onions,peeled, halved and cut into 1cm slices2 tbsp apple balsamic vinegarTake the chicken out of the fridge and leave to come to room temperature. Scrub the jerusalem artichokes in cold water with wire wool or similar, then halve or quarter them, depending on their size; discard any skinny or gnarled ends (don’t worry about bits of skin in the nooks and crannies, because you’re going to simmer them). Put the artichokes in a pan of salted water, add the lemon juice, bring to a boil, then simmer for 15-20 minutes, until they are tender to the point of a knife.Meanwhile, prep the chicken. Generously season the thighs all over. Put a 28-32cm wide shallow ovenproof pan or casserole on a medium heat, add a splash of the oil and the pancetta, then lay in the chicken thighs skin side down. Run your hand down the rosemary sprigs to strip the leaves into the pan, then cut the head of garlic in half, prise apart the cloves (reserve one clove for the salad below) and drop into the pan; discard any skins that fall off. Leave to cook for eight to 10 minutes, until the chicken starts to brown.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Lift the chicken thighs out of the pan, add the onion and artichokes, season generously and stir. Pour over the remaining olive oil and the vinegar, and roast the veg for 20 minutes. Return the chicken thighs to the pan on top of the vegetables and cook for a further 35-40 minutes, until the chicken is brown and crisp and the vegetables caramelised and delicious.

It’s given me such a great sense of freedom and clarity that I was thinking: I should do the same for my recipes. This one, for example, I would file under “magic”, because it comes together (mostly) from the store-cupboard, both in that easy way in which you throw things into a pot until they alchemise, but also because tahini and beans, together with a lemon, can, magically, become the most soothing antidote to cold weather.Tahini beans with basil and pine nutsPrep15 minCook40 minServes2-34 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to finish2 red onions, peeled and finely chopped1 tsp fine sea salt2 lemons, zest of 1 peeled off in strips, then both juiced, to get 5 tbsp4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced5 tbsp sun-dried tomato paste2 tsp aleppo pepper2400g tins butter beans in water, not drained1 vegetable stock cube3 tbsp tahini½ tsp freshly ground black pepper3 tbsp (30g) pine nutsFlatbreads, to serve15g fresh basil, leaves tornPut the oil in a large saucepan on a medium to low heat and, when hot, add the onions, salt and the strips of lemon peel, and cook, stirring, for eight minutes, until very soft and translucent. Add the garlic and fry for a minute or so, just until the smell of raw garlic disappears.Stir in the tomato paste and aleppo pepper, cook for four to five minutes, then tip the beans and their water into the pot. Cook for 10 minutes, then crumble in the stock cube and add the tahini, black pepper and 600ml boiling water. Mix well, turn down the heat to a simmer and leave to bubble away gently for 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice, cook for a further five minutes, then take off the heat.Toast the pine nuts in a small, dry frying pan, stirring so they don’t burn, for four to five minutes, until they turn golden.Heat the flatbreads, then distribute the beans between two or three shallow bowls. Scatter the toasted pine nuts and basil leaves on top, drizzle with plenty of extra-virgin olive oil and serve with the flatbreads alongside.Join Meera Sodha at a specialeventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou be the judgelive.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Iwas vegetarian in the 1980s, so I know how far meat-free sausages have come. In fact, some now taste almost identical to their ultra-processed meaty counterparts. Whether that represents progress depends on your perspective: are we creating healthier, more sustainable alternatives or simply replicating the industrial food system’s problems in plant form?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Veggie sausages split into two main categories. The first are what I call meat analogues, which are usually made with pea protein isolates (plant-based protein) or textured vegetable protein (TVP), a byproduct of the soya bean oil extraction process, and designed to imitate processed sausage meat. The second are made from mashed whole foods, such as chickpeas and vegetables, and are a less processed and more textural veg-love affair.TVP was invented in the 1960s and led to the creation of more processed, roughly textured soya-based products, such asLinda McCartney’s range. Contemporary “sausages”, however, include pea protein isolates and more thickeners, have smoother textures, and are uncannily similar to ultra-processed meat, which often contains a huge amount of plant-based fillers and flavourings to lower the price.I scored all these sausages on flavour first, then factored in additive content, value and sustainability credentials; I didn’t consider their likeness to meat. Today’s test group demonstrates how the industrial food system has evolved and become more processed over time, but even so, three products did stand out.Best overall:Gosh! veggie sausages with sage, lentil & black pepperView image in fullscreen£2 for 240g at Ocado (83p/100g)★★★★★Described by Gosh! as a Cumberland-style sausage, these are made from real ingredients (chickpeas, lentils, beans, herbs and spices) and crisp up and turn golden brown. Sweet, herby and savoury, though a touch dry, so best fried in oil or served with sauce. The only completely artificial additive-free sausage tested, and a detailedsustainability effort. Soya-and palm oil-free, too.Best bargain:Cauldron Lincolnshire sausagesView image in fullscreen£2.60 for 276g at Waitrose (94p/100g)£3.10 for 276g at Morrisons (£1.12/100g)★★★☆☆A modern-style TVP sausage (notvegan, because it contains egg white) in alginate casings that brown well and hold their shape. A pleasant, peppery and herby flavour with rich umami notes of soya, sage and onion. Good, firm bite, but a touch rubbery. Excessive additives, including stabilisers (dicalcium phosphate, methylcellulose).And the rest …This Isn’t pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£3.75 for 270g at Tesco (£1.39/100g)£3.75 for 270g at Sainsbury’s (£1.39/100g)★★★★☆Looks and tastes like an ultra-processed sausage, only better. Full-flavoured, umami-rich and piquant with a sweet note and a hint of sage. Firm, meaty texture. B Corp-certified. Contains thickeners (methylcellulose, konjac, carrageenan, xanthan gum) and pea protein isolate, though.Linda McCartney’s vegan red onion and rosemary sausagesView image in fullscreen£2 for 270g at Morrisons (74p/100g)£2.60 for 270g at Waitrose (96p/100g)★★☆☆☆A retro “sausage” brand founded more than 30 years ago. Made with TVP, which gives these a rough texture that I’ve become rather fond of. Nostalgia aside, I don’t love the taste, which has a strong onion and yeast extract flavour, as well as clear rosemary notes. Firm bite, but pasty. Contains methylcellulose.Heck meat-free chipolatasView image in fullscreen£2 for 300g at Tesco (67p/100g)£2 for 300g at Morrisons (67p/100g)★☆☆☆☆A modern industrial vegan sausage, uniformly pink, with a calcium alginate casing that peels off during cooking. Sweet and peppery with a strange fungal undertone from an overcomplicated ingredients list, including intriguing flavourings in the form of hibiscus, black carrot juice powder and grilled white onion. A nice snap, but a floury texture. Contains methylcellulose and the preservative sodium sulphite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Sweetened with apple, with an unpleasantly intense umami flavour and a coarse, pasty texture. Contains methylcellulose, preservative (potassium lactate) and sulphites.PlantLiving mushroom & leek sausagesView image in fullscreen£2.95 for 300g at Waitrose (98p/100g)★☆☆☆☆A mushroom-based sausage in a sodium alginate casing. Overwhelmingly savoury, dominated by leek and onion, and with a strange, fibrous yet gummy texture that’s hard to swallow. Contains certified sustainable palm oil, methylcellulose and preservative (sodium metabisulphite).Richmond meat-free sausagesView image in fullscreen£1.88 for 304g at Asda (62p/100g)£2.50 for 304g at Waitrose (82p/100g)★☆☆☆☆As awful as these are, they taste almost identical to their meaty cousins, so if you want a plant-based stand-in for an uber-processed pork sausage, these are spot on. These shrivelled, blistered, gummy sticks are as processed as food gets, containing flavourings and stabilisers including sodium alginate, guar gum and methylcellulose. Gets one point for flavour.Beyond sausageView image in fullscreen£4 for 200g at Ocado (£2/100g)£4 for 200g at Morrisons (£2/100g)★☆☆☆☆Pea protein sausages that leakloadsof fat and slurry, leaving dark brown, wrinkled, rubbery sticks. Intensely artificial flavour with an aftertaste that haunted me. Zero points for texture, with an unappetising, bitty mouthfeel of separate rubbery particles. A cocktail of additives, including preservatives, stabilisers and smoke flavouring. Expensiveandrepulsive.Morrisons Plant Revolution herby sausagesView image in fullscreen£2 for 300g at Morrisons (67p/100g)☆☆☆☆☆A retro, dark golden-brown, TVP sausage with a rough surface and an unpleasantly artificial taste reminiscent of packet soup. Pasty, floury and unappealing. Contains methylcellulose and emulsifier (soya lecithins). Zero points!Explore more on these topicsVegetarian food and drinkThe FilterSausagesFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"
