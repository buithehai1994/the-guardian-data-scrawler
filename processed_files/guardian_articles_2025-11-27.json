Is this just fantasy? Neither actually. It’s a bizarre hybrid, an altered hallucinogenic universe. Where up is down and down is up. Everything always slightly out of reach.A world otherwise known as “the day after the budget”. A day when politicians and amateur commentators are guaranteed to talk more doggybollox than on any other day of the year. A day when everyone gets their 15 minutes of shame.Budget 2025: key points at a glanceRead moreIt’s a truth universally acknowledged that the Today presenter in possession of the 8.10 slot with the chancellor on this most auspicious of days is the person who not so secretly believes that they are actually far better qualified to be running the economy than the person who lives at No 11.This year that presenter wasNick Robinson. Amol Rajan must have been gutted to miss out. He, also, is not short of the self-belief there is no job he can’t do better than anyone else. Perhaps next year the BBC will run a gameshow called So You Think You Could Be Chancellor? for all its Today presenters. The winner gets to be interviewed by the runner-up on the day after the night before. Nick and Amol go head-to-head to save the country. Cut out the middle woman.You would have thought thatRachel Reevesmust have got something right. It’s not many chancellors who get a guarded thumbs up from the left wing of the Labour party and the financial markets. That might even be a fiscal first. OK, so all the rightwing politicians and media had wasted no time in trashing the budget as the worst in living memory, but they were always going to say that. Don’t forget that these were the same politicians and commentators who had rushed to praise Liz Truss.To his credit, Nick Robinson did try to keep an open mind. Sort of. Though it’s hard having to bite your lip when you know you could have done so much better. But this wasn’t about him. Not much, anyway. He began with the question of trust. Why should anyone believe her when she had said she wouldn’t be raising income tax? A more than fair question. And one with no real answer.Reeves initially tried to pretend that freezing thresholds didn’t really count as a tax rise, even though it meant more people paying more in tax. Rather, it was a special loophole available to all chancellors: the broken promise that didn’t count as a broken promise because nobody ever expected you to keep it. A bit like Boris Johnson swearing to be faithful.And Rachel wanted us to know that, though these were all her choices, nothing was really her fault. She had been constrained by the figures of the Office forBudgetResponsibility and it was working on Tory productivity figures, which were far worse than Labour productivity figures.Things got stickier when Nick asked Reeves to apologise. A category error. Because no politician ever apologises for anything. Other than occasionally for some offence that a deluded person may have taken. And no chancellor is going to apologise for a budget that is less than 24 hours old. This had all been fair and necessary – £6bn for more spending and £20bn fiscal headroom. There would be no coming back for more in a year’s time. I think we had heard that one before. But here’s hoping.Robinson also sounded doubtful aboutlifting the two-child benefit cap. Perhaps he worries about the wrong kind of families getting the money. Rachel tried to put him right. She was lifting hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty and most families were in work. Hard to argue with that. Only Reeves herself had initially been unwilling to lift the cap and was only forced into a U-turn by a revolt of her own backbenchers. Still, better a sinner that repenteth and all that.We ended with Rachel insisting she would prove the forecasters wrong. She was the Bringer of Growth. There were loads of things that had been too small for the OBR to score but that would miraculously coalesce to supercharge the economy. Things were going to get better. But for now she just wanted a lie down.Earlier in the programme, Robinson had spared 10 minutes for the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride: someone for whom opposition has only fuelled his self-delusion. In his own mind he has upped a gear from someone decidedly third-rate to someone almost second-rate. The less likely he is to inflict any damage the more effective he imagines himself to be.This was definitely the worst budget in the history of the world, said The Melster. Nick tried to put him right: it was the worst budget since the last budget. That’s how these things worked. And before Mel got any ideas, Nick wanted to remind him that he was also spectacularly useless. He was the work and pensions minister who had made record increases to welfare spending. And the Tories also had broken their election promises. Mel shuffled uneasily. Tory tax rises were OK, he mumbled. Labour ones weren’t.For more impartial reporting on the budget we had to rely – as ever – on the Institute for Fiscal Studies briefing. Helen Miller brought out her scorecard. There were some bits that were good, others less so. The real thing to remember was that no party had a firm grasp of how to manage tax reform. The politics always got in the way. And she also wondered how much of this budget would actually happen, given the fact that the tax rises and spending cuts were timed to kick in just before the next election.So it could all just have been a fiction. A budget designed to look like a budget merely because it was that time of year. It made you wonder why we had bothered.A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa CrerarOn Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back with special guests at another extraordinary year, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025The politics sketchRachel ReevesNick RobinsonMel StrideBudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

Deep Rising (1998)Stephen Sommers’ sci-fi horror pulp follows a bunch of scene-stealing character actors playing mercenaries hired to destroy the cruise ship Argonautica for insurance purposes. But a giant mutant octopus has got there first! Among the potential cephalopod fodder are Treat Williams, Kevin J O’Connor, and Famke Janssen as a jewel thief.19.

The highlight of Giuseppe Tornatore’s whimsical hokum is Roth fighting a piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton, rather unfairly depicted as a smug bastard.18. Waterworld (1995)Kevin Costner: Waterworld is ‘beloved around the world’Read moreKevin Costner plays a samurai-like drifter with webbed feet and a souped-up trimaran in this megabudget sci-fi B-movie, set in a future where melting polar ice-caps have flooded the planet.

You have to admire the chutzpah of a film-maker who manages to twist a death toll of 1,500 into an emotionally uplifting tale of emancipation.16. Ship of Fools (1965)View image in fullscreenShip Of Fools.Photograph: Columbia/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockPeasants, flamenco dancers and Nazi eugenicists rub shoulders on a passenger ship sailing from Mexico to Europe in 1933. Stanley Kramer’s epic features Vivien Leigh, in her final role, as a sad divorcee, but it’s Oskar Werner, as the ship’s doctor, and Simone Signoret, as a radical countess, who provide the film with its emotional wallop.15. The Last Voyage (1960)View image in fullscreenRobert Stack in The Last Voyage.Photograph: Cine Text / Allstar/Sportsphoto Ltd. / AllstarThe USS Claridon is ripped apart in an explosion and Robert Stack’s wife (Dorothy Malone) is trapped in their cabin in this gripping proto-disaster pic.

Death on the Nile (1978)View image in fullscreenFrom left, David Niven, Peter Ustinov and Bette DavisPhotograph: RONALD GRANTBette Davis and Angela Lansbury are among the murder suspects on board a Nile paddle steamer in this all-star Agatha Christie whodunit. Peter Ustinov, as Hercule Poirot, fails to stop half the cast being stabbed or shot, which whittles down his suspects to a manageable number. Bags more fun than the2022 remake.13.Dead Calm(1989)View image in fullscreenNicole Kidman in Dead Calm.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarNicole Kidman and Sam Neill play a married couple trying to get over the trauma of their son’s death by taking their yacht for a spin in the Pacific, where they rescue Billy Zane from a sinking schooner.

The Poseidon Adventure (1972)View image in fullscreenThe Poseidon AdventurePhotograph: Moviestore collection Ltd/AlamyThis adaptation of Paul Gallico’s novel is one of the peaks of the 1970s disaster genre. The SS Poseidon is flipped over by a tsunami, and it’s up to Reverend Gene Hackman to lead his flock through the upturned hull to safety. Shelley Winters is unforgettable as a shopkeeper’s wife with a useful history of competitive swimming.9.

It’s a nightmare journey into the heart of darkness, the title of Joseph Conrad’s 1899 anti-colonial novella that inspired Francis Ford Coppola and John Milius’s screenplay.4. Lifeboat (1944)View image in fullscreenLifeboatPhotograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarAlfred Hitchcock’s wartime survival drama, adapted from a John Steinbeck novella, is a case study in how to film a handful of characters in a cramped location and keep it thrilling. Among the survivors stranded in a lifeboat after their ship is torpedoed are Tallulah Bankhead, as a journalist who offers her diamond bracelet as fish bait, and Walter Slezak as a sneaky German.3.

A bigger boat might have been advisable.2.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)View image in fullscreenRussell Crowe in Master and Commander.Photograph: Stephen Vaughan/APRussell Crowe and Paul Bettany play mismatched nautical chums, Captain Jack Aubrey and nature-loving Dr Stephen Maturin, in Peter Weir’s exemplary conflation of two Patrick O’Brian novels.

Booming cannon, amputation, superstition, sea-shanties and not a single duff note.1.

What do they get out of it?Paula CocozzaThu 27 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 20.08 ESTShareAfew hours into Brittany Witt’s boudoir shoot, with the mimosas kicking in and the music going strong, the photographer asked: “How do we feel about some completely nude photos?” Witt was lying on the bed in lingerie, in a studio in Texas, and hadn’t considered nudity an option. “I was like: ‘OK, we’re on this trust path.’” She undressed. The photographer, JoAnna Moore, covered Witt with body oil and squirted her with water, then asked her “to crawl across the floor with my full trust,” Witt says. “I did so. The pose was nude, and it was completely open. I wasn’t covered with a sheet. It was all out, it was all open, and it brought that worst level of self-doubt. I was terrified.”Witt, 33, has come to see that terror as an important part of her experience. She used to be a competitive weightlifter. “I had a very masculine aura. I showed up in strength,” she says. At school and work – in the construction side of the oil and gas industry – she was “type A – scheduler, planner, had everything together, kind of led the group”. A turbulent home life when she was growing up led her to develop robust protection mechanisms which, in adulthood, acted as a block to relationships – issues she had been addressing with a life coach. But in that moment, on all-fours in Moore’s studio: “I felt those protections stripped away. There was nothing to hide behind, literally, figuratively.”The resulting photograph is one of her favourites. “It was the combination of everything I was, and it looked phenomenal. You can tell who I thought I was in that picture. And what box IthoughtI fit in – but also all the things Ididn’t thinkI was, and which that picture allowed me to be. It’s a strength position. But you also have this intense vulnerability and openness, softness and beauty. It’s the picture that captured everything.”View image in fullscreenMakeda … ‘It’s enough to know Icanlook like this.’Photograph: Elizabeth OkohWitt is one of a growing number of women who are paying for a boudoir shoot – often up to several thousands of dollars or pounds. Initially popular among brides looking for an add-on to their wedding photography, or a gift to their partner, boudoir has evolved into its own genre. All kinds of reasons lead women – and it is still mostly women, though male or “dudeoir” photography is on the rise too – to boudoir, from milestone birthdays, a cancer diagnosis, divorce, surviving domestic abuse to weight loss and gain, pregnancy and childbirth.“There is no one this is off-limits to,” says Shawn Black, who runs the Association of International Boudoir Photographers, and who has himself been photographed naked under a sheet. “It’s not taboo, it’s not scandalous, it’s not pornography. My philosophy has nothing to do with sex. It has to do with strength, it has to do with confidence, with pulling that thing out of you that makes you shine. I’ve shot everyone from your everyday housewife to politicians. I’ve shot attorneys, judges, doctors, surgeons. I’ve shot from age 21 to 73.”Many women show no one their photos. So why do it? Judging by Witt’s experience, something seems to happen in the space of the boudoir studio that is about more than undressing and being photographed – and whatever it is makes women feel their lives are permanently changed.Susan Lausier, 61, has been photographed by Black in Boston each year since turning 58, when a younger friend encouraged her to go. It was not the sort of thing Lausier would normally do. “Hell, no. I was super shy,” she says. At high school she had a core group of three friends, didn’t do any extracurricular activities and found eye contact hard. “I didn’t want to take up the attention … Let me melt into the background. Never thought I was attractive. Never comfortable in my skin.” At parties, she would sit on the couch and wait for others to initiate conversation.We’re brought up to criticise ourselves. But in that moment, and when I shared my photos, I wanted everybody to look at meAt first, Lausier booked her shoot as a gift for her husband. “It was coming up to my 30th wedding anniversary. I’m like, you know what? Let me do this.” But after five minutes, Black showed her the back of his camera. “And I’m like: ‘That’s not me.’” The woman Lausier saw was lying on a bed with her feet against a headboard, looking back directly at the camera. At that moment, she says: “It was no longer a gift for my husband. It was all for me.”Lausier walked out of the studio “feeling like I could do anything”. The experience “has transformed everything” and “absolutely gone into my regular life” – but not in the ways she expected.Lausier had to wait a couple of months for her studio “reveal”. The slideshow of photographs is a key component of the boudoir experience. Black, who has been shooting boudoir since 2013, asks people to attend alone. “I always aim for one of three reactions,” he says. “Stunned silence, tears, or uncontrollable profanity.”For Lausier, it was stunned silence. “I never felt so beautiful.”Her husband, the intended beneficiary, was nonplussed when he saw the images. He liked them, but he couldn’t understand why Lausier had thought them necessary. Shortly after her reveal, Lausier was laid off from her job in a hospital, where she had worked for 38 years. “What the heck do I do now?” she thought. Her boxing gym was advertising for a general manager – not something she would normally have considered. But her shoot made her feel differently about herself. “Let me just try it. What’s the worst that can happen?” she told herself. She went for the job “with full force” and got it.So what did the shoot give Lausier that she didn’t have before – and couldn’t get some other way? “I try to explain it and say: ‘This is how I felt going in. This is how I felt coming out. This is how I felt with my reveal.’ And I know there’s a personal transformation that happens internally in the moment. Ifeltthe transformation,” she says. One of Lausier’s images hangs on the bedroom wall, and the photo albums sit on her coffee table – but most of all, she says: “It’s released me from my thoughts. I dress the same [as before the shoot], but I don’t compare myself to anybody any more. It’s just like: ‘This is me.’ And I never thought ‘me’ was enough for other people.”Lausier’s experience of a lived change that extends far beyond the photographic studio is echoed by others. Makeda Blake-Robinson, 38, from south London,initially booked in with photographer Elizabeth Okoh “to embrace” her altered body shape after becoming a mother. She is a district nurse, and during the Covid pandemic, when close family members were vulnerable with diabetes, “I felt stuck,” she says. “I was getting scared.” Her marriage had ended, and at 33,she wrote her will. “I might not have much,” she says, but it was important to put things in place for her son.It was in this frame of mind, with a sharpened sense of mortality, and the sense that “it was nice to live”, that she met Okoh at a studio in Battersea. She didn’t tell friends or family what she was doing. “I bought it myself. I did it by myself.” As a parent, “You always overextend yourself. Sometimes you miss yourself,” she says. As a child, she wanted to be a model for C&A or Tammy Girl, but never told anyone. In her photographs, she styled herself and saw “a Makeda who is confident, a go-getter”. Her pictures hang on the walls of her home – her dad sometimes wishes he didn’t have to see his daughter in Victoria’s Secret when he visits. She knows she doesn’t always look like that, but says: “It’s enough to know Icanlook like that.”View image in fullscreenBrittany: ‘I felt those protections stripped away. There was nothing to hide behind, literally, figuratively’Blake-Robinson has since had four more shoots. Since her first, she has “felt able to travel by myself”. She has taken solo holidays – something she would never have done before. “I know now that I can do things by myself,” she says. She used to follow beauty trends – threading, waxing, laser. But now it is enough “to be comfortable within myself”. At the last Notting Hill carnival, she swerved her usual baggy T-shirt for a wire bra and peacock feathers.Stories of transformation abound in the world of boudoir. Witt started a new relationship around the time of her shoot. Her photographs helped her to “show up differently” with her new partner, at work, and in her friendships, she says. The self she saw “helped me take off all the armour of the different roles I play”. In a few weeks, she and her partner are getting married.But why is it necessary to strip off to have this experience? If it’s not about sex – as all these women say – why do it in lingerie or less? “There’s a desire to be fully seen, not just physically but emotionally,” Witt says. “To be fully loved for what we are as human beings, as women.”“Society as a whole has done a great job of telling women what they should and shouldn’t look like,” says Moore, who photographed Witt. “Boudoir strips all that away. When you take away your clothes, you’re left to deal with what you actually look like, what you are at your core.” When women undress for a boudoir shoot, they divest themselves of their preconceptions of what a desirable body looks like and are able to look at their body as it is, “appreciating it and realising that it was handcrafted and created beautifully”.Moore switched from working as a paralegal to wedding photography. Her first foray into boudoir was to ask members of her Bible study group to pose for her. At her studios in New York and Texas, she usually initiates a “stern conversation” with clients, advising them that she won’t edit out bodily features. From cellulite to tummy tuck scars, C-section scars and stretch marks, “If it’s going to be part of your body six months from now, it’s staying in the photo.” Posing clients both to show and to hide these features offers them the chance, Moore says, to like what they had previously feared or judged. To see themselves with a different eye. “This is where the mental change happens.”She won’t edit out bodily features – from cellulite to tummy tuck scars, C-section scars and stretch marks“It’s magical,” says Kay Davies, 42. She has been photographed twice, by Laura Slater AKA Lumiere Photographic, once alone and once with her partner. Her favourite image, the one she put above her bed, shows her head tipped back to reveal the scar from the tracheostomy she had when she contracted Covid and pneumonia in 2020, and spent 33 days in a coma. “I’ve been told in no uncertain terms, I was nearly gone,” she says. The shoot in North Yorkshire, on a random Monday, was a way to celebrate the body that got her through it. “I had a bra and a thong on, and I was more confident in that than I am sometimes in clothes,” she says. “We’re brought up to criticise ourselves. But in that moment, and when I shared my photos [on social media], I wanted everybody to look at me. I wanted everybody to go: ‘Yeah, she looks good.’”Davies spent £1,000 on her shoots. She would like to bottle the feeling that overwhelmed her in Slater’s studio – “I was so strong, I could do anything” – then “give it to people when they’re feeling a bit down”. Her photographs act as her own bottled cure. She looks at them, on her phone or memory stick, or in her box of prints, “probably once a month”, when she’s “not feeling great”, or just to look again at something that felt so good. “It’s a bit weird thinking I want to look at myself in underwear, but honestly the day I did it, I did not want that day to end.”The photographs offer people a way to see themselves as they’ve never pictured themselves. They can overturn the damage of decades of objectification – the word “empowering” is emblazoned across most photographers’ websites and testimonials are full of the same, the “release” and “renewal” – but aren’t the images objectifying?“I can only take on what it was for me,” Witt says. “And for me it’s not that. Can I control if that’s what it is to other people? No.”“I think the intent of the photos makes it not objectification,” Moore says. She prefers to think of them as a form of self-appreciation. “I feel like that might not be a bad thing. Being raised in the church, we are supposed to love others as we love ourselves. Which means we have to love ourselves first.”And although the images might look like the product of a male gaze, maybe that is the boudoir sleight of hand: to imitate that, while really offering a benign, appreciative and generous lens through which a person is not only seen differently, but taught to see themselves differently. As Blake-Robinson puts it: “I feel like I’m a star in my own show.”This article was amended on 27 November 2025 to amend the credit for the top photograph; it is by Shawn Black.Explore more on these topicsWomenPhotographyMental healthFeminismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Patients were put through the unthinkableTwenty years after the first face transplant, patients are dying, data is missing, and the experimental procedure’s future hangs in the balanceFay Bound AlbertiThu 27 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 06.02 ESTShareIn the early hours of 28 May 2005, Isabelle Dinoire woke up in a pool of blood. After fighting with her family the night before, she turned to alcohol and sleeping tablets “to forget”, she later said.Reaching for a cigarette out of habit, she realized she couldn’t hold it between her lips. She understood something was wrong.Isabelle crawled to the bedroom mirror. In shock, she stared at her reflection: her nose, lips, and parts of her cheeks were gone, replaced by a raw, mangled wound.While Isabelle was unconscious, her beloved dog Tania, a cross between a Labrador and a Beauceron, had chewed away her features.“I could see a pool of blood next to me,” Isabelletoldthe BBC. “And the dog was licking the blood. But I couldn’t imagine that it was my blood or my face.”On 27 November 2005, Isabelle received the world’s first face transplant at University Hospital, CHU Amiens-Picardie, in northern France. The surgery was part of an emerging field calledvascularized composite allotransplantation(VCA), that transplants parts of the body as a unit: skin, muscle, bone and nerves.Two teams, overseen by Bernard Devauchelle, Sylvie Testelin and Jean-Michel Dubernard, grafted a donor’s nose, lips and chin onto Isabelle’s skull. The donor, a 46-year-old woman, had died by suicide. The donor graft was painstakingly attached: sensory nerves to restore feeling, motor nerve fibres for movement, arteries and veins to establish blood flow. The operation involved 50 people and took more than 15 hours.The results werepresentedto the press the following February, when Isabelle amazed the world by speaking through her new mouth and drinking water from a cup. “I now have a face like everyone else,” she said. “A door to the future is opening.”The case for face transplants seemingly made, several teams scrambled to perform their nation’s first. The US saw the first partial face transplant (2008), then the first full one (2011); the first African American recipient (2019); the first face and double hand transplant combined (2020); the first to include an eye (2023). There have been about 50 face transplants to date, and each milestone brought new grants, donations and prestige for the doctors and institutions involved.The patients, meanwhile, continue on living as they can. Some of them, like Isabelle, have suffered greatly. Others, like Joe DiMeo, who received the world’s first double hand and face transplant at NYU Langone in 2020, find new ways to forge a career by selling their stories online. But he and his wife Jessica, a nurse, are constantly trolled, and the spectre of rejection never leaves.View image in fullscreenJessica and Joe DiMeo (the first double hand and face transplant recipient).Photograph: April KirbyFor the past six years, I have been researching the history of face transplants, interviewing surgeons and patients in the US, France, China, Spain, Italy, Mexico and Canada. I have contributed to surgical articles and conferences, brought patient voices to the table, and advised on a critical Department of Defense-funded study to regulate all kinds of VCA.What I’ve found is alarming: it’s a field where negative data is often buried, driven by funding battles and institutional rivalry. In places where publicity functions as marketing, some clinics expose patients to intrusive media attention. Support networks are uneven, and few patients are prepared for the toll of lifelong immunosuppressants. Add to this picture a set of ethical challenges: face transplants take otherwise healthy people with disfigured faces and turn them into lifetime patients.People tend to remember a dramatic “before and after”. The reality is different.Dallas Wiensthought he’d won the medical lottery when he became America’s first full face transplant recipient in 2011. The 25-year-old electrician was electrocuted while painting a church; this destroyed his face and his sight. Dallas worried that his daughter Scarlette would be bullied for how he looked. He wanted to give “something back” to veterans. He wanted to be able to hail a cab.Like Isabelle, Dallas was grateful to his donor and surgeons. He attended medical conferences so surgeons could see the results. He met prospective patients and was courted by global media as proof that face transplants worked.For several years, the narrative held; then reality intruded.The anti-rejection drugs that kept his new face alive destroyed his kidneys. Dallas had repeated episodes of rejection, each requiring stronger immunosuppression. He lived in Texas, in poverty, with his beloved wife Annalyn, who was also blind. Dallas’ primary medication alone cost $120 per month, a significant expense on disability benefits.“It’s one thing to be told about risks,” Dallas told me when his kidneys were failing. “It’s another thing to experience them.”In the US, now the world’s leader in face transplants, the Department of Defense has bankrolled most operations, treating them as a frontier for wounded veterans while private insurers refuse to cover the costs.With insurance unwilling to pay until the field proves its worth, surgeons have been eager to show results. A 2024JAMA Surgery studyreported five-year graft survival of 85% and 10-year survival of 74%, concluding that these outcomes make face transplantation “an effective reconstructive option for patients with severe facial defects”.Yet patients like Dallas tell a different story. The study measures survival, but not other outcomes such as psychological wellbeing, impact on intimacy, social life and family functioning, or even comparisons with reconstruction.Most surgeons care about their patients, though they will have their own personal ambitions. Globally, there are perhaps 20 (mostly male) specialized surgeons capable of face transplants; nobody could become part of that elite group without ambition, for themselves, and for the field. And what can they do, surgeons say, if the system doesn’t provide?It’s a double-bind. Without proof of success, face transplants are experimental. And because the procedures are experimental, patients’ long-term needs aren’t covered by grants, leaving patients to carry the burden.View image in fullscreenDallas and Annalyn Wiens. Dallas died in 2024 of kidney failure.Photograph: April Kirby“I don’t have $100 for Ubers to and from hospital,” Dallas said, explaining how public transport led to infections, given his weakened immune system, and infections could make his face reject. “But if I don’t attend, it can be seen as non-compliance. Is that fair?”On 27 September 2024, Dallas died suddenly at his home in Fort Worth. His death certificate lists complications due to electrocution, his original 2008 accident. His wife Annalyn still doesn’t know what happened. “His body gave up,” she said. “He was constantly tested and made to feel like a guinea pig. I wanted his body to be left alone.”Annalyn had Dallas’ body cremated quickly, fearful that the DoD or Yale would want it for research. Neither did, but it says something about the gap between surgical intentions and patient experiences that this was her fear.That fear was also expressed privately to me by a member of Isabelle’s immediate family, who wants to remain anonymous. From their perspective, Isabelle’s face transplant was not a success, despite launching an entire field.In fact, nobody expected France to do the first face transplant. Those in the know presumed it would be Cleveland Clinic, where Maria Siemionow had spent years refining the method and the ethics.In contrast, Devauchelle’s first application for ethical approval was rejected. In the early 2000s, French ethicists were, like those in the UK, concerned about immunosuppressant risks – and psychological ones. How could anyone cope with seeing another person’s face in the mirror?For his next, successful bid, Devauchelle teamed up with Dubernard, who was not only an influential member of the French National Assembly, but also the surgeon who had made history in 1998 with theworld’s first hand transplant. And making history has always brought glory, especially for transplant surgeons.What of Isabelle? Three months before her operation, she signed a contract with British documentary maker Michael Hughes, agreeing to let cameras document her transformation in exchange for payment. The Times of Londonrevealedthis deal, showing how a vulnerable, suicidal woman with no face had been effectively “sold” even before surgery. Isabelle was swayed by the promise of a bright future, though that never transpired.Describing how he watched the blood flow into Isabelle’s lips in surgery, Dubernard compared himself to the prince who awakened Sleeping Beauty, adding: “I still see her image among the stars in my dreams”.Isabelle felt less like a princess than acircus animal.After the transplant, she spoke of being tormented: “Everyone would say: Have you seen her? It’s her. It’s her … And so I stopped going out completely.”Living with a stranger’s face was as psychologically difficult as ethicists feared. Two years after the transplant shespoketo the strangeness of having “someone else’s” mouth. “It was odd to touch it with my tongue. It was soft. It was horrible.”And then one day she found a new hair on her chin – “It was odd. I’d never had one. I thought, ‘It’s me that has given it life, but the hair is hers.’”Surgeons and ethicists observed that Isabelle wasn’t given proper alternatives, and she wasn’t in a good state of mind; the most the French team has conceded is that she wasn’t an “ideal patient”.Isabelle might have fared better in a country like Finland, where transplants are anonymous. Patients and families are not harassed by journalists – as Isabelle and her family were – and clinics don’t use patients as media opportunities.Instead, Isabelle never resumed a normal life, never returned to work or good mental health, and from 2013 experienced regular episodes of rejection. In 2010 she contracted cervical cancer, followed by lung cancer. She died in 2016, though her surgeons deny this was connected to immunosuppressant use.In fact, Isabelle’s face died before she did; after it became necrotic, it was removed and replaced with a graft from her thigh. As she told her family, she “didn’t want to die without a face”.I also learned from Isabelle’s immediate family member that her wellbeing declined dramatically after her transplant, and that she was in “psychological distress” when consenting for the procedure. “They took her away from us, so we didn’t have the power to dissuade or counsel her.” And after each psychiatric appointment, she would come home “at the lowest, full of guilt and suicidal desires”. More than once, according to her, she attempted suicide after her transplant; this story isn’t part of the record.Robert Chelsea, the first African American to receive a new face, wanted to kiss his daughter’s cheek. Now he can, but his daughter can’t look at him the same way.“Only when he opens his mouth, I know it’s him”, she says, otherwise he’s a stranger. Today, Robert is in and out of hospital and unable to find income.Robert knows race makes a difference – the sinister history of medicalexperimentation on Black bodiesmeans African Americans are less likely to donate organs of any kind. And scientific medicine privileges whiteness; until Robert’s surgery, the hospital hadn’t considered that donors with a wide range of skin colours were needed.View image in fullscreenRobert Chelsea, the first African American face transplant recipient.Photograph: Lol CrawleyOnce a successful businessman, Robert is now reliant on GoFundMe campaigns; his car has been repossessed, and he can’t get to church. He suffers through rejections and infections, and he cannot afford caregivers. Sometimes, he gets so weak he can’t even call an ambulance. And if he did, that would be an extra cost he can’t afford either. Aftercare is the biggest issue for US face transplant recipients. Yet the JAMA study only measured outcomes by graft survival; not whether patients could work, afford medications, maintain relationships. It did not track financial ruin, mental health or quality of life. It counted 10 deaths but not how people died or what their final years were like.No one tracked Dallas’s failing kidneys or Robert’s repossessed car.These patients are pioneers. During the second world war, plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe treated severely burned pilots. His patients formed theGuinea Pig Club,a brotherhood that acknowledged their experimental status openly. They received lifelong care, peer support, and recognition for their contribution to advancing surgery. We can’t say the same for face transplant recipients.One question remains: how can science and medicine ethically innovate, without knowing what has gone before?Most innovation follows the same trend: the possibility is raised, there’s ethical debates, someone breaks cover and there’s a race to join in.These innovations usually end one of three ways: they fade quietly into history, they implode in scandal, or they mature into a stable, standardized practice.Reality is now forcing that question for face transplants. Roughly 20% of patients have died – from rejection, kidney failure, heart failure. That’s an unacceptably high toll for an elective, supposedly “life-enhancing” procedure, especially when we still can’t agree on who is an ideal candidate, how to measure success, or what long-term support actually looks like.We have seen this before – in lobotomy, a field that faded out. The Portuguese physician Egas Moniz won the Nobel Prize for developing lobotomy in 1949 and 3,500 brutal procedures were performed.The same arc unfolded for vaginal meshes in the 1990s. Introduced with great fanfare, they caused chronic pain and organ damage, led to millions in lawsuits, and became synonymous with prioritizing profits over patient safety. Unlike face transplants, vaginal mesh victims found strength in numbers – 100,000 alone in the US took legal action.A more successful innovation story is IVF, which moved from controversial “test-tube baby” experiments into mainstream medicine by rigorous patient selection, improved safety standards, and proper regulation – all of which were led by surgeons.Which path will face transplants take? The numbers are already slipping – fewer procedures since the 2010s as outcomes falter and budgets shrink. And unless the field raises its standards, enforces rigorous follow-up, and commits to transparent, systematic data sharing that actually includes patients and their families, there’s no way to demonstrate real success. Without that, face transplants aren’t headed for evolution or stability; they’re headed straight for the dustbin of medical history.Isabelle’s loved one is watching closely. It is not easy for her to speak out, even now, for fear that the family will be harassed by journalists. But, she says, “I must find the strength.”“Isabelle did not want the transplants to continue. She had collected documents to prove the various dysfunctions and told me that after her death I could talk about everything because during her lifetime, she feared the medical team, the pressure was too strong.”She felt obliged to be upbeat, to represent innovation success, whatever the cost – an insurmountable amount of pressure for someone who is already vulnerable“You only hear from the complainers,” one delegate told me earlier this year, after I spoke at a talk to face transplant surgeons at an international conference in Helsinki. “The happy patients are quietly living their lives.”Such claims are meaningless without accurate data. And patients are often scared to tell surgeons the truth; even without the power imbalances of healthcare, people feel ungrateful or worry about being a “bad patient”.Yet they are the only ones who know if face transplants are a success. They are the ones who live with the reality of a face transplant after the news has broken and the cameras move on.Are things changing? Not fast enough. The same pattern repeats with each innovation: surgeons pioneer, patients sacrifice, papers get published, the field moves on.I saw Robert recently in an online meeting to discuss a Department of Defense grant aimed at improving standards. He had recently left the hospital after another round of rejection, and was one of three patients sharing experiences.He looked tired and unimpressed.“Everybody here is getting paid,” he said. “Except us. Who is feeding our children, while we are making history?”Fay Bound-Alberti is professor of Modern History at King’s College London.

A trade union source told the Guardian: “They’ve capitulated and there may be more to come.”The Trades Union Congress said it was prepared to accept the compromise arrangement, after days of negotiation. “The absolute priority now is to get these rights – like day-one sick pay – on the statute book so that working people can start benefiting from them from next April,” said its general secretary, Paul Nowak.A TUC source said there was a view that the six-month threshold was more workable than the more loosely defined nine-month probation period, which will be scrapped.But MPs are likely to be unnerved by the breach of Labour’s manifesto, which promised “day one” protection against unfair dismissal, while trade unions descended into infighting over the 11th-hour change.The reversal adds pressure to ministers already battling accusations that Rachel Reeves’s budget broke Labour’s pre-election promises not to raise taxes on working people.Kyle has replaced Jonathan Reynolds as business secretary, the latter having steered through the legislation with the former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner.A source close to Rayner said she would respond once she had talked to other MPs. Just weeks ago, the former deputy prime minister gave a speech in the chamber that vigorously defended day-one protections.Kyle committedon Monday to ensuring businesses would not “lose” as a result of the changes, which included a ban on zero-hours contracts and day-one protections for workers against unfair dismissal.“I will not allow it to become zero-sum, [you] give one to the other, the other loses … This has to be got right,” he said.Leaders from six major business lobby groups welcomed the breakthrough with relief, following days of behind-closed-doors meetings with the TUC, six unions and ministers at the Department for Business and Trade.In a joint statement, the lobby groups said the move was “crucial for business confidence to hire and to support employment, at the same time as protecting workers”.A union source said the changes had been agreed to allow the bill to progress faster through the House of Lords, which hassignificantly delayed the legislation. It will mean the qualifying period for unfair dismissal will be reduced from two years to six months.One senior union figure said: “If ping pong had gone beyond Christmas, sick pay from day one would have been lost from April, and other new rights could have been delayed beyond April 2027.”Another called the agreement a “good outcome” that would enshrine workplace protections in law from six months of employment. “The Tories cannot come back in and just extend the period to two years.“Bluntly, the biggest thing is there is no threat to delay the legislation – it will be in by Christmas and employers have to get behind that.”The deal marks a dramatic shift from union leaders, and exposes a schism between some of Labour’s largest financial backers. As recently as last month the TUC had been warning that a six-month period would leave more than 2 million workers at risk of unfair sacking.The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said the bill was now a “shell of its former self” as she made clear her objection to the deal reached with other trade unions. “These constant row-backs will only damage workers’ confidence that the protections promised will be worth the wait. Labour needs to keep its promises,” she said.The bill originally promised that the qualifying period for unfair dismissal would be removed altogether and the government had proposed a lighter-touch probation period that businesses could use instead, limited in law to nine months. That probation period will now be removed and the law will make it impossible for an employee to claim unfair dismissal if they have been in post for less than six months.‘Out of touch’ hereditary peers criticised for voting against workers’ rightsRead moreUnions insisted they had won concessions, including on costs, but the move is likely to anger leftwing Labour MPs who regarded the employment rights bill as a key offering.The bill has beenamended three times by Tory and Liberal Democrat peersin the Lords to accommodate key business demands. Kyle had said he would do “what it takes” to unblock parliamentary hold-ups to the bill because of Lords amendments, before then consulting on its implementation.“The voice of business, the voice of people who work in business, will be heard when we get down into the weeds of implementing those key parts of the employment rights bill. And yes, I’m talking about zero-hours contracts and day-one rights,” he said.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said it was “another humiliating U-turn”.“Labour talk about stability, but govern in chaos. No company can plan, invest or hire with this level of uncertainty hanging over them.”She said the bill still contained measures that would “damage businesses and be terrible for economic growth, and the Conservatives will fight every single one. If Labour won’t scrap the worst elements of this awful bill, we will. Britain cannot build prosperity with more and more bureaucracy.”The Department of Business and Trade said the outcome was the result of a compromise process. “The government was pleased to facilitate these discussions and to set an example of the benefits of working together, and remains committed to continue engaging with trade unions, business and employers to make working lives better, support businesses and, vitally, deliver economic growth and good job creation,” it said in a statement.Bosses had been warning that the bill would add to pressures on employers given a slowdown in the jobs market, with the potential to hit the recruitment of young and vulnerable people in particular.The six business lobby groups said: “Businesses will be relieved that the government has agreed to a key amendment to the employment rights bill which can pave the way to its initial acceptance.”However, they said there were several key points where bosses still held reservations, including on rights for zero-hours contract workers to guaranteed hours and more powers for trade union organisation.Explore more on these topicsEmployment lawEconomic policyWorkers' rightsTrade unionsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It’s reminiscent of the fiscal fictions of recent years. I hope this is a government able to deliver on its plans. But I have my doubts,” she said.The chancellor’s growth mission is missing in action | Nils PratleyRead moreThe thinktank also raised questions about the government’sfuture plans for supporting children with special needs, after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) identified what it said could be a £6bn future funding shortfall.Labour MPs in Westminster absorbed the potential impact of hefty future tax increases, albeit to fund measures many welcome, including the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap.One backbencher said: “Our number one priority is supposed to be about getting the cost of living down. But this budget makes most of my voters poorer in an election year. Young people, who are going Green, are particularly screwed. I don’t understand how this is supposed to work.”Another said: “It’s been smartly designed to narrowly hit the landing zone between PLP [the parliamentary Labour party] and market kicking off. But nonetheless leaves you in the same cycle of shit.”Treasury sources pointed to Reeves’s determination to “defy” OBR forecasts and deliver stronger economic growth, potentially avoiding the need for a pre-election squeeze. She also hopes to bring down government borrowing costs by reassuring bond markets.Keir Starmersaid on Thursdaythat Reeves’s £26bn tax-raising budget had “kept to our manifesto”, but conceded that Labour had “asked everybody to contribute” in the years ahead.“That is because we need to protect our NHS to make sure that it’s there for people when they need it. Secondly, to make sure that we’ve got the money to put into our schools and … the third thing is to bear down on the cost of living,” he told Sky News.In its analysis of the budget, theResolution Foundation saidReeves’s biggest revenue raiser, the three-year freeze on income tax and national insurance thresholds, would hit poorer households harder than raising income tax rates – a policy that would have breached the letter of Labour’s election promises.“Ironically, sticking to her manifesto tax pledge has cost millions of low-to-middle earners, who would have been better off with their tax rates rising than their thresholds being frozen,” said the thinktank’s director, Ruth Curtice.A 1p tax rise would have raised the same amount of money but been less costly than freezing thresholds for anyone with an income below £35,000, she said, adding: “Indeed, all but the top 10% of the income distribution are worse off because of opting for threshold freezes over rate rises.”Some MPs have expressed concern aboutthe threshold freeze, which is expected to bring 920,000 additional people paying the higher rate of income tax, as their salaries rise.One minister said: “Millions and millions of people are fuming about the prospect of becoming higher rate taxpayers on jobs that pay just double the minimum wage. This is not the sign of a strong economy.”MPs were also sharing analysis by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), based on OBR forecasts, that showed despite the government’s cost of living measures, including cuts to household energy bills, consumers were on track for “the bleakest parliament on record for living standards”.JRF said the average household would be £850 a year worse off by 2029-30 than when Labour had come to power, with those at the top end of the income scale hit hardest, as Reeves targets them with tax rises.In Wednesday’s well-trailed budget, the chancellor said borrowing would be higher than planned for the next three years, before falling back sharply by 2029-30 when her fiscal rules are judged. She plans to achieve this through backdated tax rises, including the threshold freeze; and by squeezing Whitehall budgets.Labour is now promising to increase day-to-day departmental spending by just 0.5% in real terms in 2028-29 and 2029-30 – half the rate previously planned.Miller, of the IFS, expressed scepticism about whether that would be achievable. “Perhaps the government really will be able to find new efficiency savings. Or, maybe, when the time comes, and as the election looms, it will find that the spending plans are unrealistically low.”Contrary to expectations, the downgrade to the OBR’s economic forecasts was modest, wiping just £6bn off Reeves’s headroom against her fiscal rules by the end of the forecast period.Ministers face calls to explain how £6bn Send funding hole will be paid forRead moreMiller said that meant the “fiscal repair job” required in the budget was minor; but Reeves had chosen to increase spending, including to cover U-turns on disability cuts and the winter fuel allowance, as well as aiming to meet her rules with a much bigger buffer to spare.The Conservatives have dismissed Reeves’s budget as aimed at “Benefits Street”. However, analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) shows that 70% of the additional spending from abolishing the two-child limit will go to working families. The thinktank also said that the overall welfare budget as a share of GDP was due to remain flat, between last year’s general election and 2031.Prof Ashwin Kumar, the IPPR’s director of research and policy, said: “This was a budget for working parents who are doing their best in increasingly tough circumstances. Abolishing the two-child limit is targeted, sensible and fair. It supports families who need it most, reduces child poverty and saves the public money in the long run.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Institute for Fiscal StudiesBudgetRachel ReevesThinktanksTax and spendingLabournewsShareReuse this content"

She’s no longer with us,” Trump said in his first live remarks since the shooting.Beckstrom, 20, was one of two members of the national guardsshot near the White House in a targeted attack. The other member, Andrew Wolfe, 24, is still fighting for his life, according to the president.Beckstrom’s father hadtold the New York Timesin a phone call earlier in the day that his daughter was unlikely to recover. “I’m holding her hand right now,” Gary Beckstrom said. “She has a mortal wound. It’s not going to be a recovery.”Both Beckstrom and Wolfe belonged to the West Virginia National Guard, which deployed hundreds of troops to Washington as part of Trump’s crime-fighting mission in the capital.On Thursday, West Virginia’s governor, Patrick Morrisey, confirmed Beckstrom’s death in a social media post: “Sarah served with courage, extraordinary resolve, and an unwavering sense of duty to her state and to her nation. She answered the call to serve, stepped forward willingly, and carried out her mission with the strength and character that define the very best of the West Virginia National Guard.”Beckstrom, from Webster Springs, West Virginia, entered service in June 2023.Authorities have identified the suspect in the attack as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29.Little is known yet about his life, but officials have confirmed that Lakanwal came to the US in September 2021 from his native Afghanistan under a program that gave some Afghans who had worked for the US government entry visas. He was granted asylum in April this year, under the Trump administration, Reuters reported. Lakanwalworked with CIA-backed military unitsduring the US war in Afghanistan, the CIA has confirmed.A resident of eastern Afghanistan who identified himself as Lakanwal’s cousin told the Associated Press that he was originally from the province of Khost. The cousin, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said Lakanwal had worked in a special Afghan Army unit.A former official from the unit, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said Lakanwal was a team leader and his brother was a platoon leader.The cousin said Lakanwal started out working as a security guard for the unit in 2012, and was later promoted to become a team leader and a GPS specialist.Lakanwal’s former landlord, Kristina Widman, said Lakanwal had been living in Washington state with his wife and five children.Jeanine Pirro, US attorney for Washington DC, said at a news conference Thursday that Lakanwal drove across the country to launch an “ambush-style” attack with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver.The suspect shot one guard member twice before turning to fire at the second, Pirro said. Other national guard members at the scene had engaged and neutralized the suspect, she addedPirro said the suspect would be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. However, if the national guard members did not survive, Pirro said, the charges could be increased to murder in the first degree.The FBI director, Kash Patel, told the news conference the agency is investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism. Law enforcement agencies had executed search warrants at the suspect’s home in Washington and in San Diego, California.Investigators have no information yet on a motive, but believe Lakanwal acted alone.Lakenwal was one of roughly 76,000 Afghans brought to the US through the resettlement program, many of whom worked alongside US troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators.Supporters have said candidates were extensively vetted. But the initiative has drawn intense criticism from Trump and other Republicans over what they have argued are gaps in the vetting process and the speed of admissions.Shortly after the shooting, Trump was quick to cast the blame on the Biden administration, accusing it of failing to properly vet migrants from Afghanistan. And he indicated he considered the attack justification for a broad review of asylum and green card applications.“We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country,” Trump said on Wednesday. “If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”The leaders of several federal agencies have promised immigration reviews. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said that it has stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it was expanding that directive to include a review of all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration. DHS did not clarify whether it is reviewing all asylum cases from only Afghanistan or from other countries, as well.The USCIS director, Joseph Edlow, later added he was also directing a “full-scale, rigorous re-examination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern” at Trump’s request. When asked what countries were considered “of concern,” USCIS pointed at Trump’s executive order restricted the entry to the US of nationals of 19 countries.Soon after the shooting, Trump said he would send 500 more National Guard troops to Washington DC. It’s not clear where the additional troops would come from.As of early November, the D.C. National Guard had the largest number on the ground, with 949 members. In addition to West Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama also had forces in the capital early this month.A federal judge last week ordered an end to the Guard deployment but also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the Trump administration time to either remove the troops or appeal.With the Associated PressExplore more on these topicsWashington DCUS crimeGun crimeUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

She “accused the government of being ‘traitors’ to the profession and of ‘disingenuousness’, ‘duplicity’ and ‘gaslighting’,” Streeting wrote.“This speech was not just deeply unprofessional and unbecoming of a professional representative body, it was misleading,” he added. “The BMA agreed these contract changes [on online access to GPs] in February 2025 and any suggestions to the contrary are factually incorrect.”He said that the BMA was not displaying “mutual respect and professionalism” in its dealings with the government. “Your union representatives are currently making it impossible for me and my officials to engage in good faith in the way we would all want.”The relationship between Streeting and the BMA has become increasingly fractious, mainly over thelong-running series of strikesby resident – formerly junior – doctors over their pay and difficulties getting places to start training in their chosen medical specialty.View image in fullscreenResident doctors, previously known as junior doctors, picket outside St Thomas’ hospital in London this month.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe union’s resident doctors committee (RDC) is weighing up whether to stage another strike – which would be their 14th since March 2023 – before Christmas, given their legal strike mandate expires on 6 January.Streeting saidthe BMA agreedto expand patients’ digital access to GPs in the negotiations over this year’s contract, which concluded in February. However, the union claims that he is guilty of “broken promises” for not putting in place safeguards to stop already busy GP practices becoming “overwhelmed” as a result of patients submitting requests for help online.Responding to Streeting’s letter, Bramall said a recent BMA survey had found that 42% of more than 1,300 practices that responded have had to reduce the number of face-to-face appointments they offer because GPs are so busy dealing with online communications.“Fewer appointments and practice meltdown isn’t a win for patients or the profession,” she said.Separately,Dr Tom Dolphin, the BMA’s chair of council, criticised the health secretary for revealing the reduction in the union’s role in drawing up the GP contract by publicising his letter.“We would have much preferred the health secretary to contact the BMA privately and directly to seek de-escalation, rather than via the media. Governments do not get to decide their negotiating partners, and not should they,” he said.The majority of doctors supported the recent strike. So why did the Department of Health suggest the opposite? | Peter KellnerRead moreStreeting will consult other bodies, including the Royal College of GPs and theNHSConfederation, in his negotiations over the GP contract for 2026-27, to dilute the BMA’s role.The NHS England boss, Sir Jim Mackey, has urged the BMA to end the “doom loop” of strikes by resident doctors, especially during the winter, when the NHS comes under intense pressure.The NHS and ministers are trying hard to end the standoff, which has seen what the BMA says is 20,000 doctors left unemployed and unable to progress their careers by securing places in specialty training, he said, in a letter to the RDC about the problem.Each strike forces the NHS to prioritise safe care during the action and costs £250m, Mackey added. “Let’s do everything we can to avert industrial action during winter, when our patients really rely on us being there for them,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNHSWes StreetingHealthGPsDoctorsIndustrial actionnewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of people are still missing.But as firefighters work to bring the fire under control and make progress with rescue efforts, anger is already swelling among Hongkongers about the causes of the fire.The fire has also tapped into the social anxiety inHong Kongaround affordable housing, where sky-high property prices mean that many people live in tightly packed high-rise apartments that can become death traps when disaster strikes.At a press conference on Thursday, Hong Kong’s leader, John Lee, said the government would set up a HK$300m (£29.2m) fund to help residents and that the city’s development bureau had discussed replacingbamboo scaffoldingwith metal alternatives. He also said that contractors across the Asian financial hub would be given seven days to submit documents proving their use of fire-retardant materials.But some Hongkongers are angry about the focus that has been put on bamboo as a potential accelerant of the fire. On Thursday afternoon, much of the bamboo scaffolding remained standing, with the green mesh between the poles having been incinerated.The angry people think that blaming bamboo – which the government has already pledged to phase out from public construction works – deflects responsibility from the actual cause of the fire, which is still unknown. Bamboo scaffolding is treasured as an important part of the local heritage, and is something that distinguishes Hong Kong from mainlandChina, where steel scaffolds are widely used in construction.Residents of Wang Fuk Court had complained for months about shoddy behaviour from the construction company, said Michael Mo, a former Hong Kong district councillor who now lives in the UK. He was born in the Tai Po area where Wang Fuk Court is located.Last year, the text of an email purportedly from the Hong Kong labour department was posted on a Wang Fuk Court residents group. Responding to inquiries about the maintenance works, the email said that because the works didn’t involve open flames, “the risk of fire from the scaffolding is relatively low”. It said that the Labour Department’s regulations did not cover flame-retardant standards for scaffolding. The department has been contacted for comment.On Thursday, police in Hong Kong arrested three people connected with the building maintenance company responsible for the estate.Hong Kong’s corruption watchdog also said it would launch a criminal investigation into the renovation works.Traditionally, Hong Kong has held open inquiries into major tragedies, often headed by an independent judge.But many legal experts say that Hong Kong’s judiciary is no longer independent, especially on matters which are critical of the government.“I don’t think the government will launch an independent committee on this,” said Mo. “They didn’t do it for Covid. If they are going to do it, John Lee would be cooked.”Since Beijing’s sweeping crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, which included many violent clashes between police and demonstrators, trust in the authorities is low.“Ever since the wipeout of the pro-democratic camp and civil society, there is no opposition to voice out alarm bells effectively,” said Mo. He said that before 2019, there were guardrails, albeit imperfect ones, on the authorities. “In the absence of these … there is no way we can make the government more effective or accountable.”Beijing’s response to the fire has been swift. China’s president, Xi Jinping, called for an “all-out effort” to extinguish the fire and minimise casualties and losses. Chinese companies including BYD, Geely and Alibaba have pledged tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars in aid donations. The People’s Liberation Army stands ready to “safeguard” the city, a defence ministry spokesperson said.Lee also hinted on Thursday that the upcoming Legislative Council elections, scheduled for 7 December, could be postponed because of the disaster. The elections were last postponed in 2020, ostensibly because of Covid, but it also served as a way to silence the pro-democratic camp. In the years since, that camp has been destroyed, by a combination of imprisoning legislators or forcing them into exile, or by disbarring candidates who are seen as disloyal to Beijing. This year’s election will be a “patriots only” vote.Additional reporting by Helen Davidson and ReutersExplore more on these topicsHong KongAsia PacificChinaHong Kong apartment firesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Her family became so concerned that she was taken by ambulance to QMC on New Year’s Eve.She was found to be experiencing an “acute psychotic episode” and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.A jury of five women and four men heard that blood tests and an MRI scan conducted at QMC were negative, leading doctors to rule out a physical cause for her psychosis.However, clinicians decided not to request further tests of brain activity or spinal fluid, including a lumbar puncture, which may have revealed the autoimmune encephalitis.Mia was transferred to the Becton centre on 9 January and died three weeks later.In their narrative conclusion, the jury said: “The failure to undertake a lumbar puncture at this point [at QMC] meant that potential indicators of autoimmune encephalitis were missed. This possibly contributed to Mia’s death.”They added that the information passed between QMC and the Becton centre “provided an inappropriate level of assurance that organic causes had been ruled out”.Regarding the Becton centre, the jury found that “insufficiently robust communication and management of risk led to a failure to respond adequately to Mia’s risk of self-harm”.The jury also noted that a “rare presentation of a rare condition” posed particularly complex challenges for diagnosis and care.The jurors found, on the directions of the senior coroner for South Yorkshire (West), Tanyka Rawden, that Mia’s cause of death was compression of the neck, caused by acute psychosis, caused by autoimmune encephalitis.In a statement after the inquest, Mia’s mother, Chloe Hayes, said: “It has been devastating to listen to how, when she needed specialist healthcare for the first time in her life, she was so badly let down.“She was let down at the Queen’s medical centre in Nottingham, who wrongly decided there was no underlying physical cause of her psychosis, and failed to carry out appropriate testing.“I believe they simply dismissed her and looked to pass her on to mental health services as quickly as possible, which led to her transfer to the Becton centre.”Mrs Hayes continued: “Her mental health spiralled deeper out of control there, as she was not being treated for her condition, and the many failings and lack of care meant sadly she wasn’t properly protected from harming herself.”She said: “My beautiful little girl has lost her life and I will never forgive the Queen’s medical centre or the Becton centre for failing her.”Dr Manjeet Shehmar, the medical director at Nottingham university hospitalsNHStrust, said: “We accept the coroner’s outcome in court today and apologise to Mia’s family for not identifying autoimmune encephalitis while she was in our care.“While this is an incredibly rare condition and initial tests were negative, we recognise that further testing may have had an impact on her future, for which we are truly sorry.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Kyiv would also be expected to accept reductions or a halt to US military assistance, while any future deployment of western troops to Ukraine – including those envisioned under the Franco-British “coalition of the willing” – would be explicitly banned.Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the Ukrainian president would not agree to giving up land to Russia in exchange for peace.He told the US magazine the Atlantic: “As long as Zelenskyy is president, no one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory.”Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinRussiaEuropeUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

More than half of people in the UK believe the differences in people’s political views are so divisive it is dangerous for society,recent polling by Ipsos found.The changes in political polarisation resulting from exposure to X posts were measured using a novel approach. First, the academics used AI to analyse posts in X’s “for you” feed in real time. Then the system showed more divisive posts to one cohort and fewer divisive posts to another, a power normally the sole preserve of X. Divisive posts included those that showed support for undemocratic practices, partisan violence, opposition to bipartisan consensus and biased evaluations of politicised facts.After a week of reading these subtly altered feeds, the researchers asked users to rank how warm or cold, favourable or unfavourable they felt towards their political opponents. The changes in “affective polarisation” were ranked at more than two degrees on a 0 to 100 degree “feeling thermometer”. This was the same amount of increased polarisation that typically occurred in the US in the four decades to 2020. Feeding users fewer posts with antidemocratic attitudes and partisan animosity decreased political division by a similar amount.Social media platforms have long been accused of encouraging divisive content to boost user engagement and therefore advertising revenues. But the research found that while there was a slight reduction in overall engagement in terms of time spent on the platform and numbers of posts viewed when divisive content was down-ranked, those users tended to “like” or repost more often.“The success of this method shows that it can be integrated into social media AI to mitigate harmful personal and societal consequences,” the authors wrote. “At the same time, our engagement analyses indicate a practical trade-off: interventions that down-rank [antidemocratic and partisan content] may reduce short-term engagement volume, posing challenges for engagement-driven business models and supporting the hypothesis that content that provokes strong reactions generates more engagement.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

So, I have some good news and some bad news. Good news, we’ve had a full circle moment. I’m back making TikTok content in my parents’ house. Bad news, I can’t do it in front of that lovely blue floral wallpaper any more, due to the fact that that room is upstairs.“I’ve just had my second below-knee amputation. So, unfortunately, those facilities are not available to me at the current moment in time. So a lot to unpack there for everyone involved.”Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

In the caption, she added: “No legs who dis? #paralympics2026.”In a recent interview on the YouTube channel FFTV, the actor said she had already had all her toes removed in 2021 due to the impact of using crutches for eight years.She said she had been told by doctors her foot was “never going to get any better” and that it had made it “more difficult” for her to work and perform.“It’s just that this foot, I was on crutches for the bones of eight years and the way I used my crutches I was always kind of on my tippy toes, so the joints in my feet were destroyed by the end,” she said. “It’s gone past the point where they can kind of do anything about it.”Codd also detailed the recovery process, saying she would have to spend at least a month waiting for the limb to heal before she could have a prosthetic.The actor built a following on TikTok during the Covid pandemic, when she began posting comedy sketches and highlighting disability awareness.She has starred in Netflix horror series The Midnight Club and The Fall of the House of Usher.She appeared in the first series ofThe Celebrity Traitorsearlier this year, but was “murdered” by the traitors in episode four after correctly naming Jonathan Ross as a traitor at the round table.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsDisabilityIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

The OBR prides itself on our professionalism. We let people down yesterday and we’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Reuters, the agency that first published excerpts of the outlook on its news wire, revealed on Thursday how it had obtained the document.It said: “The document, which is usually published after the finance minister’s speech has ended, was uploaded to the OBR website and available to download on an unprotected link.“The link was not advertised on the website but the OBR has used the same web address, or URL, for previous budget documents, changing only the date. A Reuters reporter, in preparation for covering the budget, went to the publicly available URL shortly after 1130 GMT on Wednesday.”Hughes said Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, would provide expert input to the investigation into how the report was accidentally published. It will be overseen by the independent members of the OBR’s oversight board, Sarah Hogg and Dame Susan Rice.Budget 2025: key points at a glanceRead moreThe terms of reference for the inquiry referred to a “publication error” and said its starting point would be that “the OBR inadvertently made it possible to access the November 2025 economic and fiscal outlook (EFO) too early on budget day”.View image in fullscreenThe OBR chair, Richard Hughes, has received the chancellor’s backing despite the budget leak.Photograph: Parliament TVThe chancellor gave Hughes her backing on Thursday morning despite the breach. The incident was serious, she said, “but I do have confidence in Richard and the OBR”.The early publication of the document, about 45 minutes before the chancellor was due to deliver her budget in the House of Commons, meant details of her central policies were made public before she announced them.Hughes said: “I regret the disruption that it caused to the chancellor’s statement and parliamentary proceedings.”Hughes said he expected the investigation to report by early next week, adding that he was prepared to step down if Reeves and Hillier decided as a result of its findings that they no longer had confidence in him.The shadow chancellor said the OBR was in need of reform. Asked on LBC whether the independent watchdog was fit for purpose, Mel Stride said: “I think, generally, yes it is. I do think it needs reform.“Clearly, this latest incident is both unprecedented and deeply worrying”Reeves’s budget on Wednesday raised taxes by £26bn in response to weaker OBR forecasts and to pay for higher spending, including on scrapping the two-child limit on benefits.The chair of the business and trade select committee, Liam Byrne, told the Commons on Wednesday that Hughes should “consider his position” in light of the accidental publication.“I have to say to the House that I seriously think that Mr Hughes needs to consider his position,” Byrne, a former chief secretary to the Treasury, said. “The fact that we had a leak of the OBR forecast before this House got to debate the budget is appalling, and this uncertainty has bedevilled us.”The relationship between the Treasury and the OBR has at times been fraught in recent months, with Reeves publicly questioning the timing of its review of productivity forecasts.Sheannounced in the budgetthat the OBR would now assess whether her fiscal rules were met once a year, at the annual budget, not alongside the spring statement as usual.It was the OBR’s judgment that Reeves risked breaking her rules that prompted her to seek savings at this year’s spring statement, including £5bn of welfare cuts that had to beabandoned after a backbench rebellion.Explore more on these topicsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityBudget 2025Rachel ReevesEconomic policyEconomicsData and computer securityBudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

But what was so revealing about Wednesday’s focus group was that they were all in what we would normally see as relatively high-paid jobs, they owned their own homes – not the type of voter you’d normally think of as struggling. As Martin, a product manager in the automotive industry, put it: “On paper, we should be feeling really well off.”Instead, they described a sense that a good wage and savings no longer guarantee financial security. Annette, an executive assistant, said she felt the “goalposts seem to move all the time”, that “doing the right thing, being sensible” was not enough. Many described a feeling that retirement felt far away, while some felt trapped in a “double squeeze”, where “we’re supporting our adult parents, while our kids are 30 and still living at home”.Aldershot is an archetypal“blue wall” seatand, until fairly recently, a Tory stronghold. Labour’s victory in last year’s election broke the constituency’s streak of more than a century of Conservative MPs.View image in fullscreenLuke Tryl is the UK director of the research group More in Common.Photograph: Russell SachThe voters we spoke to had been part of that switch. They supported Labour in the general election, partly because they desperately felt the country needed the change Keir Starmer was promising. Yet 18 months on, they felt let down.“I think actually the thing that makes me most angry about this Labour government is that I was really hopeful for them,” said Rebecca, a lecturer. Rob, a carpenter, told us: “I’ve lost faith in the government in the last six months if I’m honest. I think everything they do is wrong.”Their views on the budget were most defined by the briefings and briefing U-turns that preceded it. Pre-budget kite-flying does not normally cut through in focus groups, yet among this group (and others More in Common has run over the past few weeks) the sheer volume of speculative briefing had tainted their perceptions of Reeves’s announcements even before the chancellor stood up.Rebecca summed up the impact of those briefings: “For a party that was kind of campaigning on ending the chaos, I would say the lead-up to the budget felt quite chaotic … it’s just like a comedy of errors constantly.”The extent of this speculation meant that many agreed with Martin, who called the budget itself a “damp squib”. “It wasn’t a bad budget because they haven’t made things significantly worse,” he said. “But it wasn’t a good one. It was just … meh.”Some, however, were more critical. Annette felt thatcutting the tax-free cash ISA allowancepenalised those who were working hard and saving – another example of the “goalposts moving”. Sarah felt the same way about the tax on electric vehicles, likening it to the reversal of the government’s approach to taxing diesel cars.Their response to the government’s decision to lift the two-child limit on benefits was mixed; the group were worried about child poverty, but also felt the government needed to find ways to tackle the ballooning welfare bill.For some, the decision to freeze income tax bands had left a bitter taste. Hayley called it “sneaky” and “a little bit underhanded”. Many saw it as a breach of Labour’s manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people – though most also agreed it was better than breaking the core pledge not to raise income tax rates.While there was some sympathy at the task the chancellor faced (“over the years there’s been some horrific budgets that have caused us long-term issues”, said Sarah, “so I understand a little bit why we’re having to be cautious”), there was also real impatience, a feeling that the government was “tinkering around the edges” and failing to get a grip on the cost of living.This was Rachel Reeves’s ‘live now, pay later’ budget. The big question is: what happens when ‘later’ arrives? | Larry ElliottRead more“It’s all about playing safe, not rocking the boat, just doing the bare minimum rather than really tackling some of the really big issues,” said Annette.Traditionally, you’d have expected voters like the ones we spoke with to be satisfied, settled supporters of the status quo. Yet many of them feel frustrated with the government’s pace of change, believe that the system no longer works for them and worry that a comfortable, stable life is increasingly out of reach.The budget itself may have done no further harm with this group of voters, who make up a core part of Labour’s new coalition, but it certainly didn’t help to rebuild their shattered expectations either.The lasting impact may instead be on their perceptions of government competence. The unprecedented level of briefing and counter-briefing in the run-up to the budget reinforces a view that, despite the promise of a “politics that treads more lightly”, this government is ultimately no less chaotic than the last.Luke Tryl is the UK director of the research group More in CommonExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025BudgetEconomic policyEconomicsUK cost of living crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fire crews blasted water from cherrypickers at the mid-level floors, but above that, the fires were roaring out of reach.Wang Fuk Court, in the northern Hong Kong district of Tai Po, was home to about 4,800 people. The eight-tower complex had been under renovation for years, clad in bamboo scaffolding and mesh.On Wednesday afternoon,for reasons that are under investigation, one of them caught fire. The blaze spread inside the building, and then across to neighbouring towers. By evening, seven buildings were ablaze, and the death toll had already surpassed Hong Kong’s previous worst ever building fire disaster.At least 65 people have been killed, including one firefighter, and dozens injured. At least 55 were rescued but more than 250 are missing. Firefighters were still unable to reach the top levels of some of the 31-storey towers, although one elderly man was rescued alive from his high up apartment earlier in the day.0:49Aerial video shows scale of Hong Kong apartment complex fireThe air was still filled with acrid smoke, which reminded some of how the city smelled during the worst violence of the 2019 protests. A brief panic broke out when a flickering light in the window of a different block was mistaken for another fire, and onlookers exchanged nervous looks when the breeze picked up: Wednesday’s fire was fanned by a stiff winter northerly, said James Tang, who lives in one of the towers.Tang was not home when the building caught fire. He received a call from his brother-in-law who saw it from across the river. He rushed home but was stopped from entering.“I watched from the outside as the building burned,” he said, speaking to the Guardian outside a local primary school, which is one of the shelters for evacuated residents.View image in fullscreenFirefighters have been unable to reach the top levels of some of the 31-storey towers.Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/ReutersTang’s friends in the complex were not among the missing, he said. “But a lot of people died, especially the fireman. We are very sorry about this. The fireman tried to save us from the fire, tried to stop the fire and then he lost his life.”Nearby, volunteers had set up a market of donated clothes, food and essentials for the now homeless residents of Wang Fuk Court and the hundreds of others temporarily evacuated from neighbouring buildings.View image in fullscreenVolunteers have set up a market of donated clothes, food and essentials for people who are now homeless or have been evacuated from neighbouring buildings.Photograph: Ryan KW Lai/ShutterstockConnie Chu had just returned home from grocery shopping to the apartment she had lived in for 42 years when she saw a mass of fire trucks. A neighbour told her to leave, even though none of them had heard a fire alarm.“There should have been [an alarm],” she said. “When I came out I saw one building on fire, it was a horrible, huge fire. We were so worried.”Chu and her neighbours were lucky – their building was the only one of the complex’s eight not to burn. “I have a friend who lives in one of the other buildings and she’s in hospital. It seems quite serious. I spoke to her on the phone yesterday, she said a lot of smoke had entered her home.”Bamboo scaffolding may be to blame for spread of Hong Kong tower block fireRead moreThe community is reeling, and some are angry: police suspect the fire was caused by “grossly negligent” action. Hong Kong police have alleged unsafe scaffolding and foam materials used during maintenance workmay have been behind the rapid spread of the fire, and three people from the related construction company have been arrested. The Independent Commission Against Corruption has already announced a taskforce.There have been long-running complaints about the renovation, including allegations the alarms were switched off months ago by construction workers, and that workers smoked on site. There have also been broader concerns about the safety standards for the mesh used on sites. A video being widely shared on Thursday shows a local council member setting fire to a piece of green construction mesh and watching it quickly melt and burn.1:26Three arrested as Hong Kong tower fire leaves dozens dead - videoBy nightfall on Thursday, the surrounding area was still filled with people – emergency services, onlookers, neighbours, victims and their families. Outside a building where the deceased were being identified, people left sobbing, clutching at each other. Some wore blankets over their heads to avoid the cameras.Pastor Samson Wong, from the Cumberland Presbyterian church, was waiting with a crowd of volunteers to give emotional and psychological support to the families who have lost people.“They have enough material supplies, but they need emotional support,” he said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They include:1.Anti-communism weekTrumpproclaimedthe week of 2–8 November one of observance as a “solemn remembrance of the devastation caused by one of history’s most destructive ideologies” and a renewal of the national promise to stand firm against communism. The proclamation coincided with the election of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City, whom Trump painted as a “communist lunatic”.2.National energy dominance monthTrump issued theproclamationin October, changing what was previously called national energy awareness month, promoting energy efficiency, into a call for “maximum production, maximum prosperity, and maximum power”. Framing energy prices as a “national energy emergency”, Trump announced a commitment to policies focused on maximizing domestic production of oil, natural gas, coal and critical minerals. “This month, we continue our crusade to bring back American energy dominance,” the proclamation reads.3.Leif Erikson dayTrump has declared Leif Erikson day every year he has been in office, including signing proclamations in 2017, 2020, and2025, based on a 1964 law designating it on 9 October. The day honors “the heroic life” of the Norse explorer, who is believed to have been the first European to land in North America.4.Columbus DayA federal holiday since 1934, Columbus Day has in recent years been observed in many cities and states as Indigenous Peoples’ Day, in recognition of Columbus’s controversial legacy, particularly the suffering and horrendous treatment of Native Americans under colonization; Joe Biden became the first US president proclaim it as such. Trump swiftly did the opposite, restating his administration’s commitment to Columbus Day and “to reclaim [Columbus’] extraordinary legacy of faith, courage, perseverance, and virtue from the left-wing arsonists who have sought to destroy his name and dishonor his memory”.5.National manufacturing dayTrump has issuedproclamationsto mark national manufacturing day every year he’s been in office (as have past presidents since 2012 on other dates) on 3October. In this year’s proclamation Trump touts his tariff policy, cutting red tape, rejecting “the Green New Scam agenda”, and his drive for America to manufacture products at home. He calls upon Americans “to celebrate the entrepreneurs, innovators, and workers in manufacturing who are making our communities strong”.6.Overdose prevention weekTrump has not stopped commemorating public health epidemics that he deems important. The president officiallyestablishedthe week of 31 August to 6 September as overdose prevention week, coinciding with international overdose awareness day, which is recognized every year on 31 August. Trump called upon Americans to observe the week with “appropriate programs, ceremonies, religious services, and other activities that raise awareness about the prescription opioid and drug overdose epidemic”. Touting his tough immigration and border policies, and his efforts to classify fentanyl-related compounds as Schedule I drugs and designate cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, it reads: “We remember those who lost their lives to overdose, we stand beside the families left to grieve, and we renew our solemn commitment to ending this epidemic once and for all.”7.Cancer control monthTrump also stillproclaimscancer control month to “honor” and “celebrate” survivors of cancer, to remember “beloved family members and friends that we have lost to this devastating disease”, and to recommit “to pursuing groundbreaking medical advancement and spearheading innovative treatments to combat and prevent all forms of cancer”.8.Made in America weekIn line with his America First vision, Trumpproclaimedthe week of 20-26 July Made in America Week, after issuing similar proclamations with different dates in 2017 and 2018. He calls upon to Americans “to pay special tribute to the builders, the ranchers, the crafters, the entrepreneurs, and all those who work with their hands every day to make America great”.9.250th anniversary of the Battle of Bunker HillAs part of the broader commemoration of the nation’s 250-year anniversary next year, Trump issued aproclamationon 17 June declaring that day as a day of remembrance for “the courage, determination, and selflessness of the patriots who fought at Bunker Hill”.10.101st anniversary of United States border patrolTrump issued aproclamationon 28 May honoring 101 years of US border patrol. “We honor the thousands of patriots who dedicate their careers to defending our borders and upholding the rule of law, even in the face of grave danger and tremendous risk,” it reads. “Above all, we pay tribute to every brave soul who has perished in the line of duty while proudly serving our Nation.”11.Victory Day for the second world warTrump issued aproclamationdesignating 8 May as Victory Day for the second world war. The choice of date left many historians and commentators flummoxed, given that while it marks the day in 1945 that Nazi Germany surrendered, US troops continued to fight for several more months in the Pacific theater until Japan finally surrendered on 2 September.12.418th anniversary of the first landing and the raising of Cape Henry CrossTrump became the first president to commemorate the anniversary of the Cape Henry Landing by issuing aproclamation. “The seeds of America’s destiny were sown when this courageous band of Christians erected a towering wooden cross at the crest of Cape Henry, Virginia,” it reads. “Our Nation honors the heroic souls whose faithful devotion and uncommon courage more than 400 years ago foreshadowed the birth of the greatest Republic in the history of the world – and it is in their memory that we pledge to forge a future that always celebrates our history, honors our heritage, and glorifies our God Almighty.”… and more:Trump has also issuedproclamationsfor many other pre-existing events – several of them health-related – that are typically marked every year by the sitting president (or have been in the past), including the national Days of Remembrance for victims of the Holocaust, national mental health awareness month, and World Autism Awareness Day.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpAids and HIVexplainersShareReuse this content"

Photograph: stock_colors/Getty ImagesIn the two years since the system was launched, beverage-packaging collection and recycling has risen to 94%ByAndrei Popoviciuin Bucharest, RomaniaThu 27 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 16.36 ESTShareIn the Transylvanian village of Pianu de Jos, 51-year-old Dana Chitucescu gathers a sack of empty polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, aluminium cans and glass every week and takes it to her local shop.Like millions of Romanians across cities and rural areas, Chitucescu has woven the country’s two-year-old deposit return system (DRS) into her routine.It is a simple scheme: when buying soft drinks or alcoholic beverages, the customer pays an extra 0.50 Romanian leu (£0.09) per bottle and gets the money back when returning the packaging, cleaned and in its original shape, to a collection point (usually the same shops where the goods were bought).Chitucescu makes about 40 leu a week from recycling her and another family’s bottles. “That covers the food for my seven cats,” she said. “It’s a great system, everyone in our village uses it, there’s always a queue at the shop.”Her weekly walk is one tiny part of a national shift that, until recently, seemed impossible. Romania’s recycling rates were among thelowest in the EU, but in the two years since the scheme launched, beverage-packaging collection and recycling has skyrocketed to as high as 94% in some months.View image in fullscreenGemma Webb, CEO of RetuRO: ‘It’s a zero to hero story.’Photograph: RetuRO“It is a zero to hero story,” said Gemma Webb, the chief executive of RetuRO, the company running the system in a public-private partnership with beverage packaging manufacturers and the state. “The products are clean, there is little contamination, they can be recycled easily and we have full traceability as well, so we know every bottle that goes on the market.”Romanians returned about 7.5bn beverage containers between the system’s launch in November 2023 and the end of September 2025, according to the company. The returns included 4bn PET bottles, 2bn metal cans, and 1.5bn glass containers. More than 500,000 tonnes of high-quality recyclable materials have been collected. “We are the largest fully integrated deposit return system globally.”The scale of Romania’s turnaround is even more striking given where the country started. For more than a decade, the country has sat at thebottomof Europe’s recycling statistics. Between 2011 and 2021, the country’s municipal waste recycling rate barely budged, drifting between 11% and 14% while the rest of the EU climbed ahead.View image in fullscreenRetuRO runs the system in a public-private partnership with beverages packaging manufacturers and the state.Photograph: Facebook / RetuRORomania rankedlastin the EU for circular material usage, with only 1% of materials being recycled and reintroduced into the economy in 2021.But in 2018 the government began discussions about the scheme; in 2022 RetuRO began work, and on an extremely tight timeline including the construction of nine counting and sorting centres nationwide, the scheme launched in late 2023.“Now we have one of the largest, most complex logistics networks in Romania,” said Webb.In fact starting later than other countries may have been an advantage, says Raul Pop, the secretary of state in the environment ministry and a waste policy expert, because Romania could use modern software and traceability tools.It is on a return-to-retail model: shops that sell the containers must either install reverse vending machines or process the packaging manually. There is also a financial incentive for them, which helps them cover processing costs, and RetuRO reinvests all profits back into operations.A nationwide advertising campaign used the Romanian traditional dance, thehora, people holding hands and dancing in a circle, to symbolise shared responsibility, and a recentstudyfound that 90% of Romanians say they have used the system at least once and 60% return packaging regularly.View image in fullscreenA notice for the RetuRO scheme.Photograph: RetuRO SGROther countries, Pop explained, “suffer from their own inertia” because they introduced their systems decades ago and are now stuck with outdated models. For them, shifting to new systems risks confusing consumers, even if it could improve collection rates.Countries such as Poland, Turkey, Bulgaria, Moldova and Serbia have had meetings with RetuRO and the Romanian authorities looking to learn best practices as they prepare to implement a similar system.Romania has also introduced a supportive legal framework, which means retailers can be penalised if they refuse returns – even the smallest village shops must accept containers if they sell the products or they risk fines, while big chains have automated return points.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The country recorded a total recycling rate of only 12% in 2024, according toEurostat, and has never exceeded 14%. Even with a hypothetical 100% return rate for beverage containers, the overall waste recycling rate would only rise marginally.Re-use, Elena Rastei of the NGO ZeroWasteRomania argued, needed to be looked at more closely.“Collection solves the problem of visible waste, but re-use changes its nature. When packaging circulates – returned, washed, refilled – it becomes a resource, not waste. A single, reusable bottle can replace 20 to 50 single-use bottles, cut carbon emissions, and support a truly circular economy.”View image in fullscreenRetuRO vans.Photograph: Adrian Scutariu/RetuRO SGRFor now, while Romania has become a policy model abroad, for Chitucescu, the success is not measured in billions of bottles but in what she does not see any more in her community.When heavy rain falls, bottles are no longer swept into streams. When she walks through the village, the streets are free of the rubbish that once littered them.Her brother, who lives in Spain, is envious. He tells her they do not have a similar system there, and it is one of the rare things Romania is doing exceptionally well.“He’s jealous of us, and he’s right, it’s beneficial for us and for the environment,” said Chitucescu.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesRomaniaRecyclingPlasticsWasteEuropeEthical and green livingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fashion industry metamorphosed over the decades since, but she went on believing in individuality and drama, painstakingly achieved. Debbie Harry, Siouxsie Sioux, Rihanna, Björk, Lady Gaga, Lily Allen, Kylie Minogue and Taylor Swift, among others, bought her garments, which were auditorium-dominating mixes of sex, eccentricity and intellect. Hogg’s catsuits in Latex and PVC became the glam workwear of the rock and pop stage. They never dated. When a star strides on stage in one, the audience knows the action is about to kick off.Yet to the end of her life, Hogg, who has died, aged perhaps 66 (she refused to reveal her age publicly), remained a struggling artist. She hoped to arrive at the same safe destination as her long-term friendVivienne Westwood, with an atelier equipped with pattern cutter and couture seamstresses, plus financial backing for a ready-to-wear line that would not betray her nonconforming philosophy of dress.For a long time she fitted clothes on her own body because she could not afford a mannequinShe did show collections at London Fashion Week and in Paris, but for a long time fitted them on her own body because she could not afford a mannequin, and sewed almost every stitch herself, at first in her kitchen and then in a studio in Hackney Wick, east London.Hogg’s creations were technically complex and her ideas developed as she executed them, right up until the moment a model set foot on the catwalk. Financial frailty denied her the credit to buy the best materials, but that suited her ethos: she toldthe Guardianthat her entries in the 2014 Barbican exhibitionThe Vulgar: Fashion Redefined, among Dior, Schiaparelli and acres of historical cloth-of-gold, “were made of old curtains I found on the market that cost me £20 for the lot. A headdress made from old plastic flowers that I found in junkshops.” Her involvement was extraordinarily personal – the smears on a wedding dress from 2010 were her own blood from pricks and cuts sustained while at work.Hogg said she had been upcycling materials since she was six, in Paisley, Scotland, where she was born, one of four children of a father who worked as a gardener and a mother who was a telephonist, both freethinking members of a spiritualist church. School was a misery, because of what she later realised was dyslexia, but Glasgow School of Art was an inspiring harmony of high craftwork and hard wear. She was so successful studying fine art and printed textiles there that she went on for her master’s degree to the Royal College of Art in London.Hogg’s career, though, began outside formal education, in the Tuesday night queue to enterthe Blitz clubin Covent Garden. The dress code was “wildly imaginative” – Blitz kickstarted the New Romantic style – and its gatekeeper,Steve Strange, let in only the most original art-student hopefuls. Hogg laboured at her sewing machine to create a competitive outfit, but still turned to leave when Strange barred the door to others (he once turned Mick Jagger away for the “wrong shoes”). However, he told Hogg: “Where d’you think you’re going? You belong. Get in.”Competition did not ease among the chosen inside, so Hogg had to produce a fresh ensemble each week, which brought orders from fellow club-goers, and from musicians for performance gear. She was noticed by name designers such as Katharine Hamnett, andJoe Casely-Hayfordintroduced her into Hyper Hyper’s Kensington market of fashion stalls – in the 1980s, post-punk, early New Romantic London still had small, low-rent retail spaces. Her clothes guested in Harrods and Bloomingdale’s, New York, featured in new magazines such as the Face and i-D, and costumed MTV music videos. Enough club-goers wanted elements of Hogg to support her own shop in Newburgh Street, Soho.View image in fullscreenPam Hogg’s spring-summer collection at London Fashion Week, September 2016.Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/ShutterstockAnd then Hogg walked away from it all. In her student days she had sung in a band, Rubbish, that supported the Pogues. (She always cut and sewed to music, and it often inspired what was created.) In 1990, she went with her then boyfriend Mary Byker when he toured the US with the supergroup Pigface. The boys in the band discovered she could sing, and dragged her onstage in Nashville to adlib to a number she had heard only a few times. She brought it off and was immediately accepted into the tour.“I left fashion as understatedly as I’d entered it,” Hogg recalled. When she was asked by Debbie Harry to support her on the last few dates of her UK tour in 1993, Hogg had toswiftly assemble a band, Doll. The shows were a success, and Doll later opened for the Raincoats. Hogg spent over a decade in the music biz, including with her second group Hoggdoll, plus adventures in film and video scripting and directing, before returning to a changed fashion world.She had never lost her old performer admirers, and soon won new ones, although some could not be satisfied – Beyoncé’s wardrobe people requested 24 garments to choose from, not understanding that each was an unrepeatable one-off piece sewn by Hogg herself. But in 2008,Brownsof South Molton Street, London, stocked Hogg’s couture, and she showed regularly in London, and for a while in Paris, wild as ever in collection names, such as They Burn Witches Don’t They?, and Will There Be a Mourning/Morning? Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell were customers.Hogg’s style made for exciting exhibitions, including a one-woman show at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow in 1990, and Dr Hogg’s Divine Disorder at the Gallery in Liverpool in 2018. The V&A holds pieces, which are equally at home in its theatre and fashion collections.Pam Hogg, designer and performer, born c1959; death announced 26 November 2025Explore more on these topicsFashionPop and rockobituariesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereChloe Mac DonnellThu 27 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 18.36 ESTShareThis week’s newsletter idea stemmed from where all good ideas stem from – procrastinating while on a deadline. All it took was for one person to reveal what was on their Vinted Favourites list and suddenly everyone was whipping out phones to compare.The Lithuanianresale platformlaunched in the UK just over 10 years ago, but really revved up during 2021 when many of us ran out of excuses to avoid clearing out our wardrobes. Today, “it’s from Vinted” has become a humblebrag indicating you are the type of person who can track down a great deal and don’t buy new from mass retailers.But it turns out your own “Favourites items” section is the real signifier. From midlife crises to fantasising about being someone else, below seven writers reveal what’s really going on as they tap the heart icon.‘Trousers that have languished in Vinted purgatory’There are some items that symbolise the gap between the person you want to be and the person you actually are. For me, that item is the leather trouser. Long the reserve of motorcyclists or try-hards (the Guardian in 2020:“to buy a pair was to show the world that you were coping very badly with the ageing process”), the trousers started to appear everywhere a few years ago.I admired the women who wore them; they looked sophisticated, glamorous, as if they had dropped in from an era yet to be touched by athleisure and sweatpants and trainers. I tried on a black pair at a vintage shop, and looked like a child playing biker dress-up.I didn’t have theheftfor black leather, and wanted something less, uh, leathery. I found a cute pink pair on Vinted, which looks like something Barbie would wear if she wanted to indulge her edgy side. And yet as I contemplated the purchase, new doubts emerged. How comfortable would vinyl – stiff, unyielding, sticky – really be? Maybe I’m just a product of our unserious athleisure-led, comfort-first era after all. And so these trousers have languished in Vinted purgatory. That said, I’ve just noticed they’ve been discounted. Maybe I can become the woman I’ve always wanted to be, after all. –Rebecca Liu‘I’m never going to buyan underboob dress’My Vinted Favourites is really just a series of variations on a single theme: a short, skin-tight, polystyrene minidress that fastens in a kind of knot over the nipples, leaving both underboobs entirely exposed. I started lusting after a minidress last summer, after I went to a music festival that triggered what I now know to be an existential crisis. Before I went to this festival I thought I was young. I can hardly bear to type this, but the truth is that before I went to this festival I thought I was cool. Standing in the boiling mud last summer, poked and prodded on all sides by the Von Dutch caps of gen Z influencers, I had a horrible realisation that I was not cool at all. I was past it. I was wearing a straw hat and a calf-length smock that doubled as a sweat rag for my face.I’m never going to buy this underboob dress. Quite apart from anything else, the knot isn’t strong enough to hold up my 33-year-old breasts. But I can’t stop picturing myself dancing in it, polystyrene glistening in the night. I like to tell myself that my clothes are an expression of my personality, but really, they’re an expression of who I want to be. Currently, I want to be a teenager. And, at the time of writing, I’m in disputes with three separate real-life teenagers, bartering to get £3 off different iterations of The Dress, because it feels good to pretend. –Kitty DrakeView image in fullscreenItems languish in your Favourites as you try to decide whether to push the buy button.Photograph: PR image‘A graveyard of items I’m waiting to drop in price’My attempt to atone for the fast-fashion sins of my teenage years means I now spend an inordinate amount of time scrolling on Vinted. After a couple of years of steady curation, the algorithm is alarmingly well-attuned to my tastes (if you’re still in the nascent stages, it does get better).My Favourites section, meanwhile, is a sort of digital purgatory: a graveyard of items I’m waiting to drop in price (they never do), pieces I’ve liked purely to nudge the algorithm in a certain direction, and things I fully intend to buy but somehow forget exist the moment I close the app. There are always Miista boots in the mix, stubbornly hovering between £120 and £200, taunting me with their refusal to budge.And then there is the inevitable wildcard: a slightly outre statement piece from a hipster seller whose taste I admire but whose lifestyle I probably do not possess. Currently it’s a grey-and-yellow checked Diesel asymmetric dress-coat hybrid. It’s the kind of multilayered, cross-pollination of shapes and colours that looks effortlessly chic on someone in east London, but I know would read as more “experimental scarecrow” than cutting edge in the honesty of my bedroom mirror. Still, I probably won’t unfavourite it. –Emma Loffhagen‘More than a shirt’I’m locked in a battle of wills with a navy Engineered Garments overshirt. I saved it on my Vinted Favourites list about six months ago. Every time I open the app it’s there, waiting. Looking back at me and asking, ‘When are you going to grow up and buy me?’This thing is more than a shirt. It’s a gateway into slightly nicer, better-made inoffensive clothes that grownups wear. It’s the type of shirt I probablyshouldbe wearing as a 41-year-old media professional but don’t really want to wear because it’d be like admitting defeat.I’m not sure who is going to blink first in this deadlock. But the more I think about it, the more that puke-green Stüssy jacket on Depop appeals. I don’t think I’m ready to give up my hypebeast dreams and grow old gracefully just yet. –Lanre Bakareskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How had I never spotted this emporium of 60s-style clobber and mod subculture before? The clothes are as impressive as the shop’s client list (Weller, Gallagher Jr, Suggs, Oldman), and though I’m not a mod, I love the clean lines, bold designs and swagger of the clothing. It’s at once nostalgic and timeless.I was immediately drawn to the rail of gorgeous, Italian-inspired Gabicci knitwear in the corner – all vivid colours, large collars with beautifully detailed piping and thick, quality fabrics. But then I saw the price tags – the kind that induce both an eyebrow raise and short, high-pitched whistle.In that same moment, I thought: I wonder how much these are on Vinted? The answer is: the same items, if “new, unworn, without tags”, are only half or even a third of the price. And that is the beauty of online shopping in general and Vinted in particular – it can make dream purchases of normally unaffordable designer brands a reality.I’m currently favouriting three Gabiccis. All I need to decide now is whether I can carry off the turquoise knit with snazzy white detailing I’ve got my eye on. It would look fab on the 67-year-old Modfather, but I’m not so sure about this 62-year-old’s belly. –Gavin McOwanView image in fullscreenVinted allows you to curate a fantasy version of yourself, that may – or may not – become a reality.Photograph: PR image‘A midlife crisis indicator’A couple of months ago, I turned 36 and had a painful realisation: for a professional adult woman, my work wardrobe looked strikingly similar to that of a teenage boy doing his paper run – baggy jeans, baggy long sleeves, baggy sweatshirts. It triggered an anxiety in me that’s currently playing out in my Vinted Favourites.For me, this is all about a fantasy version of myself I’d like to one day bring into fruition: Professional Kate. At first, that meant curating a list of incredibly drab vintage Nicole Farhi and Margaret Howell. But that made me feel sad. So I’ve changed tack. Now I’m leaning into what can probably be best described as things Bridget Jones might wear to the office – pastel cardigans, suede A-line skirts, wine-coloured ballet flats and lilac fitted shirts from the brands my mum once shopped at: Principles, Wallis, Etam and Monsoon.Time will tell if any of these things actually make their way into my wardrobe. Perhaps they’re a sign I’m moving into a new era of my life and trying to figure out what that looks like. (I’ve lived an extended youth – my life looks pretty similar now to how it did in my early twenties, but that’s starting to change.) Perhaps a midlife crisis indicator. Only Vinted knows. –Kate Lloyd‘Big stripes unlock both vulnerability and confidence in me’I love stripes. I always have done. Big, colourful, horizontal stripes. So much so that I have a core memory of the afternoon before a primary school mufti day when a classmate asked if I’d be wearing something stripey and the entire class started laughing at me. It wasn’t the popular choice of clothing for boys in south London, which was anything sportswear-like or Nike or Adidas branded and graffiti-stained jeans.This love has followed me through my life, and stripes are still a core motif in my wardrobe – whether they’re on a rugby shirt, tiny baby tee or a big cozy jumper. On my Vinted wishlist is a fluffy black, white and yellow stripey jumper from Marni. Yes it is a cheesy platitude to say that I’m healing my inner child by still venerating stripes, but it is true nonetheless. Big stripes unlock both vulnerability and confidence in me, they’re an assurance that I am the person that I was always meant to become. –Jason OkundayeTo read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterVintage fashionSustainable fashionnewslettersShareReuse this content"

The band whose name it bore had split acrimoniously just before they were supposed to record it. Their guitarist Vini Reilly was so poleaxed by depression that he was virtually unable to leave his house: 12 different attempts were made to section him over the course of 1979. Believing that Reilly was “going to die”, Factory Records boss Tony Wilson intervened, buying him a new guitar, then suggested he visit a studio with the label’s troubled but visionary producer Martin Hannett as “an experiment”. The sessions were a disaster. Hannett ignored Reilly in favour of tinkering with a vast amount of cutting-edge electronic equipment he had brought with him. Reilly fitfully played something on the guitar, but eventually stormed out with the words: “I’m fucking sick of this.” He did not return.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for The Durutti Column: The Return of the Durutti Column.Unaware that he was making an album, Reilly was “mortified” when Hannett handed over a finished product, and “absolutely hated” what he heard. The solitary upside, as he saw it, was his sense that it would never find a wider audience. The music on 1980’s The Return of the Durutti Column bore no relation to the workmanlike post-punk that the original band had contributed to the label’s compilation EP A Factory Sample, put together the previous year. (Although Reilly thought they were “complete and total rubbish”, too.) Grasping for comparisons, the music press likened it to the atmospheric jazz of the German label ECM and Reilly’s guitar playing to that of Mike Oldfield and theGrateful Dead’s Jerry Garcia– neither of them having much musical cachet in the post-punk world of 1980. Even a positive review in the NME suggested listeners would consider The Return of the Durutti Column “hippy noodling”.And that should have been that. Another Factory curio, a name on the list of wildly obscure artists on whom the label briefly alighted: Tunnelvision, Ad Infinitum, Shark Vegas, Abecedarians. Instead, here we are, 45 years on, staring down a version of The Return of the Durutti Column given the classic album deluxe treatment. It comes with a plethora of lo-fi home demos and recordings from gigs in Leeds and Brussels that reveal Reilly’s early attempts to turn the Durutti Column into a live act were as fraught as you might expect. “You’re a very nice audience,” he mutters at one juncture, before swiftly changing his mind: “You’re a fucking awful audience.”For music that could seem as fragile as the man who made it – one critic compared the sound of Reilly’s dextrous guitar lines, turned into intricate latticeworks by the use of echo, to “frost on a windowpane” – the sound of the Durutti Column has proved surprisingly robust. It has appeared on the soundtracks of The Bear and video game Grand Theft Auto and been hailed by everyone from Red Hot Chili Peppers to Frank Ocean. An interpolation of their 1998 track Sing to Me lent a very English melancholy to Blood Orange’s wonderful recent single The Field.Listening to The Return of the Durutti Column today, its longevity and influence is easy to understand. What counted against it in 1980 was its distance from everything else happening at the time. That ultimately worked in its favour: other than the sound of the primitive rhythm tracks, there’s nothing to tie the music here to a specific era, which means it hasn’t dated. And perhaps the peculiar circumstances of its creation – people experimenting for their own benefit, rather than actively making an album for public consumption – helped forge its distinctly beguiling atmosphere.‘I’ve played for 60 years. That’s long enough’: guitar hero Vini Reilly on PTSD, life on the streets and the little girl who saved himRead moreThere are sonically richer and more expansive albums in the Durutti catalogue, which built on the blueprint established here and grew to encompass everything from sampling to flamenco. But from the moment Reilly’s guitar appears on opener Sketch for Summer – its languid echoing tones a perfect evocation of a long, sun-dappled July afternoon – you feel drawn into a secret world, filled with private feelings. It rarely sounds anguished or pained, but you wonder if the desperate circumstances in which Reilly was operating have some bearing on music that, for all its lush melodiousness, feels emotionally raw, without filter.You don’t need to know that Collette and Katherine were named after Reilly’s former and current girlfriends to sense the tracks’ respective sweet sadness and delicate euphoria; Lips That Would Kiss would sound like an expression of yearning regardless of its title; the unspeakably lovely Requiem for a Father is so shrouded in reverb that it seems to be transmitting from a vast distance, like a fading memory. For all the undoubted technical skill on display, the most striking thing about the music is its power to move you rather than simply dazzle: only the self-explanatorily titled Jazz – recorded with a live rhythm section – slips into the realm of background music. The rest is exquisite, an album its author never intended to be heard, that you suspect people will discover and fall in love with for decades to come.This week Alexis listened toOvermono – Paradise RunnerWe’re entering the period when the charts and airwaves gum up with Christmas sludge, so here’s a sleek, sparkling palate cleanser in the form of a speeded-up R&B vocal, shivering synthesisers, powerful house rhythm.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekIndieExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yuletide now seems to start roughly whezn Strictly does, and Black Friday seemed to kick off around Halloween. But now, at last, we’ve reached the day that puts the “Friday” into Black Friday.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Black Friday is a devil worth dancing with if you want to save money on products you’ve had your eye on. Some of the Filter’s favourite items spent most of November floating around at prices clearly designed to make them sell out fast. Other deals have been kept back until now, and some won’t even land until the daftly named Cyber Monday (1 December).As ever, we’d encourage you not to buy anything unless you really need it and have the budget to do so – read our advice onhow to shop smartly.Here’s our fully updated guide to the best genuine Black Friday bargains on the Filter’s favourites, from Anker battery packs to KidiZoom cameras via the espresso machine you loved more than any other product this year.For more, read thebest Black Friday deals under £50How we selected these deals (and excluded others)The key toshopping smarton Black Friday, Cyber Monday or any discount event is to know what you want – and we’re here to help you target the good stuff. We’ve tested thousands of products at the Filter in 2025 and warmly recommended hundreds of them, including many that have genuinely good Black Friday discounts.Instead of listing price cuts on all the products we’ve featured, we’ve focused on the things you’ve liked the most this year, and looked for deals that undercut their long-term average prices by a significant amount. Ideally, their Black Friday price will be their lowest of the year.We don’t take retailers at their word on discount size, either. Amazon may say it’s “70%” off the RRP, but we study the price history of every item using independent tools such asthe Camelizerto find out how generous a discount really is. If an item’s price has been all over the place in 2025, we’ll give the average price below instead of a “was …” price, so you can judge how good a deal it is.Q&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The bestBlack Friday deals on the Filter’s favourite productsThe best home and mattress dealsThe best artificial Christmas treeView image in fullscreenHabitat 6ft mixed top upswept Christmas tree, £84 (was £120)£84 (with code XMAS30) at ArgosHabitat’s gloriously lifelike and easy-to-assemble tree topped our test to find thebest artificial Christmas trees, and as December rattles towards us it’s inevitably discounted for Black Friday.

The handheld bit detaches easily from the body then slots back in when needed, and you get an array of brushes, scrapers, pads and nozzles. This dirt-blitzing package has dropped more than 40% at Currys and Amazon.Smart wake-up and reading lightView image in fullscreenPhilips SmartSleep sleep and wake-up light, £139.99 (avg £179.61)£139.99 at Philips£139.99 at AmazonWhen testing products for his guide to thebest sunrise alarm clocks, our writer Pete Wise was struck by how well this one worked as a reading light. “Even when a bright setting is selected, the light seems relatively mellow and restful,” wrote Pete, who also liked the range of alarm sounds and audio input option. He found it a little too expensive, however – and it’s still north of £100, but somewhat less so.The best heated clothes airerView image in fullscreenDry:Soon Deluxe heated airer, £159.99 (was £199.99)£159.99 at Lakeland£159.99 at AmazonA heated airer dries your clothes fast enough to avoid the dreaded stink of slow-dried laundry, and without the cost or noise of a tumble dryer. Lakeland’s three-tier heated airer – the top performer in ourheated airerstest – has proved enduringly popular with the Filter’s readers, and is now at its lowest price ever. Lakeland has also dropped the price of theairer with coverto £195.98 for Black Friday.The best hybrid mattressView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOtty Original Hybrid double, £533.58with code THEFILTER7 (was £647.99)£533.58 with code at OttyThe most comfortable and supportive foam-and-springs hybrid of all themattresseswe’ve tested, the Otty already came at an impressive price of £647.99 for a double, but the Filter’s exclusive code gives you a small but perfectly welcome additional 7% off for Black Friday.

It’s been around for a few years and saw a price hike in 2022 (cost-of-waking-up crisis?) before settling at just under £50 from most retailers, so this is a deal worth grabbing.Simba Pro hybrid mattressView image in fullscreenSimba Hybrid Pro king size, £948.27 (was £1,299)£948.27 at SimbaMattress “discounts” may seem to be a 24/7/365 thing, but UK watchdogs have given companies short shrift over money-off claims that aren’t all they seem. We’ve certainly noticed Simba playing by the rules lately, and its current 30%-off sale is the first we’ve seen in months. The excellentSimba Hybrid Pro, another of ourbest mattresses, is now hundreds of pounds cheaper in all sizes, from single (now £599.25) to super king (now £1,091.22).Wool mattress topperView image in fullscreenWoolroom Deluxe wool topper (double), from £148.74 (was £174.99)£148.74 at Amazon£165.74 at the WoolroomThe sustainably sourced wool in Woolroom’s bedding is a hypoallergenic temperature regulator, helping to keep you warm in winter and cool on hotter nights. The company’s deluxemattress topperadds a touch of softness to a too-hard mattress, and is one of the easiest toppers we tested to move and store. Woolroom’s 35% isn’t quite as big a discount as Amazon’s, but it applies to everything on its site, including duvets, mattresses and linens.Powerful pressure washerView image in fullscreenBosch UniversalAquatak 135 high pressure washer, £135 (was £209)£135 at Currys£135 at AmazonBlitz the gunk from your patio, decking, gutters and any flat surface you find yourself unable to resist pointing the nozzle at. Our writer Andy Shaw found the UniversalAquatak to be the most powerful of all thepressure washershe tested, and he thought its price was reasonable too. It’s now even cheaper for Black Friday, although not quite its lowest price of 2025 – it was briefly (very briefly) under £120 for Prime Day.Shark vacuum cleanerView image in fullscreenShark PowerDetect vacuum, £314 (was £549)£314 at Shark£314 at AmazonA vacuum cleaner that empties itself? Yes please, said our writer Andy Shaw in his roundup of thebest cordless vacuum cleaners– and you agreed, making Shark’s ingenious and powerful cordless cleaner one of your favourite products of the year.

The Eufy X10 was named “best overall” by Stuart Andrews in his guide to thebest robot vacuums, and it’s already one of the fastest-selling items in Amazon’s Black Friday sale. Its price cut isn’t quite the 38% Amazon suggests, because it cost £579 throughout 2025, but this is still a legitimately good deal.Damp-destroying dehumidifierView image in fullscreenProBreeze dehumidifier, from £151.99 (was £189.99)£159.49 at ProBreezeThis “workhorse”, which “extracted moisture powerfully” in ourbest dehumidifierstest, has tumbled to its lowest price of the year (except for a few days in May, because no one buys dehumidifiers in May).

One of our topcat essentials, the SureFlap hasn’t been this cheap at Amazon since 2023, and Currys is only a penny behind. The moggie-trackingConnect versionis also discounted at £119.99 – its lowest price since 2022.Cuddly heated throwView image in fullscreenBeurer HD150 heated throw, £79.99 (was £84.99)£79.99 at Amazon£79.99 at BeurerBeurer’s “soft and sumptuous” fleece blanket was crowned “best throw overall” in our guide to thebest electric blanketsthanks to its ability to get toasty fast without using much energy. A fiver off is not a massive discount, but this is its cheapest recent price on Amazon, where it normally costs £84.99. Beurer has now matched Amazon’s Black Friday price, dropping from £94.99 to £79.99.Google video doorbellView image in fullscreenGoogle Nest doorbell, from £119.98 (was £179.99)£119.98 at Amazon£129 at CurrysSort the cold-callers from the welcome visitors when they’re still metres away from your front door, with this outstanding battery-powered doorbell that crashes to its lowest price since Black Friday 2023.

With more than £30 shaved off Amazon’s average price for the camera, it’s now an even more reasonable buy.Budget electric blanketView image in fullscreenSlumberdown Sleepy Nights electric blanket, king size, from £30.59(was £45.99)£30.59 at Amazon£34.20 at SlumberdownThis Slumberdown Sleepy Nights performed admirably in Emily Peck’s test ofthe best electric blankets, heating quickly to a temperature that was comfortable to keep our reviewer warm through the night.

It’s the king-size one that’s been discounted.Subscription-free video doorbellView image in fullscreenEufy Security doorbell E340, £74.99 (avg £151.29)£74.99 at AmazonLots of video doorbells and home surveillance systems come with a recurring subscription to access some of their features, which you may wish to avoid. If so, then the Eufy Video Doorbell E340 was Andy Shaw’s pick in his testing of thebest video doorbellsout there. He liked the E340 precisely because of its dual camera setup to make keeping an eye on parcels a breeze, plus the onboard storage to stick it to cloud storage. Reliability of movement detection needed some work, though. At £74.99 from Amazon, it’s also at its lowest price ever this Black Friday from the big online retailer.The best tech dealsSilk sleep headphonesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianSnoozeband Silk, £84 (was £99)£84 at SnoozebandBlock out the world and drift off to whatever music, podcast or white noise you choose with this comfy silk sleep mask that incorporates flat Bluetooth speakers for pairing with your phone.

DJ and producerSophie Lloydtold the Filter’s Kate Hutchinson that she loves the sound quality, size and durability of these phones, adding that their modular design means “you can buy a new lead or earpieces separately, which is essential when you’re using them all the time”. This Black Friday deal takes them to their lowest price of 2025.Portable Bluetooth speakerView image in fullscreenBose SoundLink Flex 2nd gen, £108.95 (was £149.95)£108.95 at John Lewis£108.95 at AmazonThis fab portable speaker boasts 12-hour battery life, durability and a range of swish colours, making it a must-have foruniversity lifeand beyond.

It’s also pocket-sized compared with some of the 7l and 8l beasts you can buy, but it happily accommodated 500g of potatoes, half a lamb shoulder and various vegetables in Joanne’s test.Ninja assisted barista coffee machineView image in fullscreenNinja Cafe Luxe ES601UK, from £439 (was £549)£439 at Amazon£439.99 at ArgosHaving cornered the market in air fryers, Ninja now has its eye on all your kitchen needs, starting with your morning coffee – however you take it, from cold brew to latte.

It brings the nitro beer effect to your Guinness at home, enabling you to pour the black stuff in two-part draught style, just like any good bartender. It’s a brilliantChristmas giftidea, now with a third wiped off its price … so, sincere apologies if you bought it last week when we first recommended it.

Not quite so big, anyway. Rachel Ogden named the Double Stack XL “best compact air fryer” in her guide to thebest air fryers, but with its 9.5lL capacity and four cooking levels, this thing can cook alot. Still not cheap, but far below its average price of £229.The best blenderView image in fullscreenBraun PowerBlend 9,£140 (was £199)£140 at Amazon£140 at AOYou can spend about £500 on a premium blender, but this superb model from Braun costs below £200 even at full price – something ourbest blenderstester, Rachel Ogden, could hardly believe when she named it “best overall”.

It’s easily the best budget-friendly hair dryer, and it’s now the cheapest it’s ever been.Wet to dry multistylerView image in fullscreenShark FlexStyle £159 (was £269.99)£159 at John LewisThe Dyson Airwrap v Shark FlexStyle debate has been raging on for years now, with both manufacturers recently launching upgraded versions.

Photograph: Europa Press News/Getty ImagesThe leftist party exploded out of Spain’s anti-austerity protests in 2011 and upended Spain’s entrenched two-party system. I was instantly captivated – and for the next decade, I worked for the party. But I ended up quitting politics in disappointment. What happened?This article originally appeared inEquator, a new magazine of politics, culture and artByLilith VerstryngeThu 27 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTShareInever expected to retire in my 30s, but I suppose politics is the art of the impossible: what it promises, what it extracts. A decade at the heart of Spain’s boldest modern political experiment aged me in ways I’ve only just begun to fathom.In May 2014, just four months after it was founded, the leftwing Spanish party Podemos (“We Can”)won five seatsin the European parliament. As a recent university graduate who had been part of a local Podemos group (orcírculo, as they were known) in Paris, I was hired to work for these MEPs. We arrived in Brussels as complete tyros and had to learn everything on the job. But we were motivated by the promise of doing what we used to call “real politics” – that is to say, not the internal power struggles and ideological weather patterns of the movement (which were always abundant), but the actual issues, such as gender discrimination and unemployment.Over the next few years, Podemos continued to disrupt Spain’s sclerotic two-party system. In the November 2019 general elections, we won enough seats to join Spain’sfirst-ever governing coalition, under prime minister Pedro Sánchez, as a junior partner to the centre-left Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE).Shortly after that election, I got a call from Madrid: it wasPablo IglesiasTurrión, the charismatic political scientist and founder of Podemos, who was soon to be Spain’s second deputy prime minister and minister of social rights.“I think you should come back to Madrid,” he said. He offered me a job in the social rights ministry, doing a lot of the same things I was doing for EU deputies: helping with speeches, communication and policy negotiations. Of course, I said yes.We would have to learn almost everything from scratch, again. Some longstanding civil servants were already asking to be transferred because they didn’t want to work for these young radicals. But others told us with excitement that they had voted for us, that the government needed new blood. This, too, felt like real politics; it was one thing to say that the two-party system was broken, and another thing to figure out how to govern alongside them.When I returned to Madrid, I was prepared for attacks from the right, claiming that I had only got the job because of my father, Jorge Verstrynge, who had once helped lead Spain’s main post-Franco conservative party. (This was partly why I had spent so many years studying and working abroad.) But the right is always surprising.Two weeks into the job, in March 2020 – while I was still looking for a flat to rent, having temporarily moved back into my childhood bedroom – I started to get texts asking if I’d been online that day. Overnight, there had been a blitz of headlines in the rightwing papers alleging that I had been hired at the Ministry of Social Rights because I was Iglesias’s lover. Never mind that I had barely met him in person. With half the country now glued to their computers during the pandemic’s first lockdown, the rumour was everywhere.View image in fullscreenVerstrynge, left, when party secretary, and former secretary-general, Ione Belarra, in the Congress of Deputies, Madrid, in 2023.Photograph: Europa Press News/Europa Press/Getty ImagesMy intuition had been essentially correct: for certain people, the only way a young woman could possibly have got that job was through a relationship with a man – albeit not my father, but my boss. The attack was designed to cause damage in more ways than one, because Iglesias’s domestic partner was Irene Montero, a longtimePodemosMP who had just been appointed as minister of equality in the new coalition government.Colleagues, journalists and lawyers all advised me to ignore it. Only a few months later, when we had another election season on our hands, did we bother to publicly deny it. In any case, Podemos had long believed that fake news, at times, could be turned to its advantage. The party was obsessed with getting messages across through any medium possible, and saw television as a key arena of political struggle. In 2015, Iglesias had written: “People no longer engage politically through parties … but through the media.”“You are known, and we can use that,” party leaders explained to me. Once the dust settled, I vividly experienced a vindication of the idea that there is no such thing as bad press. Basically, the attack backfired. Not long afterwards, I was added to the list of candidates for the regional elections in Madrid, and was placed at number 14 – high enough to have a real chance of winning a seat. I was 29.Iwas born in 1992 in Madrid. My father was born to a ruined Belgian businessman in the Tangier international zone, declared himself a fascist as a teenager, became secretary-general of the Alianza Popular (AP) – the predecessor to today’s main conservative party – and was purged from the party by the age of 40. Today he votes on the left, and teaches at a public university. He met my mother, a journalist turned housing rights activist, in the AP’s youth organisation. She left the party first. I grew up with the ambient understanding that people change, ideas evolve, and collective struggle is worthwhile.I am the third of their four children, and the only daughter. At home, everybody talked about politics, and my parents were critical of the two main parties’ chokehold. But I initially resisted politics. In 2011, I was studying history and international relations at the University of Paris when the15-M movement broke outacross Spain. Economic pressure was suffocating millions. A generation that had grown up being encouraged to study, train, learn languages and prepare for a promising future now saw its expectations shattered by the financial crisis. From my student flat, I watched as every news outlet was flooded with images of austerity and poverty – young people without jobs, ever more homeless people, families and elderly people being evicted.In response, on 15 May 2011, more than50,000 protesters convergedon the Puerta del Sol, one of Madrid’s main public squares, and thousands more marched across Barcelona, Granada, Santiago de Compostela and beyond. For young people, politics had become urgent and personal overnight.A few days later, I flew from Paris to Madrid. A lot of my friends were camping in the Puerta del Sol, and I slept in the streets with them for two nights. There were people of all ages, many of whom had no prior ideology or history of political involvement. This raw vein of populist sentiment left a huge impression on me. It seemed as if Spain’s calcified political system might be cracked open through sheer collective will. The energy was intoxicating, as strangers debated late into the night about how to rebuild democracy from the ground up. I skipped some of my classes for the rest of the term. But eventually, I had to return to my studies.View image in fullscreenAn anti-government protest in the Puerta del Sol, Madrid, in 2011.Photograph: Arturo Rodriguez/APThe protesters started to organise in different sectors, defending public health, housing and labour. My mum was so affected by images of evictions that she started attending housing reform meetings. My dad, meanwhile, told me that some of the professors at his university were whispering about building a new party that could bring 15-M’s ideas to the ballot box. In January 2014, Iglesias founded Podemos, and I joined immediately. In a practical sense, that meant joining a satellite Podemos círculo in Paris. There were about 50 of us, including some older Spanish exiles, young people from Spain and France, as well as French journalists and activists. We would meet in a bar on the Left Bank.The romance of Podemos was that so many young people were suddenly engaged in politics, because its messaging felt less like jargon and more like common sense. We suddenly believed that we had a stake in the future. Before this, the Spanish left had been defined in opposition to Franco-ism – but Iglesias used to say we shouldn’t even talk about left or right. He spoke instead about the people and the economic elites – and insisted that public health and guaranteed housing weren’t radical ideas. There was no one like us inEuropein this era – before Syriza came into power in Greece, before La France Insoumise. In May 2014, the party shocked everyone by winning five out of 54 seats in the European parliament.That summer I became a técnico, or adviser, for two of those deputies in Brussels. Before my first day, Podemos, surpassing any parody of leftist splintering, had already broken down the middle over questions of political strategy. Should we differentiate ourselves from the socialists, or try to reach agreements with them? Two major factions emerged: one, under Iglesias, argued that Podemos should ally with the traditional left, while the other, under Íñigo Errejón, the party’s first campaign manager, pushed for a “populist” approach that didn’t ally with any traditional workers’ party. Our MPs were from both sides, and some partisan staffers wouldn’t even talk to each other in the canteen.I spent hours poring over reports on topics ranging from medical marijuana and geopolitics to agricultural pests in southern Europe. We were a young, inexperienced group, but eager to do things right. Like most people our age, we had never had “real jobs” or owned houses, but were suddenly working side by side with veteran statesmen. We would enter parliament when its doors opened at 8:30am, and leave well past midnight, after reviewing the hundreds of amendments that we submitted to every report that passed through our hands. We vacillated wildly between feeling godlike and realising how little we knew about getting things done at the EU’s only directly elected institution.Few of our colleagues in Brussels had entered politics the way we had – knocking on doors, stumping, protesting – but many were clearly well informed, and we had a lot to learn from them. One of those lessons was the fact that you start doing politics with emotions, but you must transform those into action.Iglesias, the young, ponytailed professor who became a household name through television debates, was a totally new kind of Spanish politician. He combined sophisticated strategic thinking with an intuition for connecting with the masses who had become indignant – “Indignados” was another name for 15-M – about inequality and austerity. His style of leadership became the condition and the limitation of our project.In March 2021, about a year after I returned to Spain,Iglesias abruptly resignedas second deputy prime minister, after concluding that it was vital for him to secure the party’s survival in Madrid’s regional elections. He declared that a leftwing alliance could finally end decades of rule in the region by the conservative People’s party. His gamble was largely a failure: he managed to increase the party’s seats in Madrid, but with only 7% of the vote, he fell far short of his goal of bringing the left to power. As a result, he also stepped down from Podemos’ leadership, having proposed that our left coalition continue under the direction of labour minister Yolanda Díaz. Despite being a card-carrying communist since her youth, Díaz was less hardline and more willing to negotiate than Iglesias, which she had shown by enacting worker protections during the pandemic. Podemos was entering a new era.View image in fullscreenYolanda Díaz earlier this month.Photograph: Zipi/EPAIn June 2021, secretary-general Ione Belarra selected me to be party secretary – effectively the number-three position in Podemos. I was now the one negotiating the lists of people we presented at elections, as well as managing our never-dull relations with other political organisations and the media.My new job required me to connect our fractured regional branches with the national leadership. But what Podemos valued far more than organisation was communication – or perhaps “airtime” would be more accurate. Our leaders, like those of Syriza, were deeply influenced by the Argentinian political theorist Ernesto Laclau, who argued that populist movements could bypass traditional party structures through the canny use of media. This idea was obviously seductive: why invest in the slow work of organising when you could reach millions through television? But there was a pitfall we didn’t really see at the time: you could win power through airtime, but you couldn’t govern with it. And perhaps our own change in status, from upstarts into people in power, had happened too fast for our leaders to internalise our success.Shortly after starting my new post, a party operative suggested to me that we could simply close every local delegation and turn Podemos into a party with just 10 strong national leaders. This was not at all viable, and I could hardly believe someone so high up in Podemos actually advocated this, but his attitude was typical of a party that was fundamentally uninterested in structure – in the tedious work of building local chapters, training organisers, holding regular meetings and maintaining the infrastructure that keeps a party alive between election cycles.We also hadn’t clocked how our base was changing. The initial strength of Podemos was that it brought hundreds of thousands of people out of apathy, and even attracted supporters in other countries. But by the 2020s, the major experience of working in Podemos was of dwindling political debate and growing internal paranoia.In July 2022, I joined the Ministry of Social Affairs as secretary of state forthe 2030 Agenda. But Podemos was beginning to collapse. Though Iglesias had hoped that Díaz would take over Unidas Podemos, our broader left coalition, she had other ideas. The same month I joined the ministry, she launched a newprogressive coalition called Sumarto present a fresh face to voters, without the now-considerable baggage of Podemos. This was pitched as a way to preserve a left presence in government, but it risked making Podemos irrelevant. The threat seemed to galvanise Iglesias, despite his nominal resignation as Podemos leader in 2021. (In reality, he remained a constant presence in the Spanish media, offering almost daily political commentary on radio and TV programmes, often anticipating the party’s official positions and effectively setting our agenda – which is to say nothing about his ubiquity in the group chats.)A few months later, he decided to give a speech opposing Díaz’s new alliance, and asked if I could round up a crowd of 40,000. That was impossible. By that point, we might have been able to activate 2,000, if the weather was perfect. How could he not comprehend that Podemos was no longer a party that could turn out 40,000 people to any event, let alone one that was about a further leftist split?Outside criticism bruised us, too. In just a few years, Podemos had faced so many false attacks – charges of corruption, using accounts in tax havens, receiving moneyfrom Iran and Venezuela– that many members lost their initial idealism. The combative attitude that had once turned my tabloid scandal into electoral fuel had its limits. Almost every major Podemos figure soon had some kind of judicial case open against them – many of them trumped up and fake, but tiring all the same. Several years straight of doing politics in a state of permanent alert slid us toward the traditional comfort zone of the left: victimhood.By the spring of 2023, it was clear that Podemos was no longer steering Unidas Podemos, which had formed a coalition government with PSOE back in 2019, and we were forced to negotiate with Díaz. In June, Podemos accepted a deal that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago, andjoined the Sumar coalition. The new balance of power was painful, and our candidates were further down the list than anyone had anticipated. Despite my growing disillusionment, I focused on finishing every task handed to me. And when Podemos managed to win five of Sumar’s 31 seats in the July 2023 election, one of them was mine.When the time came to form his third government, Pedro Sánchez had to build a coalition with Sumar, not with Podemos. The general perception was that Podemos no longer brought in votes, so its presence should be reduced. Despite this, there were attempted olive branches, such as offers to include some Podemos members, including Nacho Álvarez or Ione Belarra, in the new cabinet. Podemos, however, had decided that our non-negotiable appointment was Irene Montero, and that she should stay on as minister of equality. The 35-year-old was arguably the party’s most visible figure, despite the dustup over a2022 affirmative consent lawthat she spearheaded, and had also become our de facto leader. The PSOE refused to keep her on, and Podemos was left out of the new cabinet altogether. It was the turning point that consolidated our new strategy of opposition. A few months later, we would break away from Sumar, too.Both Belarra and Montero had to leave their ministerial posts, and they both gave angry, candid speeches: Podemos colleagues had acted in a “distressing and despicable” manner, said Montero, whileBelarra saidthat our opponents had “tried to destroy us, but they couldn’t, and all they’ve achieved is making us stronger”. This party line now rang hollow. In less than a decade, Podemos had become a party that feared the world, and indeed one that feared its own country. How?View image in fullscreenPodemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, and Pedro Sánchez, then acting prime minster, in 2019 after signing an agreement to form a coalition government.Photograph: JuanJo Martin/EPAWe had stopped talking to people. Instead of demonstrating to voters that Podemos could still do politics – by fighting for the interests of our constituents – we decided that we would vote against, or threaten to vote against, everything that Sánchez’s government proposed. This included ostensibly core party issues such as rights for unemployed people. And even that might have worked, if we had explained to voters that we were stonewalling on purpose, with a plan – but we didn’t.We had started talking to ghosts. The constant, threatening presence of fascism and the search for internal enemies turned politics into an exercise in blind loyalty. Conspiracy was widespread, and we indiscriminately blamed journalists and the media, to the point of openly stating that it was better to have voters who did not read the news at all. The media were no longer a tool, but an enemy.During our short time in power, we did rack up some tangible policy and legislative successes, including a better minimum wage, a progressive law on euthanasia, improved abortion access and labour rights, and a domestic violence hotline. But I felt that the manner of our departure overshadowed these victories.Perhaps the simplest way to describe what happened during those final months is that I fell out of love. Suddenly, the last nine years felt very long; I felt much older than my friends, even though I was one of the only ones still unmarried and without children. Though I had learned so much in an organisation that had helped to redefine Europe after the financial crisis, I had also become hardened and more cynical, and had come to feel a certain anticipatory political orphanhood.But politics does not belong to us. It belongs to all those whose lives are shaped by it. And I knew one thing for certain: no one should stay in politics merely out of fear of losing their place.And so, in January 2024, at the age of 31, I announced my retirement. My entire statementwas posted on X: “Farewells are difficult and sad. I am leaving my political responsibilities and also my seat as a deputy. A thousand thanks to the Podemos activists and to the people who have trusted me over these years.”I kept it brief, thinking of all those who still stood for a project I no longer believed in. I thought, perhaps naively, that my silence – about the infighting, the personality conflicts, the ways we had betrayed some of our founding principles – would protect them. But nearly two years later, it’s possible to reflect with some distance, and I believe it’s important to do so, if only to leave a record for future political upstarts.Looking back, it seems clear that Podemos never really wanted to be a party, let alone a better kind of party. From the beginning, its leaders believed that parties were outdated, and that social movements were the true engine of political transformation. Working under those premises, the best we managed to create was an online party – one that sounded new, but inherited many old vices, and failed to introduce any meaningful organisational innovation. Still, I wish we had tried harder – or perhaps that we could try again, knowing what we know now.I have no plans to return to politics. To do so, I would need to be sure that I had learned enough to do things better – and that I could once again trust a project deeply enough to believe in it. Neither of those conditions is met today.Party politics is imperfect and demanding, but I still believe that parties are the lifeblood of parliamentary democracies. Newer projects such as Your Party in the UK are seeking to spark similar left-populist insurgencies against the ossified establishments in their countries. But if they don’t build the organisational capacity and internal democracy that we neglected, I don’t see much of a future for them. And they must never stop talking to their supporters. When people stop feeling that their participation matters, they drift away. Podemos transformed Spain’s two-party system – that’s undeniable. But real politics is about creating something durable enough to outlast your own moment of insurgency.Spain’s Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nationRead moreMy life is much quieter now. I read, write and teach international relations theory at Sciences Po in Paris. I don’t teach anything drawn from my personal experience, though many students are curious about Podemos’s early years. When people ask me what happened with the party, I usually say that its leaders have other interests. After resigning in 2021, Iglesias launched a media outlet that became the main arm of his activism – though it would not have made sense without Podemos in the first place. He also opened a bar in Madrid. He asked for crowdfunded voter donations for the bar, which was, he claimed, a place to fight against fascism. Íñigo Errejón became Sumar’s spokesperson, but left politics in October 2024, afteraccusations of sexual assault.When I told people close to me that I planned to resign, some of them urged me not to do it. My father kept repeating the same line: “Once you leave politics, they never let you come back.”I have no doubt this was true in his time. In some ways, it was a classic generational disagreement about gaps in one’s résumé. But it also reflects how, for his contemporaries, politics was almost a religion. I believe things should be different now. I know my father was trying to protect me. But I also remembered that, beyond the vertigo of such a decision, it was at home that I first learned that institutional politics is a place of transit, not a destination. I still believe everyone should have the chance to engage in it, at some point in their life. But politics should be just that: a stage, not a lifetime. We must know when we can still contribute – and when it’s time to let others lead.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignThe best stories take time.From politics to philosophy, personal stories to true crime, discover a selection of the Guardian’s finest longform journalism, in one beautiful edition.

Now it is goneLucy Powell is deputy leader of the Labour partyThu 27 Nov 2025 12.04 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 12.12 ESTShareYesterday the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delivered aLabourbudget. People have been asking for Labour’s purpose and values to be more clearly expressed. Through the choices made – a shift to a fairer tax system, targeting wealth to pay for tackling child poverty, good public services and the cost of living – we have clearly set out what we stand for.That’s why Labour MPs cheered in the Commons, and it’s why we are up for the fights to come. And it’s why the cries from the right began immediately.The central dividing line in British politics is once again on the economy. On the one side Labour, who want to change it so it benefits ordinary working people, and on the other, our political opponents, who support the status quo and the failed ideology of the past. We must now take on, and win, the argument.The Torieshad 14 yearsto fix things and instead, by any measure, they got much worse. Their ideological austerity and trickle-down economics–tax breaks for the wealthy, cutting off investment (leaving us with low productivity and wages), and failing to support young people post-Covid–didn’t work.Living standardsfell by the largest marginsince records began, child povertyreached record levels, NHS waiting lists in England were the highestthey’ve ever been, wageswere stagnant, a housing crisistook hold, young people scarred by Covid wereleft on the scrapheap. The record of failure goes on.One budget alone can’t put all this right, so Labour has a long-term plan for renewal and for rewiring the country. And we have to go out and keep making the argument for why our approach will reap dividends.Take welfare spending and child poverty. Under the Tories, welfare spendingsignificantly increased. As did child poverty, because they didn’t address the root causes: low pay, high housing costs, deep inequalities in education, health and regions. The state ends up paying more to deal with the symptoms instead of the cure.It’s why we are building more social housing than for a generation, increasing wages andnew rights for workers, massively boosting investment in infrastructure and new industries, getting waiting lists down andbringing downthe costs of childcareand energyas we drive for clean power.It’s also why we are absolutely right to use this budget tolift the two-child benefit cap.For eight long years, since George Osborne introduced it, poorer families with children have suffered from acruel social experimentthat was branded as fair for working people when it was anything but. Most of the families affected by it have a parent in work.It’s done nothing but push 300,000 more children into poverty – which, in the end, costs us more, as well as being callous and immoral.I know from my own constituency – where over 5,000 children will be lifted out of poverty as a result of ending the cap– the real impact it’s had. Children wearing £1 Matalan wellies as school shoes, children going to bed hungry and cold, living in cramped, mouldy homes, parents this Christmas relying on food banks for a modest meal or small gift for their kids.I also see the impact on schools, teachers, social workers, doctors and charities who are already stretched but have to divert time and resources tosupporting children who are living with the consequences of deep poverty.Just one in four pupils from the poorest families achieve five good GCSEs, compared with nearly three in four among affluent families. This sets them up for the disadvantages they face throughout their lives: missed potential, financialstruggles and ill health. Children who grew up in poverty are more likely to be unemployed or poor as adults.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Poverty costs the economy far, far more than the £3bn cost of lifting the two-child cap, or extending free school meals.That’s why we acted urgently in the budget, despite the very difficult economic context. Every day with this cap in place sees more than 100 additional children pushed into poverty. The effects of lifting it won’t happen overnight either, so acting early in the parliament was vital.The cap was a totem to 14 years of failed rightwing ideology. Now it is gone.We, as Labour, can also be clear that these measures are being paid for in a fair way – from a new gambling levy, closing tax loopholes and a new “mansion tax”.Fairness and purpose – that’s how we will win the battle of ideas. This budget is a clear statement that we won the election as Labour, and will govern as Labour. As I repeatedly said during my campaign to become deputy leader, we must seize back the political megaphone and set the agenda more strongly about what’s really wrong with the country and how we are fixing it. We’ve certainly done that this week.So let’s keep hold of it and win this fight about how we will renew Britain and tackle the deep inequalities holding us back.Lucy Powell is MP for Manchester Central and deputy leader of the Labour partyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But now some people are fighting backThu 27 Nov 2025 12.20 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 14.10 ESTShareFor the past six years, every Black Friday – that made-up carnival of consumption – Amazon workers and their allies have mobilised across the world in coordinatedstrikes and protests. At first glance, these disputes look like the standard struggle between a giant capitalist employer and the people who keep it running. But Amazon is no ordinary corporation. It is the clearest expression of what I call technofeudalism: a new economic order in which platforms behave like lords owning the fiefs that have replaced markets.To appreciate Amazon’s extraordinary power, we must recall the system it is helping to bury. Capitalism relied on markets and profit. Firms invested in productive capital, hired workers, produced commodities and lived or died by profit and loss. But the emerging order is one in which the most powerful capitalist firms have exited that market altogether. They own the digital infrastructure that everyone else must use to trade, work, communicate and live.Amazon sits at the apex of this new order because it owns the cloud computing platform – Amazon Web Services (AWS) – upon which other technological firms, such as Uber, rely, but also large parts of banking, healthcare, logistics, public administration, media and education sectors. Once these businesses are embedded in AWS, switching costs become prohibitive. Firms thus become vassals on Amazon’s vast cloud fief and surrender their customers’ data. In 2020, the European commissioncharged Amazonwith using the sales data of other sellers to illegally gain an advantage in the European marketplace.Amazon fuses logistics, cloud infrastructure, data extraction and algorithmic command into one vertically integrated system. Inside Amazon’s warehouses, technofeudal domination takes a more visceral form. Workers are subjected to minute-by-minutesurveillance: handheld scanners and other devicestrack their movements; algorithms measure their pace, track productivity and monitor behaviour. Amazon, however, has said that claims of excessive surveillance are “factually incorrect” and any recording was necessary for ensuring safety and efficiency in its operations.Consumers, too, are drawn into the system. Each click, scroll, search and purchase on Amazon trains its algorithms to predict our needs and manipulate our desires. We, effectively, labour so that Amazon’s cloud capital accumulates. Each time we buy, Amazon can takeas much as 40%of the sale price from the sellers in what I call cloud rents.Governments have a job, ostensibly, to regulate behemoths such as Amazon, but they are also becoming its serfs as public institutions run their data and communications on Amazon servers.According to the Guardian, key ministerial departments that have contracts with AWSincludethe Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HMRC, the Ministry of Justice, the Cabinet Office and Defra.Unsurprisingly, cloud capital has invaded battlefields and the shadowy world of surveillance. Amazon Rekognition, launched in 2016, was aimed at law-enforcement bodies including ICE in the US. Palantir – the surveillance firm that produces software used in everything from counter-terrorism to predictive policing to ICE’s deportation machine – hasa partnershipwith AWS. Amazon is also directly involved inProject Nimbus, the 2021 cloud contract through which Amazon and Google provide the Israeli state with advanced cloud computing, AI and secure data storage.Amazon is a technofeudal rentier owning the digital infrastructure on which privateers, states and societies depend. Thankfully, there are signs of a pushback. The campaign that brings workers and citizens together every Black Friday –Make Amazon Pay– recognises this transformation. What began as a fight for workers’ rights has grown into a coalition of unions, climate campaigners, tax justice groups, digital rights advocates and migrant and Palestine solidarity networks. They understand that Amazon’s reach extends across logistics, finance, governance, ecological destruction, surveillance and war.Itsdemands– decent wages, safe workplaces, collective bargaining, climate action, tax justice, curbs on Amazon’s vast water consumption, an end to its entanglement with surveillance agencies and military operations – are integrated. Together, they map the much needed unified resistance to technofeudal domination.In the early decades of industrial capitalism, cross-border worker solidarity was hard. Today, the resistance to cloud capital can use its own tools to coordinate at planetary scale. Campaigns such as Make Amazon Pay offer a glimpse of the alliances required to confront our new cloudalist overlords. It may be only a beginning – but it is a hopeful one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Watch out for the narrative that will followFrances RyanThe right is already in a frenzy about the migrant groups it thinks will benefit – and the budget contained other trade-offsThu 27 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 15.10 ESTShareAnd just like that, the two-child benefit limit was finally abolished.“I don’t intend to preside over a status quo that punishes children for the circumstances of their birth,” the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, told the Commons, as she used the budget to scrap, from April 2026, one of Britain’s most controversial policies.Four hundred and fifty thousand children will be lifted out of poverty as a result. That means 450,000 children who won’t go to bed hungry any more or walk to school with holes in the soles of their shoes. That means Keir Starmer’s government, after 16 months in power and endless will-they-won’t-they procrastination, has – at last – done the right thing.Introduced by the Conservatives in 2017 to curb public spending and teach low-income parents that“children cost money”, the policy means parents can claim universal credit or tax credits only for their first two offspring. As of this summer, a staggering1.7 million childrenlived in households affected by the policy. That’sone in nine kidswho miss out on help worth £3,514 a year.Over nearly a decade, the cap has become a key part of the “war on welfare” narrative – and the key driver of worsening child poverty. The two-child limit fundamentally broke a core tenet of the welfare state: rather than helping a child because they are in need, it arbitrarily denied support based on the order of their birth.The notorious“rape clause”– in which women have to prove to the state that their third pregnancy was conceived without consent to get an exemption – came to symbolise the scale and casual cruelty of Tory austerity. As Reeves, Britain’s first female chancellor, said with palpable emotion on Wednesday, she won’t tolerate it.Labour MPs, charities and civil groups will all be relieved that the Treasury has finally found the funds to repeal it, though not everyone will forgive Reeves for the wait. Each day that she and Starmer prevaricated, an average of 109 more childrenwere pushedinto poverty.No one can pretend they didn’t know the harm it was causing. As far back as six years ago,research showednearly all families affected by the limit were cutting back on food, medication, heating or clothing. Domestic violence survivors have long warned that the policy makes it harder to leave an abusive partner. Other women have said they felt pushed towards an abortion, often after their contraception failed. Politicians – both those with either a blue or a red rosette – let it continue anyway.But if those on the left rue Starmer’s failure to end the policy sooner as a sign of his abandonment of Labour values, those on the right will use its abolition – in a tax-raising budget – as proof that he is prioritising benefits claimants. Or as the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, put it on Wednesday: “The Labour party should be renamed theWelfareparty.”Days before the budget, the Daily Mail published a poll asking readers whether Reeves should use a raid on the “salary sacrifice” tax break on private pensions to fund ending the two-child cap. Expect much more of this worker v shirker propaganda in the coming days, despite the fact nearly three in five families affected by the cap were already in work – and that any of us might lose a job or fall ill after having a child we could previously afford.Watch out also for the rise in anti-migrant sentiment adding a layer of racism to this longstanding classism. When the Times reported on the two-child limit’seffect on child povertythis week, it noted that rising immigration “may” be a “contributing factor” to hardship and large families, with white British people less likely than “Bangladeshi families” or “Pakistani families” to have three or more children. In recent days, hard-right social media accounts have been posting about the groups that will supposedly benefit from the policy change, often accompanied by unidentified photos of large minority-ethnic families. In the 2010s, the right’s fear was the working class breeding too much; in 2025, it’s working-class people who aren’t white.That Reeves felt she had to pair repealing the two-child limit with removing tax relief for the Motability scheme and leases for “luxury cars” for disabled people shows starkly the deal that she is making with the rightwing media and potential Reform voters. It is not enough to give children a warm meal because they are hungry. Ministers must justify it by reassuring critics they have not gone “soft on welfare”. Compassion, it seems, comes with a footnote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes, it is both at once. Eight years of campaigning,court casesand a change in government have at last rid the country of the scourge of the benefit limit. Hundreds of thousands of children will be safer; their parents less afraid.And yet the energy it took to get here and the backlash it has already provoked show starkly how progress is an uphill battle. Decency is not a simple sell. Prejudice and resentment are, sadly, much easier to spread. The most obvious of truths – that every child matters, that some things go beyond partisan point-scoring – are, to some, not obvious at all.Cheer the victory today. Tomorrow, the fight continues. The two-child limit is at last abolished but the sentiment that created it is alive and well.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025OpinionChild benefitsChildrenPovertyWelfareRachel ReevesBudgetcommentShareReuse this content"

After she delivered her second budget statement, it still is. Even more than usual, Wednesday’s speech was full of significant fiscal changes, altered spending commitments and adjusted economic forecasts, most of themaccidentally (and, for journalists, conveniently) releaseda short while in advance by the obviously misnamed Office for Budget Responsibility. Politically, however, almost nothing has changed at all.Reeves arrived in the Treasury last year offering what she, like Keir Starmer, had promised as the Conservative years ebbed: competence, stability and, above all, a focus on economic growth. Her problem, despite her upbeat assessments, is that she hasdelivered none of them. Nothing about the 2025 budget guarantees any early change in that, however defiantly Reeves spoke about reversing the OBR’s reduced new growth and productivity forecasts.No one is more aware of the dispirited national mood than Reeves herself. In her pre-budget video, she acknowledged the public’s continuing frustration and anger. What she did not acknowledge – although she is painfully aware of it in private and it shaped big parts of her budget – was that the same frustration and anger that carriedLabourinto government is now threatening to sweep Labour out of it again.Only an incorrigible Labour optimist – and there are very few of these at the moment – could say the 2025 budget has calmed those feelings, let alone laid them to rest. In some respects, indeed, the 2025 budget has made things worse, and not simply because of the many tax rises which, do not delude yourself, are never popular. All this will be overstated by a largely hostile press, but it seems inevitable that the 2025 budget will be remembered for the many taxes Reeves put up, rather than for the big one, income tax, that in the end she did not.From 2026 GDP growth is less than previously predictedBetween now and Christmas, political and media focus will be on whether Wednesday’s complex mix ofnew duties, stealth taxes and public spending hikes can cut it with the public, the bond markets and the Labour party. The budget blowbacks experienced in the past by chancellors such as Gordon Brown and George Osborne should remind all of them to expect the unintended. My own tuppenceworth is that higher taxes on private pension contributions may deter savings and boost consumer spending in quite significant ways for the economy.Right now, it is still the Labour party, particularly its fearful MPs and its candidates facing tough elections next May, that matters most in political terms. The backbenches seemed to welcome most of what Reeves announced – the end of thetwo-child benefit capin particular. Hardly surprising this, since this became a budget designed to calm a fractious Labour party, not one aimed at swing voters in marginal seats. This remains a very vulnerable time for both Reeves and Starmer. Their party still holds a lot of power over them.This budget will not merely define Reeves’s career and Labour’s prospects. Anyone with good sense in Whitehall should use what happened in this budget to force a comprehensive rethink of the whole budget preparation process. The OBR’s humiliating premature launch was merely the last straw for a more general failure. The long run-in to a very late budget meant a loss of good decision-making. The official strategy of pre-budget leaking is also completely out of hand. It is disreputable, insults parliament, stokes public contempt, empowers journalists to speculate not report and weakens the chancellor’s authority. The 2025 experience has been an object lesson in how not to do things. It should be the last budget of this kind.A lot of these issues predate Reeves’s chancellorship. Yet it remains her responsibility. Her own original sin remains the irresponsible pre-election commitment not to raise the three key personal taxes in this parliament. This underlay the undignified on-again, off-again mixed messages in this year’s drawn-out pre-budget period. It also implied she did not know what she was doing. That judgment is boosted by the fact that lifting the child benefit relief cap sits awkwardly with Reeves’s previous protestations of fiscal prudence. A budget that pleases most of the Labour party in its fissiparous current state is probably a budget with something pretty seriously amiss with it.By Reeves’s own rather modest standards, her speech was decent performative politics. The content may have been grim, but the shape of the statement was smart. There were one or two jokes and some sharp back-and-forth with the opposition. None of this will have harmed her with the Labour benches. But she plainly does not command the Commons as a more powerful chancellor ought to do. Though one accepts that all too few modern ministers of all political tribes seem capable of doing this, it is still a weakness which limits her authority to do difficult things.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bryan Robson was there. Eric Cantona was there. The manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær was there, and yet even as these four club legends sold the dream of Manchester United to a 17-year-old from the Midlands, they could sense the elusiveness, the coldness, the drop of the shoulder. The nagging suspicion that, like so many defendersJude Bellinghamwould later encounter, they too were grasping at pure air.“He had it planned out,” Solskjær would later remember. “He knew what he wanted. X amount of minutes in the first team. The most mature 17‑year‑old I’ve ever met in my life.” Though five years have passed since Bellingham turned down United for Borussia Dortmund, for me this is still the story that explains him best of all. The origin myth. This is what you all think I’m going to do. So I’m going to step that way instead.Ian Wright believes Jude Bellingham’s critics not ready for a ‘black superstar’Read moreAnd before we talk about Problem Jude, Petulant Jude, Selfish Jude, One Man World Cup Wrecking Ball Jude, let’s first discuss Jude the way he deserves to be discussed. Jude, the artist. Jude, the apostate. Jude, the obsessive student of the game who quotes Theodore Roosevelt after a big tournament win. The Jude who scores one of the most memorable goals inEnglandhistory at Euro 2024, who has played five La Ligaclásicosand scored the winning goal in three.Yet to listen to some of the chat about Bellingham in recent weeks is somehow to be persuaded that all this is somehow incidental, bordering irrelevant. “Of course he’s a fantastic player, no doubt about that,” pundits and journalists will opine, as if this is actually the boring bit, the part where the operator reminds you that all calls are being recorded, the necessary disclaimer before we get to the juicy stuff. Yes, yes, he’s very good at football. Now can we please –please– talk about his attitude.Sport, at its most basic level, is the pursuit of outcomes. You score or you don’t; you win or you don’t; you lift the trophy or someone else does. Certainly Bellingham seems to be a player who has plotted his career in a largely transactional fashion. Dortmund equals minutes. Madrid equals silverware. United equals what? The accumulated generational angst ofthe world’s most dysfunctional big cluband a selfie with a 78-year-old? Yeah, if you could maybe just put that in an email, cheers.Perhaps this was what Ian Wright meant on The Overlap last week when he observed that certain parts of the media “hate that they can’t get to him”. And yes, Wright is very much a self-knowing brand these days, a man paid to deliver snackable content, but he also has a brilliant nose for this stuff. He, too, has experienced the way the media environment tries to bend and shape its star footballers, exalts them for being a Black man with a personality, then ridicules them for being a Black man with a personality.What Wright expressed so succinctly was the way Bellingham’s otherness has made him such a ripe target. Take the fact that Bellingham has never played in the Premier League. Even in an age when his every game is available to watch, few do. There is a still a kind of freshness to him, a player unsullied by 24-hour tribal club discourse, who only really gets talked about during international weeks. Did you even notice he scored alate equaliser against Elcheat the weekend?View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham has been subject to increasingly intense media scrutiny.Photograph: Nikola Krstic/ShutterstockOn some level, there is a part of the English footballing establishment that has never really forgiven him for this. For spurning the haptic pleasures of Our League, for refusing to worship at the altar of the Barclays, an English player who has never shared the foundational belief that England is the centre of the footballing universe. Perhaps this is why there is such glee in some sections of the media when Thomas Tuchel – who by contrast can’t stop talking about how much he loves England – gives him a little punishment beating every now and again.Then you have his approach to the media, which – as one might expect from a player whose family was relentlessly hounded during the last European Championship – verges on outright hostility. Then, by no accident, you have the slow drip of camp gossip, the rumours and whispers that get circulated about Bellingham being a bad teammate. Nobody ever seems to be able to explain why. Weirdly, nobody ever seems willing to put their name to any of the criticism.So you have all that. This, in itself, would be enough to cast him as The Other. Then you have the colour of his skin. Which of course does not remotely trigger most people, but will definitely trigger some people, and some of those people buy newspapers, and some of those people may even run newspapers. And so, by the simple law of the market, there will inevitably be a small swirl of media opinion catering to this section of the audience.Nor does any of this ever have to be overt. The tropes and the unspoken language of anti-Black sentiment are everywhere you look: in the numbers of Black coaches in this country, in the subtly discriminatory language of “leadership qualities”, in a political landscape where it has become increasingly permissible to conflate Englishness with whiteness. None of this makes the treatment of Black players inevitable. But, somehow, it makes the dots a little easier to connect.Does any of this exempt Bellingham from criticism? Of course not. If he plays badly, he plays badly. But when so much of the recent commentary has taken a sinister turn into more intangible issues of behaviour and attitude, it is perhaps time to give pause.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many newspapersused a picture of Bukayo Saka(64th-minute substitute) to illustrate a defeat by Iceland simply because he’s a familiar face that everyone will recognise.The real sadness here is that this is a genuinely exciting England team that deserve to go to North America on a tide of goodwill and optimism. Eight wins, no goals conceded, 22 goals from 11 goalscorers, an established system and plenty of healthy competition for places. We have Bellingham, Morgan Rogers, Cole Palmer and Phil Foden competing for one spot. This is basically the stuff of dreams. Is there any real need for resentment or rancour?But these buttons must somehow still be pushed, just in case we lose. Perhaps in a sense the Bellingham coverage has already served its purpose: to set up scapegoats for defeat, to stir the pot and create a fresh stream of talking points and sacrificial cows. It was Marcus Rashford and it was Jess Carter, and it was Raheem Sterling and it was John Barnes before them. As a wise man once said: who else.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The big question is: what happens when ‘later’ arrives?Larry ElliottThe chancellor has given Labour breathing space with modest giveaways, but can only hope for an upturn in the government’s fortunes before tax increases kick inThu 27 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 12.45 ESTShareSome budgets are important but quickly forgotten. Some budgets are trivial but linger long in the memory. The package of measuresRachel Reeveshas delivered is a rarity: a budget that matters and will go down in the history books. And perhaps not for the right reasons.Make no mistake, the buildup was shambolic, and real damage has been caused by the leaks and counter-leaks coming out of the Treasury.The early releaseby the Office for Budget Responsibility of the contents of what the chancellor had in store was a final, chaotic twist marring what was supposed to be Reeves’s big day.Despite the embarrassment of having pundits dissect her measures before she had actually announced them, the chancellor put in a combative performance, defending her policy choices and attacking the Conservatives for their record in office between 2010 and 2024. In this, she was helped no end by the still vivid memories of the Liz Truss mini-budget of three years ago. ForLabour, Truss is the gift that keeps on giving.Expectations were so low ahead of the budget that it didn’t take much to exceed them. Things may yet unravel quickly, but the signs are that the package provides the chancellor – and the government – with a bit of much-needed breathing space.That’s because, after all the dire predictions of gaping black holes in the public finances, the OBR’s forecasts were not nearly as bad as the City pundits had expected. There was never any need to consider theheavily trailed 2p risein the basic rate of income tax. Through a hodgepodge of other measures, Reeves has more than doubled the size of the buffer against any unexpected bad economic news to £22bn.November forecast more than doubles fiscal headroomBut a breathing space is one thing; a sustained improvement in Labour’s political fortunes is quite another. The chancellor had best be hoping that her second budget is received better than her first, because the future of the government hangs on how well it goes down with two audiences: the financial markets and voters. Keeping both onside is going to prove a difficult – and perhaps impossible – task.The markets liked the fact that Reeves was increasing the size of her rainy-day fund to £22bn by the end of the decade, but were much less keen on the live now, pay later shape of the budget. Spending is increasing in the short term, but the higher taxes will only start to kick in as the date of the next election approaches, when the government will be looking to keep voters sweet. The markets are already starting to wonder how serious the commitment to financial rectitude actually is. Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo markets, summed up City scepticism when he commented: “Big spending increases front-loaded, massive tax increases and restraint has been back-loaded – the classic policy mix: jam today, pain tomorrow. I hardly think it seems credible.”But nor for that matter would be front-loading tax increases at a time when unemployment is rising and growth is stagnant. That would simply increase the real risk of the economy getting stuck in a doom loop of depressed activity leading to weaker public finances and hence pressure for still higher taxes or public spending cuts. There was already a Groundhog Day feel to Reeves’s second budget, and she will want to avoid another tax-raising package next year at all costs.From 2026, GDP growth is less than previously predictedInstead,she is banking oncuts to energy bills, the freezing of rail fares and the increase in the minimum wage to buy her a little time. It is possible, for example, that the reduction in inflation next year from lower energy bills will speed up the pace at which the Bank of England cuts interest rates.There are two problems with this approach. First, the giveaways are much more modest than the eventual tax increases, and the tax increases will hit even low-paid workers. Someone on the minimum wage working full-time will be payingan extra £137 a yearby 2030 due to the extended freeze on tax thresholds.The second problem is that there is no guarantee that the Bank of England will accelerate cuts in interest rates, or that the financial markets will continue to have faith in the chancellor. Reeves and her fellow ministers talk a good game about how the government is turbo-charging growth, but there is precious little to show for it. Growth would indeed solve all sorts of problems. It would raise tax receipts, reduce the deficit and obviate the need for tough choices. Yet the budget contained no new supply-side measures that might boost the UK’s growth potential.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our panel responds | Polly Toynbee and othersRead moreFor Reeves, the hope is that her package will do for Keir Starmer what Geoffrey Howe’s 1981 budget is supposed to have done for Margaret Thatcher: mark a turning point in the government’s fortunes. Then, too, the government was hugely unpopular. Then, too, the chancellor froze tax allowances. Little more than two years later, Thatcher won a second term in office by a landslide.Howe was in the happy position, in the days before Bank of England independence, of being able to announce a two percentage-point cut in interest rates on the day after his budget. That option is not available to Reeves. Nor is there likely to be a repeat of the Falklands war – arguably a bigger factor in Thatcher’s re-election than Howe’s budget.So Reeves can only sit tight and hope that something turns up.

Our research shows how to address itTarik Abou-Chadi,Silja HäusermannandBjörn BremerThe mantra of ‘build, build, build’ misses something crucial: that few can afford these new homesReport: European progressives must tackle housing crisis to beat far right, say researchersThu 27 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 10.33 ESTShareHousing costs across Europe have become a growing burden for many households, both for those trying to buy and those trying to rent. Over the past decade, property prices have surgedfaster than incomesin many European countries. The same is true for rents, which have increased exponentially in large cities but have also increased substantially in suburban areas and smaller university towns.Given how much housing costs affect Europeans’ quality of life, it is comparatively absent from the agenda of progressive political parties. When politicians do emphasise housing, the focus is usually solely on building more houses. Former German chancellor Olaf Scholz, for example,promised to build 400,000 new homesin Germany every year – a goalhis government failedto reach by some distance. At the same time, far-right parties such as the Freedom party (PVV) in the Netherlands or Chega in Portugal havemade the housing affordability crisisinto a campaign issue. Their equation is simple: housing should be available and affordable only for nationals.What are the hurdles that keep other parties from politicising housing? And what would a progressive European housing agenda look like? As part of the Progressive Politics Research Network – an initiative to promote social science research findings to a broader audience –we have published eight research briefsto that end.European societies fundamentally differ in how housing is organised. Home ownership remains the dominant form of housing in most European countries, but ownership rates vary significantly. In some countries – including Germany, Austria and Switzerland – more than half of the population lives in rented accommodation. And as home ownership becomes increasingly unaffordable, renting has become the modal form for younger people, especially in Europe’s larger cities.To compare housing politics across countries, it is helpful to think of two policy paradigms:housing as an assetv housing as a social right. In the housing as an asset approach, housing is seen as an investment to generate financial returns – a system that depends on rising prices. Over the past decades, this has become the dominant paradigm. Even parties of the left have significantly reduced social housing, deregulated rental markets and created new investment and market structures that affect house prices.These reforms have eroded housing as a social right. The inequalities of who can live where, and under what conditions, have created massive grievances among a large share of the population. These grievances contribute to theincreasing electoral successof the radical right.If progressive parties want to reclaim this issue, they have to accept that housing is fundamentally a question of distribution and redistribution. They should not treat housing as an issue where parties simply compete over who is more competent, or who can deliver more units. Housing policy involves profound choices about who benefits and who bears costs, about the balance between markets and collective responsibility, about whether housing is primarily an asset or a social right. From a progressive perspective, the goal should be clear:housing needs to be affordable, secure and nonspeculative.To achieve this, progressive parties first need toreinvest in social housingas part of a broader strategy to increase supply. Yet simply recreating the social housing of the 1970s won’t work. Social housing cannot be revitalised today if it is only targeted at the poorest: tight eligibility rules can undermine cross-class political support and lead to stigmatisation and exclusion. As an example, in Vienna, around 40% of households live in limited-profit or public housing: this broad access, together with strong rental protections, helps build the broad political coalitions necessary to support sustained investment.Second, progressive housing policy must address both supplyanddistribution. The fixation on “build, build, build”misses a crucial fact: under-occupation of existing housing stock now rivals overcrowding in many European countries. In Germany, demographic factors – especially age – correlate with housing inequality more than income does. Younger households and immigrants face severe overcrowding, while older households are increasingly under-occupied. Policy must incentivise the redistribution of existing space alongside new construction.Third, increasing housing density is unavoidable but must be done correctly.Large-scale surveysfrom cities in Europe and the US show that public acceptance of densification depends critically on design and implementation. When projects include participatory governance, protect neighbourhood amenities and green space, and ensure affordability, resistance drops significantly. Densification without social inclusion and environmental sustainability will fail politically.This agenda requires substantial public investment. Wealth-to-income ratios are driven largely by housing booms, providing funding resources. Whileinheritance taxes remain unpopular, net wealth taxes and reformed capital gains taxes command public support – especially when revenues are credibly tied to popular investments such as affordable housing.Austria demonstrateshow dedicated housing funds, fed by modest levies and reinvested profits from limited-profit providers, can sustain large-scale provision.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Land-use planning, construction regulation, and public loans can be tied to conditions: obligations to reinvest profits, provide housing at cost-based rents, respect limited-profit constraints, or meet social and ecological criteria.Housingpolicy is not simply about market v state, but about steering both toward social ends.The European far right has seized on housing precisely because progressives have abandoned it. Their answer – blaming immigrants for scarcity – is both morally and economically wrong. However, it will continue to gain traction if the centre left offers only market solutions and technocratic supply-side fixes.Housing is fundamentally a question of distribution and social rights, not merely construction targets. It shapes who can live where, access what opportunities, and build what kind of life. A progressive housing agenda must be bold enough to challenge the norm that housing has become an asset for wealth accumulation, and ambitious enough to build the broad coalitions of support necessary for sustained public investment. Our research shows such policies can work and command public support. The question is whether progressive parties have the will to fight for them and offer a real alternative to the far right’s politics of scarcity and blame.Tarik Abou-Chadi is a professor of European Politics at the University of Oxford; Björn Bremer is an assistant professor at the Department of Political Science at Central European University in Vienna; Silja Häusermann is a professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of ZurichDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

All the signs, however, are that it soon will be. The leak of a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) briefing this week suggests that the lord chancellor,David Lammy, has signed off a plan restricting jury trial to a narrow band of serious offences – murder, manslaughter, rape and cases passing a public interest test. An announcement could come soon, with legislation in the new year.If Mr Lammy has his way, a new lower tier of juryless crown courts would hear most cases now heard by juries. Those involving criminal charges carrying a maximum sentence of up to five years would be heard by judges in the planned crown court “bench division”. Juries would no longer hear fraud and financial crime cases either. This would mean a large majority of the more than 30,000 jury trials each year in England and Wales being heard instead by judges alone, at an estimated saving of 20% of trial time.Mr Lammy’s plan, if confirmed, goes beyondSir Brian Leveson’sJuly report, commissioned by the MoJ, on the entire criminal justice system. Sir Brian set the limit to juryless trial at cases carrying a likely sentence of three years, not five. He also proposed that juryless trials could be heard by a judge sitting with two magistrates, potentially ensuring a lay element. Mr Lammy appears to have ignored these more sensible ideas.The context for the Leveson proposals and Mr Lammy’s move is the mountingbacklog of criminal cases. The backlog is indisputable. It requires action. Some 78,000 crown court cases are waiting to be heard. Some defendants being charged today will not have their cases heard for three years. If nothing changes by March 2029, the MoJ projects that the backlog will reach 105,000, generating still lengthier delays.Jury trials for the most serious offences have doubled in length since 2001 – a genuine concern. Yet it is far from clear that juries – who only hear around 1% of all criminal cases – are particularly responsible for the wider criminal justice system crisis. To single out juries as the part of the system crying out for reform would be misleading and would not solve the larger problem, which involves the neglect of the magistrates courts too.The wider issue is that the MoJ has been anunprotected departmentin successive austerity public spending rounds. Funding was cut by 30% in the coalition years. The MoJ is still unprotected today. Covid compounded everything further, as did the rising complexity of investigations, including digital and financial crime, and of the trial process itself. The whole system has been knowingly rendered less efficient, even while demands on it have been increased.Juries are not the sole or even the main blockage in this. Nothing entitles the jury system to immunity from reform. There is an argument for reasoned restrictions on juries in particular cases, like fraud, for example, or in special circumstances, such as those already applying in Northern Ireland. But successive governments have made dangerous and deliberate spending choices to shrink the criminal justice system and thus make it less efficient. That policy could have been reversed in this week’s budget, if the government had wanted to. Taking its frustrations out on theiconic traditionof trial by jury is a shabby evasion of responsibility.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We’re still figuring out how to copeThu 27 Nov 2025 13.35 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 15.10 ESTShareCities have existed for millennia, but their triumph is remarkably recent. As recently as 1950, only 30% of the world’s population were urban dwellers. This week, a United Nations reportsuggestedthat more than 80% of people are now urbanites, with most of those living in cities. London became the first city to reach a million inhabitants in the early 19th century. Now, almost 500 have done so.Jakarta, with 42 million residents, has just overtaken Tokyo as the most populous of the lot; nine of the 10 largest megacities are in Asia. TheUN reportrevealed the scale of the recent population shift to towns and citiesthanks to a new, standardised measurein place of the widely varying national criteria previously used. The urbanisation rate in its 2018 report was just 55%.Jakarta’s explosive growth – its population has grown almost 30-fold since 1950 – demonstrates both the costs of rapid urbanisation and the difficulties of addressing them. It ischoked by traffic and pollution, regularly floods and is sinking fast due to the overextraction of groundwater. The government is now building a new administrative capital more than 1,000km away, in Borneo. But such projects havean uninspiring record. The new city of Nusantra isbehind scheduleand short on funding and would-be inhabitants.Most thriving cities are more spontaneous affairs. The typical image of urbanisation is of young people lured by the promise of prosperity. But the late urbanist Mike Davis also pointed to waves of migration driven by growing rural desperation thanks to agricultural deregulation and punishing fiscal policies enforced by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. In other cases, he wrote in his bookPlanet of Slums, “rural people no longer migrate to the city; it migrates to them” as urban sprawl encroaches on their land.The benefits of cities are obvious. They are hubs of productivity, creativity and diversity that boost social and economic development. New York City’s gross product – $1.8tn last year – easily exceeds the GDP of Turkey or Saudi Arabia. That helps to explain why some cities are growing stronger as political – evendiplomatic– entities.Yet as in 19th century London, opportunities and services exist alongside monstrous inequality, overcrowded housing and substandard infrastructure. Diseases spread more rapidly in crowded conditions with highly mobile populations. The rational decisions of individuals – to find educational opportunities for their children, escape rural desperation or seek excitement – play out on a grand scale, demanding intervention.Most of the land that has been urbanised in the last 55 years was used for agriculture, endangering food security and despoiling the environment. Improved urban-rural links are needed to prevent the entrenchment of rural deprivation as older people are left behind, with few services. Global heating is creating new dangers, with urban dwellersdisproportionately exposedto heatwaves and rising seas – and the poorest hit hardest. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, argued last year that sustainable and equitable urbanisation and fighting climate change are two sides of the same coin. While cities generate a huge share of emissions, they can also foster more efficient use of resources.Cities have always represented both opportunity and threat. They grow as if of their own accord, but their new inhabitants cannot flourish that way. Humans are a new urban species, still learning to adapt to the environment we created.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Abolishing the two-child cap is the right call, but it is solving a failure that should not exist. No advanced economy should have child poverty baked so deeply into its design. Freezing train fares, taxing wealth a little harder – fine. Good. Necessary. But still just sticking plasters on wounds that have been haemorrhaging for years. And once again, it is the middle classes footing the bill while the ultra-wealthy and the corporate giants look on, essentially untouched.Meanwhile, the core problem remains unaddressed: an economic model built to maximise shareholder returns while hollowing out wages, public services and social resilience. Until we shift that model towards high wages, broad-based prosperity and an economy where labour, not capital, holds the centre of gravity, every budget, red, blue, green or technocratic beige, will remain cosmetic. What is needed is a full package of structural reforms: corporate governance that shares power with workers, taxation that shifts the burden upward instead of protecting vast concentrations of private wealth, and incentives rewired so that companies cannot keep extracting while offloading the consequences on to the public.And the political risk of ducking that challenge is upon us. When the centre offers only tinkering and managed decline, desperate voters look elsewhere. That is the void Reform UK and demagogues like Nigel Farage exploit, manipulating the frustrated and peddling enemies instead of solutions.This is not uniquely British. The same pattern is playing out across the west, with extraction-driven economics widening the wealth gap, eroding trust and corroding democratic institutions. Civilisations have unravelled over less. Assuming ours is somehow safe because it is modern seems naive at best.We are seeing the consequences everywhere: privatised utilities collapsing under the weight of extraction; rail, water and energy all run for profit until the public ends up paying for the fallout; a health crisis fuelled by ultra-processed food because maximising margins mattered more than wellbeing; environmental damage from Pfas “forever chemicals”, pesticides and microplastics, with clean-up costs dumped back on to society; and an entire generation’s mental health hammered by algorithmic attention-mining so that tech giants can keep their quarterly growth.Different industries, same model: constant growth, extract value, socialise the harm.So sure, we will take the bandages. But without a fundamental reset of who this economy serves, the bleed-out will not stop. And if we keep squeezing the middle while allowing the wealthy to strip-mine society from above, we are not steering away from crisis but straight into it.Now, who is actually going to have the guts to clean up this mess?Cassie GroosLymm, CheshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But it is only the first step towards making it an effective tool to reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions.I provided written and oral evidence to the 2021 Commons transport committee’s inquiry into road pricing and have led a focus group on how it could be made acceptable to the public. Although a per-mile charge is relatively simple to administer, taxes on fuel are fairer because they vary with the weight and efficiency of the vehicle. These are relevant because they determine external costs, such as the rate of road wear, severity of harm caused in collisions, and carbon emissions. A tax on energy usage captures these external costs better than a tax on mileage.There are currently two taxes on electricity: VAT and the climate change levy (at 0.8p per kWh). The problem with VAT is that the effective rate paid varies greatly: home chargers pay 5% (or nothing if charging from their own solar panels); users of public charge points pay 20% of a much higher tariff; and VAT-registered businesses can reclaim VAT paid (but not duty).We need a tax applied not at the point of charging, which is practically impossible to regulate uniformly, but at the point of use. The solution is for EVs to log electricity consumption in addition to mileage. Both can then be reported (automatically or manually), cross-checked for obvious discrepancies, and the electricity taxed accordingly. That would be fair and relatively straightforward to implement.Including VAT, the tax paid on petrol and diesel vehicles is approximately 7p per mile. To achieve tax parity, EVs would ultimately need to be taxed at about 23p per kWh.Edward LeighCambridgeI note with horror that the chancellor has introduced a 3p per mile charge for a selection of EVs. How is that wise or fair? It even applies if you take your UK registered EV to drive anywhere in the world.It is more costly to run an EV if you rely on public charging. Owners now must pay vehicle excise duty. From next year they will also be liable to congestion charges.So, the government is penalising domestic EV owners, who have followed government advice and are trying to do the right thing for the environment. How does that match up with Labour’s green commitments?The fairest approach would be for all types of vehicles to pay this toll – and this should reflect the environmental impact of the vehicles. In principle, if a charge per mile is considered appropriate, then it should be raised on every road user, and the higher polluters should pay more. Their impact should be reflected in higher rates per mile.David AbramsFareham, HampshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I, for one, as someone who is not a habitual Labour voter, welcome some evidence of the desire for more long-term thinking. I wish them success.Linda MarriottNorth Hykeham, LincolnshireNo one likes to pay taxes. But we like to have a working NHS, an army, trains running on time, motorways in a good condition, energy and water supply, and so on. All these services cost money. A lot of money. In Europe, the average amount people pay is around40% of GDP. So the calculated 38% in the recent budget is not out of line. So far, people in the UK are not doing badly. For most people today, this conclusion is hard to take. But the facts are difficult to ignore.Oane JansenKollumerpomp, NetherlandsIs this country so full of selfishness that the media headlines are all about “who wins and who loses”? Aren’t we all winners if this government can put more money into improving our crumbling public services for everyone? Especially those pensioners who pay tax but no national insurance contributions, have usually paid off their mortgages and make much greater use of the NHS and travel agents than those on the same income who are working.John ThornRadcliffe-on-Trent, NottinghamshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is Liverpool’s worst sequence of results since an identical run in 1953-54 and has heightened the pressure on Slot before Sunday’s Premier League trip to West Ham.Who are the worst champions in Premier League history?Read moreSlot admitted after Wednesday’s home reverse that he would have to see how his employers assessed the situation in their next conversation. At a press conference to preview the West Ham game on Thursday, scheduled before the PSV defeat, he claimed their stance remained unchanged. “We’ve had the same conversations as we’ve had since I’m here,” he said. “Not sure if I said it last night, but we fight on. We try to improve, that’s what we all try, but the conversations have been the same as they’ve been for the past one and a half years.”Slot conceded that the pressure is rising amid Liverpool’s worst run for 71 years, yet denied being let down by his players or that morale has deserted them.“I didn’t see morale being low at the start of the game or at 1-0 yesterday but after the third, fourth or fifth knock I saw a very difficult five to 10 minutes,” he said.“We were able to generate enough chances at 2-1, after more knocks, to make it 2-2 but at 3-1 I could see it hurt the players and it wasn’t a period where our fighting spirit was at its best, and that’s putting it mildly.”Despite that admission, and some poor body language at the end of both defeats, the head coach believes the Premier League champions have not lost their fighting spirit and remain committed.Slot, who expects to have Alisson back from illness on Sunday and could have Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz available, said: “In the first 85 minutes, or for large parts of the [PSV] game, I saw a team that have had a lot of setbacks recently and were still able to fight against that.“Not always with the end product you would like because fighting is of course part of what you should do but if fight was enough to win a game of football then it would be quite easy. You need a little bit of something extra as well, you need quality playing one-v-ones, getting crosses in the box and arriving with the right timing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lot has happened since Trevor Francis’s stooping header clinched the European Cup in Munich in 1979 but Forest still, rightfully, cherish those days. A lot has also changed in the five weeks since Sean Dyche took the reins, Forest reinvigorated and another comfortable win, this time courtesy of goals from Ryan Yates, Arnaud Kalimuendo and Nikola Milenkovic, enhanced their hopes of qualifying for the Europa League knockout phase.For Forest, this victory – against aMalmöside who had not played for almost three weeks after finishing sixth in their domestic league – represented a third straight win in all competitions and further built on the momentum gained from last weekend’s success at Liverpool. For the third successive match, they also scored three goals. This was a rerun of Forest’s European Cup triumph in name but the game itself was free of jeopardy or jitters. Malmö did not muster a single touch inside the Forest 18-yard box and their sole shot, a sixth-minute effort by Sead Haksabanovic, was distinctly forgettable.Nottingham Forest v Malmö, Rangers v Braga, and more: Europa League – liveRead moreThis was an occasion dripping in nostalgia, an eagerly awaited reunion and a third competitive meeting between the teams since the European Cup final 46 years ago. Forest lent into the history, too. They made a fuss of the heroes of 1979, giving them as well as their Malmö counterparts the red-carpet treatment, with 13 members of the Swedish club’s squad from then also in attendance. Forest gave Frank Clark, Colin Barrett and co a rousing reception when they gathered on the pitch 15 minutes before kick-off and there was a typically superb tifo in the Trent End to boot.“30th May 1979, John Robertson crossed it in from the left,” read half a giant banner, in block capitals, and while nobody needed reminding what happened next, the rest of it was unfurled as the players emerged from the tunnel. “And there’s Francis,” it read. Another brilliant tifo depicted Brian Clough observing events beside his assistant Peter Taylor on a bench at the Olympiastadion.View image in fullscreenRyan Yates puts Nottingham Forest in front in the 27th minute with his first goal in Europe.Photograph: Rui Vieira/APSo, Forest had drunk in those beautiful memories, but what about the performance on the night? It was rather good, too. Forest were in complete control from the moment Kalimuendo whistled an effort wide inside two minutes and had established a two-goal lead at the interval. It felt fitting that Yates, who joined Forest aged eight, made the first dent in the Malmö defence led by their own homegrown captain, Pontus Jansson, formerly of Leeds and Brentford. Milenkovic’s attempted cross cannoned off a defender and into the path of Yates, who swept home from inside the box to register his first goal since March.Yates was involved in Forest’s second goal on the verge of the half-time interval, too, his free header saved by Malmö’s goalkeeper Melker Ellborg but Kalimuendo on hand to convert the rebound from close range. James McAtee, the midfielder handed a rare start and just his second outing since September, was the catalyst, chipping a delicious ball towards Yates at the back post.Quick GuideGlasner rues Palace misses in StrasbourgShowOliver Glasner admitted missed chances cost Crystal Palace after they slipped to a 2-1 Conference League defeat in Strasbourg.Tyrick Mitchell's first-half goal had put the Eagles on course for a third win from four European matches. But they were pegged back by the Chelsea-bound striker Emanuel Emegha and then sent packing by a first senior goal from teenager Samir El Mourabet.Crucially, Palace hit the woodwork twice with open goals to aim at after the eccentric Strasbourg goalkeeper Mike Penders, on loan from Chelsea, went walkabout. Ismaïla Sarr's 30-yard shy at an empty net hit the foot of a post and Adam Wharton's half volley crashed back of the crossbar.Palace manager Glasner told TNT Sport: \"It's easy, when you have twice the empty goal in front of you and you miss the goal twice hitting the post. Could be, should be 3-1 up and then we have a big chance and in the next situation you are 2-1 down. We've had this too often, to be honest, this season that we didn't decide the game when we could decide it.\"Strasbourg, they are very good, they have very quick players, we knew it. You can concede the equaliser but then we have the next empty net goal we are missing and then we have the next big chance.\"Then you lose a game and I think that's why we deserved to lose today.\"Palace are down in 18th place in the 36-team league with six points after two wins and two defeats.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.This was Malmö’s first match since the Swedish Allsvenskan ended on 9 November and they struggled to live with Forest’s intensity. Forest made it 3-0 when Milenkovic applied the finishing touch after his centre-back partner Murillo kept alive a corner. Yates’s volley was blocked but the Serbia defender Milenkovic feasted on the leftovers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All of a sudden we’ve corrected that. We’re scoring varied goals – not every goal can be a beautiful goal and I’ve spoken to the players about that. What about finding ugly goals, scraps in the box? To change the way you can score a goal is really, really important.”Forest then went for the jugular, Callum Hudson-Odoi dinking a right-foot shot on to the crossbar before Ibrahim Sangaré sent an ambitious effort wide from 30 yards. It was that kind of night. Dyche discussed how the Forest old guard “still come out with bits of gold” at weekly get-togethers and, almost five decades on, the current crop showed they are pretty capable, too.“Our supporters were the best thing about us – they were trying to help us for the whole 90 minutes and were absolutely amazing,” said the interim Malmö head coach Anes Mravac, who will join Kim Hellberg’s coaching staff at Middlesbrough next month, after taking charge of the Swedish club for the final time against Porto next month. “I’m sad we couldn’t give them more.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueNottingham ForestMalmömatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Villa manager looks a decent bet to win this competition for a fifth time this season.It was in Berne last season that Young Boys fans reacted angrily to a Villa goalscorer when Jhon Durán netted, before being given offside, in his side’sChampions League victory.But their supporters have more history for this sort of trouble after being fined for incidents in Champions League games away to Manchester City and Celtic last season. They surely face more Uefa action after this latest episode.Emery gave the trouble the least oxygen possible – “We need respect for both sides,” the Villa head coach said. “It is not necessary to have what we had today” – but Gerardo Seoane, theYoung Boyscoach, was more forthcoming.He apologised for the crowd trouble but balanced this by suggesting they perhaps felt provoked by Villa players celebrating near their place in the lower tier of the Doug Ellis Stand.There was a five-minute hold-up after Malen’s second goal. Fighting broke out with police even as Loris Benito, the Young Boys captain, went over to plead for peace from his team’s supporters. At least three trouble-makers were escorted away by police.View image in fullscreenYoung Boys fans clash with police and stewards during a controversial first half.Photograph: Paul Currie/Colorsport/Shutterstock“It’s normal when you score a goal that you want to celebrate with your teammates,” Seoane said. “Our fans maybe took this like a provocation, but I think this is part of the football. Our fans should not react so heavily.“The referee asked our captain to go to our supporters, and he was going there to calm a bit, and some supporters came down to have a talk. [But] the police reacted like [the fans] would jump into the pitch, but it was not their intention, and I think [the police] reacted a bit early.“It’s a pity for everybody – for the provocations, for throwing the object, for thinking that somebody would jump on the pitch – and the result is not nice for anybody, and for sure we apologise. We don’t feel good.“The way our supporters are normally, it is not how we want to act when we are guests somewhere. Nobody wins at the end; everybody loses with this situation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their orchestrated clapping, drumming, pogoing and chanting had helped give the early kick-off what sense there was of a continental occasion although what followed each of the first-half goals was unacceptable by any standards.The trouble intensified after Malen doubled the lead three minutes before half-time. As the Dutch forward smiled on doing a knee-slide in the general direction of the travelling fans, they responded by ripping out seats to hurl alongside more plastic cups at the increased presence of police and stewards.It had at least been a very satisfactory half on the field for Villa as they set up a seventh successive home win. Malen, who set up Morgan Rogers’ equaliser as an impact substitute inSunday’s win at Leeds, made the most of his hour at centre-forward.Marvin Keller had had to tip over his brilliant 25-yard shot in the fourth minute and both Evann Guessand and Amadou Onana came close to opening the scoring before Malen headed in Youri Tielemans’ cross as eight players were involved in the buildup.The move for the second goal was somewhat more direct but no less aesthetically pleasing. Malen took Rogers’s superb through pass in his stride down the inside-left channel before cutting back to smash in his sixth goal of the season.Although Chris Bedia had one goal disallowed for offside, Joël Monteiro did wallop home a consolation goal, and this time VAR could not deny Young Boys their moment of celebration.After all the political backdrop to the last Europa League game here, when tickets were not on sale for Maccabi Tel Aviv’s fans in expectation of Free Palestine protests, Villa will head to Basel next month hoping for a calm trip and the three points that should safeguard the top-eight finish that would preclude any need of a two-legged play-off in February.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAston VillaYoung Boysmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Close your eyes and you can probably make your own, with an Embrace soundtrack if you want to be right on the nose. Chances are you’ll see Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff belting sixes with lusty abandon; Geraint Jones wheeling away after winning the epic Edgbaston Test; Ashley Giles calmly patting the winning runs at Trent Bridge; Flintoff’s messianic dismissal of Ricky Ponting at Edgbaston; Simon Jones detonating Michael Clarke’s off stump at Old Trafford.All those moments came in England victories or winning draws. But no 2005 montage is complete without images of Ponting being cut below the eye or Justin Langer’s right elbow ballooning in real time. Both wounds were inflicted by Steve Harmison on the first morning at Lord’s, a game that Australia won emphatically by 239 runs. When the story of the series was written, those blows – and the way England duffed Australia up in the first innings – were an essential chapter.England plan extra training sessions in wake of howling first Ashes Test defeatRead moreThe hope for England fans is that any montages of the 2025-26 Ashes will include similar moments from Perth: Steve Smith being hit twice on the elbow and once on the hand, Cameron Green wobbling like a drunken sailor after wearing a beauty from Mark Wood on the side of the head.On Saturday, as two nations tried to make sense of the first two-day Ashes Test in more than a century, dozens of emails were sent tothe Guardian’s over-by-over coverage. One, from Tom Van der Gucht, countered the prevailing view among England fans that the apocalypse was due before sundown.“I have a feeling this is our Lord’s 2005 moment and we’ll come back and win the series from here,” he wrote. “Our bowlers, for at least one innings, went toe to toe while our batters effectively blew it with a rush of blood to the head. Australia are there for the taking. You mark my words …”Cricket nerds love a precedent. In this case, England fans will cling to anything that doesn’t involve a wearingly familiar story: England lose the first Test in Australia, then the second, then the third …View image in fullscreenThe manner in which Steve Smith was made to feel uncomfortable on day one in Perth should encourage England.Photograph: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake/ReutersThe parallels with Lord’s 2005 are compelling if imperfect. Some of the details have been twisted, like dreams in a David Lynch film. In that game, for example, it was Australia who batted first and drowned in testosterone, bowled out for 190 in 40.2 overs. An immense bowling performance on the first evening – in this case by Glenn McGrath rather than the entire England attack – gave them a first-innings lead. This is where the stories diverge: Australia batted England out of the game in the third innings, with Clarke strumming 91 from 106 balls. They won handsomely in the end, but like Perth the victory was built on individual greatness (for Mitchell Starc and Travis Head, read McGrath and to an extent Clarke in 2005) rather than a complete team performance.In both Tests, a much-hyped England pace attack showed they could unsettle and unseat the Australian batters. Smith hasn’t struggled as much in a Test innings since he was a leg-spinner who batted a bit. In 2005 England didn’t really wound the Australian batters after Lord’s – partly because that was the liveliest pitch, mainly because the physical threat, unprecedented for an England attack against Australia, had been established.There was also, hiding in plain sight, a detail that would define the series. In an otherwise poor individual performance – “I bottled it” – Flintoff dismissed Adam Gilchrist twice. For the rest of the series, Flintoff was the bogeyman’s bogeyman. There are no obvious parallels at Perth but then we didn’t appreciate the significance of Flintoff’s wickets at the time. Harry Brook’s first-innings fifty also had echoes of Kevin Pietersen’s outrageous batting (57 and 64 not out in totals of 155 and 180), including a gobsmacking six off Australia’s postage-stamp seamer.Most of all, on both occasions there were industrial quantities of opprobrium. England – who went into the 2005 series on a run of 14 wins in 18 Tests, all achieved playing ultra-aggressive cricket – were savaged after Lord’s. They were just another English Ashes shower: “a bunch of drips” according the Mirror, “Vaughan Again Losers” in the Sun.Between Tests, the captain, Michael Vaughan, bowled twice at Lord’s, met the coach, Duncan Fletcher, to do some technical work in the nets. They kept talking about how submissive, Pietersen aside, England’s batting had been at Lord’s. “The loss in the first Test actually was the switch,” said Fletcher later. “We said: ‘Enough is enough now. If we carry on like this we will get drilled again.’”View image in fullscreenMarcus Trescothick led England’s counterattack on the first morning at Edgbaston in 2005.Photograph: ReutersWith McGrath absent – another twisted detail, given Pat Cummins may return at Brisbane – England skedaddled to 132 for one from 27 overs on the first morning at Edgbaston. They eventually belted 407 from 79.2 overs, an unprecedented onslaught at the time; their approach veered from calculated risk to giddy recklessness. “The manner in which we played on that first day was the turning point of the entire series,” said Vaughan.Stokes’s team crave a similar turning point, but they are not for turning. At Perth last week they were ultimately beaten by an all-time-great innings from Head, the platonic ideal of Bazball. He just had a much smarter gameplan.Quick GuideScoreboards from Lord's and Edgbaston, 2005ShowFirst Test, Lord'sAustralia 190 (Harmison 5-43) and 384 (Clarke 90, Katich 67, Martyn 65)England 155 (Pietersen 57, McGrath 5-53) and 180 (Pietersen 64*, McGrath 4-29)Australia won by 239 runsSecond Test, EdgbastonEngland 407 (Trescothick 90, Pietersen 71, Flintoff 68) and 182 (Flintoff 73, Warne 6-46)Australia 308 (Langer 82, Ponting 61) and 279 (Lee 43*, Flintoff 4-79)England won by two runsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Fletcher’s quote from 2005 can be adapted to suit this team’s wants and needs. Hyper-aggressive cricket is their only chance of winning in Australia, but they also need to tweak their approach. If, at Brisbane, they continue driving on the up well wide of off stump, they will get drilled again. And if that happens, the montages of the 2025-26 Ashes will be full of English batters getting out, not their bowlers landing symbolic blows on day one of the series.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesCricketEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brian Naugle, tournament director of the Insperity Invitational in Houston and a longtime colleague, said Zoeller’s daughter notified him of the death on Thursday.Zoeller, born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr in New Albany, Indiana, was one of golf’s most outgoing characters across a career that delivered historic highs. He was the first player in more than four decades to win the Masters on his debut, claiming the 1979 green jacket after a three-man playoff. Five years later at the US Open at Winged Foot, he outlasted Greg Norman in an 18-hole Monday playoff after famously waving a white towel from the fairway, believing Norman had just holed a birdie putt to beat him. It turned out to be a par, and Zoeller won by eight shots the next day.US president Donald Trump, who often praised Zoeller, posted a tributeon Truth Social. “Very sad to hear that the highly respected and beloved Professional Golfer, Fuzzy Zoeller, has passed away,” he wrote, citing Zoeller’s major victories and calling him “a truly remarkable person and player”.But for all of Zoeller’s success and easygoing charm, it was the 1997 Masters that irrevocably altered his standing in the sport. As Woods marched toward atransformative, record-breaking victoryat Augusta National, a relaxed Zoeller – drink in hand – was stopped by a CNN crew near the clubhouse and asked for his thoughts. His reply, delivered with a smile and a snap of his fingers, sparked immediate outrage.“That little boy is driving well and he’s putting well,” Zoeller said, before adding that Woods should be congratulated, then joking that officials should “tell him not [to] serve fried chicken next year … or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve.”Zoeller apologized, but the blowback only grew as it took Woods two weeks to address the remarks while traveling. Zoeller later said he received death threats for years. InGolfDigest in 2008, he called it “the worst thing I’ve gone through in my entire life,” adding: “If people wanted me to feel the same hurt I projected on others, I’m here to tell you they got their way.”He said he had “cried many times” and offered “countless” apologies for words he described as a misguided attempt at humor that did not reflect who he was. “Still, I’ve come to terms with the fact that this incident will never, ever go away.”View image in fullscreenFuzzy Zoeller is congratulated by his caddie during the 1979 Masters in Augusta, Georgia.Photograph: Augusta National/Getty ImagesZoeller’s playing record extended well beyond his two major triumphs. He won eight additionalPGA Tourtitles, captured two PGA Tour Champions victories including a Senior PGA Championship, and represented the United States in three Ryder Cups. Known for playing quickly and whistling between shots, he cultivated an image of a player who both competed hard and relished the walk.His 1979 Masters win remains one of Augusta’s most enduring debuts. Arriving as a first-time competitor, he reached a playoff after Ed Sneed bogeyed the final three holes. On the second extra hole, Zoeller stiffed his approach to six feet and rolled in the winning birdie, tossing his putter skyward in celebration. “I’ve never been to heaven,” he once said. “I guess winning the Masters is as close as I’m going to get.”At Winged Foot five years later, he believed Norman’s 40-plus-foot par putt on the 18th was a birdie that had beaten him and responded with a theatrical white-towel wave from the fairway. After an official told him the score, Zoeller forced the playoff and dominated, though he later joked that he regretted giving away the now-famous towel.Zoeller played college golf first at Edison Junior College and later at the University of Houston, then a powerhouse programme. He turned professional in 1973. His wife, Diane, died in 2021. He is survived by three children, including his daughter Gretchen, with whom he often played in the PNC Championship. He was awarded the USGA’s Bob Jones Award for sportsmanship in 1985.Explore more on these topicsGolfTiger WoodsDonald TrumpPGA TourUS sportsShareReuse this content"

McLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella, has denied the team took “excessive risks” with their car in Las Vegas.The race in Nevada last weekend was won by Verstappen but Norris took a strong second and Piastri fourth. However, four hours afterwards, following an investigation by the FIA, both were disqualified after the skid blocks on the floor of their cars were found to have been worn down below the 9mm limit defined in the rules.How did McLaren get it so wrong with their cars in Las Vegas? | Giles RichardsRead moreVerstappen had been 49 points behind Norris going into the meeting but with Norris and Piastri stripped of their points he is now only 24 behind, the same deficit as Piastri, as the season enters its penultimate round in Qatar. Norris can still close out the title here but maintained he felt no extra pressure from Verstappen’s proximity in the title race.“We’ve treated him as a threat the whole year even when he was a few more points behind,” he said. “We treat him as a threat because we know what he’s capable of, we know what Red Bull is capable of, so therefore nothing changes now because he’s still the threat he’s always been through the whole year.“There’s no point in trying to treat it any differently because we’ve been doing a good job and I’m very happy with the job we’ve all been doing. We know what areas we need to do better, we know what things we need to improve on. I don’t feel like I had a bad weekend last weekend or we had a bad result, so that’s a good thing.”Norris’s chances did take a blow in Las Vegas, however. But for the miscalculation, he would have come to Qatar with a 30-point lead over Piastri and 42 over Verstappen, giving him a much greater chance to seal the title and he admitted it had been a blow.“Of course it hurts,” he said. “There’s a lot of effort that goes into every weekend from everyone, including myself, and it certainly made all that effort feel like it disappeared very quickly. But it’s the same feeling for all of us, the mechanics, the engineers, myself, everyone inMcLarenfeels let down by what we had as a result.“We’re all disappointed but actually I found it quite easy just to move on and have a few days off and come to this weekend.”View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri was adamant he would be fighting for the title as strongly as his teammate Lando Norris.Photograph: Darko Bandić/APPiastri expressed similar feelings but was unequivocal that as things stood he would not make any sacrifices to help Norris in a fight with Verstappen, when asked if he would be prepared to help his teammate. “We’ve had a very brief discussion on it and the answer is no,” he said. “I’m still equal on points with Max and I’ve got a decent shot of still winning it if things go my way, so that’s how we’ll play it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That much was acknowledged in July when the former Grenadiers team principal Brailsford, making his return to the Tour de France, admitted that after his sojourn at Manchester United, he had “a lot of catching up to do”.Ineos Grenadiers have not won a Grand Tour since 2021 and the once-dominant team have been criticised by Thomas himself and former staff for falling behind the four-time Tour de France winner Pogacar and his rivals, Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel.“Ineos are not where they want to be, nor where they need to be and the gap is not small,” the ­aerodynamics guru Dan Bigham said, after ­announcing he was leaving the team in 2024.Thomas’s new position was first mooted in 2024 when he told the Guardian the team’s managementwas “like a coalition government”and that “it was a lot more straightforward with Dave at the top. There was clarity with everything.”Brailsford’s long-standing working relationship with the Welshman has been key to his recruitment. “Geraint knows what the process takes, how to deal with the highs and lows of elite sport and his willingness to now share this and mentor others to do the same is a great asset for the team,” said Brailsford.Explore more on these topicsTeam IneosGeraint ThomasDave BrailsfordCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s genocide is not over.”Contacted by Agence France-Presse, the Israeli foreign ministry did not immediately respond to the allegations.When faced with such allegations previously, the ministry has vehemently rejected them as “entirely false”, “fabricated” and “based on lies”.The 1948 UN genocide convention defines genocide as any of five “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.In December 2024, Amnesty concluded thatIsrael was committing genocide in Gazaby three of those acts– including deliberately inflicting on Palestinians conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction.View image in fullscreenA makeshift tent amid widespread devastation in Gaza City.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APIn an update on Thursday, Amnesty said: “Israel continues to severely restrict the entry of supplies and the restoration of services essential for the survival of the civilian population.“Despite a reduction in scale of attacks, and some limited improvements, there has been no meaningful change in the conditions Israel is inflicting on Palestinians inGazaand no evidence to indicate that Israel’s intent has changed.”Following Amnesty’s findings in December, Israel’s foreign ministrycalled the London-based group a “deplorable and fanatical organisation”.“Israel is defending itself ... acting fully in accordance with international law,” it said.Gaza hospitals running out of supplies as Israeli airstrikes continue, medics sayRead moreGaza has been devastated by the war triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.Callamard said: “Israel’s pattern of conduct in Gaza, including the deliberate, unlawful denial of lifesaving aid to Palestinians, many of whom are injured, malnourished and at risk of serious disease, continues to threaten their survival.”In September 2025, the independent international commission of inquiry set up by the UN concluded that“genocide is occurring in Gaza”– something Israel denied. The investigation concluded that Israeli authorities and forces had since October 2023 committed “four of the five genocidal acts” listed in the 1948 genocide convention.These five acts include killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group, preventing births and forcibly transferring children out of the group.The international court of justice last year ordered Israel “to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide” in Gaza.The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people. Israel’s retaliatory assault on Gaza has killed at least 69,799 people, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry that the UN considers reliable. The ministry says that since the ceasefire came into effect, 352 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelAmnesty InternationalPalestineIsrael-Gaza warHuman rightsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

However, the DWP has stopped short of issuing a formal apology or offering compensation.Figures released as part of Rachel Reeves’s budget on Wednesday showed that ministers have earmarked £75m from 2026 to fix the issues raised by the review, led by the disability rights expert Liz Sayce.It is understood that most of the £75m will pay for the large number of officials needed to reassess the 145,000 overpayments. A smaller amount is expected to be used to either write off debts or reimburse unpaid carers who have already paid.Official documents show that £20m is due to be spent in 2026-27, £35m the following year and £20m in 2028-29. The money is to cover the costs to “reassess overpayments from 2015 to 2025 caused by incorrect operational guidance”.The “incorrect operational guidance” refers mainly to guidance issued to DWP staff in 2020 that caught out carers whose weekly or monthly earnings fluctuated, and who were penalised despite their “average” total earnings over a defined period being within allowed earnings limits. The guidance resulted in a surge of overpayment penalties.Unpaid carers who look after loved ones for at least 35 hours a week are entitled to £83.30 a week carer’s allowance, as long as their weekly earnings from part-time jobs do not exceed £196. If they exceed this limit, even by as little as 1p, under “cliff edge” rules they must repay the entire week’s allowance.This means a carer who oversteps the earnings threshold by 1p a week for a year must repay not 52p but £4,331.60, plus a £50 civil penalty.Carers in zero hours or seasonal work were especially vulnerable to penalties. The review cites a part-time NHS worker who was forced to pay back £300 carer’s allowance after getting a one-off £200 Covid bonus, leaving them £100 out of pocket.The review said the guidelines were flawed, confusing and out of step with social security law. It “was not clear why the new guidance was introduced” it said, adding it appeared to have been done so without being tested or legally checked.The guidance was never published, leaving carers in the dark about whether it was permissible to average their earnings. Carers told the review they had received conflicting advice from the DWP. New guidance was introduced in September this year.Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK, said the fix was a“vital step towards addressing the injustices carers have faced for far too long”. She added: “In the coming days, we will be examining how much of this funding will directly benefit carers and how much will be used to implement the new systems and processes that are so urgently needed to prevent this happening again.”Explore more on these topicsCarersCarer's allowance crisisWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

ANL vehemently denies the allegations.The judge warned lawyers for the claimants he will not permit the case “to descend into a wide-ranging public inquiry” that was “guided only by what the claimants seek to shine a light on”. Nor would he allow “a series of rabbits produced out of a hat” to ambush witnesses.His warning came as he granted the claimants’ legal team permission for restricted use of records kept by the private investigator Stephen Whittamore detailing his dealings with journalists. ANL had retained the two notebooks after they were produced at the Leveson inquiry, Sherborne told the judge.The fact the claimants were not able to use the books was “wholly unjust” and a “totally unlevel playing field”, Sherborne had argued.The court has previously heard private investigator Gavin Burrows had withdrawn a statement he allegedly made for the claimants in which he is said to have claimed to have targeted “hundreds, possibly thousands of people” through voicemail hacking, landline tapping and the accessing of financial and medical information for a journalist at the Mail on Sunday.Burrows has claimed his signature on the statement was a “forgery”, an accusation dismissed by Sherborne as “scurrilous” and “a grotesque inclusion which is meant to be an attack on parts of the legal team”.The trial, in which legal costs are estimated to reach £38m, is expected to last nine weeks.Explore more on these topicsMediaPrince HarryPaul DacreDaily MailDaily Mail & General TrustNewspapersNational newspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

The exterior was covered with more than 85,000 pieces of limestone.Hedge-fund managers, financial tycoons including Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, tech entrepreneurs including Steve Jobs, and celebrities such as Bono, Sting, Denzel Washington, and sports commentator Bob Costas called it home.Stern bucked the trend for modernist glass condominiums by the likes of Richard Meier, and again for the later fashion for ultra-tall “shadow-makers”. He chose instead to make old fashioned new again – the “traditional modern”.“It was my breakthrough,” the 84-year-old architecttold the New York Timesof 15 Central Park West in an interview for his obituary, adding that he did not use a computer and drew everything by hand.View image in fullscreen15 Central Park West, designed by Stern.Photograph: Sandra Baker/AlamyThe backers behind Central Park West, the Zeckendorf family, had figured out –said Vanity Fair– “that nothing appeals to people, particularly rich people, like something new that doesn’t look too new”. The building featured the classic layouts of old money Park Avenue apartments, along with screening rooms, copper-domed rotunda-lobby, a 75-ft pool and a waiting room for chauffeurs.At the peak of his career, Stern, who was born in Brooklyn, ran a 300-person architectural firm and produced encyclopedic volumes on the city’s architecture and served as dean of the Yale School ofArchitecture.“I became an architect because I loved the buildings of my city, New York, and imagined one day that I would make ones like them. The New York of my youth is to this day the principal subject of all my work in architecture,” he wrote in 1981.Stern also designed beach club resorts for Disney World in Florida, and his firm did the master plan for the infamous Disney “new town” of Celebration. He had wide range, designing the George W Bush Center in Dallas, the Museum of the American Revolution and Philadelphia’s 58-story Comcast Center.Small and with a high-pitched voice, Stern wore pocket squares, worn with suede loafers, butter-yellow socks, and chalk-striped bespoke suits. Modernism was not among his interests. “Many Modernist works of our time tend to be self-important objects, and that’s a real quarrel that I have,” hetoldthe New York Times in 2007. “Buildings can be icons or objects, but they still have to engage with the larger whole.“I’m not considered avant-garde because I’m not avant-garde. But there is a parallel world out there – of excellence.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

The planting of willow trees can help prevent it from being eroded and washed away, because they have complex root systems that anchor the soil.Guy Shrubsole, the author of The Lost Rainforests of Britain, said: “This is an outrageous act of sabotage, one which points a dagger at the heart of efforts to restore nature in this part of the country.“Dartmoor’s commons are virtually treeless already – a result of centuries of overgrazing by sheep. To see even these tentative efforts at restoring trees subjected to deliberate vandalism is deeply disturbing, as is the failure so far to uncover the culprit.“Such wanton criminal damage must be publicly condemned by all common graziers, farmers and conservationists. Dartmoor stands at a critical juncture: do we choose to breathe life back into this landscape, or let it die?”The Duchy of Cornwall has reacted with dismay to the news. Emma Magee, its head of communities and nature, said: “We are committed to working with our partners to secure a better future for Dartmoor, and this recent action does not represent the collective commitment of Dartmoor’s community to achieve this. Woodland expansion alongside peatland restoration is central to a restored landscape across Dartmoor.”A spokesperson for the South West Peatland Partnership, which funded the tree planting, said: “Any use of herbicide on the common land and legally protected habitats of Dartmoor is an attack on those that live, work, enjoy and rely on these landscapes. An attack on everyone working year-round together using public money to restore our peatlands, rebuild vanished habitats, and support nature recovery alongside sustainable farming practices.“Planting trees on Dartmoor is key to wetland function and is backed by scientific and historical evidence. We will replant the vandalised areas as soon as possible.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

And then we’ll have a revolutionary style change that will be both chaotic and violent.”On nature, Nathalie Seddon, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford, said: “We are facing a national emergency not only because the climate is changing, but because the living systems that protect the climate are breaking down.”She added:“This isn’t about choosing between the economy and the environment. It’s about recognising that the economy is embedded within the environment, and that the health of the nation depends on the living systems that sustain us.”Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, said thata collapse in the Atlantic meridianal overturning current (Amoc)would leave London freezing in winters of -20C, “and yet the summers would still be hotter than today’s”, leading to a situation where the UK would be 100% reliant on food imports. “We have got to do everything in our power to limit the amount of time we spend above 1.5C [above preindustrial temperatures],” Lenton said.Mark Rylance was among the prominent figures who attended the briefing. Inequality is a core part of the climate problem, the actor told the Guardian. Echoing Anderson, he said: “The cost of living crisis is really an inequality crisis. They go hand in hand. What we have is such an unequal society. And it is a contributing factor to the climate crisis.“I’m a very wealthy person and I have to do more about this. We have got to do more about our collective addiction.”He accused billionaires of funding climate denying misinformation. “They do it because they don’t want people to act collectively, they want people to feel powerless. They should do better things with their money.”Richard Nugee, a retired general, said politicians focused on the threat from Russia were failing to see the greater threat of the climate crisis. “Climate change is going to be a bigger problem than Russia,” he said. “It’s an insidious threat, one that has crept up. It’s going to do more damage than the threats they’re focused on now. But all they see is a resurgent Russia.”He said politicians needed to ensure the UK could cope with the greater extremes of weather that were already apparent and going to worsen. The lack of action to ensure that vital infrastructure is resilient was leaving the country vulnerable to extreme weather, and open to attack from enemies who could perceive this weakness.“Having spent most of my life fighting, I need to believe this country to be strong. The last thing I want to see is this country go to war. But we are not providing a sufficient deterrent, because we are not resilient enough [to the impacts of the climate crisis],” said Nugee.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEconomicsHealthMark RylancenewsShareReuse this content"

Yet here, inside a small enclosure with a shallow pool, three capybaras are at the disposal of dozens of paying customers – all clamouring for a selfie. As people eagerly thrust leafy snacks toward the nonchalant-looking animals, few seem to consider the underlying peculiarity: how, exactly, did this South American rodent end up more than 10,000 miles from home, in a bustling Asian metropolis?Capybara cafes have been cropping up across the continent in recent years, driven by the animal’s growing internet fame. The semi-aquatic animals feature inmore than 600,000TikTok posts. In Bangkok, cafe customers pay 400 baht (£9.40) for a 30-minute petting session with them, along with a few meerkats and Chinese bamboo rats. Doors are open 12 hours a day, seven days a week.We used to talk about the food trade in China, but now the pet trade is increasing with all these pet cafesSue Lieberman, WCS“They’re just so weird,” says Elizabeth Congdon, a capybara biologist at Bethune-Cookman University in Florida, mulling over the rodent’s sudden appeal. “And then you combine that weirdness factor with how docile they are, how easy they are to keep in zoos, and how social they are.”But the newfound popularity, experts say, is tied to a troubling boom in exotic animal cafes across Asia. Taiwan wasthe first placeto allow cafe patrons to rendezvous with cats, in 1998.Japanand South Korea later popularised mingling with wilder animals, fromowlsto raccoons to otters. Last year, the lattercracked downon exotic animal cafes, introducing laws that would stop cafes displaying wild animals unless they were registered as zoos or aquariums. But in some of Asia’s other large cities, from Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam to Guangzhou in China, animal cafes are more popular than ever.View image in fullscreenCustomers interact with owls at a cafe in Kamakura, Japan.Photograph: Frederic Vielcanet/Alamy“The amount of diversity and the number of animals – and, in particular, quite a few threatened animals – is very concerning,” says Timothy Bonebrake, a conservation biologist at the University of Hong Kong who has studied the growth of exotic animal cafes in Asia.Even a cursory online search yields capybara cafes in places such asJakarta,Qingdao, andHanoi. The rodents are not classified as endangered – they range from northern Colombia down to northern Argentina, with an estimated1.2 millionroaming Brazil’s wetlands and cities. But, “the reason they are not endangered is because they are abundant in Brazil where they are protected”, says Congdon, who says that in Venezuela and Colombia they live mostly in protected areas.The international trade in capybaras is not regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites), though exporting native wild capybaras remains illegal in many South American countries, such as Brazil, Argentina and Peru. Experts say the rodents’ movement from South America to Asia is often linked to the illegal pet trade, with the same people moving species across international borders.View image in fullscreenA sloth hangs out in a coffee shop in Hangzhou, China.Photograph: Long Wei/FeatureChina“Legal and illegal supply chains for live animals converge at multiple points, and are often controlled by the same people and companies,” says Scott Roberton, executive director of a team countering wildlife trafficking at the WildlifeConservationSociety (WCS).The capybaras at the Bangkok cafe are “from ethic [sic] farms inThailand. We don’t import them from their original country,” according to a small sign in the animals’ enclosure. However, Roberton says: “Laundering of illegally caught animals into legal supply chains is very common, with those animals often then used to establish or supplement breeding stock.”Species at risk of extinction have also been swept up in the pet trade for exotic animal cafes. This year, a study linkedsmall-clawed ottersfound in Japanese animal cafes to two poaching hotspots in southern Thailand – violating a ban on the commercial trade of the vulnerable species.View image in fullscreenHedgehogs at a cafe in Tokyo. Concern over animal cafes is not simply over the illegal pet trade but also fears that non-native species could become invasive.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersConcerns about the growth in the illegal pet trade – including for animal cafes – prompted members of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) toadopt a motiontargeted at curbing the illegal pet trade at its October congress meeting.“The global pet trade is really out of control, from a conservation perspective,” says Sue Lieberman, vice-president of international policy at WCS. “In the past five years, we have seen much more pet trade in Asia. We used to talk about the food trade inChina, but now the pet trade in China is increasing with all these pet cafes.”A survey of one of China’s largest databases on corporations, Qichacha, reveals that the number of businesses listed as petting zoos, which includes animal cafes, shot up from fewer than 100 in 2020 to more than 1,800 in 2025. And while private pet ownership in China increased by 50% over the past five years, pet cafes have been growing at 200% annually.View image in fullscreenOtter cafes are increasingly popular in Japan.Photograph: ZUMA Press Inc./AlamyOtters posing for selfies in Japanese cafes may be linked to illegal trade, experts warnRead moreA comprehensive analysis of recent growth in the number of exotic animal cafes across the whole of Asia is lacking, but one study co-authored by Bonebrake in the journal Conservation Lettersfound there were 406 animal cafes across Asiain 2019, just over a quarter of which contained exotic species. And of the more than 250 exotic species recorded, nearly half were threatened with extinction or had a decreasing population in the wild.Even in the absence of conservation concerns about imported species, some countries are worried about the movement of exotic animals for cafes. In May,policeseized five capybaras from traffickers in Costa Rica, where trading capybaras is illegal due to fears they could escape and flourish in the wild. Capybaras breed rapidly, can withstand a wide range of temperatures, and have a flexible diet of grasses and aquatic plants. “There is a high risk for them to be invasive,” Congdon says.The impact of pet cafes on the illegal wildlife trade isn’t just limited to the animals moving through a venue’s doors, says Roberton, but how they may stimulate demand. “Suddenly, you’re encouraging people that there is this cool, big exotic animal that you can pet and feed. How many people leave that cafe and go, ‘I want a baby capybara’?”View image in fullscreenWildlife experts fear that pet cafes may stimulate demand for animals.Photograph: Cristóbal Herrera/EPA/ShutterstockFind moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsIllegal wildlife tradeThe age of extinctionAnimalsAnimal welfareThailandPetsEndangered speciesConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

WuXi AppTec publicly refuted the claims against it last year, with its chair, Ge Li, signing an open letter in February 2024 pushing back on the “misguided” bill and rejecting “blanket allegations and pre-emptive actions” against it.WuXi AppTec is one of several Chinese companies that haveappeared on Global Counsel’s client rosterin recent years, with others including TikTok and Shein.Global Counsel’s client list and Mandelson’s own ties to China came under scrutiny after he was appointed UK ambassador to Washington in February 2025.Critics of Beijing saidhis doveish stance and support for closer trade ties made him unsuitable for the role.He was sacked in Septemberhaving served just seven months as ambassador after disclosures were made about the extent of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.Mandelson stepped down as chair of Global Counsel in May 2024 and stopped advising the business in December 2024. He retains a minority stake according to the latest company filings from October, but this has now been ringfenced and is in the process of being divested. It is understood he has no role in the business and will play no role in the future.Global Counsel’s work with WuXi AppTec is led by its chief executive, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, a former Downing Street head of strategic communications under Tony Blair. Wegg-Prosser was reportedly approached by the UK government for the role of investment minister last year but turned it down.The Biosecure Act proposed by US lawmakers last year sought to prevent “adversary biotech companies” from obtaining federal government funding.Supporters of the legislation argued it was needed to keep American citizens’ health data and genetic information safe from foreign adversaries and that it was dangerous for China to dominate the biotechnology supply chain.WuXi AppTec’s US and European president, Richard Connell, criticised the “unfounded allegations” against the company and said it was known for its “longstanding and strict adherence to US laws and regulations and respected security protocols”.In a LinkedIn post in May, he raised concerns about the bill’s “broader impact on US leadership in biotechnology innovation”.The bill threatened WuXi AppTec’s business in the US, where it supplies key ingredients for a host of drugs and generates most of its revenue. It ultimately failed to pass through the Senate in 2024 after industry pushback.A new version of the bill was endorsed by the US Senate last month, which adopted a softer tone and omitted any mention of WuXi companies.Earlier this month, WuXi AppTec announced plans to set up its first European headquarters in Germany.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Once she started vomiting, I’m of the view she should have been immediately readmitted.”The coroner said that Kel Anyanwu, the surgeon who carried out the operation, ought to have consulted colleagues who knew more than him about CVS.Cox said: “I’m of the view that Mr Anyanwu should have spoken to paediatric colleagues pre-operatively, as he knew little, if anything, about CVS. This may well have impacted on decisions to discharge or readmit earlier.“As Mr Anyanwu did not fully understand the implications of CVS, it had to follow the parents could not fully have provided informed consent. That is plainly undesirable and a point for the trust to take on board.”However, Cox said he was not able to say that Amber’s death could have been prevented if she had been kept in hospital overnight or readmitted sooner.Amber, from the village of St Just in Roseland, Cornwall, underwent the procedure on 5 April 2023 because she had sleep apnoea. She was discharged home within hours and began vomiting in the early morning of 6 April.Her parents rang the hospital and were advised to wait and see how Amber did and to call back if she did not stop being sick, the inquest in Truro heard. Amber vomited about 20 times and her parents took her back to the hospital at 10pm on 6 April.Cornwall coroner’s court heard that on 9 April, Amber suffered an infection in the area of her throat where her tonsils had been removed and a haemorrhage.Anyanwu told the inquest he had worked at the hospital for 25 years and had never seen a death from a tonsillectomy before.Asked about the decision to discharge Amber after the operation, he said: “The conversation was let’s see how she’s managing three, four, five hours after. The assumption was that if she was fine, she will probably be OK. The decision was made later when we saw her, that she is fine, she can go.”Anyanwu described the operation, which took 38 minutes, as “quiet in terms of blood loss” and said he had not seen active signs of infection at the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was also a very brave person, and those qualities came to the fore when she first started getting poorly at the age of two.“Once she had started vomiting, she was in and out of hospital on a regular basis, which was tough on her, tough on us all, but she took it all in her stride. Amber was so strong and when she felt sick she just got on with it.”Outside the court, they said in a statement that it had “never for a moment crossed our minds that she might die from having her tonsils out”.They encouraged other families to allow necessary surgery but added: “If you are worried, don’t be afraid to trust your instincts and speak up or ask questions and work with the doctors.“Remember that no operation is risk-free, however common it may be.”The Royal CornwallHospitalsNHS Trust said it accepted the coroner’s findings and would make any further changes it could to improve the care it gave to patients.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCornwallEnglandHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

He remains in custody for questioning.Two people, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby, were killed when Jihad al-Shamie launched a car and knife attack on Heaton Park shul on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, on 2 October.Cravitz, 66, died in hospital from stab wounds while Daulby, 53, was fatally struck by a police bullet fired by armed officers. Shamie, 35, was shot dead by police while wearing a fake explosive belt.Rob Potts, an assistant chief constable at Greater Manchester police, said: “The loved ones of Mr Daulby and Mr Cravitz have been updated on this development, as have those who were seriously injured in the attack.”Seven people have so far been arrested in connection with the attack, which was the most lethal antisemitic incident in Britain in modern times.One of those, a 30-year-old man, was arrested on 9 October at Manchester airport on suspicion of failing to disclose information that could prevent a terror attack. He remains on bail. Five others were released without further action.Potts added: “Our investigation is continuing, and I would once again appeal for anyone with information that they think could assist our inquiries to please come forward. We are also still seeking to identify and speak to anyone who was present at the time of the incident or the immediate aftermath so that we can ensure they have access to all the welfare support options that are available to witnesses.“If you believe you may have been one of those witnesses or have information that could help us identify them then please contact us via the major incident public portal or by calling 0161 856 3946.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Colin McPherson/The GuardianShellfish exports to the EU from the Menai Strait have all but collapsed, but fishers are looking to the futureByJoanna Partridgein BangorThu 27 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTShareRising out of the water, nets bulge with thousands of blue mussels. Pulled back to the dredging boat, they are emptied into a hopper and rinsed with water.They have just been harvested fresh from the bottom of the Menai Strait, the channel that separates the northWalesmainland from the island of Anglesey.On a blustery, damp morning, skipper Alan Owen guides the 43-metre Valente out of Port Penrhyn, close to the city of Bangor, towards the mussel grounds around the pier.“It’s windy today but we’re not jumping up and down as there aren’t big waves. If Anglesey wasn’t there it’d be a different story,” says Owen.“Our geographical position makes this probably the best place in Britain for producing mussels,” he adds, pointing to the boat’s screen, where different colours display the areas where several companies are licensed to harvest the shellfish.“It’s because of the tidal exchange going through the Menai Strait, it gets up to six knots in the middle there,” he says. “You’ve got a massive volume of water exchanging both ways, bringing in the food and nutrients the mussels like.”View image in fullscreenSkipper Alan Owen was followed by his son Martin into the mussel harvesting industry, but his grandson might not do so.Photograph: Colin McPherson/The GuardianIt was these natural advantages that helped turn the eastern Menai Strait into the largest mussel farming area in Britain from the 1960s onwards, employing scores of local people including Owen’s father and uncle.Over the years, as production increased, the vast majority of the mussels were sent across the Channel toEurope, where diners – especially in France, Belgium and the Netherlands – tend to eat a lot more shellfish.The UK’s shellfish industry is small and specialised, valued before Brexit at less than £12m a year, but one which is crucial for some coastal communities. Britain’s departure from the EUclosed off most accessto the lucrative European export market, and has all but ended the industry in the Menai Strait.SinceBrexit, mussel production has collapsed from about 10,000 tonnes annually to just five tonnes in 2022, representing just 0.05% of the previous total.The Valente is the last remaining mussel dredging boat at Port Penrhyn; the other three have been sold off or redeployed. The company which owns the Valente, Myti Mussels is the only one of four mussel fishing companies fully operating. It now just sells small quantities of molluscs to UK customers.There is, however, a glimmer of hope on the horizon in the shape of the“reset” dealbetween Keir Starmer’s UK government and the EU, announced in May.A mussel dredging net being opened on board the ValenteBritain’s shellfish exporters and other food producers are expected to beone of the main beneficiariesof the UK-EU reset, designed to remove the need forsanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) controlsat the border, which formed part of post-Brexit trading requirements, along with health and veterinary checks and supplementary paperwork.The administrative burden was one of the reasons for the collapse in exports from north Wales, resulting from longstanding EU rules concerning imports of shellfish including mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops – collectively known as live bivalve molluscs – from non-EU member states.Molluscs caught outside the EU can only be imported to the bloc without treatment if they come fromwaters with the highest quality rating, while vessels from non-EU states are also not permitted to land live bivalve molluscs in EU ports.The waters of the Menai Strait are, like the majority of those in England and Wales, rated “class B” for shellfish production, which isassessed according to the levels of E coli detectedin shellfish flesh. This means mussels from the area can be sold for human consumption provided they are either purified in an approved location, or moved for at least a month to “class A” water, or alternatively treated with heat.Some fishers believe thatsewage outflows into the Menai Straitafter heavy rain has not helped improve the water quality in recent times.View image in fullscreenMartin Owen checking samples of mussels at a purification plant at the harbour in Bangor.Photograph: Colin McPherson/The GuardianMussels from “class B” waters can still be exported to the EU, provided they are first purified – or depurated in industry parlance – by being placed for a day or two in tanks of clean seawater which has been sterilised using ultraviolet light. This process is costly and can cause stress for the molluscs, reducing their shelf life and making them less attractive to European buyers.There isn’t a purification plant in Bangor, or indeed in the UK, that could handle the volumes of molluscs exported pre-Brexit. However, that should be about to change, as an Irish seafood company has fitted out a building next to Port Penrhyn, which is awaiting certification.This investment and news of the reset talks have given Owen hope that the local industry can be resurrected.“The customers are still there,” he says. “Where we are situated, weather-wise, we are 100% reliable. If they pick up the phone and order, we deliver.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

James Wilson is one of the owners of the mussel producer Deepdock. The business has stopped trading since Brexit and Wilson now runs a fish and seafood shop next to the port for part of the week, alongside teaching at Bangor university.“We tried every possible avenue that we could think of to try to secure some stable access to the EU market, but found a locked door at the end of it,” Wilson says, in between wrapping up fish fillets for customers.View image in fullscreenJames Wilson at the Menai Seafood Company in Bangor. He formerly owned a company that fished for mussels in the Menai Straits.Photograph: Colin McPherson/The GuardianHe was initially encouraged by news of the reset talks, but given that any implementation of an SPS deal is unlikely to happen before 2027, Wilson worries it will be hard to restart significant mussel exports.The local mussel beds would also need to be repopulated. This requires very young mussels – called seed mussels – to be collected from other naturally occurring beds and laid in licensed areas, where they usually need a couple of years to grow to a marketable size.“There’s always uncertainty, particularly in respect of the juvenile mussels, the seed mussels, so we have natural variability associated with that,” Wilson says.“If you’ve got an input uncertainty with the seed, added to an output uncertainty as to whether you’ll be able to sell anything you’ve got on the ground, it’s just too much. It’s a big investment, millions of pounds, to buy a boat, run it, crew it. You’ve got to have certainty.”Many other shellfish businesses around the UK are “on hold”, says David Jarrad, the chief executive of the industry body the Shellfish Association of Great Britain. “So much for a reset,” he adds, saying “the longer it takes [to implement an SPS agreement with the EU], the less chance there is that they will be able to start trading again.”Skipper Alan Owen opens a blue mussel on board the ValenteHe and many others believe the UK is missing out on a potential growth sector, supplying customers with a large appetite for British shellfish.“The UK is located in the sweet spot for cultivating shellfish almost anywhere in the world,” Jarrad says. “Our aquaculture industry is minuscule in comparison with Spain and France and the Netherlands, even though we have a greater coastline.”A government spokesperson said: “We are focused on negotiating an SPS deal that could add up to £5.1bn a year to our economy, by cutting costs and reducing red tape for British producers and retailers.”Back at the fish shop next to Port Penrhyn, Wilson wonders whether a future SPS agreement could inspire a new generation of mussel fishers.“Maybe if somebody with a bit more enthusiasm, a bit more energy, a bit of money comes in, then it might all happen.”Explore more on these topicsFishing industryBrexitWalesEuropean UnionEuropeFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The news was first reported by thejournalistEmily Bass and confirmed in an email viewed bythe New York Times.Employees and grantees could still “tout the work” on Aids being done through various programs “to counter this dangerous disease and other infectious diseases around the world”, the email reportedly said. They may also attend events related to the commemoration.But they should “refrain from publicly promoting World Aids Day through any communication channels, including social media, media engagements, speeches or other public-facing messaging”.The email also reportedly said the government’s policy is “to refrain from messaging on any commemorative days, including World AIDS Day”, even thoughDonald Trumphas issued proclamationsfor dozens of other observances, including Anti-Communism Week and National Energy Dominance Month.“An awareness day is not a strategy,” a state department spokesperson, Tommy Pigott, told the New York Times. “Under the leadership of President Trump, the state department is working directly with foreign governments to save lives and increase their responsibility and burden sharing.”Every year since 1988, theUShas marked 1 December as World Aids Day to honor those who have lost their lives to the disease, to recognize and highlight efforts to contain the epidemic, and to raise awareness among the general public.Last year, in a cermony on the South Lawn,Joe Bidenhosted the first White House display of Aids memorial quilt panels memorializing more than 110,000 lives lost.Since returning to the White House, Trump hascancelledforeign aid programs thatcombatHIV and Aids, scrappedresearchand prevention resources, and restrictedfundingunder the two-decade-old President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, or Pepfar, the government’s global HIV program established under the Republican president George W Bush, which is estimated to haveprevented 25 million early deaths.World Aids Day is usually when the state department shares Pepfar data about cumulative and annual progress with Congress.

He said Portugal, where the airline Tap has its headquarters, had tried through its embassy in Caracas to persuade Venezuelan authorities to reinstate operating rights, adding Portugal had “no intention of canceling our routes to Venezuela, and that, obviously, we only did so for security reasons”.The US has made itslargest military deployment to the Caribbean in decadesamid worsening relations with Venezuela to combat, it has claimed, the role of the president, Nicolás Maduro, in supplying illegal drugs that have killed Americans.Maduro has denied the accusations and said Donald Trump was seeking to oust him.In a statement on Monday, the International Air Transport Association said Venezuelan authorities had given international airlines a 48-hour deadline to resume flights or risk losing their rights to fly to the country.Several international airlines had cancelled flights to Venezuela in recent days, ignoring the deadline.

He believed French youth had a “thirst for engagement”, saying there was a young generation “ready to stand up” for their nation.Under the new military service, men and women, mostly aged 18 and 19, could volunteer to sign up for 10 months. They would be paid a minimum of €800 (£700) per month and receive food and accommodation, as well as a 75% discount on rail travel. They would be deployed “only on national soil”, Macron said. A minority with specific qualifications, for example in engineering or medical skills, could be aged up to 25.View image in fullscreenFabien Mandon, France’s armed services chief, standing alongside Emmanuel Macron, said France needed to steel itself for possible future losses against Russian aggression.Photograph: Blondet Eliot/ABACA/ShutterstockThere is so far no suggestion that military service in France could again be compulsory, as it was before the then president, Jacques Chirac, abolished conscription in 1997.“We cannot return to the time of conscription,” Macron said. “This hybrid army model corresponds to the threats and risks ahead, bringing together national service youth, reservists, and the active army.”The plan will cost €2bn, which Macron called “a significant and necessary effort”.The scheme aims to bring in 3,000 volunteers in 2026, rising to 10,000 by 2030. “My ambition for France is to reach 50,000 youth by 2036, depending on evolving threats,” Macron said. After the programme, participants could integrate into civilian life, become a reservist, or stay in the armed forces, he said.He said the plan was “inspired by practices of our European partners ... at a time when all our European allies advance in response to a threat that weighs on us all”.The move is part of abroader shift across Europe, where nations who have long enjoyed the decades-long tranquillity of US security guarantees are concerned about Donald Trump’s shifting priorities and Russia’s aggressive posturing.Macron’s announcement brings France in line with nearly a dozen other European nations such as Germany and Denmark who have launched similar projects.Military service is seen as a way of bolstering armies with recruits, but also of providing a large pool of potential reservists, who could be called up in the case of a future war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perrin told Reuters: “His remarks were taken out of context ... but if being a bit blunt is necessary to make the French understand the situation we are in, then he was right to do it.”Clémence Guetté, of the leftwing party La France Insoumise, said of the new voluntary military service on RTL radio: “France isn’t at war and this can’t be the priority for young people.”Sébastien Chenu, an MP for Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party, said the new voluntary military service was “going in the right direction”.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsFranceRussiaEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Thompson was “expressly aware of his obligations of confidentiality” and discussed steps taken to keep their relationship secret.Their messages were not preserved by council under the Public Records Act.“Mr Thompson denies committing any kind of misconduct or criminal offence and respectfully declines to provide a response in circumstances where there is the prospect of future criminal proceedings,” his lawyers told the CCC.The report also details allegations of false statements by Thompson before and after he became mayor of Townsville in 2024.During the election campaignhe falsely claimed to have served as a signalman alongside the SASand exaggerated his length of service, which was in the army reserve, it said.In a subsequent interview with A Current Affair, he blamed “100-plus” concussions and epilepsy for forgetting details of his military service.The CCC obtained copies of Thompson’s medical records.“There is no evidence Mr Thompson has received specialist treatment for epilepsy,” the CCC report read.“An epilepsy management plan has been endorsed by a general practitioner, who also prescribed anti-seizure medication between November 2023 and October 2024”.Thompson also claimed to be a “cancer survivor” during the election campaign, claiming he had been told to “get your affairs in order” in 2021 as a result of oesophageal cancer.His medical records do not record a diagnosis or treatment for oesophageal cancer, the CCC said.“The records show that Mr Thompson had post-gastric sleeve complications which potentially account for any reference to his stomach and the associated comments to ensure his affairs were in order,” the CCC said.One witness interviewed by the CCC told them Thompson had made similar claims on Facebook in 2019, and that a relative had commented on the post blaming his gastric band surgery and encouraging him to “stop telling people he had cancer”.He also self-reported the removal of several “melanomas”. According to the medical records reviewed by the CCC, he had malignant skin lesions removed in 2020 but “has had no melanomas diagnosed or treated”No specialist oncologist or known cancer medications are listed in his Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefit records.“Mr Thompson did not publicly rescind his claims that he has survived a diagnosis of cancer,” the CCC said.During the election campaign, Thompson also claimed to have “put myself through university” and to have obtained a business degree. His election materials asserted that he had bachelors degrees in commerce and science.The CCC found this was also false.Thompson was enrolled in a bachelor of commerce degree for one semester in 2006, passing two of the four subjects in which he was enrolled, according to the report. He has no university qualifications.Thompson stood down as mayor in September after 18 months of pressure for his resignation.He was accused of standing asidein order to avoid being dismissed by the minister, so that he would be allowed to recontest the position at a byelection. He also called on the local government minister to dismiss the council, effectively sacking all other councillors.He was easily beaten in November.The CCC referred allegations about false claims during the election period and leaking as mayor to the Queensland department of public prosecutions.It also recommended introducing a mechanism for candidates for election to declare qualifications and employment history, with sanctions if the information was false.Explore more on these topicsQueensland politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Under that exemption, parcels with a value of less than $800 (£600) shipped to individuals had been exempt from import tax. In August the US scrapped the tax break for items from all countries.The EU said in February it wouldphase out its exemptionon customs duties for low-value parcels.Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the trade body, added: “The US has already removed its threshold, with the EU following suit next year. The chancellor must take decisive action and remove the exemption as fast as possible. This will help protect British consumers from the risks of imported goods that don’t meet the UK’s stringent environmental and ethical standards, while promoting fairer competition.”George Weston, the boss of Primark’s owner, Associated British Foods, said the four-year delay, announced in Wednesday’s budget, “would prolong the damage caused and would be unacceptable”.“A commitment to close the customs loophole on low-value imports that unfairly disadvantages the high street is positive, but this needs to be brought in rapidly to prevent further undermining of UK retailers,” he said.Dan Finley, the boss of Debenhams Group, which owns Boohoo, PrettyLittleThing and other online fashion brands, said it was “disappointing we have to wait more than three years.”“There is no doubt that Shein and Temu are major competitors to us and they have disrupted our business and others’ in recent years in the UK,” he said, adding bringing the change in sooner would mean “more money in the coffers of the Treasury and less burden on the UK taxpayer”.He said the delay had “created an unlevel playing field” because British online sellers were losing the ability to sell low-value goods to the US and EU without paying duty but their overseas competitors could continue to enjoy a similar tax break when they sell into the UK.“They managed these changes in nine months in the US. I’m not sure why we can’t do it in the same amount of time,” he said.Alex Baldock, the boss of Currys, urged the government to go “further and faster” on the de minimis and business rates changes. He said that plans for both were “a step in the right direction and we would urge the government to go further and faster on both”.The changes are expected to boost the government’s coffers by about £500m a year.Retail insiders said the government was holding off on blocking all low-value imports because of fears of fuelling inflation. However, the government has said it expects any impact on consumer prices to “be modest”.It said the change “seeks to keep the UK in line with partners and ensure the customs system is fair and fit for the realities of modern global trade”.Explore more on these topicsRetail industrySheinChinaTrade policyE-commerceTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The two parties have entered a period of exclusivity and aim to complete the terms of the transaction swiftly. However, there is significant speculation over how Rothermere will fund the deal.Most analysts believe that the Telegraph titles are worth about £350m, and DMGT has said that in order to comply with foreign state influence rules, there would be no foreign state investment or capital in its funding structure.Some observers have speculated that this could still leave open the possibility of funding from foreign sources that are not state-owned or sovereign wealth funds. Two years ago DMGT had been intalks with Qatari investorsabout backing a bid for the Telegraph group, but later decided against the move.Rothermere’s businesses, which also include a Middle East-based events operation and property information services in the UK and US, made £1.1bn in revenues and adjusted pre-tax profits of £78m in the year to 30 September 2024.The consumer media business made revenues of £613m and £53m in adjusted operating profit. The property information division, which includes Trepp in the US and Landmark and Yopa in the UK, reported £219m in revenues and adjusted operating profits of £22m.The events and exhibition arm – which hosts four of its five biggest events in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Egypt – saw revenues increase 67% year-on-year to £272m as adjusted operating profits more than doubled to £42m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sales at its Karen Millen brand fell by 31%.Sales in the Debenhams division of the group – which isnow run as an online marketplaceand also includes brands such as Oasis and Warehouse – increased sales by 20%.The company said it had narrowed pre-tax losses to £2.5m from £130m in the prior year after it cut costs by £160m, which Finley said involved the loss of 2,500 jobs. It now employs 1,500 across the business.It expects to slash another £60m in costs after exiting a warehouse in Daventry and in the US and putting another one in Burnley up for sale.The group has been battling to revive sales after aboom during the Covid pandemic, when high street shops were closed, was followed by aslump in recent yearsamid new competition from retailers such as Shein and Temu. It has put its Pretty Little Thing brandup for sale.The group – which wasrebranded from Boohoo to Debenhams this year– said it was ditching an existing management reward scheme after a string of wrangles between Boohoo’s founders and shareholders over bonus payouts.Under the new scheme, the share price must reach £3 on average over a 30-day period in three years’ time, which would value the company at £4.2bn, 25 times its value when the market opened on Thursday.To achieve the full payout of £222.2m, shared among several executives, the share price must remain at that level for a further two years.Alongside the £148m for Finley – who became the group chief executive in 2024 – the company’s finance director, Phil Ellis, is in line for up to £14.8m. The rest would be shared with an undeclared group of other management. The executives could still share £21m if the share price hits a minimum of 60p.Finley said: “This is aligning senior management, including myself, with major shareholders to transformation of the share price. We are making progress and the opportunities are there to get back to our best.”The fashion group’sbillionaire founder Mahmud Kamaniwill not participate in the scheme.The latest reward scheme comes after a string of controversies at Boohoo over payouts to executives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Frasers is its largest shareholder, with almost 30% of the shares.Debenhams said “a major competitor who is a significant shareholder of Debenhams continues to seek to disrupt the Debenhams Group’s growth strategy and operations rather than maximise its future success”, pointing to Frasers’ previous vote against an attempt to officially change the group’s name from Boohoo Group to Debenhams.Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Boohoo is the right term to describe how its investors must be feeling now, with its shares down about 96% over the last five years.“Despite this, and in typical poor corporate governance fashion for Boohoo, it has sidestepped its investors by announcing a new compensation scheme for the management team, without seeking shareholder approval. As a result, the pressure really is on management to deliver on its turnaround scheme.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryBoohooDebenhamsFrasers GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

In extreme scenarios homes could be affected as well. It could take weeks or months to return the country to normal, according to separate government reports.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About a third of the UK’s gas is from North Sea fields but domestic production fell to 50-year lows last year and is expected to fall further towards the end of the decade. “Collaboration will be essential to ensuring reliable supplies for consumers,” according to Deborah Petterson, Neso’s resilience director.In forecasts where all gas supply and network infrastructure were working properly the risk of a shortfall could be far lower but it would still be evident in a scenario where the decarbonisation progress is slower and the UK remains more reliant on gas.A spokesperson for the industry regulator, Ofgem, said it would work closely with Neso, the government and NationalGas, which operates Britain’s gas networks, to “mitigate risks” in the system.Glenn Bryn-Jacobsen, a director at National Gas, which operates Britain’s gas network, said: “Gas remains a critical component of Britain’s energy security. Keeping homes warm, powering industry, and supporting electricity generation during periods of peak demand and low renewable output. In considering potential solutions, it is essential to look at both the gas supply landscape and the investment required in network infrastructure.”Explore more on these topicsGasEnergy industryUtilitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The pundit and former footballer talks about gentleness, bullying, her love of the Lionesses and why she’s never been so happyEmine SanerThu 27 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 05.46 ESTShareThe qualities that made Karen Carney an unstoppable winger on the football pitch – her speed and attack, and the sheer relentlessness of both – are more of a hindrance in the ballroom, for some of the dances at least. As the emerging star of this year’sStrictly Come Dancing, she has had to learn to slow down, stand up straighter, to be softer, and it’s taken a lot of hard work. On week eight, she had just performed the American Smooth, and her pro partner Carlos Gu was tearfully describing Carney’s work ethic. Who could watch her trying to hold back her own tears, chewing on emotion like a particularly tough bit of gristle, and fail to see a woman who was giving it everything?It was Carney’s dream to be on Strictly. The former England footballer, now TV pundit and podcaster, has just made it through week nine, performing an astonishing pasodoble at the all-important Blackpool week, and something will have gone very wrong if she doesn’t reach the final. The show has been struggling this year – a man described as aStrictly “star” was reportedly arrestedin October on suspicion of rape last year, and the announcement from its longtime hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman that this will be their final series has been destabilising. But Carney says that for her, it has been an overwhelmingly positive time. “There’s a team spirit within the cast. Behind [the scenes], the team can’t do enough for you to have the best experience.”Whatever happens, she says the show has already changed her. “I feel like I’m being rewired,” she says. “For 30 years, all I’ve done is football. When you retire, that’s really difficult. I’ve been able to show who I am, and remind myself of who I am as well. I’ve never been so happy. I’ve never smiled so much.”To survive in football – she retired in 2019, before the women’s game was as celebrated as it is now – and as a female pundit, Carney has had to steel herself. “I’ve pretty much been told I shouldn’t really play football, and then I shouldn’t really talk about it. So you have to be really resilient, maybe play a character that has to fight, whereas – which I think I’ve been able to show on Strictly – I’m quite soft and pretty sensitive. I’m a gentle human being. Sometimes, sport doesn’t allow you to show that.”View image in fullscreenPerforming the paso doble with Carlos.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PACarney burst on to the show with a leaderboard-topping jive. “It was a lot of kicking – you’d hope I’d be good at kicking,” she says. But the Latin styles and the slower ballroom dances have been difficult. As a child, Carney was diagnosed with Scheuermann’s disease, which causes a curvature of the spine. She has always had to overcompensate for her lack of full mobility, though she didn’t need perfect posture for football.She didn’t quite realise how much of a challenge it would be on Strictly, where the “frame” is vital. “It is really hard for me to get in frame. I physically can’t do it, but we’ve worked so hard on everything else around it to give me a fighting chance.” The work has paid off. Carney’s Argentine tango, performed in a flat cap to the Peaky Blinders theme song (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds’ Red Right Hand), in honour of her home city Birmingham, will surely become one of Strictly’s all-time greats.Carney is in the car on the way to training with Gu, to start work on their “couples’ choice” dance for this weekend. The song – Born This Way, Lady Gaga’s anthem of self-expression, joy and diversity – is meaningful to them both. Carney loves its opening lyrics: “My mama told me when I was young / ‘We are all born superstars’”. Her mum, she says, “never told me not to follow my dreams. That line epitomises everything that she told me.”As a child, Carney danced before football took over. She was the youngest of three girls. Their dad was a firefighter, and their mum still works for Sainsbury’s, a job she has had for more than 30 years. She credits her parents for her work ethic: the graft that got her a place on the England squad, a broadcasting career that was initially well out of her comfort zone, a master’s degree and MBA (despite, she says with a laugh, being “not academic at all” and having dyslexia), and several 10s on Strictly.The family supported Birmingham City, and Carney’s sister, Sarah, loved football – she became a referee and coach, but she would have loved to have been a player. “In terms of athleticism, she’s far more talented than me,” says Carney. “But being 12 years older, if it was hard for me to play, she had no chance. She never had any opportunities.”As a girl, even in the late 90s and early 2000s (she is 38), Carney had to justify her love of football. “I got told I shouldn’t play. I got bullied for it, really.” It was harder to deal with as a teenager. “You can understand why, in women’s sport, there’s such a drop-off [at that age]. The overriding thing was I had support from my family, and my coaches, so I was able to stay in it, and I was so obsessed with football.” Her mum always had a ball and red plastic cones in the car, “so wherever we went, I was able to play a game with someone or do some skills.”At 11, Carney joined the then quaintly named Birmingham City Ladies, and at 16, she left home on a scholarship to go to Loughborough College, where she boarded with other children who were gifted at sport. At 17, she made her England debut. “It was my dream to play for England, to play with Rachel Yankey and Kelly Smith, and I got to do it.”View image in fullscreenCarney playing in the Women’s World Cup in 2019.Photograph: Xinhua/REX/ShutterstockSoon afterwards, she joined Arsenal Ladies, winning the top trophies that season including the Women’s Premier League and the women’s FA and Uefa cups. Around that time, Carney’s mother – now regularly seen cheering in the Strictly audience–was ill. Football was, she says, “a big distraction for me”. It must have been a lot to go through, so young. “I lived away from home, my mum was ill, and football and studying for my A-levels, it was a lot,” she says. “There’s a little fighter in me somewhere.”She would have to draw on her resilience again a few years later when, signing for Chicago Red Stars and playing for the professional league in the US, she had a knee operation that meant she couldn’t play. She sank into depression. Before long, she was self-harming and addicted to sleeping pills. “I was in a pretty bad way. I think that has been the hardest thing I’ve ever had to overcome,” she says.Emma Hayes, who had been her coach at Arsenal and then in the US, urged her to return to the UK, even though she had another year left on her contract. “I came back purely to … save my life, pretty much.” Birmingham City wanted her back, but she told them football couldn’t be her priority while she got better. “They were, like, we know you’re not in a good place, but we will do our best to take care of you.”What helped? “My friends,” she says. “People around me dragged me through and I owed it to them to try and fight, and it’s an amazing feeling when you can get through that. It’s hard to talk about it, and I couldn’t have done it without people [around me].” Eventually Carney fell back in love with the game and finished her career on a high, having played for Chelsea, earned 144 caps for England and played in four World Cups before retiring in 2019.In 2022, she chaired agovernment reviewon the future of women’s football. “I knew how difficult it was for my sister. I know how difficult it was for my teammates. It was really important to me to get [the review] right, because I want girls to always have the best opportunities.” Among its recommendations were minimum salaries (this season, Women’s Super League players will be guaranteeda minimum salaryof £40,000, still some way off theaverage £4.7mearned by male Premier League players), improved pathways for talented girls and vastly better training facilities.In the run-up to the 2012 Olympics, Carney had to train, alone, in her local park. “So many times dogs nicked my ball, wee’d on my bottle, nicked my cones.” Dog walkers would come over to chat, not realising they were interrupting her training. “And the mud. The mud was so thick.” We’re both laughing, but it’s shocking really. “A lot of us in that [GB] team that I grew up with, we had to go to the local parks and train ourselves because we didn’t have the facilities, the coaching.”How does she feel when she sees how the women’s game has changed? “Proud,” she says. She laughs and says she feels like a “superfan” when some of her Lioness friends come to watch Strictly. “I forget they’re my pals. I look at them, and I’m in such awe of what incredible women they are.”When she watches the games, “the speed is improving, the quality is improving and it makes me so happy that the product is getting better and our female footballers are just thriving.” Does she wish she had been born 10 years later and was playing now? “No, I’m really happy with my career. I’m so grateful and humbled for the opportunities I had. You ask any Lioness, our job is to always make it better for the next generation.”When Carney turned 30, she knew retirement was coming, and she prepared as much as she could – female players, especially of Carney’s generation, weren’t retiring with the financial riches of their male counterparts. She hadn’t planned to be a pundit. When she was still playing, Birmingham City offered her some work commentating for their video channel during a period of injury. She says she was swayed by the free ticket to a game, and they were going to pay her; the extra money would pay for recovery equipment. She also wanted to teach herself to think more analytically. “At 26, I knew I was slowing down, and my mindset was: if I can’t beat someone physically, I can tactically out-think them.” Becoming a pundit, she says, “was always to make me a better footballer”. But she found she liked it.View image in fullscreenBecoming a pundit, ‘was always to make me a better footballer’.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAOnline abuse is familiar to most female pundits, particularly those working in football. Carney, who has worked for Sky and ITV, among others, was already battle-hardened by social media. As a player, one of many abusive posts wished “cancer, leukaemia and rape” on her, which prompted the FAto urge the policeand tech companies to act; but her experience as a pundit has been on another level. In December 2020, Carney received thousands of abusive and sexist messages after comments she made about Leeds United. She deleted her Twitter account, and the following year saidshe’d had suicidal thoughtsat the time.Even now, she looks close to tears. “That crushed my confidence. It floored me as a human, completely floored me. I’ve never got over it. I’m more emotional about that than what I dealt with in America. I’ve not dealt with this.” The pile-on felt, she says, “like the whole world was caving in on me. I’ve never experienced anything like it.”But she won’t be pushed out of punditry by people who think women have no place commenting on the men’s game: “The greatest gift that was ever given to me is my love of football,” she says. Still, she is hypervigilant, in her work – “the amount of effort I go to and the research and the prep I have to do is because I never want to make a mistake” – and on social media, where she restricts who can comment on her Instagram posts.View image in fullscreenDancing her leaderboard-topping jive on Strictly.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PAWhen Strictly Come Dancing offered her a place, she thought it might be a way to restore her confidence – and it has. “That’s why I’ll be forever grateful to Strictly, because it is rebuilding me.” After that first week’s jive, she says, “I was blown away by so much positivity. I don’t really think I’ve had much positivity about what I do for a long time, so I was overwhelmed.”It feels good to be away from football for the first time in decades – Gu, she says with a laugh, knows nothing about the game. “If anyone’s going to get confidence out of me, it’s Carlos. Because he’s unapologetically himself, I feel like I can be.” Other people have noticed: one of her former coaches, watching her on the show, told her she was seeing the spark in Carney that she remembers seeing in her when she was a kid playing football. No pressure, just joy, doing everything she had ever dreamed of.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The fifth and last season arrives almost three-and-a-half years after a fourth run that felt like a finale, not least because it seemed the kids had grown up. Having originally aped beloved 1980s films where stubbornly brave children avert apocalypse, the franchise now starred young adults and had adjusted plotlines and dialogue accordingly. Life lessons had been learned. Selves had been found. Adolescent anxieties – as personified by Vecna, the narky telekinetic tree-man who rules a parallel dimension adjacent to the humdrum town of Hawkins, Indiana – had been put aside.But Stranger Things now belatedly returns, with the cast all visibly in their 20s. This is a problem. The whole point is that it’s fun to watch kids outrun monsters by pedalling faster on their BMX bikes, or ignoring their mum calling them to dinner because they’re in the basement with their school pals, drawing up plans to bamboozle the US military using pencils, bubblegum and Dungeons & Dragons figurines. If everyone looks old enough to have a studio apartment and a stocks portfolio, none of the above really flies.View image in fullscreenEveryone now looks old enough to have a studio apartment and a stocks portfolio … Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas and Sadie Sink as Max in Stranger Things season five.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/PAThe four new episodes – three more are coming for Christmas, with a further, definitely final one at New Year – get around this by shrinking the Stranger Things world. We don’t leave Hawkins, unless it’s to visit nightmare mirror town the Upside Down, or the mind-palace realm made of memories that Vecna takes his victims to if he really wants to mess with them. Even Hawkins as a location hardly exists: parents, teachers and the general populace no longer appear unless entirely necessary. There’s just the sinister government research facility (now heavily guarded by soldiers) where all the trouble started, and the main group of characters, scheming to break into the Upside Down and defeat Vecna for good – a quest that has obliterated all other concerns.View image in fullscreenA solidly thrilling spectacle … David Harbour as Hopper and Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in Stranger Things season five.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/PAOur friends have become ageless, their core characteristics trapped in amber. Gadgetty herbert Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), fast-talking free spirit Robin (Maya Hawke), intense psychic warrior Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and determined nerd Mike (Finn Wolfhard) all continue to do their thing. Pals such as Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), who have never really found their thing, are still welcomed along for the ride, as are the token adults in the group, Joyce and Hop (Winona Ryder and David Harbour).‘It’s time for it to end’: the stars of Stranger Things open up about their final, epic seasonRead moreWith each of the four episodes running on from the previous one, we have a five-hour action-comedy-horror movie, where each part of the story is luxuriously stretched. Episode one is all set up; episode four is a solidly thrilling 90 minutes of flame-throwing, bullet-dodging spectacle that makes good use of what looks like a virtually limitless effects budget, and which culminates in a moment that will have fans standing on their chairs and hollering joyfully.Along the way, the gang set traps, crawl through tunnels, recruit spies and fiddle with radios, encouraging and arguing with each other as they improvise their way out of every impossible situation just as they always have. This year’s reference points, in lighting, composition or plot, include The Exorcist, Home Alone, Back to the Future, Little Red Riding Hood, The Great Escape, Jurassic Park and the cult 1985 French-Canadian animated movie The Peanut Butter Solution – but the overriding influence is Stranger Things itself. It has successfully patchworked its own unique genre vibe, a formula that can be profitably re-run, at least once more.View image in fullscreenWorth indulging it one last time … Noah Schnapp as Will.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/PAAnd, crucially, character development is not totally absent. Much of the action is driven by budding investigative journalist Nancy (Natalia Dyer), who is prompted to find her inner fire when an older man pats her on the shoulder, calls her “sweetheart” and tells her not to worry about difficult adult things. Then there’s the long-awaited blossoming of Will (Noah Schnapp), who was Vecna’s first victim in season one, episode one. As it succumbs to the instinct to end by returning to the beginning, Stranger Things opens season five by revisiting that moment, then works to turn Will, who for ages has been a frustratingly pale, baleful presence defined by his trauma, into the most important member of the ensemble.Will is secretly gay, which could be just another coming-of-age tribulation, but writers/directors the Duffer Brothers have always treated their creations with more thought and sensitivity than you might expect a billion-dollar retro fantasy thriller to allow. Now, in Will, they find not just one more journey of self-discovery to embark on, but the show’s most moving one of all. Stranger Things definitely needs to switch off its boombox, hang up its catapults and admit it’s too old for these capers, but it’s worth indulging it one last time.Stranger Things season five is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsStranger ThingsTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

A wild season finale loomsZach VasquezThu 27 Nov 2025 07.31 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 07.49 ESTShareTonight’sSouth Parkis something of a breather in what has been their most story-driven season (or seasons, as it turned out) ever. There is some advancement to the overriding plot of Donald Trump attempting to kill the unborn baby he’s expecting with his lover, Satan, before it can unleash the prophesied apocalypse – a plot that involves master manipulator (and new Trump sex partner) JD Vance and billionaire/self-proclaimed antichrist expert Peter Thiel (recently incarcerated by South Park’s finest for kidnapping Eric Cartman). But tonight’s instalment, Turkey Trot, focuses more on the goings-on in the titular town than in Washington DC.As Thanksgiving approaches, South Park finds its annual holiday marathon in jeopardy. None of its regular sponsors – Stan Marsh’s Tegridy Weed Farms, recently shuttered, and City Asian Popup Store, beset by high tariffs – can afford to pay for it. Desperate for a solution, the town reaches out to the one entity that has plenty of money to spend in America: the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.The Saudis are only too happy to sponsor the foot race, going as far as to offer a $5k prize to the team of the first-place runner. Their one caveat: “Disparaging remarks towards the Saudi royal family are strictly prohibited.”Everyone in South Park is desperate to win the prize money, but none more so than Cartman, who is convinced he can lead his team to victory using “race science”. An obvious double entendre, his plan is simply to get the one African American boy in their class, Tolkien Black, to join the team, convinced that “[his] race always wins races”. But Cartman’s plan goes to pot when Tolkien quits in protest after learning of the Saudis’ involvement. Much of the remainder of this plotline involves Cartman referencingthe hugely criticised Riyadh comedy festivalheld in Saudi Arabia as he tries to persuade Tolkien that it’s a good idea to let Saudi Arabia spend money on American sporting events. Otherwise they would just “go back to what they were doing … hacking up reporters and inviting Pete Davidson to come do comedy”.View image in fullscreen‘Hacking up reporters and inviting Pete Davidson to come do comedy’ … Eric Cartman gives Tolkien his South Park verdict on the Saudis.Photograph: Comedy CentralThis is far from South Park’s most transgressive takedown of a powerful and dangerous force, with none of the Saudi royal family or government coming in for any personal sendups. That’s more than can be said for members of the American regime, as the episode’s other storyline focuses on idiotic defence secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempts to spring Thiel from his fictional lockup. Hegseth acts like a macho commando, but he’s too concerned with posting content on social media – including videos of him pitifully attempting to do chin-ups, as seen in the real-life video he appeared in alongside the health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr – to carry out his mission.(Trump, in the one scene he appears in tonight, chides Hegseth: “Don’t just make a bunch of content. Like, actually go and do something!”)Oh my God, they riled Donny! The 15 biggest South Park scandals … rankedRead moreHegseth is outmatched at every turn by the town’s usually buffoonish Det Harris, who has zero patience for his douchebag antics (Hegseth gets his own theme song all about being a douchebag, set to the tune of Kenny Loggins’s Danger Zone) and continually kicks him in the ass. Humiliated, Hegseth assembles his forces in the town square and, with the unwanted help of Kristi Noem’s ICE agents, wages war on the Turkey Trot, shooting the runners with teargas and rappelling down on them from Black Hawk helicopters. This assault ends up earning Cartman and Tolkien, who have found themselves in the middle of the fracas, the victory and grand prize, but Hegseth is unable to carry out his own mission. Harris, having had all he can stomach of Hegseth, kicks his butt into the same prison cell as Thiel. The episode ends with Hegseth angrily proclaiming: “South Park is gonna pay for this! They’re all gonna pay!”Initially, this season of South Park was expected to run for 10 episodes. While the decision to split the season in two changed the length of each, the forthcoming episode, set to air on 10 December, is expected to serve as the big finale. The pieces are certainly in place for an epic showdown, with the forces of darkness – both Trump and the antichrist – set to descend upon the town.There’s no point in trying to predict how things will end, or even if they’ll end at all, as series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker may choose to keep Trump and his cronies a central focus of next season and beyond, having inkedtheir new deal with Paramountearlier this year for 50 new episodes. But given how newsworthy this run of South Park has proven, with record high ratings and more national attention than they’ve seen in years, you can bet it’ll be plenty wild and likely very, very offensive.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkAnimation on TVTelevisionUS televisionTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, having been forgotten for years, its warm-hearted charms are being discovered by a new generationKathryn BromwichThu 27 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 16.20 ESTShareAblond waitress called Shelly is giving a long, strange monologue about an egg sandwich called One Eyed Jack. She works in a diner in the woods in the Pacific north-west, in a town populated by a host of quirky characters: sensitive young men in leather jackets; strong-and-silent types with hearts of gold; and wise, aphoristic members of the local Indigenous community. An intellectual big-city outsider is transplanted into the scene, resulting in various fish-out-of-water encounters and misunderstandings; a will-they-won’t-they flirtation with a glamorous local brunette ensues.Two separate TV shows, both wildly successful in their own ways, fit the above description. Both debuted in 1990, and both were shot about the same time in the mountainous area near Seattle, Washington. One, of course, was Twin Peaks, David Lynch’s era-defining cult series that ran for two series, followed by a 1992 feature film and 2017’s magisterialTwin Peaks: The Return. The other show was Northern Exposure, which ran for six seasons until 1995, making stars of its two leads, Rob Morrow, who starred as sardonic Brooklyn doctor Joel Fleischman, furious at having been stationed in rural Alaska, and Janine Turner, the feisty, independent small-plane pilot Maggie O’Connell, whose boyfriends keep dying in tragic accidents.Originally meant to be a short-term summer series, the show became a word-of-mouth hit thanks to its witty writing, benevolent-but-not-saccharine tone, and the sparky Hepburn-and-Tracy rapport between Fleischman and O’Connell (as they exclusively referred to one another). After two short series, the show was renewed by CBS for an unprecedented 50 episodes, launching a trend for the pixie haircuts popularised by Turner’s character. “When I went back home to Texas everyone started following me around,” recalls Turner, over video call from her ranch, talking a mile a minute and exuding enthusiasm. “Because there were only three stations at the time, it was a collective American experience. Everything now is incredibly diluted, but back then everybody was watching it on Monday night. It became water-cooler talk.”One minute I’m speaking Russian, the next I’m Amelia Earhart, the next I’m a prehistoric humanoid. It was  very creativeIt is easy to see why the show was so popular: it is inventive and warm-hearted, with trippy dream sequences and flashbacks taking episodes in unexpected directions. There are moments of fourth-wall breaking that give it an element of self-awareness unusual for its time. “Every script was like a short story,” Turner says. “That’s why we as actors had so much fun. One minute I’m speaking Russian, the next minute I’m Amelia Earhart, the next I’m a prehistoric humanoid. It was really fun, very creative.” The show wasn’t afraid to stray into intellectualism, with frequent references to Walt Whitman, Russian literature and Buddhist philosophy, and memorable appearances by Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud and Franz Kafka.At the height of the show’s fame, fan Joni Mitchell told the creatorsshe was convincedthat the character Shelly’s backstory was based on her own; at one point, she contacted the producers tosuggest a guest appearancein which she had quit showbusiness and ended up in the fictional town of Cicely, where the show was set. An episode containing the phrase “Bon hiver” (“Good winter” in French)inspired Justin Vernon’s band name, Bon Iver, after he worked through a DVD of the show while sick with mononucleosis. “I’m not going to say we are responsible for the music,” says Morrow, usually based in Los Angeles but speaking from the Hamptons, wearing a bright yellow Kubrick T-shirt. “But that’s a cool thing, to know that it influenced him.” The show’s footprints can be found in much of the popular culture that followed: the loquaciousness of Gilmore Girls; the sharp but sweet depiction of a small-town community in Schitt’s Creek; the cinematic landscapes of shows such as Severance. Across its run, the show received seven Emmy awards and two Golden Globes. Regina King, Jack Black and Peter Bogdanovich appeared as guest stars.View image in fullscreenNo ifs no butts … Morrow’s character Fleischman meets a moose.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyAnd yet, for much of the world – especially younger viewers – it remains unfamiliar. For decades, the show was available only on DVD in difficult-to-find formats, languishing on the shelf largely due to music-rights issues. Several reboots were discussed, but went nowhere. After extensive discussions with Universal Studios, Turner managed to persuade them to make Northern Exposure available to stream in 2024. All six series are now on Prime Video, which has introduced the show to new viewers all around the world. “A lot of people who had watched it in the 90s are watching it with their kids,” says Morrow. “That’s such a fascinating phenomenon: the idea of a show sticking around for so long it becomes something you pass on to the next generation.”Inspired by the renewed interest, Turner and Morrow started a podcast,Northern Disclosure, launched in May this year, in which they rewatch and commentate on episodes one at a time. So far, guests have included the show’s co-creator Joshua Brand and cast members Elaine Miles and John Corbett (perhaps better known as Aidan from Sex and the City), with the latter telling a funny story about a moose head. They are hoping Joni Mitchell and Justin Vernon will agree to be guests on later episodes.It was paramount that, if we were going to place this town in that area, that Native Americans would be a great part of itIn many ways, Northern Exposure was ahead of its time. Cicely and Roslyn, the founders of the town, were a lesbian couple; in season five, the show featured one of the firstgay weddings on television, which some CBS affiliates refused to air. In another standout episode titled Aurora Borealis, Corbett’s character, ex-con DJ Chris Stevens, turns out to have a long-lost half-brother who is African American; throughout, the depiction of Native American characters is nuanced and celebratory, informed by consultants and cast members such as Miles, who is Native American. “It was paramount that, if we were going to place this fictional town in that area, that Native Americans would be a great part of it,” says Turner. “And it was wonderful. It brought a richness of culture, a richness of American history.” (Turner is now working on a musical about Belva Lockwood, who in 1906 successfully represented the Cherokee Nation v the United States in the supreme court.)“I’m proud of the fact the show dealt with these things,” adds Morrow. “It didn’t do it in a didactic way. It did it in a way that explored the spectrum of humanity.”Inevitably, some elements have aged better than others (Shelly is worryingly young given her relationship history with certain members of the community). But overall, the show made a strong case for acceptance, forgiveness and peaceful coexistence. “It shows how we can come together despite our differences,” says Morrow. “Joel is ironically a Republican; I’m a Democrat. Janine is a Republican, playing a Democrat. So our political values are very different. But everyone seems to find acceptance and still get along. The community of the people on the show was really what it was about, everyone making decisions together.”Best podcasts of the week: Tom Rosenthal chats to strangers on a benchRead moreNow 63 and 62, respectively, Morrow and Turner look back on Northern Exposure with great fondness; with 110 episodes to work through on the podcast, they’re in it for the long run. The show launched their careers: Morrow went on to work with Robert Redford on Quiz Show and hosted Saturday Night Live, while Turner worked withRobert Altman, Sylvester Stallone andAnthony Hopkins. Both have worked extensively in TV and directed short films; in 2000, Morrow directed a feature film, Maze. But mostly, they are proud that Northern Exposure has stood the test of time. “What’s moving to me is how deeply the show affected people,” says Morrow. “I can’t tell you how many people have told me it saved their life. That they were in a hospital or their mother was dying and they didn’t know how they were gonna get through it; that they decided to move somewhere because of the show, or that they became a doctor because of Joel Fleischman.”You wait ages for a charming, offbeat show about small-town America that will still be talked about in glowing terms decades later, and two come along at once. How did the similarities to Twin Peaks come about? “I think because we were shooting in the same area, and the shows came on the air at the same time, there was probably a media-born competition,” says Morrow. “But the interesting thing is that Twin Peaks might be a more complicated, interesting show, more sophisticated. But Northern Exposure is the one that won the day. Twin Peaks only lasted two seasons. Northern lasted six.”Not that it’s a competition. “David Lynch was such a master artist,” Morrow adds. “Any comparisons – I’ll take them.”Northern Exposure isstreamingon Prime Video.

The group was founded in 1975, and this pairing of perhaps the two greatest violin concertos in the repertory is being released to mark the ACO’s 50th birthday. The soloist and conductor in both works isRichard Tognetti, who has been the orchestra’s leader and artistic director for the past 35 years.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Both recordings are taken from concerts given in Sydney’s City Recital Hall, theBeethovenconcerto in 2018, the Brahms last February. The close recorded sound very faithfully reproduces the intensely involving approach of the ACO when heard in the flesh, with its amalgam of modern playing techniques with the use of historical instruments (gut strings, period wind). For both concertos the orchestra’s permanent core of 20 players was more than doubled with guest instrumentalists from other Australian orchestras, but the suppleness and coherence of its textures are as persuasive as ever.View image in fullscreenYet Tognetti’s approach may not persuade everyone. In the Beethoven especially, he favours urgency over lyricism, though that does not prevent his 27-minute account of the first movement of the Beethoven being one of the most expansive on record. In part that’s because of the choice of cadenzas, which Tognetti describes as “a synthesis” of those composed for the concerto by Vieuxtemps (which bring back the timpani with which the concerto opens), Auer and Kreisler among others.For theBrahms, Tognetti incorporates elements of Busoni’s cadenzas in what is in general a more mainstream account of the work than his Beethoven. It is characterised by outstanding woodwind solos woven around the solo line, while textures always remain light and transparent. Even if these performances do not rival the finest of the myriad other versions on disc, they are thoroughly convincing, and a wonderful souvenir of one of one of the most remarkable partnerships in music today.Listen on Apple Musicor on SpotifyExplore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

When arriving paramedics ask Eitan for his details, he declines to give his real name, instead giving them the name of his work supervisor and nemesis, Douglas Moran. Eitan is a hard-partying consultant rheumatologist who has just returned to work after several months off following a mental health crisis, and who uses liquid cocaine secreted into a nasal inhaler to get through the working day.When Moran dies in unexpected circumstances, Eitan suspects foul play and sets about finding the culprit. Soon he is performing illicit postmortems and impersonating a police detective so he can cross-examine a suspect. But when he tries to blow the whistle, his colleagues and the police decline to take his claims seriously. Eitan may work among medical professionals, but they are not above stigmatising a colleague diagnosed with bipolar disorder and taking his outlandish claims as evidence of his instability.A Particularly Nasty Case is the first murder mystery from Adam Kay, author of the tragicomic This Is Going to Hurt, his bestselling memoir which recounted his early career as a junior doctor. The Lord of the Rings actor Andy Serkis is the narrator, who revels in Kay’s pitch-black humour and energetically inhabits the wild dysfunction of Eitan.

The newspaper then noted that Brian Thompson was “shot in the back in Midtown Manhattan by a killer who then walked coolly away”. The murder in broad daylight was indeed both cold and shocking. But many Americans had a different response: for those who had been denied health insurance or faced exorbitant healthcase costs, the news felt cathartic. Social media blew up. One post read: “All jokes aside… no one here is the judge of who deserves to live or die. That’s the job of the AI algorithm the insurance company designed to maximize profits on your health.”Five days later, Luigi Mangione, a good-looking, 26-year-old University of Pennsylvania graduate with a master’s in computer science, was apprehended at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He awaits trial on federal and state charges of murder, with prosecutors seeking the death penalty. So who is Mangione? And what might have motivated the alleged crime? These are the questions John H Richardson attempts to answer in an investigation that explores broader themes, too.A journalist for Esquire magazine, Richardson spent years researching the groups that lurk in the dark corners of the internet, writing stories about people “cursed with realistic fears about an apocalyptic future”. To uncover “the making” of his subject, Richardson first reviews Mangione’s extensive reading. We learn that “[when] he was arrested, Luigi had a list of 295 books on Goodreads”. Their content ranged from climate change to masculinity, along with a “focus on his own personal growth, both physical and mental”. Additionally, Richardson sifts through his correspondence with influencers and authors as well as his many posts on social media. These primary sources, meant to paint a portrait of Mangione, instead render him an amorphous figure. Richardson tries to justify this by suggesting that “Luigi’s elusiveness, in fact, is what gives him a little of that old trickster magic”. Here, as elsewhere, Richardson attempts to cast his subject in archetypal terms.Mangione is deeply anxious about the world around him, one where ‘everything is accelerating whether we like it or not’As for “the meaning” of the title, Richardson takes as his lead three words – “delay”, “deny” and “depose”, etched on the bullets left behind at the crime scene. These are the terms sometimes used by health insurance companies to reject claims. He looks at the evidence Mangione suffered from a chronic back condition, which might have provided motive for an attack, but finds no proof; instead, what meaning there is seems to rest in Mangione’s existential anxiety about the world around him, one where “everything is accelerating whether we like it or not, sliding faster and faster to the edge”; a world where the consensus seems to be that AI is going to eventually either take control, or destroy us, or both.Conspicuous by their absence from the book are interviews with the principal actors. Richardson asked, of course, but never expected time with Mangione himself. And his family made it clear that they had chosen not to talk to the press in advance of the trial. Another flashing-yellow omission is any significant information about the victim, Thompson, though we learn that under his leadership, from 2021 to 2023, UHC profits increased by 33%.By book’s end, the reader has no clear understanding of Mangione’s personality or what might have motivated his alleged crimes. Worse still, Richardson’s obvious sympathy for him gives the reader the uncomfortable impression of having been privy to a veiled endorsement of an assassination. In the book’s final lines, Richardson delivers his fairytale assessment: “We’ve entered a time of fables, the mad king, the monster in the maze and the emperor without clothes.” In that fable “Robin Hoods come with a beautiful promise … They arrive in times of social turmoil, when the people are suffering and nothing makes sense anymore.”One thing is certain: as Mangione’s defence team continues in its attempts to have charges that could lead to the death penalty dismissed, any mention of fables, Robin Hoods, heroes or monsters will not be admissible as evidence in defence of this handsome young man with a “jawline … and lips … out of a Caravaggio painting” soon to be on trial for murder.Luigi: The Making and the Meaning by John H Richardson is published by Simon & Schuster (£20).

I am generally sceptical about books that use child narrators to add poignancy to dark plots, or novels that use nazism as a means of introducing moral jeopardy to their characters’ journeys. And yet by the end Jolly had won me over. This is a book that walks a tightrope between sentimentality and honesty, between realism and imagination, and creates something spirited and memorable as it does so.We meet our fierce narrator, Adelheid Brunner, when she is brought into a children’s hospital by her grandmother, who cannot cope with the little girl’s fixations. Adelheid is obsessed with the matchboxes of the title, which she is constantly studying, ordering and occasionally discarding. In the hospital, she finds that she and her fellow child inmates are the object of obsessive study in turn by their doctors – sometimes understood, sometimes valued, and then, tragically, sometimes discarded.Adelheid sees how certain disabilities spark particular interest from one of the key doctors, Dr A, who is intrigued by the children he calls his “little professors”. This, we come to understand, is Dr Hans Asperger, whose research in the Vienna children’s hospital in the 1930s laid the groundwork for the understanding of autism.Adelheid works out how she needs to present herself in order to thrive in this milieu: to show that she is valuable and not to be discarded. “One can put on the coat of a Life,” she realises, “and perhaps change for another garment when the need arises.” She is able to leave the hospital for a time, and watch the rise of nazism from her position as a waitress in her grandmother’s crowded cafe, returning as a ward assistant during the dark years of the second world war.While the narrative is pretty impressionistic at times, Jolly is clearly trying to keep to the historical reality of this hospital. This was indeed where staff carefully observed their patients, but it is also where, during the war, decisions were taken to send many of them to another clinic, where they were subjected to medical experiments or murdered.Adelheid’s joy in ordinariness adds up to a great paean to the humanity that the Nazis wanted to destroyI’m no expert on this harsh corner of history, but it had recently sparked my interest after readingNaomi Klein’s book Doppelganger. Klein also explores the way that the Vienna children’s hospital under Asperger became a “key node in the system of sorting who would live and who would be murdered”. Klein dissects Asperger’s shift from care to callousness, from curiosity to murder, in order to ask how we can resist that shift right now. As a novelist, Jolly is less interested in the bigger lessons and more interested in the moment-by-moment anguish and chaos of those times. But there is a synergy between Klein’s work and Jolly’s, both of whom seem to be on a journey to identify what makes us human and what destroys that humanity.Adelheid is not a straightforward guide on that journey. As the novel begins, the Reich’s ostensible love of order appeals to her. When the Germans march into Vienna, she is ready for them: “My flag is already positioned in a vase on the windowsill and I also have a most shiny tin badge.” She recognises its darker side slowly, as its cruel and arbitrary threats – including to her own survival – unfold.Nobody ever hears Adelheid speak, but her inner voice is wild. In fact, her delivery can be so chaotic, with its constant distractions and random capitalisations, that at first I struggled to settle into her point of view. But gradually I warmed to her, and her restless, needling observations. She gives us moments of true jeopardy – hiding from Nazis, running from murder – and stretches of poignant ordinariness. In the end, Adelheid’s joy in this ordinariness adds up to a great paean to the humanity that the Nazis wanted to destroy: “The World vastly varied and luminous and brilliant. Everything separate and known and entirely beautifully brilliantly itself.”At times, Jolly becomes too invested in her own research, so the narration occasionally jumps around, leaving Adelheid’s point of view to cross centuries and continents in order to explore Asperger’s legacy and how his actions are seen by others. That makes the book a little baggy. But in the end, Jolly manages to mould all her fragments together into a distinctive narrative, which brings both the darkness of nazism and the courage of those who tried to resist it very close to the reader.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

That spawned six books, a TV series, a film, comics, stage adaptations – and branded bath towels.Booming business indeed yet it is odd to see the sale of merchandise as part of thisimmersive show(there is one booth selling branded goods within the production and a second in the foyer), as well as a bar at every turn. That commercial opportunism grates. Is this an attempt to take the audience into Adams’s imaginative universe in a new, interactive way – or merely a cash cow?View image in fullscreenDelightful … Andrew Evans with Marvin.Co-created by designer Jason Ardizzone-West and writer Arvind Ethan David, it reverently cross-references across the books and seems to be aiming for its own story, despite the hard sell. This chimes with the spirit of Adams who added new, sometimes contradictory, aspects across the many manifestations of the original tale.But despite a vast set spread across several rooms, the final one opening up to a virtual bonfire of luminous, super-computer effects, there are too many mere nods to Adams’s characters, without flesh around them or the plotlines. This might leave initiates bamboozled too: who are these people, what makes them tick, what is the jeopardy in their world?A promenade show directed by Georgia Clarke-Day, with discrete casts over different time slots, it begins with Arthur (Robert Thompson) typically in his dressing gown and bath towel (at least one member of the audience came dressed the same way). There is no Trillian, the one other – female – human survivor of the first book, but Fenchurch (Kat Johns-Burke) instead, from a later book, whom Arthur meets for a karaoke date in Rickmansworth, along with his friend, Ford Prefect (Oliver Britten).They blast out a couple of well-sung pop classics (What’s Up? by 4 Non Blondes and Gnarls Barkley’s Crazy) and there is a too quick disclosure by Ford that he is an alien in disguise before the Vogons – destroyers of the Earth – descend.The invasion is reported on screens and audio breaking news. We are herded from an initial bar space to another room, representing a rescue spacecraft. Urgency is announced but not felt. Then it’s on to another room, and another aircraft, this time with iconic characters from Adams’s world, including Beeblebrox (Lee V G), Eccentrica Gallumbits (Briony Scarlett) and Slartibartfast (Richard Costello).Scrooge gets a hip-hop spin and the RSC does the BFG: 20 of the best UK stage shows this ChristmasRead moreThe problem is that they pop up as cameos, not nearly rounded enough, although they are fabulously dressed by costume designer Susan Kulkarni (metallic dresses, purple frills and a glittery dressing gown for Arthur in the final scene). The audience is left to wander around the room, initially. When the drama kicks in, it does not do enough, despite the eye-catching optics.Arthur is a flatly diffident, depressed type; Fenchurch is equally flimsy. The Earth’s destruction takes a backseat to romance between them but it is too brief to sweep you in. It is a shame that the arc of the story is so truncated because there are some incredibly strong vocal performances during the song and dance numbers, along with the lavish visuals. But without the story to tether it, these are just floating effects.What is singularly winning is Marvin (the paranoid android), a red-eyed robot puppet who is excellently voiced and manipulated by Andrew Evans. Surly little Marvin is so delightfully entertaining - like ET on a downer – that you want more from him.

With interlocking scenes between two actors at a time, they rotate every few minutes. It’s a useful device for packing variety into a single story, like tossing a big salad of ideas. Though neatly performed by its young cast, this new, modern-day mix by the writer of the incomparableIphigenia in Splottstruggles to add up to more than the sum of its parts.La Ronde caused controversy, deemed immoral and too sexual for the stage. Ring Ring takes a far softer approach. Owen seeks to illuminate the modern anxieties that keep us awake at night: the things we fear to share, to pass on, to tackle by ourselves. We have nervous couples, anxious about whether to become parents. People working dead-end jobs who hope a shag will help them forget their existential dread. Individually, the scenes are quick and full of yearning, a beautiful bluntness to Owen’s dialogue. Collectively, we miss a sense of accumulation or forward momentum.Originally commissioned by theRoyal Welsh College of Music and Drama, and directed by David Bond, the school’s former director of performance, this is the show’s first professional outing. With a hard-working cast of five, it has difficulty shedding its roots as a student show and getting beyond an exercise for the actors to cut their teeth on. This isn’t helped by the self-conscious moments of movement during the scene transitions or the shelves on Alberto Aquilina’s corrugated set, intended as physical reminders of these encounters, that in reality become awkward prop trays for the cast.Petty Men review – understudies plot their own version of Julius CaesarRead moreTiger Tingley does the most to unearth the tenderness of the script, first as a harried worker aggressively flirted with on the street, and later as an exhausted parent desperately wanting to reconnect with his partner. Leisa Gwenllian and Iwan Bond also adapt with ease, leaping between charm and anxiety. There is some fine storytelling inShed theatre’s production, but it serves its audience in glimpses and fragments, rather than as a whole.AtWhite Bear theatre, London, until 6 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreGary OwenreviewsShareReuse this content"

Adapter Theresa Heskins and her co-director, Vicki Dela Amedume, present theirs as an all-ages gig-theatre show. We’re even introduced to each member of a house band nestled among the audience before meeting the main characters.Rhiannon Skerritt plays the title role, here named Coralie, in a production that accentuates how Andersen made her the littlest of several merfolk. The romance isn’t entirely extinguished but the power of siblinghood rises to the surface instead in this telling, which also stresses the suspicion and division between the inhabitants of land and water.Early on, this makes for some upstairs-downstairs comedy as the mermaids tell tales about the world above. But Heskins muddies the waters by showing them to be gleefully cruel and she makes the pearl-diving prince, Caspian (Darcy Braimoh), as guilty of exploitation as the Sea Witch (Harrison Sweeney). A related message about trade feels awkwardly forced, however, as does the show’s ending. It’s also surprising to see the damage to our oceans go unexplored for a young audience.View image in fullscreenIn a spin … Rhiannon Skerritt as Coralie.Photograph: Andrew BillingtonThat was the focus of an eco-fablelast Christmas at Bristol Old Vicwhich conjured the mermaids’ aquatic life through the aerial skills of Holly Downey, a circus director and performer. Downey joins the ensemble here and assists circus choreography by Amedume that befits performers with little wiggle room inside their tailed costumes. Sweeney’s suppleness conveys the witch’s slippery nature in a routine with ropes suggesting how Coralie is ensnared by their deal. The aerial silks blend well with Daniella Beattie’s shimmering projections and performers also use whirlpool-like spiral apparatuses mid-air. Designer Laura Willstead’s stage floor functions as seabed and sand, a maze-like structure is used for the water’s rippling surface (cue golden lighting from Beattie) while Willstead provides glowing rod puppets, too, for iridescent sea creatures.One challenge for adapters is a heroine whom Andersen depicts as reticent then robs of speech. Heskins tweaks the deal with the witch so that it’s Coralie’s “siren song” that is lost rather than her voice. The witch is voiced in darkness by Inês Sampaio (also doubling as a narrator who fades out of view for too long) while the aerial Sweeney remains silent, eerily emphasising the witch’s longing to steal Coralie’s song.When she arrives on land, Coralie is given a mock-Shakespearean parlance while Caspian uses extravagantly slangy dialogue – both are jokes that get old very quickly. But Skerritt appealingly handles the physical comedy and ensures a message of goodwill without coming across as goody-goody.Costume designer Lis Evans gives the band costumes that are funkier than the nevertheless lively and soulful compositions of Arun Ghosh (the lyrics are occasionally drowned out). And when band member Alexander Bean becomes a deus ex machina Poseidon, he does so with a voice as deep as the bottom of the ocean. This is a bubbly production with dark undercurrents but it’s the designs that dazzle.AtNew Vic theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreChristmas showsHans Christian AndersenCircusDanceFairytalesChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then, finally, I started on new music. The “you” in the single are people who feel they have the right to have autonomy over other people’s bodies and make it unsafe for people to be who they want to be. I’m especially talking about queer and mostly trans rights. The song’s like a mantra or chant, a way to empower people in only a few sentences.As a fan of your concert costume design as much as your music, what can we expect from the upcoming tour?KelechicaI was thinking about sustainability and went to a costume sale at the Berlin opera and bought a bunch of opera costumes. I’m working with Charlie Le Mindu, who is transforming them into weird new creations. In the video for Not in Your Mouth, I’m wearing my sister’s leather jacket. It’s just been the fifth anniversary of her passing, and I wanted to keep something of her, so I kept her leather jacket that she wore the crap out of since the 90s. So, in a way, she’ll be in the show.Your album titles –The Teaches ofPeaches, Impeach My Bushand now the forthcomingNo Lube So Rude– are like rallying cries wrapped in provocation. Does the title come first or does that crystallise once the songs have taken shape?VerulamiumParkRangerThe title is always the last thing to come, once I have the big picture. No Lube So Rude is the name of one of the songs, which is about how we can help the friction of the world. We need to smooth it around a little because we have so much irritation and dryness.Is it true that you used to be roommates withFeistin Toronto? What was that like?seoalwatYes – she was making her album Monarch (Lay Your Jewelled Head Down) and I was making The Teaches of Peaches. We lived above a queer sex shop called Come As You Are, where they’d do porn workshops for women, and lectures, but we lived a few floors up so customers never wandered upstairs. Feist and I got along really well and had amazing parties, then we’d go into our rooms and make our albums. Our music was completely different, but we were similar in terms of socialising, and were constantly crushing cockroaches or trapping mice. Our scene in Toronto was very vibrant. Even though we all had different bands, we had a Super 8 film collective and would support each other.Chilly Gonzaleshad a riff-rock band called Freedom; we also had other bands like the Permanent Stains. Feist would be my B-girl in my early Peaches shows. I’m still good friends with her.As a long-term resident of Berlin, do you think it’s losing its edge?meansardineI think the whole world is losing its mind, to be honest, and moving towards crazily dysfunctional gentrification and a wealth gap. Berlin is feeling it like everybody else. Politics and club culture are changing, but I still feel there are pockets of the city that you can cling on to, and we have to keep fighting a good fight and find our place. I moved there 20 years ago because it was cheap and there was lots of space. I felt there was a big creative openness and that what I was doing was more understood there than inCanadaat the time. The politics are complicated now – funding is being cut and such – but it’s still a great place to be creative.View image in fullscreen‘When I went solo I kept the Shit attitude’ … Peaches on stage in London in 2015.Photograph: Jim Dyson/RedfernsWere you really in a band called the Shit?Topcat89I was – with Chilly Gonzales, Mocky [Dominic Salole], who produced some Feist albums, and another member, Sticky [Henderson]. In about 1996, the four of us got together in a basement. We’d smoke a lot of weed and yell whatever we wanted to about what we felt about each other sexually or how we were feeling. It was very impulsive and improvisational. After our first jam, we changed instruments, which was the first time I ever played drums or bass, and I fell in love with keyboards. We just said, “Oh my God, we are the shit!” so named ourselves that. Our live album never came out, but [we] did put out a cassette tape, which had an early version of [Peaches’ 2003 song] Operate. It was actually a very important period for me – when I went solo I kept the Shit attitude.Fatherfuckeris still my go-to karaoke song, much to my daughter’s discomfort, but I feel like our generation of riot queer artists were louder, angrier and more demanding. Is it different working creatively and politically in 2025 v 2005?SUSE____I think it feels important to realise that there’s a younger generation that listen to me, but there’s also an older generation that are not going to stay home and sleep. That’s a wild shift: the older generation is still feeling that punk energy, but the world is a more pressurised place compared to 20 years ago. That’s why I don’t want to water things down, so I give it like I give it, but with the punch of 2025.What do you do in your downtime? Any mountaineering, birdwatching or collecting antiques?mattsketchI drink wine, sleep … I don’t really have much extracurricular stuff because I have so much going on all the time, but I do like a game of ping-pong. I think I’m pretty good, but I just love the sound of the ball and it’s so good for the brain and coordination. There’s a 2012 movie calledPing Pong: Never Too Old for Gold, about older people who play table tennis. One of them was 100 years old, which is so inspiring. I hope I’m playing ping-pong when I’m 100.View image in fullscreen‘The older generation are still feeling that punk energy, but the world is a more pressurised place’ … Peaches.Photograph: The Squirt DeluxeHave you got any more plans to collaborate withChristeene?DrMagicChristeene [AKA “drag terrorist” Paul Soileau] is like a sister, and we’re always talking about collaborations, although there’s nothing concrete. In 2019, when Christeene started the project to honour Sinéad O’Connor, I sang Troy. It’s such a powerful song and I can really belt it out. Sinéad’s first album influenced me a lot as I was going from folk music to understanding dance music, and she had all that. Also, she had a hit song, Mandinka, about genital mutilation, and sang it at the Grammys in a bra top with [the] Public Enemy [logo] etched on her head because they’d been boycotted by the Recording Academy. Just incredible. She also had her baby’s bib in her back pocket, because her record label told her if she had a baby she would never make it. Just a brilliant artist.‘The epitome of amazingness’: how electroclash brought glamour, filth and fun back to 00s musicRead moreIn 2009,the Flaming LipscoveredPink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moonalbum and you guested onThe Great Gig in the Sky.

I ended up being the backup singer for the whole show, which was really fun. Otherwise, I sing the entirety of Jesus Christ Superstar as a one-person show, with a piano player. I do that live, but I would like to record it – use my voice in a different way.The world mostly knows you as a sexually charged rapper and “shock” performance artist, butdo you have any music outside the concept of Peaches sitting on a shelf somewhere?clevergunsI don’t, actually, but it needs to happen.

She also worked in radio and television, including on Torchy the Battery Boy for the BBC Light Service. On stage, a highlight was The Dame of Sark with Celia Johnson at the Wyndham theatre (1974).Jill Freud, Love Actually actor and inspiration for Lucy in Narnia books, dies aged 98Read moreShe was a highly active MP’s wife, married to the Liberal politician Clement Freud, and the mother of five children, but it was not until later life that she truly flourished creatively. In 1980, in her 60s, she founded Jill Freud & Company, producing seasons of summer repertory in Southwold and Aldeburgh for three decades.The company brought high-quality theatre to coastalSuffolk, produced hundreds of plays, toured abroad, and became a cherished local institution. Actors she hired returned year after year, drawn by Jill’s fairness, wit and unwavering belief in the rights of the company members, and the importance of regional theatre. Her legacy continues each summer in the playhouses she brought to life.Born June Flewett in Barnes, south-west London, the daughter of Winifred (nee Johnson) and Henry Flewett, a classics teacher at St Paul’s school, she went to the Sacred Heart convent school, Hammersmith. At the start of the second world war she was evacuated to Oxford, where she was billeted with a succession of homeowners, before, aged 15, she was sent to a house owned by an academic known as Jack. At first, she had no idea that he was actually her favourite writer, CS Lewis. She became a beloved member of the household for three years, and later discovered that Lewis had acknowledged her as the inspiration for Lucy Pevensie in his classic children’s series The Chronicles of Narnia. Jill carried that same sense of Lucy’s curiosity, courage and clear-sighted kindness throughout her life.View image in fullscreenJill Freud, right, in her cameo role in the 2003 film Love Actually, alongside, from left, Hugh Grant, Nina Sosanya and Martine McCutcheonAfter the war she won her place at Rada, where she was a contemporary of the young Roger Moore; her time there was graciously funded by Lewis. In 1950 she married Clement, a writer, broadcaster, chef and, from 1973, an MP. Together they raised their children in an energetic, unconventional household that often blurred the boundaries between domestic life, politics and the arts.Jill was known for her warmth, her keen intelligence and her wicked sense of humour. She was widowed in 2009, but remained sharp, engaged and eccentric, claiming the secret to her vitality was having the same lunch every day – a glass of red wine, a packet of crisps and the Guardian. She was 95 when she recorded her final radio play, and her last film role was a cameo as the housekeeper at Downing Street in the 2003 film Love Actually.In 2001 she received an honorary doctorate from the University of East Anglia for services to theatre.Jill is survived by her five children, Nicola, Ashley, Dominic, Matthew and me, 18 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.Explore more on these topicsTheatreOther livesActingSuffolkobituariesShareReuse this content"

And as the devastating end neared, then the initial grief of losing her daughter, Rice mostly coped by huddling over her typewriter, crafting what became her first novel: the enduring classic Interview With the Vampire.“I knew that writing was the only thing I could do, and when I wrote it was like fighting the darkness, pushing all the absurdity and horror away,” Rice later said of her novel about vampires fighting the complications of immortality, including a five-year-old girl inspired by Mouse.When Rice was done, the first read went to her husband, Mouse’s father, the poet Stan Rice. Stan Rice once recounted how he read it in “approximately one sitting” and upon finishing it told himself: “Our life will never be the same.”“And,” he said, “it never was.”Indeed it was not. The bestselling book, released in 1976, inspireda moviestarring Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and a young Kirsten Dunst, and more recentlya Netflix series. It spurred sequels including Queen of the Damned and aBroadway musicalscored by Elton John. It gained Rice international fame, a huge following and a fortune, the most visible reminder of which was one of the most recognizable mansions in her home town New Orleans: the old St Elizabeth’s orphanage.View image in fullscreenBrad Pitt and Tom Cruise in Interview with the Vampire.Photograph: BFA/AlamyNow, atAnneRice.com, that story and myriad other related ones are being retold in an anthology of documentaries being made available for streaming for free starting Thursday.Anne Rice: An All Saints’ Day Celebration was helmed by her son, the author Christopher Rice, and his business partner and her close friend Eric Shaw Quinn. It contains archival footage, privately held photographs and new interviews, paying tribute to the literary titan whodiedat 80 toward the end of 2021 following a stroke. And it chronicles a live event in New Orleans at the beginning of November that celebrated Rice’s legacy.Part of the documentary anthology, previewed by the Guardian, not only honors the role that the big sister Christopher Rice never met played in their mother’s career. It also explores the influence Rice had on authors who came after her, including the fantasy and romance novelistJennifer Armentrout, who says on screen: “Many of us would not have the careers that we have now without her.”And it unpacks the feeling of acceptance engendered through some of the characters she created in the early years of the LGBTQ+ civil rights movement, especially Lestat de Lioncourt and Louis de Pointe du Lac. In Rice’s debut as an author, that pair fashioned a family of sorts with their fellow vampire, the kindergarten-aged Claudia.“When I was a kid reading Interview With the Vampire, I was a gay kid,” Rob Roth, the director of the Elton John-backed stage play Lestat, says in the anthology. “And the love between Lestat and Louis, just reading about it … made me feel better – like not so alone.”View image in fullscreenA musical tribute at the Anne Rice: An All Saints’ Day celebration live event in New Orleans.Photograph: Frank L Aymami IIIQuinn, a novelist himself, says in the film that he encountered Interview while “going through one of the worst times in my life”.“And it was like Anne reached out to me and said, ‘You are OK – exactly the way you are,’” Quinn remarks. “And you don’t have to apologize to anyone for it.”The approach vaulted her to rarefied air. For instance, one of the anthology’s clips sees Rosie O’Donnell introducing Rice as a guest on her talkshow – and describing how the host, arguably at the peak of her career, waited five hours outside a bookstore for the author.Christopher Rice, speaking with the Guardian recently, shared another anecdote he had otherwise guarded about the kinds of celebrities who would seek her out. Ozzy Osbourne left his mother backstage passes once when he was performing inNew Orleans, but she didn’t attend, primarily preferring to spend her evenings – as her son put it – “in a Laura Ashley sundress eating crackers and cheese”.Her absence from the performance so crushed Osbourne that when Christopher Rice and a friend tried to use the passes, the former Black Sabbath frontman refused them entry. “They wanted to meet Anne – that was that,” Christopher Rice said, laughing nostalgically.View image in fullscreenChristopher Rice delivers a final remembrance at the Anne Rice: An All Saints’ Day celebration live event in New Orleans at the beginning of November 2025.Photograph: Frank L Aymami IIIChristopher Rice and Quinn said they also made it a point for viewers of their documentary anthology to hear from those who got a look behind the curtain of Anne’s public persona. One of the staples of that persona were coffins – to either arrive at book signings in or display in her imposing home at the north-east corner of Napoleon Avenue and Prytania Street in New Orleans.One of the more humorous voices in Anne Rice: An All Saints’ Day Celebration is that of Amy Troxler, a religion schoolteacher in New Orleans who also worked as a part-time assistant to the author – and addresses those coffins in a distinctive local accent.“There was a coffin in the living room, and I thought, ‘What is that coffin?’” a clearly befuddled Troxler says in one of the anthology’s documentaries. “‘What kind of people put coffins in their living room?’ It was a pretty coffin, though, I must say.”If Christopher Rice and Quinn have their way, the anthology won’t be the final word on Anne. Her son said he and Quinn had been “reviewing the archive of Anne’s work, both published and unpublished, with an eye towards future publications and productions across many platforms.“Stay tuned.”Explore more on these topicsAnne RiceNew OrleansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was also reassuring to learn that in an area swept by forest fires in September, species such as strawberry trees (which are fire-resistant thanks to their low resin content) were beginning to bounce back – alongside highly flammable eucalyptus, which hinders other fire-retardant trees such as oak. Volunteers were being recruited to help with rewilding.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Visitor numbers to the Algarve are growing, with 2024 showing an increase of 2.6% on the previous year – but most arrivals head straight for the beach, despite there being so much more to explore. The shoreline is certainly wild and dramatic but the region is also keen to highlight the appeal of its inland areas. With the development of year-round hiking and cycling trails, plus the introduction of nature festivals, attention is being drawn to these equally compelling landscapes, featuring mountains and dense woodlands. TheAlgarve Walking Season(AWS) runs a series of five walking festivals with loose themes such as “water” and “archaeology” between November and April. It’s hoped they will inspire visitors year round, boosting the local economy and helping stem the tide of younger generations leaving in search of work.View image in fullscreenStretching it out at Walk & Art Fest.Photograph: Carlos Afonso/Sarah RodriguesOur visit to the national forest coincided with a weekend festival with the theme of “art”, focused on the white-washed village north-west of Barão de São João. As well as guided hikes, departing from the cultural centre, free events ranged from learning how to make natural coloured inks, to theatre workshops, tai chi and sketching. There were two photography exhibitions running plus several other child-friendly activities, such as leaf safaris and making bird-feeders.Even before our drop-in afternoon screen-printing session at the cultural centre our walk into the forest with Joana had the feeling of an art trail. Marked at the start by standing stones painted with images of traditional agricultural folk, it was studded en route with smaller, permanently placed stones depicting examples of wildlife, including hedgehogs and lynxes – the latter’s population reviving, thanks to a rehabilitation centre based in the castle town of Silves.View image in fullscreenHikers on the Via Algarviana.Photograph: Stephen Taylor/AlamyAs the trail wound up to its highest point, themenhir(standing stone) on thePedra do Galotrail, it became more densely vegetated and a lingering hint of ash gave way to the resinous scent of pine. There was a ripeness to the air and solid, amber-hued bubbles bulged from bark. Limestone glistened underfoot and tiny frogs sat by pond edges, throats pulsing. In the distance, wind turbines cartwheeled against the sky.Francisco Simões, our guide the following day, was again keen to point out these inland areas can be explored year-round. Waymarked hikes, established in recent years, are offshoots of theVia Algarviana, a route that stretches from the border with Spain for 186 miles, all the way to the Atlantic, and many are now linked to an app that makes navigation even easier.View image in fullscreenAt the tile painting workshop.Photograph: Sarah RodriguesFrancisco established ecotourism outfitAlgarvian Rootsin 2020 and offers experiences from birdwatching to full-day guided hikes, all with the same aims as the AWS: to promote the region by way of immersion, education and cultural awareness. The art connection is here, too – his mother, ceramicist Margarida Palma Gomes, had taught us to paintazulejos, the distinctive blue and white glazed tiles seen throughout the country, two days earlier on a festival workshop. Visits to her studio, as well as to a local potter, can also be arranged through Algarvian Roots.Francisco urged us to do our bit for the industry by drinking generous quantities of good wine sealed with corkAfter an excellent lunch of pork cheek and cabbage inA Charrettein Monchique, a pretty mountain town flanked by the Algarve’s two highest peaks, the 902-metre Fóia and 774-metre Picota, Francisco led us down steeply cobbled streets and into a side lane, where an older couple sunned themselves at the front of their home. A steep path took us into the woods, the ground strewn with acorns. Here, Francisco was eager to show us cork trees, Portugal’s national tree and legally protected since the 13th century. Not only are they naturally fire-resistant, but their pliable bark is a source of income for locals, who harvest it to sell to other industries, particularly wine making and construction. Each tree is marked with a number, denoting when it was last stripped, ensuring that the tree’s nine-year regenerative cycle is observed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We agreed, not very grudgingly, to do our best.View image in fullscreenA pastel-pretty street in Monchique.Photograph: Nick Maslen/AlamyEarlier in the day, Francisco had shown us a wall covered in meticulously detailedazulejosdepicting elements of traditional local life. One of these showedmagusto,the annual festival where chestnuts are roasted on fires and shared by the community each November. This was perfect timing as, walking back into Monchique, strains of tinny, discordant music reached our ears, and a smell of smoke hung in the air. On arrival we were swept up by a multi-generational crowd, armed with cups of wine and thimblefuls of chestnut liqueur, as the nuts were roasted on glowing coals. Everyone swarmed around the firepits, brown paper bags in hand, and scooped their fill. Faces were wreathed with smiles and children shrieked excitedly; the music we’d winced at a few minutes earlier now had us dancing.It was a joyful, authentic celebration of local life and culture. A reminder of the rewards awaiting those who leave the coast behind and head inland – regardless of the season.The trip was provided byVisit Algarve.

I cannot be the only person who’s ever been shocked back into consciousness at my desk by a message from a friend asking, “What time do you want us later?” Fear not; whether you’re absent minded, or just prone to last-minute invitations, I have your back.Firstly, and I cannot stress this enough, whether you’ve been planning for a year or 15 minutes, the best parties are the simplest. All anyone is hoping for is a good chat, something to drink, and enough to eat that they don’t feel like gnawing an arm off on the bus home. Unless you’re Jay Gatsby, no one expects a full bar, Michelin-starred catering or a live band.That said, a theme is helpful for disguising the fact you’ve just thrown this thing together on the way home from work … And by theme, I mean something like, for instance,Christmas. Getting slightly more specific (Scandinavian Christmas, say, with glögg, spiced punch, smoked fish and rye crackers, Nordic beats playlist; or Mexican Christmas, with ponche navideño, cold beers or margaritas, and heaps of tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole, and Luis Miguel on the stereo) will focus your options on the inevitable supermarket sweep.The best parties are the simplest. That said, a theme helps to disguise the fact you’ve just thrown this thing togetherAt the shops, choose a drink or two (one alcoholic if you drink, one not in case others don’t want to) and a couple of nibbles that fit the theme, and buy as much of them as you can afford, rather than worrying about giving people too much choice. Nothing looks as generous and as festive as abundance – I would always prefer to be welcomed by a sink full of cold bottles of competitively priced crémant or cava than a single glass of swanky champagne. (Chuck in a few bags of ice, too; there is never enough ice.)If you must show off and offer a cocktail, then pre-mix a large batch in a jug so you’re not left faffing around with it when you should be having fun. Once underway, ask a significant other or friend to keep an eye on it and top up as necessary until it runs out. Do the same with the non-alcoholic punch; people love to be given a job at a party so they can enjoy a share of the goodwill.On the punch front, whichever recipe you go for (they abound online), avoid anything too sweet – any kids present should have their own drinks – and if you have one, plonk a bottle of bitters nearby (don’t add any to the bowl as they’re not suitable for people who avoid alcohol altogether). Make an effort with presentation so the non-alcoholic option doesn’t feel like an afterthought; it doesn’t take a minute to slice a few rounds of citrus into the bowl.Personally, I’d skip the readymade platters of “party foods” that pop up in supermarkets at this time of year; they feel fussy, and often involve turning the oven on (if you must do this, know that everyone secretly prefers garlic bread and/or cocktail sausages anyway). I truly believe you can’t beat a couple of really big bowls of decent crisps (salted will offend no one), and, assuming no allergies, one of those big and excellent value packets of nuts often sold in the South Asian section of supermarkets, with perhaps some pitted olives for colour (you don’t want to still be finding stones in your pot plants next Easter).If, like my mum, you don’t consider crisps proper food, a single big slab of good cheese on a board with crackers and some artfully draped grapes always looks painterly. A plate with some cured or cooked meats or fish laid out on it (just one sort, unless you’re wealthy), or a handsome ready-made pie, of the type that pops up on deli counters at this time of year, is even more substantial, and you really can’t go wrong with rustic chunks of focaccia, because they don’t need buttering.In short, choose foods that don’t require preparation, plates or cutlery, but don’t forget the napkins, and two obvious bins: one for rubbish, one for bottles and other recycling. Tie a large ribbon to the corkscrew if you don’t want to be asked where it is every 10 minutes and put it, a bottle opener, and as many glasses as you can muster by the drinks – a jug of water is rarely a bad idea, either.All of this can be picked up in a supermarket, and laid out in the twinkle of an eye – prioritise chilling the drinks before doing anything else. Switch on the lamps (or fairy lights if you have them handy), stick on an appropriately long album or playlist, so you’re not worrying about the soundtrack (after a couple of drinks, any men present will be fighting to put their own music on anyway), and go and make yourself look presentable … it’s party time!Explore more on these topicsChristmasWinter food 2025Christmas food and drinkFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The origin story that we’re all told – of a friendly exchange of food between the pilgrims and the Native Americans – is, at best, a whitewashed oversimplification. And then there’s Black Friday, an event that has hijacked one of our few non-commercialised holidays and used it as the impetus for a stressful, shameless, consumerist frenzy.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

It sucks to be an American right now. It’s hard to feel gratitude for a country that’s an out-of-control dumpster fire stoked by an ogre of a man who treats the global economy like a game of Monopoly and orders his steaks well done (and with ketchup).The worst impulses of American excess have coalesced into this moment, but hopefully this too shall pass. The story of the US I was told growing up is one of inclusivity: the melting pot, made up of the huddled masses, yearning to breathe free. Even as we recognise that these stories may not always be true, we have to keep telling them. They set standards for us to live up to.Every year when I was a kid, my mom used to make a “Thanksgiving tree”. It was fashioned out of brown construction paper and taped to the window, and we’d all add little green leaves inscribed with something we were thankful for. Even if Thanksgiving is problematic, it’s nice to have a day set aside as a reminder to ask ourselves this. And it’s a good excuse to indulge in some seriously comforting comfort food.Accept no substitutes: theremustbe turkey. I recommend cooking the crown and the legs separately – the latter confited in butter with herbs, and the former simply roasted to an internal temperature of 65C (149F). But if you have time, a barbecue, and the fortitude to cook outside, you should try smoked turkey, which I adore. Neil Rankin hasan excellent, straightforward methodfor this (pictured top). Any leftovers would be perfect inJacob Kenedy’s rich Louisiana gumbo. That said, noodle soup is also a must with leftover turkey, and Uyen Luu has you covered for that withsix pho recipes.View image in fullscreenTwo pies in one … Meera Sodha’s pumpkin pie with caramelised maple pecans.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The GuardianAlthough turkey is non-negotiable, the sides are just as important. First of all: gravy. I’m not opposed to granules, but you can’t beat homemade. I love it made with a little cider, as in Anna Jones’sroast vegetable gravy. Mashed potatoes should be light, fluffy, smooth and simple, but a touch of soured cream, à laRen Behan’s version, is always a good idea. Stuffing is mainly a vehicle for sausage meat, and must be cooked separately; I love Nigel Slater’s idea toinclude a little sauerkrautin the mix.For balance, you’ll need veg. And fruit – cranberries, that is. There’s nothing wrong with shop-bought cranberry sauce, and Yotam Ottolenghi’s idea to spike the bird withpink peppercornssounds delightful. Nothing is more Thanksgivingy than sweet-potato casserole, but if you aren’t into the concept of consuming marshmallows with gravy, a similarly sweet side would be David Everitt-Matthias’sroast pumpkinwith maple, almonds, and sage.Rachel Roddy’s green beans cooked in soured cream and breadcrumbs, is a less stodgy iteration of the green bean casserole.Finally, theremustalso be both pumpkin and pecan pies. Textbook versions are always welcome, but they can be a bit meh, so I like to change things up a little. Pumpkin makes a great cheesecake, such asDan Lepard’s pumpkin labneh number, or why not giveHelen Goh’s version with maple pecan brittlea go. And if you want to keep things classic, you can’t go wrong withFelicity Cloake’s take. For pecan pie, I’m intrigued byRuby Tandoh’s inclusion of rosemary, orLiam Charles’s luscious-looking recipe with juicy pears. Can’t be bothered to make two pies? Have the best of both worlds withMeera Sodha’s clever vegan pumpkin-pecan pie.By the way, Thanksgiving food isn’t just for Thanksgiving. As far as I’m concerned, recipes such as these can – and should – be enjoyed on regular rotation until daylight savings kick in again.

Who needs to wake up and smell the coffee?Find out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 27 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 11.57 ESTShareThe prosecution: LuciaHamad’s method isn’t the way it’s supposed to be done. I’m Italian – I know all about good coffeeHamad and I have been together for a year and a half, and this issue began when he started making coffee in my flat with the moka pot – the iconic, eight-sided stove-top coffee maker that brews espresso-style coffee. Every time Hamad uses it, he will pack the coffee grounds down tightly, which you shouldn’t do, as the pot will start hissing. The moka pot was invented in Italy, where I grew up, and there it is taboo to compress the coffee grounds.Hamad did a barista course and likes to say that he knows more about coffee than me. But the course didn’t teach him about moka pots and traditional methods. He learned how to use modern coffee machines in cafes, where you have to compress coffee grounds. But I’ve been making coffee since I was nine and I don’t need a course to tell me how to use a moka pot.He turned it into a socio-political issue. He’s from India, and said ‘Italians aren’t the only ones who make coffee’One of the first things you learn as a child in Italy is that you’re supposed to let some air into a moka pot – pressing down the coffee grounds creates the opposite effect. The coffee sometimes spills out with Hamad’s method, but when I make coffee that doesn’t happen, which shows you my technique is the right one.I told him to stop, but he turned it into a socio-political issue. He’s from India, and said: “Italians aren’t the only ones who make coffee,” and “traditions can be changed.” But to me, it’s also a matter of safety. He compresses the coffee grounds so tightly that pressure builds up, and the machine starts hissing loudly. I don’t think it would explode, but it could damage the pot.Also my son, Noah, who is 11, has started copying Hamad. It’s annoying because I taught Noah the proper technique: to let air into the container before gently putting the coffee in and heating it up very slowly to enhance the flavour. But now Noah wants to make coffee Hamad’s way.I never critique Hamad’s other methods. I am happy with the results when he makes coffee using a filter or coffee machine. We both like strong coffee – it’s just with the Italian moka pot you have to follow the rules, and he won’t do that.The defence: HamadPressing down the grounds improves the flavour. Lucia is just being a coffee snobYes, Lucia’s moka pot makes a hissing noise, but that’s not normal and it’s not my fault. I have my own pot in my flat and whenever I compress the coffee grounds down, it is fine and doesn’t hiss. Pushing the grounds down makes coffee taste much better.I don’t know why it annoys Lucia so much. I just did a barista course, and despite Lucia saying it’s not relevant to this style of coffee-making, I learned that if you want a stronger-tasting coffee you need more pressure. So that’s my reasoning behind compressing the coffee in the moka pot slightly. It’s simple physics.She even asked all her Italian friends what they thought of my technique. She sent a video of me pressing down the coffee grounds to her group chatDifferent parts of the world have different coffee-making techniques, but Lucia thinks her method is the best. She even asked all her Italian friends what they thought of my technique. She sent a video of me pressing down the coffee grounds to her group chat. They are all food fascists, so of course they said what I was doing was blasphemous, but that’s just because I don’t conform to Italian norms.I am from south India, where we make coffee with filters – and the more you press down on the grounds, the better the taste. I was trying to recreate something similar with the moka pot.I didn’t teach Noah my method on purpose, but he liked seeing the steam coming out of the pot and wanted to know about the whole ritual. It’s interesting to watch the steam in my opinion, but I’m indifferent to the hissing noise. What’s important is the quality of the coffee.Right now, Lucia and I are travelling together, and I’m making filter coffee, so we aren’t arguing. However, there is no proof that pressing on the grounds makes it worse. Although I do think Lucia is better at making Italian coffee.But I don’t like being told my method is incorrect, and I don’t like it when she tries to get support from food fascists. If you have to use groupthink to prove your point, it means your argument is weak. I will continue making good coffee, and If I want to press down in the moka pot, then I will.The jury of Guardian readersIs Hamad making a moka-ry of the situation?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

If he insists on pressing down the coffee, he should get a new machine and use that – not hers! Although I wonder, is the coffee the real issue? It may be that Lucia is annoyed with Hamad about something else and is using the coffee issue to vent.Belinda, 64It’s the sort of slovenly micro-obsession you develop when life is otherwise fine, symptomatic of a wider malaise of self-obsession and the decline of the west. The only way out of this is to bin the moka and have a lovely cup of weak tea.Dan, 35Hamad should use the device how it is intended to be used. If the consensus is it needs air to filter properly, that’s what he should do. It’s important to Lucia, so why mess around?Liam, 35Explosions of moka pots aren’t common, but they have been documented. Hamad’s patronising aside about it being “simple physics” shows he doesn’t actually understand the physics and is classic mansplaining.Laura, 34Why can’t Hamad get his way, some of the time? I highly doubt the machine is going to explode. People are probably doing this all over the world – millions of mokas are being overstuffed as you read this ... and there’s no epidemic of exploding pots.

It’s a 1930s house.”Boasting the largest of the capital’s royal parks, a thriving high street, highly rated schools and quick transport connections to the city, Richmond has long been a popular base for well-heeled Londoners, including among its longtime residents the broadcaster David Attenborough and actor Richard E Grant..The constituency of Richmond Park – which includes parts of Barnes, Kew, East Sheen and Richmond-on-Thames – is likely to be amongthe places most affected by Rachel Reeves’s property tax changesannounced in the budget.Houses worth £2m or more accounted for 6.4% of sales in Richmond-upon-Thames over the past five years, according to Land Registry sales data, equivalent to almost one in 15 transactions.View image in fullscreenAn estate agents window in Richmond borough shows a £5m house in Twickenham, which will merit a surcharge of £7,500.Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian“In Richmond, £2m to £2.5m gets you a lovely house, but not a mansion by any means,” said Rory Clarke, a senior sales consultant in the local office of Hamptons estate agents.“The [new regime] isn’t ideal but shouldn’t impact someone owning a home at that level too much. I wouldn’t have thought it would cause an issue in the housing market in Richmond.”On Wednesday,Rachel Reevesrevealed that from April 2028, owners of properties in England valued at £2m and over in 2026 will be required to pay an annual high-value council tax surcharge on top of existing council tax.The value of qualifying properties will not be based on asking or sale prices, but will instead be determined next year by the government’s Valuation Office Agency.There will be four price bands, meaning the surcharge will rise from £2,500 a year for properties valued between £2m and £2.5m, to £7,500 a year for those valued in the highest band of £5m and above. The surcharge will be raised in line with the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation each year.The surcharge is expected to raise £400m in 2029-30, slightly less than had been expected, and the revenues will be sent to central government rather than remaining with local authorities, as usually happens with council tax.Propertyanalysts anticipate governments in the devolved nations may now look at similar changes.The measure broadly matches pre-budget leaks and aligns with Reeves’s pledge last month that those with the“broadest shoulders”should pay their “fair share” of taxes.View image in fullscreenNick Miller and his wife, Carolyn, are trying to sell an expensive home in Richmond.Photograph: Handout“This is kind of what we thought would happen,” said Clarke. “[The introduction of the tax] is quite far away, but at least there is clarity where we stand and people now know what to expect.”Weeks of speculation in the run-up to the late budget about apossible property tax shake-uphad already stalled the local housing market, according to Amy Reynolds, the head of sales at the local estate agent Antony Roberts. When it came it was better than feared. “The phone would be ringing off the hook if it was bad news,” she said. “I’m grateful it isn’t worse.”View image in fullscreenAmy Reynolds, of Antony Roberts estate agents in Richmond, London, said the run-up to the budget had stalled the local housing market.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianReynolds believes the surcharge, which will mostly affect properties in London and south-east England, means the “north-south divide is getting sharper”.“Given that council tax hasn’t been comprehensively updated since 1991, it would be far more sensible to invest the time inrevaluing all council tax bands,” she said.Older homeowners, or those who have owned their property for a long time and watched its value soar over the years, are expected to be hardest hit by the changes.This is the case for Nick Miller and his wife, Carolyn, who have lived in their detached home in East Sheen for three decades.After putting the house on the market in summer 2024, a sale fell through this spring and they have subsequently reduced the price several times to the current £2m asking price, meaning it remains within the surcharge bracket.“It won’t help our case – it’s just more burden for buyers,” said Miller, a retired corporate financier. “We may have a better chance if interest rates come down again in December.”.In the short term, activity in the property market might pick up after the budget, “especially given the breathing space offered by a delay in implementation whilst the valuation exercise is conducted,” said Lucian Cook, the head of residential research at Savills estate agent.Longer term, Cook expects the measures to “act as slightly greater incentive for older homeowners to downsize and, in some cases, heavily mortgaged owners of high-value homes to move to a less-valuable property pushing some demand out of London into the commuter zone”.In addition, some sellers are expected to reduce their asking price to just below £2m to make properties more attractive to buyers. This was the case with previous stamp duty “ceilings”, where sales of properties above £250,000 were charged a 3% rate, instead of 1% for homes below that price, prompting buyers to offer £249,999 for properties that were on the market for a higher price.View image in fullscreenThe window of a Hamptons estate agents in Richmond, London.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThe Millers will also have to pay more tax in future on the income they receive from renting out a nearby home, which they originally bought for Nick’s parents.Among Rachel Reeves’s other announcements, the basic and higher rates of tax on property, dividend and savings income will increase by two percentage points.The move prompted an initial sell-off of shares in the UK’s largest housebuilders including Berkeley, Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon and Barratt Redrow, before they recovered slightly, because buy-to-let landlords represent an important group of buyers of new-build homes.The increase in property income tax rates will add “further pressure on landlords who own property in their own name”, but will not affect those who operate through limited companies, said Aneisha Beveridge, the head of research at Hamptons.“For individual landlords, who make up the bulk of the market and who are already squeezed by higher borrowing costs and previous tax changes, this could accelerate the trend of investors exiting the market,” she added.Property analysts and the Office forBudgetResponsibility (OBR) have voiced concerns that this could reduce supply of rental property and thereby risks pushing rents higher.“Despite headline tax rates on expensive homes and landlords going up, the OBR don’t believe the new taxes will raise any money at all, with behavioural changes eating away at tax revenues,” Beveridge said.Explore more on these topicsBudgetBudget 2025Council taxTax and spendingPropertyReal estateHouse pricesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The surcharge will rise from £2,500 a year for properties valued between £2m and £2.5m, to £7,500 a year for those valued in the highest band of £5m and above.This measure, which will come in addition to existing council tax, is often called a “mansion tax” – althoughin more expensive areas of the countrythis might stretch the definition of a mansion.What do you think of the new measures?

Castillo, 56, was also imprisoned at the facility pending his trial.Castillo, a former trade unionist who won power in 2021 on a promise to uplift Peru’s poor, took the shock decision to dissolve Congress to try to avoid impeachment for alleged corruption. His stunt failed spectacularly, however, with members of his own government siding against him.He was arrested while on his way to the Mexican embassy with his family to seek asylum. He was charged with rebellion, abuse of power and disturbing public order, but was acquitted on Thursday of the two latter charges.Prosecutors had sought a 34-year prison sentence.His eight-month trial took a dramatic turn earlier this month when his former prime minister, Betssy Chávez, also put in the dock, was given asylum by the Mexican embassy.Perubroke off diplomatic ties with Mexicoover what it called an “unfriendly act” and has not ruled out storming the Mexican embassy to arrest her.Castillo’s arrest and impeachment sparked mass protests in 2022 among his working-class rural base. The protests were harshly repressed, leading to at least 50 deaths.His deeply unpopular successor, the former vice-president Dina Boluarte, led the country for a tumultuous 22 months marked by a deep security crisisbefore also being impeached in October.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He said Portugal, where the airline Tap has its headquarters, had tried through its embassy in Caracas to persuade Venezuelan authorities to reinstate operating rights, adding Portugal had “no intention of canceling our routes to Venezuela, and that, obviously, we only did so for security reasons”.The US has made itslargest military deployment to the Caribbean in decadesamid worsening relations with Venezuela to combat, it has claimed, the role of the president, Nicolás Maduro, in supplying illegal drugs that have killed Americans.Maduro has denied the accusations and said Donald Trump was seeking to oust him.In a statement on Monday, the International Air Transport Association said Venezuelan authorities had given international airlines a 48-hour deadline to resume flights or risk losing their rights to fly to the country.Several international airlines had cancelled flights to Venezuela in recent days, ignoring the deadline. Iberia said it wished to restart flights to Venezuela as soon as full safety conditions were met.3:34'War on drugs' or political agitation?

Stanish/University of Sydney/Cover ImagesUS newsFlorida professor may have solved mystery of Peru’s Band of HolesCharles Stanish surmised indentations were rudimentary market place and later adapted as accounting and storage systemRichard Luscombein MiamiThu 27 Nov 2025 12.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 12.37 ESTShareAFloridaarchaeologist’s decades-long persistence has helped solve one of Peru’s most puzzling geographical conundrums: the origin and purpose of the so-calledBand of Holesin the country’s mountainous Pisco Valley.Charles Stanish, professor of archaeology at the University of SouthFlorida, and an expert on Andean culture, spent years studying the more than 5,200 curious hillside shallow pits known to local residents as Monte Sierpe - serpent mountain.He surmised during numerous field trips since the 1980s that the holes were man-made indentations created during the pre-Inca period for a rudimentary market place, then adapted by Incan civilization into a sophisticated kind of accounting and storage system, likely for agriculture.Rival theories abounded – from the sensible to the bizarre. Some analysts opined the holes might be an intricate network of water storage tanks; a more extreme postulation, aired on the Ancient Aliens television program andexploited by an enterprising travel company, was that they were crafted by extraterrestrial beings, perhaps to cover up the crash of their spacecraft.Now Stanish, in partnership with Dr Jacob Bongers of the University of Sydney, his former graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles, believes he has found the smoking gun.On their most recent expedition they used advanced drone technology to conduct the first comprehensive aerial mapping of the site, producing high-resolution images revealing “striking patterns” in how the holes were organized.The rows of holes, each between 3ft and 6.5ft wide, appeared segmented and mathematically structured, they said, a layout mirroring khipus, knotted-string devices the Inca used for counting and record keeping.“Monte Sierpe is extremely difficult to map from the surface,” Stanish said. “Even from the mountain above you can’t see its full pattern because of the permanent haze in the area. And because there were few artifacts, archaeologists couldn’t date or interpret it accurately.”View image in fullscreenMonte Sierpe holes in PeruPhotograph: Bruno7Even more conclusive, Stanish said, were the results of microbotanical analysis of sediment samples taken from inside the holes. Fossilized seeds revealed traces of crops such as maize and wild plants traditionally used for weaving and packaging goods.“We proved that the seeds didn’t fly in, they weren’t airborne, they had to be put there by humans,” he said. “We didn’t get any, with one exception way down below, colonial-era seeds, and we got one carbon-dated to slightly pre-Inca, which was fascinating.“And the coolest stuff was we found the reeds, the traditional reeds and the willows that the Inca and the Quechua peoples use to carry commodities, even up to the present day. So we got the reeds, we got the seeds.”Stanish said future work will focus on further analysis of the recovered seed samples, while Bongers plans to lead an upcoming expedition for more excavation. But he said he believed his explanation for the Band of Holes’ existence was now “pretty solid”.“If we do find anything that changes interpretation, we’ll say that. But I doubt it,” he said.He said he hoped that authorities inPeruwould recognize the historical significance of the holes, and move to protect them.“I’m not worried about tourists, about foreigners coming,” he said. “I’m worried about landowners getting the land and then irrigating it. People have to make a living, and I admire that. But, yes, this is a precious site, for the Indigenous peoples and for their pride, and its important to recognize that.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsPeruFloridaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Whenasked about the case by El País, he said: “It is completely false that I have an arrest warrant.”View image in fullscreenRaúl Rocha Cantú said it was ‘completely false’ that he had an arrest warrant before the attorney general confirmed the existence of the investigation.Photograph: Sakchai Lalit/APThe attorney general’s office later confirmed the existence of the investigation and said that arrest orders had been issued for 13 people, among them “Raúl R, about whom there have been various public reports”.The other half of the Miss Universe Organisation is owned by the Thai media mogul Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, for whom an arrest warrant was also this week issued by a Thai court.Jakkaphong is accused of fraud by a plastic surgeon, who says she concealed information when persuading them to invest in her company, JKN Global Group.A verdict for the case was due on Tuesday, but Jakkaphong failed to appear in court – prompting the judge to order her arrest, deeming her a flight risk. Her whereabouts are unclear.They were the latest twists in a singularly dramatic edition of the Miss Universe competition.Falls, feuds and fury: Miss Universe crowned after chaotic – and controversial – pageantRead moreAt the start of November Bosch – then Miss Mexico – went viral when she staged a walkout after being berated as “dumb” by the pageant’s director, who singled her out for failing to post promotional content.After a public outcry, the director gave a tearful apology and claimed he had been misunderstood, and the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, described Bosch as an “example of how we women should speak out”.View image in fullscreenFátima Bosch was crowned Miss Universe but allegations of vote rigging cast a shadow on her win.Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPABosch beat the crowd favourite, Miss Thailand, to win the crown – only for allegations of vote rigging to cast a shadow on her triumph.Days before the final, two of the eight judges quit, with one suggesting that the vote was rigged. The other cited “unforeseen personal reasons”.Mexican media have also reported on business ties between Rocha and Pemex, the Mexican state oil company where Bosch’s father has worked for decades, prompting Rocha and Bosch’s father to deny that there are any business ties between them personally.At a press conference on Wednesday, Sheinbaum again came to Bosch’s defence. “[Any investigation of Rocha] is independent of the young woman who won the competition. They want to connect them, but they are different. They want to detract from her achievement.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasThailandnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty ImagesThree construction employees arrested as firefighters battle to reach trapped people, with many still missingHow the fire unfolded – visual guideByHelen Davidsonin Hong Kong andOliver HolmesThu 27 Nov 2025 17.55 ESTFirst published on Thu 27 Nov 2025 01.03 ESTShareHong Kong police have alleged unsafe scaffolding and foam materials used during maintenance work may have been behind the rapid spread of a devastating fire at a group of residential tower blocks that has killed at least 94 people and left scores missing.Firefighters were still battling to reach people who could be trapped on the upper floors of the Wang Fuk Court housing complex on Thursday due to the intense heat and thick smoke generated by the fire. Late in the day, a survivor was rescued from a stairway on the 16th floor of one of the towers, the SouthChinaMorning Post reported.Early on Friday, authorities said the death toll had reached 94. Officials have also reported 76 people injured, including 11 firefighters. It is the deadliest Hong Kong fire in decades.Fire service officials said blazes in four of the eight apartment blocks in the estate had been extinguished and that three fires were under control. One building was not affected.Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, said in the early hours of Thursday that 279 people were unaccounted for, though firefighters said later that they had established contact with some of those people. Authorities have not updated the figure since. Lee said more than 900 people had sought refuge at temporary shelters overnight.Loop of Hong Kong fireEileen Chung, a Hong Kong police superintendent, alleged: “We have reason to believe that the company’s responsible parties were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties.”Three men from the construction company, two directors and one engineering consultant had been arrested, Chung added, without giving further details.Chung did not name the company but police later on Thursday searched the office of Prestige Construction and Engineering Company. Officers seized boxes of documents as evidence, according to local media.The government separatelyidentified the registered contractorfor the building complex as Prestige. Noting the requirement for use of fire-retardant netting and screens on scaffolding, it said in a statement: “If any violations of the requirements of the buildings ordinance are found, the case will be referred to the BD [buildings department] for handling in accordance with the ordinance, including prosecution or disciplinary proceedings.”Prestige has not yet publicly commented.The Tai Po district includes eight 31-storey towers containing about 2,000 flats, which house about 4,800 people. The site was undergoing renovation work at the time.Image of Wang Fuk Court residential complexPolice alleged the buildings had been covered with protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not have met fire standards, and discovered some windows on one unaffected building were sealed with a foam material, installed by a construction company carrying out maintenance work.The fire is thought to have spread on bamboo scaffolding around the building, and was probably aided by windy conditions. Bamboo scaffolding is a ubiquitous sight across Hong Kong building sites, though the government has said it is being phased out for safety reasons.View image in fullscreenThe fire at Wang Fuk Court, a residential estate in the Tai Po district.Photograph: Chan Long Hei/APThe fire has prompted comparisons with theGrenfell Tower infernothat killed 72 people in London in 2017. That fire was blamed on firms fitting the exterior with flammable cladding, as well as failings by the government and the construction industry. Three companies that wereheavily criticised in the findings of the Grenfell inquirylast year have all continued to deny wrongdoing.The Tai Po district authorities have opened shelters in community halls, at least one of which local media reported was full by Wednesday night, and police have set up acasualty hotline.Several forums and campaign events related to 7 December elections that had been scheduled for the coming days have been cancelled.On Wednesday night, dozens of shocked residents, many sobbing, watched from pavements as smoke funnelled up from the complex. One 71-year-old resident surnamed Wong broke down in tears, saying his wife was trapped inside.View image in fullscreenA man who gave his surname as Wong said his wife was trapped inside Wang Fuk Court.Photograph: Tyrone Siu/ReutersAnother longtime resident, a woman surnamed Chu, said she still had not been able to contact her friends who live in the next block. After staying at a friend’s place on Wednesday night, the 70-year-old came back to see her home still burning. “We don’t know what to do,” she said.Harry Cheung, 66, who has lived at Block 2 in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise about 2.45pm (0645 GMT) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block. “I don’t even know how I feel right now,” he said. “I’m just thinking about where I’m going to sleep tonight because I probably won’t be able to go back home.”1:17Hong Kong apartment fires continue to burn as people rally to support survivors – videoChina’s leader, Xi Jinping, urged an “all-out effort” to extinguish the fire and to minimise casualties and losses, as residents voiced anger online at possible causes of the fire. One video appeared to show several construction workers smoking on the bamboo scaffolding surrounding one of the complex’s blocks during the renovation process.Building standards in Hong Kong are relatively high and vastly improved in recent decades, but the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, a local advocacy group, expressed deep concern about fires associated with scaffolding, noting similar incidents in April, May and October.How the Hong Kong fire unfolded – visual guideRead moreThough fire hazard was not cited as a reason for the phasing-out of bamboo scaffolding, there have been at least three fires involving bamboo scaffolding this year, according to the association.Wang Fuk Court is one of many high-rise housing complexes in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Tai Po, located near the border with mainland China, is an established suburban district with about 300,000 residents.Occupied since 1983, the complex is under the government’s subsidised home ownership scheme, according to property agency websites.

        "Content": "7h ago13.34 ESTClosing summaryHong Kong is mourning after 83 people were killed in the fire, among them a firefighter and two Indonesian domestic workers.Another 79 people are battling injuries in hospital. And many more people are still waiting to hear from their missing loved ones. Authorities have not given an update on that number – reported earlier on Thursday as more than 250 people.The complex is made up of eight 32-storey towers, containing about 2,000 flats, and were being renovated at the time. About 4,800 people live there.Derek Chan, the deputy fire services director, said their hoses had reached the remaining units still on fire, and flames are expected to be fully out by 9am local time on Friday.The fire department official said their operations had been hampered by the fire’s intense heat.Debris and scaffolding falling from the higher levels had also made access to the buildings difficult, along with the high temperatures and darkness.Three men aged between 52 and 68 were arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of manslaughter. The trio – two directors and one engineering consultant – worked at a construction company, police said.Police alleged they had reason to believe the company’s responsible parties were “grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties”.Police did not name the company but later on Thursday searched the office of a construction and engineering company. They seized boxes of documents as evidence, according to local media.1:17Hong Kong apartment fires continue to burn as people rally to support survivors – videoShare"

Hundreds of people are still missing.But as firefighters work to bring the fire under control and make progress with rescue efforts, anger is already swelling among Hongkongers about the causes of the fire.The fire has also tapped into the social anxiety inHong Kongaround affordable housing, where sky-high property prices mean that many people live in tightly packed high-rise apartments that can become death traps when disaster strikes.At a press conference on Thursday, Hong Kong’s leader, John Lee, said the government would set up a HK$300m (£29.2m) fund to help residents and that the city’s development bureau had discussed replacingbamboo scaffoldingwith metal alternatives. He also said that contractors across the Asian financial hub would be given seven days to submit documents proving their use of fire-retardant materials.But some Hongkongers are angry about the focus that has been put on bamboo as a potential accelerant of the fire. On Thursday afternoon, much of the bamboo scaffolding remained standing, with the green mesh between the poles having been incinerated.The angry people think that blaming bamboo – which the government has already pledged to phase out from public construction works – deflects responsibility from the actual cause of the fire, which is still unknown. Bamboo scaffolding is treasured as an important part of the local heritage, and is something that distinguishes Hong Kong from mainlandChina, where steel scaffolds are widely used in construction.Residents of Wang Fuk Court had complained for months about shoddy behaviour from the construction company, said Michael Mo, a former Hong Kong district councillor who now lives in the UK. He was born in the Tai Po area where Wang Fuk Court is located.Last year, the text of an email purportedly from the Hong Kong labour department was posted on a Wang Fuk Court residents group. Responding to inquiries about the maintenance works, the email said that because the works didn’t involve open flames, “the risk of fire from the scaffolding is relatively low”. It said that the Labour Department’s regulations did not cover flame-retardant standards for scaffolding. The department has been contacted for comment.On Thursday, police in Hong Kong arrested three people connected with the building maintenance company responsible for the estate.Hong Kong’s corruption watchdog also said it would launch a criminal investigation into the renovation works.Traditionally, Hong Kong has held open inquiries into major tragedies, often headed by an independent judge.But many legal experts say that Hong Kong’s judiciary is no longer independent, especially on matters which are critical of the government.“I don’t think the government will launch an independent committee on this,” said Mo. “They didn’t do it for Covid. If they are going to do it, John Lee would be cooked.”Since Beijing’s sweeping crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, which included many violent clashes between police and demonstrators, trust in the authorities is low.“Ever since the wipeout of the pro-democratic camp and civil society, there is no opposition to voice out alarm bells effectively,” said Mo. He said that before 2019, there were guardrails, albeit imperfect ones, on the authorities. “In the absence of these … there is no way we can make the government more effective or accountable.”Beijing’s response to the fire has been swift. China’s president, Xi Jinping, called for an “all-out effort” to extinguish the fire and minimise casualties and losses. Chinese companies including BYD, Geely and Alibaba have pledged tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars in aid donations. The People’s Liberation Army stands ready to “safeguard” the city, a defence ministry spokesperson said.Lee also hinted on Thursday that the upcoming Legislative Council elections, scheduled for 7 December, could be postponed because of the disaster. The elections were last postponed in 2020, ostensibly because of Covid, but it also served as a way to silence the pro-democratic camp. In the years since, that camp has been destroyed, by a combination of imprisoning legislators or forcing them into exile, or by disbarring candidates who are seen as disloyal to Beijing. This year’s election will be a “patriots only” vote.Additional reporting by Helen Davidson and ReutersExplore more on these topicsHong KongAsia PacificChinaHong Kong apartment firesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Fire crews blasted water from cherrypickers at the mid-level floors, but above that, the fires were roaring out of reach.Wang Fuk Court, in the northern Hong Kong district of Tai Po, was home to about 4,800 people. The eight-tower complex had been under renovation for years, clad in bamboo scaffolding and mesh.On Wednesday afternoon,for reasons that are under investigation, one of them caught fire. The blaze spread inside the building, and then across to neighbouring towers. By evening, seven buildings were ablaze, and the death toll had already surpassed Hong Kong’s previous worst ever building fire disaster.At least 65 people have been killed, including one firefighter, and dozens injured. At least 55 were rescued but more than 250 are missing. Firefighters were still unable to reach the top levels of some of the 31-storey towers, although one elderly man was rescued alive from his high up apartment earlier in the day.0:49Aerial video shows scale of Hong Kong apartment complex fireThe air was still filled with acrid smoke, which reminded some of how the city smelled during the worst violence of the 2019 protests. A brief panic broke out when a flickering light in the window of a different block was mistaken for another fire, and onlookers exchanged nervous looks when the breeze picked up: Wednesday’s fire was fanned by a stiff winter northerly, said James Tang, who lives in one of the towers.Tang was not home when the building caught fire. He received a call from his brother-in-law who saw it from across the river. He rushed home but was stopped from entering.“I watched from the outside as the building burned,” he said, speaking to the Guardian outside a local primary school, which is one of the shelters for evacuated residents.View image in fullscreenFirefighters have been unable to reach the top levels of some of the 31-storey towers.Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/ReutersTang’s friends in the complex were not among the missing, he said. “But a lot of people died, especially the fireman. We are very sorry about this. The fireman tried to save us from the fire, tried to stop the fire and then he lost his life.”Nearby, volunteers had set up a market of donated clothes, food and essentials for the now homeless residents of Wang Fuk Court and the hundreds of others temporarily evacuated from neighbouring buildings.View image in fullscreenVolunteers have set up a market of donated clothes, food and essentials for people who are now homeless or have been evacuated from neighbouring buildings.Photograph: Ryan KW Lai/ShutterstockConnie Chu had just returned home from grocery shopping to the apartment she had lived in for 42 years when she saw a mass of fire trucks. A neighbour told her to leave, even though none of them had heard a fire alarm.“There should have been [an alarm],” she said. “When I came out I saw one building on fire, it was a horrible, huge fire. We were so worried.”Chu and her neighbours were lucky – their building was the only one of the complex’s eight not to burn. “I have a friend who lives in one of the other buildings and she’s in hospital. It seems quite serious. I spoke to her on the phone yesterday, she said a lot of smoke had entered her home.”Bamboo scaffolding may be to blame for spread of Hong Kong tower block fireRead moreThe community is reeling, and some are angry: police suspect the fire was caused by “grossly negligent” action. Hong Kong police have alleged unsafe scaffolding and foam materials used during maintenance workmay have been behind the rapid spread of the fire, and three people from the related construction company have been arrested. The Independent Commission Against Corruption has already announced a taskforce.There have been long-running complaints about the renovation, including allegations the alarms were switched off months ago by construction workers, and that workers smoked on site. There have also been broader concerns about the safety standards for the mesh used on sites. A video being widely shared on Thursday shows a local council member setting fire to a piece of green construction mesh and watching it quickly melt and burn.1:26Three arrested as Hong Kong tower fire leaves dozens dead - videoBy nightfall on Thursday, the surrounding area was still filled with people – emergency services, onlookers, neighbours, victims and their families. Outside a building where the deceased were being identified, people left sobbing, clutching at each other. Some wore blankets over their heads to avoid the cameras.Pastor Samson Wong, from the Cumberland Presbyterian church, was waiting with a crowd of volunteers to give emotional and psychological support to the families who have lost people.“They have enough material supplies, but they need emotional support,” he said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Thompson was “expressly aware of his obligations of confidentiality” and discussed steps taken to keep their relationship secret.Their messages were not preserved by council under the Public Records Act.“Mr Thompson denies committing any kind of misconduct or criminal offence and respectfully declines to provide a response in circumstances where there is the prospect of future criminal proceedings,” his lawyers told the CCC.The report also details allegations of false statements by Thompson before and after he became mayor of Townsville in 2024.During the election campaignhe falsely claimed to have served as a signalman alongside the SASand exaggerated his length of service, which was in the army reserve, it said.In a subsequent interview with A Current Affair, he blamed “100-plus” concussions and epilepsy for forgetting details of his military service.The CCC obtained copies of Thompson’s medical records.“There is no evidence Mr Thompson has received specialist treatment for epilepsy,” the CCC report read.“An epilepsy management plan has been endorsed by a general practitioner, who also prescribed anti-seizure medication between November 2023 and October 2024”.Thompson also claimed to be a “cancer survivor” during the election campaign, claiming he had been told to “get your affairs in order” in 2021 as a result of oesophageal cancer.His medical records do not record a diagnosis or treatment for oesophageal cancer, the CCC said.“The records show that Mr Thompson had post-gastric sleeve complications which potentially account for any reference to his stomach and the associated comments to ensure his affairs were in order,” the CCC said.One witness interviewed by the CCC told them Thompson had made similar claims on Facebook in 2019, and that a relative had commented on the post blaming his gastric band surgery and encouraging him to “stop telling people he had cancer”.He also self-reported the removal of several “melanomas”. According to the medical records reviewed by the CCC, he had malignant skin lesions removed in 2020 but “has had no melanomas diagnosed or treated”No specialist oncologist or known cancer medications are listed in his Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefit records.“Mr Thompson did not publicly rescind his claims that he has survived a diagnosis of cancer,” the CCC said.During the election campaign, Thompson also claimed to have “put myself through university” and to have obtained a business degree. His election materials asserted that he had bachelors degrees in commerce and science.The CCC found this was also false.Thompson was enrolled in a bachelor of commerce degree for one semester in 2006, passing two of the four subjects in which he was enrolled, according to the report. He has no university qualifications.Thompson stood down as mayor in September after 18 months of pressure for his resignation.He was accused of standing asidein order to avoid being dismissed by the minister, so that he would be allowed to recontest the position at a byelection. He also called on the local government minister to dismiss the council, effectively sacking all other councillors.He was easily beaten in November.The CCC referred allegations about false claims during the election period and leaking as mayor to the Queensland department of public prosecutions.It also recommended introducing a mechanism for candidates for election to declare qualifications and employment history, with sanctions if the information was false.Explore more on these topicsQueensland politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Howe called the premier, Chris Minns, a“snowflake”after he said she had spread an“enormous amount of misinformation and lies”.Bill to restrict abortions later in pregnancy defeated in South Australia after emotional debateRead moreAfter a recent attempt to restrict access to abortion after 22 weeks and six days (which is only done in rare and health-threatening circumstances), she listed politicians who voted against the bill, which was introduced by former One Nation, now independent MP Sarah Game, as members of what she calls the“Baby Killers Club”.State and federal MPs have told of receivingdeath threats and abusefrom third parties after Howe used her social media accounts to criticise them.On the day of the emotional debate in which MLCs were visibly distressed about the discussion on late-term abortion, Howe started a“fun little game”about the debate.It was a bingo card-style fundraiser, which she says raised $7,000. The attorney general, Kyam Maher, said he would refer it to the authorities, and the department of consumer and business services, which is in charge of lottery rules, is now considering it.In a video with her husband, furniture designer James Howe, she said it shouldn’t have been referred, before talking about taking the university to the Fair Work Commission (FWC) in 2024.The university has conducted six investigations into complaints against Howe, and the universityreportedlyrequired her to do an anti-bias course.She wrotethat the complaints were about her abortion activism, with one relating to an allegation of plagiarism and misrepresentation of facts.She spent $100,000 taking the university to the FWC for bullying, which went to conciliation.Howe said she won because she did not have to do the course, while the FWC says the outcomes of conciliations are confidential.“We agreed on a new process around complaints … and in that conciliation the university agreed that if a complaint came in from someone with an ideological position that was opposite to mine, so they were pro-abortion, then the university wouldn’t take their complaint further because it would be deemed vexatious,” Howe said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardian Australia understands some roles have already been outsourced.Staff members who spoke on condition of anonymity said the proposal was “out of touch” and opaque. They raised concerns about how the basic functions of the library could continue under the plan.Reference librarians had been “running on the smell of an oily rag for the past 18 months”, and requests to hire in vacant positions were often delayed or ignored, one staff member said.Meanwhile, staff were concerned basic IT tasks, such as maintaining current opening hours on the SLV website, were already falling by the wayside and would be worse with a fully outsourced team.“I can’t even believe that they think that’s workable, given the simultaneous desire to up their digital activity in a very complicated old building,” they said.Staff were concerned that no public consultation had been conducted before the changes were decided upon, and that such significant changes were being implemented by acting executives.Staff said the library has been receiving significant negative public feedback on the proposal since news of cuts to jobs and services was first reported in Nine newspapers over the weekend.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also isn’t clear how any benefits or savings from these proposals will be realised.“Both library staff and the Victorians who rely on them will suffer if these half-baked ideas are implemented. The State Library needs expert staff who know the collection’s five million plus items better than any AI ever could.”Gilmour said the acting SLV management had not met their consultation obligations under the enterprise agreement for proposed changes of this magnitude. Guardian Australia understands the CPSU has formally notified the library it is in dispute.A state library spokesperson said the library’s executive had “engaged and consulted extensively and in good faith with staff and the CPSU on the proposed changes” and that their approach to the process was in line with their obligations under the Cultural and Creative Enterprise Partnership Agreement 2025.“The proposed changes reflect the Library’s strong commitment to best serving the community now and into the future,” the spokesperson said.“To clarify: State Library Victoria will continue, as we always have, to provide appropriate computer access for the public to assist with research and reference activity,” the spokesperson said.“The Library is committed to upholding our critical role as an essential service providing free and equal access to knowledge and information.”The CPSU Victoria state branch secretary, Jiselle Hanna, on Monday described the proposal as “management folly”.Speaking to 774 ABC Melbourne’s Drive program, Hanna said: “If you’re so sure that this proposal is going to be palatable to Victoria, have a public meeting … where Victorians get to have a say about the future of the State Library of Victoria.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Europol, which coordinated the raids, said most of the toys seized “completely evaded the EU’s strict rules on products” intended for children.They included fake toys “that can cause asphyxiation, suffocation, drowning, cuts, burns and exposure to chemical substances” in fabrics that are not legally compliant and “forever chemicals” that can be carcinogenic, the police authority said.“Some posechoking hazardsand could be ingested, while others may damage children’s hearing or sight,” it added.View image in fullscreenEuropol seized millions of packages of fake and harmful toys in Operation Ludus.Photograph: EuropolAmong the goods were card games, dolls, fidgeting toys, accessories, action figures, plastic construction toys and floating toys. The haul ranged from “fakes that are almost indistinguishable from the real products, to obvious fakes ripping off the known brands,” said a spokesperson.Europol urged parents to be vigilant when it came to Christmas shopping and to restrict buying to trusted retailers online and on the high street.Tell-tale signs can be the absence of safety labels and safety instructions in relation to the risk of fabrics catching on fire.Shoppers should be particularly wary of toys of characters from popular TV shows that are not sold in trusted shops, as these were popular choices for counterfeiters, said Europol in a lengthy report on the crackdown, called Operation Ludus.Counterfeiters typically use low-quality batteries that carry a fire hazard, produce clothes for toddlers with draw-strings longer than EU standards that could cause trip hazards, and ribbons on clothing that carry a risk of strangulation.Europol also warned that the Chinese fakes could contain small parts that easily fall off and could be swallowed, such as magnets.The law enforcement agency said: “China remains the main origin country of counterfeit toys marketing in the EU.” Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey are often used as a transit route and commercial warehouses are leased for the stock.The raids underline the EU and the UK’s continuing battle to prevent sub-standard quality goods coming in onplatforms such as Shein.View image in fullscreenThe operation to collect the counterfeit goods was led by investigators in France, Spain and Romania.Photograph: EuropolThe European Commission ramped up pressure on China’s Shein on Wednesday, saying the online platform might pose a “systemic risk” for consumers and demanding more information from the company after illegal items were found for sale on its marketplace.Europol’s swoop across 26 countries was led by investigators in France, Spain and Romania.Europol said Operation Ludus shows that criminal networks see profit in low-cost goods and not just the high-end market, which can include fake designer handbags, perfume and makeup.‘Part of the joy economy’: bumper year for UK toys as Wicked dolls and Pokémon appeal to ‘kidults’Read more“Toys are continuously targeted because of their variety and popularity,” the agency said, with online crime “increasingly nurtured”.This summer, the EU justice commissionerexpressed shockat the toxicity and dangers of some goods being sold bySheinand Temu, amid a crackdown on the popular Chinese retail platforms.With 12m low-value parcels each day coming into the EU from online retailers outside the bloc, Michael McGrath has vowed to crack down on the sale of goods that blatantly break the law.Among the worst examples McGrath came across were baby soothers with beads that fall off easily, which pose a choking hazard because they do not have the regulation-size hole to enable a baby who did swallow one accidentally to continue to get air.Other goods cited by MEPs in a report released this month include children’s raincoats with toxic chemicals and sunglasses with no UV filter.Explore more on these topicsToysEuropeEuropean UnionSheinnewsShareReuse this content"

His packed schedule also includes a visit to the Blue Mosque in Istanbul and the celebration of a Catholic mass at the city’s Volkswagen Arena.Francis, who died in April, had planned to visit both countries but was unable to because of ill health.Leo is considered more of a moderate, low-key operator than the charismatic but often divisive Francis, and the choice of Turkey and Lebanon for his first overseas trip is highly strategic, while also presenting an opportunity for the pope to show the world his style and personality.View image in fullscreenPope Leo attending a wreath-laying ceremony at Ataturk’s mausoleum in Ankara.Photograph: Alessandro Di Meo/EPAIn recent weeks, Turkish media has buzzed with images of Vatican delegations touring the country, while in Beirut banners showing Pope Leo’s smiling face have lined the stone outer walls of churches in the Lebanese capital’s central Christian neighbourhoods.“This is a trip where Leo will get to promote one of the central themes of his papacy, peace – and he’ll have two different audiences in mind,” said Christopher White, a Vatican expert and author of Pope Leo XIV: Inside the Conclave and the Dawn of a New Papacy.At least 127 civilians killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since ceasefire, UN saysRead more“One will be world leaders: Turkey and Lebanon are strategic locations for him to double down on his efforts for peace in Ukraine and in the Middle East and with this being his first foreign outing, he’ll have the attention of world leaders closely following the trip.”The second audience will be Christian leaders, as Leo attempts to unite the region’s long-divided churches. He would especially use the anniversary celebrations in Turkey “to remind believers what they share in common is far greater than their divisions”, White said.Leo’s arrival in Lebanon on Sunday afternoon comes during a period in which many fear a potential return to the two-month Israeli bombing campaign that blanketed southern Lebanon and Beirut last year.View image in fullscreenPope Leo XIV is welcomed by Turkey’s culture and tourism minister, Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, after disembarking from his plane in Ankara.Photograph: Vatican Media /EPAKarim Émile Bitar, a professor of international relations at the Saint Joseph University of Beirut, said Lebanon’s Christian community would be looking to the pope for a message of unity at a time when the country remained deeply polarised.“This visit matters because the Vatican has historically been the main protector of Lebanese national unity and of Lebanese territorial integrity,” he said. “Most states have political or economic interests. The Vatican is one of the last moral authorities in the world that genuinely tries to promote peace and justice without any hidden agenda.”Bitar said he believed Leo would “find the right words” during a visit that had “the potential to demonstrate that global powers like the Vatican can attempt to heal divisions in Lebanese society without pursuing their own political interests”.He added: “Even though this visit is symbolic, and even though the Vatican has no army and no military influence, the simple fact that this is a man who speaks to people with genuine goodwill may matter more than the representatives of heavily militarised regional powers who are pushing Lebanon toward fragmentation.”Leo will lead prayers in Beirut’s port, where a deadly blastdestroyed swaths of the capital in 2020, and visit a psychiatric hospital run by the Catholic church.The Turkey trip had been on the agenda for some time before Leo received the official invitation to Lebanon, where leaders hope the papal visit will bring world attention to a country also in deep economic strife.“He immediately embraced it,” said Andrea Vreede, the Vatican correspondent for NOS, the Dutch public radio and TV network. “Going to Lebanon means being able to talk about peace in the Middle East, in a really war-torn country, and very near to Israel. I’m not sure if he’ll speak directly about Gaza but he will obviously use Lebanon as a platform for peace.”The Lebanese, meanwhile, “want some hope from him”, added Vreede. “It’s a country that is also in huge economic crisis … they see this visit as basically the only miraculous thing that can help them.”After Francis in 2021 made thehigh-risk trip to Iraq, where hevisited Mosul, the northern city devastated by Islamic State militants, Leo has faced some criticism for not visiting Christian communities in southern Lebanon. “He won’t go there – it’s too unsafe,” said Vreede.Meanwhile, Christians in other countries are hoping he will visit them, too. Inside the Maronite church in Bab Touma, a historically Christian neighbourhood in the Syrian capital of Damascus, Fahed Dahta said he was overjoyed at the visit to the region. “This visit is enormously important to people. We need peace in the Middle East. I want peace for the entire region, and an end to all of these wars: Israel-Lebanon, Israel-Palestine, Israel and Syria,” he said. “He represents peace: he’s the pope!”Explore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVThe papacyLebanonTurkeyCatholicismRecep Tayyip ErdoğanMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He believed French youth had a “thirst for engagement”, saying there was a young generation “ready to stand up” for their nation.Under the new military service, men and women, mostly aged 18 and 19, could volunteer to sign up for 10 months. They would be paid a minimum of €800 (£700) per month and receive food and accommodation, as well as a 75% discount on rail travel. They would be deployed “only on national soil”, Macron said. A minority with specific qualifications, for example in engineering or medical skills, could be aged up to 25.View image in fullscreenFabien Mandon, France’s armed services chief, standing alongside Emmanuel Macron, said France needed to steel itself for possible future losses against Russian aggression.Photograph: Blondet Eliot/ABACA/ShutterstockThere is so far no suggestion that military service in France could again be compulsory, as it was before the then president, Jacques Chirac, abolished conscription in 1997.“We cannot return to the time of conscription,” Macron said. “This hybrid army model corresponds to the threats and risks ahead, bringing together national service youth, reservists, and the active army.”The plan will cost €2bn, which Macron called “a significant and necessary effort”.The scheme aims to bring in 3,000 volunteers in 2026, rising to 10,000 by 2030. “My ambition for France is to reach 50,000 youth by 2036, depending on evolving threats,” Macron said. After the programme, participants could integrate into civilian life, become a reservist, or stay in the armed forces, he said.He said the plan was “inspired by practices of our European partners ... at a time when all our European allies advance in response to a threat that weighs on us all”.The move is part of abroader shift across Europe, where nations who have long enjoyed the decades-long tranquillity of US security guarantees are concerned about Donald Trump’s shifting priorities and Russia’s aggressive posturing.Macron’s announcement brings France in line with nearly a dozen other European nations such as Germany and Denmark who have launched similar projects.Military service is seen as a way of bolstering armies with recruits, but also of providing a large pool of potential reservists, who could be called up in the case of a future war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perrin told Reuters: “His remarks were taken out of context ... but if being a bit blunt is necessary to make the French understand the situation we are in, then he was right to do it.”Clémence Guetté, of the leftwing party La France Insoumise, said of the new voluntary military service on RTL radio: “France isn’t at war and this can’t be the priority for young people.”Sébastien Chenu, an MP for Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party, said the new voluntary military service was “going in the right direction”.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsFranceRussiaEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s genocide is not over.”Contacted by Agence France-Presse, the Israeli foreign ministry did not immediately respond to the allegations.When faced with such allegations previously, the ministry has vehemently rejected them as “entirely false”, “fabricated” and “based on lies”.The 1948 UN genocide convention defines genocide as any of five “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.In December 2024, Amnesty concluded thatIsrael was committing genocide in Gazaby three of those acts– including deliberately inflicting on Palestinians conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction.View image in fullscreenA makeshift tent amid widespread devastation in Gaza City.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APIn an update on Thursday, Amnesty said: “Israel continues to severely restrict the entry of supplies and the restoration of services essential for the survival of the civilian population.“Despite a reduction in scale of attacks, and some limited improvements, there has been no meaningful change in the conditions Israel is inflicting on Palestinians inGazaand no evidence to indicate that Israel’s intent has changed.”Following Amnesty’s findings in December, Israel’s foreign ministrycalled the London-based group a “deplorable and fanatical organisation”.“Israel is defending itself ... acting fully in accordance with international law,” it said.Gaza hospitals running out of supplies as Israeli airstrikes continue, medics sayRead moreGaza has been devastated by the war triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.Callamard said: “Israel’s pattern of conduct in Gaza, including the deliberate, unlawful denial of lifesaving aid to Palestinians, many of whom are injured, malnourished and at risk of serious disease, continues to threaten their survival.”In September 2025, the independent international commission of inquiry set up by the UN concluded that“genocide is occurring in Gaza”– something Israel denied. The investigation concluded that Israeli authorities and forces had since October 2023 committed “four of the five genocidal acts” listed in the 1948 genocide convention.These five acts include killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group, preventing births and forcibly transferring children out of the group.The international court of justice last year ordered Israel “to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide” in Gaza.The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people. Israel’s retaliatory assault on Gaza has killed at least 69,799 people, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry that the UN considers reliable. The ministry says that since the ceasefire came into effect, 352 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelAmnesty InternationalPalestineIsrael-Gaza warHuman rightsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He added that there was “no information to suggest that Dr Aladwan presents a real and immediate risk to patient safety”.In September, the MPTS ruled that it would not impose interim conditions on Aladwan’s registration, saying it did not believe the complaints against her were “sufficient to establish that there may be a real risk to patients”.However, the tribunal’s chair, Lee Davies, found on Wednesday that her alleged conduct “may impact on patient confidence in both her and the profession and patients may be discouraged from seeking treatment from her”.He said there had been “additional information” made available since September that “may indicate an escalation in the tone and nature of Dr Aladwan’s activities and posts, which may be considered to be extreme, offensive and antisemitic”.Davies said: “The tribunal considers that the allegations, if found proved, are serious and appear to have arisen from persistent and prolonged posting of potentially egregious material which has been widely disseminated by Dr Aladwan, resulting in a number of individual complaints made to the GMC.“While the tribunal is mindful of Dr Aladwan’s freedom of expression rights, it has noted a number of comments which allegedly support and celebrate terrorist acts and organisations, and promote violent action and offensive Jewish tropes.”He added that “many complaints” had been received “from individual members of the public and various organisations”.The interim suspension of 15 months on Aladwan, 31, took effect from Wednesday and will be reviewed within six months.The GMC and MPTS assess the conduct of doctors and decide whether sanctions, including being struck off the medical register, are necessary. The MPTS interim orders tribunals decide if a doctor’s practice should be restricted while a GMC investigation takes place, but do not reach their own conclusions.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, is seeking to overhaul the way medical regulators investigate cases of antisemitism after saying “the current medical regulatory system is completely failing to protect Jewish patients and NHS staff”.Explore more on these topicsAntisemitismPalestineProtestDoctorsHealthMiddle East and north AfricaLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Her family became so concerned that she was taken by ambulance to QMC on New Year’s Eve.She was found to be experiencing an “acute psychotic episode” and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.A jury of five women and four men heard that blood tests and an MRI scan conducted at QMC were negative, leading doctors to rule out a physical cause for her psychosis.However, clinicians decided not to request further tests of brain activity or spinal fluid, including a lumbar puncture, which may have revealed the autoimmune encephalitis.Mia was transferred to the Becton centre on 9 January and died three weeks later.In their narrative conclusion, the jury said: “The failure to undertake a lumbar puncture at this point [at QMC] meant that potential indicators of autoimmune encephalitis were missed. This possibly contributed to Mia’s death.”They added that the information passed between QMC and the Becton centre “provided an inappropriate level of assurance that organic causes had been ruled out”.Regarding the Becton centre, the jury found that “insufficiently robust communication and management of risk led to a failure to respond adequately to Mia’s risk of self-harm”.The jury also noted that a “rare presentation of a rare condition” posed particularly complex challenges for diagnosis and care.The jurors found, on the directions of the senior coroner for South Yorkshire (West), Tanyka Rawden, that Mia’s cause of death was compression of the neck, caused by acute psychosis, caused by autoimmune encephalitis.In a statement after the inquest, Mia’s mother, Chloe Hayes, said: “It has been devastating to listen to how, when she needed specialist healthcare for the first time in her life, she was so badly let down.“She was let down at the Queen’s medical centre in Nottingham, who wrongly decided there was no underlying physical cause of her psychosis, and failed to carry out appropriate testing.“I believe they simply dismissed her and looked to pass her on to mental health services as quickly as possible, which led to her transfer to the Becton centre.”Mrs Hayes continued: “Her mental health spiralled deeper out of control there, as she was not being treated for her condition, and the many failings and lack of care meant sadly she wasn’t properly protected from harming herself.”She said: “My beautiful little girl has lost her life and I will never forgive the Queen’s medical centre or the Becton centre for failing her.”Dr Manjeet Shehmar, the medical director at Nottingham university hospitalsNHStrust, said: “We accept the coroner’s outcome in court today and apologise to Mia’s family for not identifying autoimmune encephalitis while she was in our care.“While this is an incredibly rare condition and initial tests were negative, we recognise that further testing may have had an impact on her future, for which we are truly sorry.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

ANL vehemently denies the allegations.The judge warned lawyers for the claimants he will not permit the case “to descend into a wide-ranging public inquiry” that was “guided only by what the claimants seek to shine a light on”. Nor would he allow “a series of rabbits produced out of a hat” to ambush witnesses.His warning came as he granted the claimants’ legal team permission for restricted use of records kept by the private investigator Stephen Whittamore detailing his dealings with journalists. ANL had retained the two notebooks after they were produced at the Leveson inquiry, Sherborne told the judge.The fact the claimants were not able to use the books was “wholly unjust” and a “totally unlevel playing field”, Sherborne had argued.The court has previously heard private investigator Gavin Burrows had withdrawn a statement he allegedly made for the claimants in which he is said to have claimed to have targeted “hundreds, possibly thousands of people” through voicemail hacking, landline tapping and the accessing of financial and medical information for a journalist at the Mail on Sunday.Burrows has claimed his signature on the statement was a “forgery”, an accusation dismissed by Sherborne as “scurrilous” and “a grotesque inclusion which is meant to be an attack on parts of the legal team”.The trial, in which legal costs are estimated to reach £38m, is expected to last nine weeks.Explore more on these topicsMediaPrince HarryPaul DacreDaily MailDaily Mail & General TrustNewspapersNational newspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

The OBR prides itself on our professionalism. We let people down yesterday and we’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Reuters, the agency that first published excerpts of the outlook on its news wire, revealed on Thursday how it had obtained the document.It said: “The document, which is usually published after the finance minister’s speech has ended, was uploaded to the OBR website and available to download on an unprotected link.“The link was not advertised on the website but the OBR has used the same web address, or URL, for previous budget documents, changing only the date. A Reuters reporter, in preparation for covering the budget, went to the publicly available URL shortly after 1130 GMT on Wednesday.”Hughes said Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, would provide expert input to the investigation into how the report was accidentally published. It will be overseen by the independent members of the OBR’s oversight board, Sarah Hogg and Dame Susan Rice.Budget 2025: key points at a glanceRead moreThe terms of reference for the inquiry referred to a “publication error” and said its starting point would be that “the OBR inadvertently made it possible to access the November 2025 economic and fiscal outlook (EFO) too early on budget day”.View image in fullscreenThe OBR chair, Richard Hughes, has received the chancellor’s backing despite the budget leak.Photograph: Parliament TVThe chancellor gave Hughes her backing on Thursday morning despite the breach. The incident was serious, she said, “but I do have confidence in Richard and the OBR”.The early publication of the document, about 45 minutes before the chancellor was due to deliver her budget in the House of Commons, meant details of her central policies were made public before she announced them.Hughes said: “I regret the disruption that it caused to the chancellor’s statement and parliamentary proceedings.”Hughes said he expected the investigation to report by early next week, adding that he was prepared to step down if Reeves and Hillier decided as a result of its findings that they no longer had confidence in him.The shadow chancellor said the OBR was in need of reform. Asked on LBC whether the independent watchdog was fit for purpose, Mel Stride said: “I think, generally, yes it is. I do think it needs reform.“Clearly, this latest incident is both unprecedented and deeply worrying”Reeves’s budget on Wednesday raised taxes by £26bn in response to weaker OBR forecasts and to pay for higher spending, including on scrapping the two-child limit on benefits.The chair of the business and trade select committee, Liam Byrne, told the Commons on Wednesday that Hughes should “consider his position” in light of the accidental publication.“I have to say to the House that I seriously think that Mr Hughes needs to consider his position,” Byrne, a former chief secretary to the Treasury, said. “The fact that we had a leak of the OBR forecast before this House got to debate the budget is appalling, and this uncertainty has bedevilled us.”The relationship between the Treasury and the OBR has at times been fraught in recent months, with Reeves publicly questioning the timing of its review of productivity forecasts.Sheannounced in the budgetthat the OBR would now assess whether her fiscal rules were met once a year, at the annual budget, not alongside the spring statement as usual.It was the OBR’s judgment that Reeves risked breaking her rules that prompted her to seek savings at this year’s spring statement, including £5bn of welfare cuts that had to beabandoned after a backbench rebellion.Explore more on these topicsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityBudget 2025Rachel ReevesEconomic policyEconomicsData and computer securityBudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s reminiscent of the fiscal fictions of recent years. I hope this is a government able to deliver on its plans. But I have my doubts,” she said.The chancellor’s growth mission is missing in action | Nils PratleyRead moreThe thinktank also raised questions about the government’sfuture plans for supporting children with special needs, after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) identified what it said could be a £6bn future funding shortfall.Labour MPs in Westminster absorbed the potential impact of hefty future tax increases, albeit to fund measures many welcome, including the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap.One backbencher said: “Our number one priority is supposed to be about getting the cost of living down. But this budget makes most of my voters poorer in an election year. Young people, who are going Green, are particularly screwed. I don’t understand how this is supposed to work.”Another said: “It’s been smartly designed to narrowly hit the landing zone between PLP [the parliamentary Labour party] and market kicking off. But nonetheless leaves you in the same cycle of shit.”Treasury sources pointed to Reeves’s determination to “defy” OBR forecasts and deliver stronger economic growth, potentially avoiding the need for a pre-election squeeze. She also hopes to bring down government borrowing costs by reassuring bond markets.Keir Starmersaid on Thursdaythat Reeves’s £26bn tax-raising budget had “kept to our manifesto”, but conceded that Labour had “asked everybody to contribute” in the years ahead.“That is because we need to protect our NHS to make sure that it’s there for people when they need it. Secondly, to make sure that we’ve got the money to put into our schools and … the third thing is to bear down on the cost of living,” he told Sky News.In its analysis of the budget, theResolution Foundation saidReeves’s biggest revenue raiser, the three-year freeze on income tax and national insurance thresholds, would hit poorer households harder than raising income tax rates – a policy that would have breached the letter of Labour’s election promises.“Ironically, sticking to her manifesto tax pledge has cost millions of low-to-middle earners, who would have been better off with their tax rates rising than their thresholds being frozen,” said the thinktank’s director, Ruth Curtice.A 1p tax rise would have raised the same amount of money but been less costly than freezing thresholds for anyone with an income below £35,000, she said, adding: “Indeed, all but the top 10% of the income distribution are worse off because of opting for threshold freezes over rate rises.”Some MPs have expressed concern aboutthe threshold freeze, which is expected to bring 920,000 additional people paying the higher rate of income tax, as their salaries rise.One minister said: “Millions and millions of people are fuming about the prospect of becoming higher rate taxpayers on jobs that pay just double the minimum wage. This is not the sign of a strong economy.”MPs were also sharing analysis by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), based on OBR forecasts, that showed despite the government’s cost of living measures, including cuts to household energy bills, consumers were on track for “the bleakest parliament on record for living standards”.JRF said the average household would be £850 a year worse off by 2029-30 than when Labour had come to power, with those at the top end of the income scale hit hardest, as Reeves targets them with tax rises.In Wednesday’s well-trailed budget, the chancellor said borrowing would be higher than planned for the next three years, before falling back sharply by 2029-30 when her fiscal rules are judged. She plans to achieve this through backdated tax rises, including the threshold freeze; and by squeezing Whitehall budgets.Labour is now promising to increase day-to-day departmental spending by just 0.5% in real terms in 2028-29 and 2029-30 – half the rate previously planned.Miller, of the IFS, expressed scepticism about whether that would be achievable. “Perhaps the government really will be able to find new efficiency savings. Or, maybe, when the time comes, and as the election looms, it will find that the spending plans are unrealistically low.”Contrary to expectations, the downgrade to the OBR’s economic forecasts was modest, wiping just £6bn off Reeves’s headroom against her fiscal rules by the end of the forecast period.Ministers face calls to explain how £6bn Send funding hole will be paid forRead moreMiller said that meant the “fiscal repair job” required in the budget was minor; but Reeves had chosen to increase spending, including to cover U-turns on disability cuts and the winter fuel allowance, as well as aiming to meet her rules with a much bigger buffer to spare.The Conservatives have dismissed Reeves’s budget as aimed at “Benefits Street”. However, analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) shows that 70% of the additional spending from abolishing the two-child limit will go to working families. The thinktank also said that the overall welfare budget as a share of GDP was due to remain flat, between last year’s general election and 2031.Prof Ashwin Kumar, the IPPR’s director of research and policy, said: “This was a budget for working parents who are doing their best in increasingly tough circumstances. Abolishing the two-child limit is targeted, sensible and fair. It supports families who need it most, reduces child poverty and saves the public money in the long run.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Institute for Fiscal StudiesBudgetRachel ReevesThinktanksTax and spendingLabournewsShareReuse this content"

A trade union source told the Guardian: “They’ve capitulated and there may be more to come.”The Trades Union Congress said it was prepared to accept the compromise arrangement, after days of negotiation. “The absolute priority now is to get these rights – like day-one sick pay – on the statute book so that working people can start benefiting from them from next April,” said its general secretary, Paul Nowak.A TUC source said there was a view that the six-month threshold was more workable than the more loosely defined nine-month probation period, which will be scrapped.But MPs are likely to be unnerved by the breach of Labour’s manifesto, which promised “day one” protection against unfair dismissal, while trade unions descended into infighting over the 11th-hour change.The reversal adds pressure to ministers already battling accusations that Rachel Reeves’s budget broke Labour’s pre-election promises not to raise taxes on working people.Kyle has replaced Jonathan Reynolds as business secretary, the latter having steered through the legislation with the former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner.A source close to Rayner said she would respond once she had talked to other MPs. Just weeks ago, the former deputy prime minister gave a speech in the chamber that vigorously defended day-one protections.Kyle committedon Monday to ensuring businesses would not “lose” as a result of the changes, which included a ban on zero-hours contracts and day-one protections for workers against unfair dismissal.“I will not allow it to become zero-sum, [you] give one to the other, the other loses … This has to be got right,” he said.Leaders from six major business lobby groups welcomed the breakthrough with relief, following days of behind-closed-doors meetings with the TUC, six unions and ministers at the Department for Business and Trade.In a joint statement, the lobby groups said the move was “crucial for business confidence to hire and to support employment, at the same time as protecting workers”.A union source said the changes had been agreed to allow the bill to progress faster through the House of Lords, which hassignificantly delayed the legislation. It will mean the qualifying period for unfair dismissal will be reduced from two years to six months.One senior union figure said: “If ping pong had gone beyond Christmas, sick pay from day one would have been lost from April, and other new rights could have been delayed beyond April 2027.”Another called the agreement a “good outcome” that would enshrine workplace protections in law from six months of employment. “The Tories cannot come back in and just extend the period to two years.“Bluntly, the biggest thing is there is no threat to delay the legislation – it will be in by Christmas and employers have to get behind that.”The deal marks a dramatic shift from union leaders, and exposes a schism between some of Labour’s largest financial backers. As recently as last month the TUC had been warning that a six-month period would leave more than 2 million workers at risk of unfair sacking.The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said the bill was now a “shell of its former self” as she made clear her objection to the deal reached with other trade unions. “These constant row-backs will only damage workers’ confidence that the protections promised will be worth the wait. Labour needs to keep its promises,” she said.The bill originally promised that the qualifying period for unfair dismissal would be removed altogether and the government had proposed a lighter-touch probation period that businesses could use instead, limited in law to nine months. That probation period will now be removed and the law will make it impossible for an employee to claim unfair dismissal if they have been in post for less than six months.‘Out of touch’ hereditary peers criticised for voting against workers’ rightsRead moreUnions insisted they had won concessions, including on costs, but the move is likely to anger leftwing Labour MPs who regarded the employment rights bill as a key offering.The bill has beenamended three times by Tory and Liberal Democrat peersin the Lords to accommodate key business demands. Kyle had said he would do “what it takes” to unblock parliamentary hold-ups to the bill because of Lords amendments, before then consulting on its implementation.“The voice of business, the voice of people who work in business, will be heard when we get down into the weeds of implementing those key parts of the employment rights bill. And yes, I’m talking about zero-hours contracts and day-one rights,” he said.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said it was “another humiliating U-turn”.“Labour talk about stability, but govern in chaos. No company can plan, invest or hire with this level of uncertainty hanging over them.”She said the bill still contained measures that would “damage businesses and be terrible for economic growth, and the Conservatives will fight every single one. If Labour won’t scrap the worst elements of this awful bill, we will. Britain cannot build prosperity with more and more bureaucracy.”The Department of Business and Trade said the outcome was the result of a compromise process. “The government was pleased to facilitate these discussions and to set an example of the benefits of working together, and remains committed to continue engaging with trade unions, business and employers to make working lives better, support businesses and, vitally, deliver economic growth and good job creation,” it said in a statement.Bosses had been warning that the bill would add to pressures on employers given a slowdown in the jobs market, with the potential to hit the recruitment of young and vulnerable people in particular.The six business lobby groups said: “Businesses will be relieved that the government has agreed to a key amendment to the employment rights bill which can pave the way to its initial acceptance.”However, they said there were several key points where bosses still held reservations, including on rights for zero-hours contract workers to guaranteed hours and more powers for trade union organisation.Explore more on these topicsEmployment lawEconomic policyWorkers' rightsTrade unionsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

He was granted asylum in April this year, under the Trump administration, Reuters reported.2:13US officials name soldiers injured in Washington DC shooting – videoLakanwal’s ties to the Central Intelligence Agency, which worked alongside US special forces in Afghanistan, were confirmed by the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, to media outlets.The New York Times reported that the shooting suspect had worked for several US government agencies in Afghanistan, including CIA-backed units in the southern province of Kandahar, a stronghold of the Taliban.The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources,saidthose CIA-backed units included counterterrorism squads known as the “zero units”, which were involved in combat missions to seize or kill suspected terrorists.“The Biden administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the US government, including CIA,” Ratcliffe told Fox News digital, adding that Lakanwal’s involvement with the agency was “as a member of a partner force in Kandahar, which ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation”.The two victims in the attack were named as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24. Both are members of the West Virginia national guard .Beckstrom succumbed to her injuries on Thursday evening, Donald Trump said. Beckstrom’s father hadtold the New York Timesin a phone call earlier in the day that his daughter was unlikely to recover. “I’m holding her hand right now,” Gary Beckstrom said. “She has a mortal wound. It’s not going to be a recovery.”Wolfe was fighting for his life, according to the president.Both Beckstrom and Wolfe had both been sworn into service less than 24 hours before they were ambushed at a bus stop by the suspect.A man reached at the family home of Wolfe told a reporter at the outlet: “All we need right now are prayers for my son.”Jeanine Pirro, US attorney for Washington DC, said at a news conference Thursday that the suspect had used a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver, shooting one guard member twice before turning to fire at the second.View image in fullscreenAndrew Wolfe and Sarah Beckstrom.Photograph: APShe said the two wounded national guards had “put their lives on the line to protect people they don’t even know”.Other national guard members at the scene had engaged and neutralized the suspect, she said.The suspect is under arrest and being treated at a hospital.Pirro said he drove across the US from his home in Bellingham, Washington, with a plan to conduct what she called a “brazen and targeted” assault.The prosecutor said Lakanwal would be charged with three counts of a assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Pirro said that if the national guard members do not survive, then charges could be increased to murder in the first degree.The FBI director, Kash Patel, told the news conference the agency is investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism. Law enforcement agencies had executed search warrants at the suspect’s home in Washington and in San Diego, California.“This is a coast-to-coast investigation,” Patel said.The mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, who has criticized the Trump administration’s deployment of national guard in the district, said: “These young people should be at home in West Virginia with their families.”Patel also confirmed the suspect’s relationship with US forces in Afghanistan. The investigation, he said, would include any known associates of the suspect overseas and in the US.Following the shooting, Donald Trump ordered 500 additional national guard troops to Washington DC.He was quick to cast the blame for the shooting on the Biden administration, accusing it of failing to properly vet migrants from Afghanistan. And he signalled he considered the attack justification for a broad review of asylum and green card applications.“We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country,” Trump said on Wednesday. “If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”The leaders of several federal agencies have promised reviews.US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said that it has stopped processing residency applications from Afghan nationals.“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” the agencysaid on social media.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) meanwhile it was expanding that to include a review of all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration. DHS did not clarify whether it is reviewing all asylum cases from only Afghanistan or from other countries, as well.The USCIS director, Joseph Edlow, later added he was also directing a “full-scale, rigorous re-examination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern” at Trump’s request. When asked what countries were considered “of concern,” USCIS pointed at Trump’s executive order restricted the entry to the US of nationals of 19 countries.Explore more on these topicsWashington DCUS politicsUS crimeGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The exterior was covered with more than 85,000 pieces of limestone.Hedge-fund managers, financial tycoons including Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, tech entrepreneurs including Steve Jobs, and celebrities such as Bono, Sting, Denzel Washington, and sports commentator Bob Costas called it home.Stern bucked the trend for modernist glass condominiums by the likes of Richard Meier, and again for the later fashion for ultra-tall “shadow-makers”. He chose instead to make old fashioned new again – the “traditional modern”.“It was my breakthrough,” the 84-year-old architecttold the New York Timesof 15 Central Park West in an interview for his obituary, adding that he did not use a computer and drew everything by hand.View image in fullscreen15 Central Park West, designed by Stern.Photograph: Sandra Baker/AlamyThe backers behind Central Park West, the Zeckendorf family, had figured out –said Vanity Fair– “that nothing appeals to people, particularly rich people, like something new that doesn’t look too new”. The building featured the classic layouts of old money Park Avenue apartments, along with screening rooms, copper-domed rotunda-lobby, a 75-ft pool and a waiting room for chauffeurs.At the peak of his career, Stern, who was born in Brooklyn, ran a 300-person architectural firm and produced encyclopedic volumes on the city’s architecture and served as dean of the Yale School ofArchitecture.“I became an architect because I loved the buildings of my city, New York, and imagined one day that I would make ones like them. The New York of my youth is to this day the principal subject of all my work in architecture,” he wrote in 1981.Stern also designed beach club resorts for Disney World in Florida, and his firm did the master plan for the infamous Disney “new town” of Celebration. He had wide range, designing the George W Bush Center in Dallas, the Museum of the American Revolution and Philadelphia’s 58-story Comcast Center.Small and with a high-pitched voice, Stern wore pocket squares, worn with suede loafers, butter-yellow socks, and chalk-striped bespoke suits. Modernism was not among his interests. “Many Modernist works of our time tend to be self-important objects, and that’s a real quarrel that I have,” hetoldthe New York Times in 2007. “Buildings can be icons or objects, but they still have to engage with the larger whole.“I’m not considered avant-garde because I’m not avant-garde. But there is a parallel world out there – of excellence.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

More than half of people in the UK believe the differences in people’s political views are so divisive it is dangerous for society,recent polling by Ipsos found.The changes in political polarisation resulting from exposure to X posts were measured using a novel approach. First, the academics used AI to analyse posts in X’s “for you” feed in real time. Then the system showed more divisive posts to one cohort and fewer divisive posts to another, a power normally the sole preserve of X. Divisive posts included those that showed support for undemocratic practices, partisan violence, opposition to bipartisan consensus and biased evaluations of politicised facts.After a week of reading these subtly altered feeds, the researchers asked users to rank how warm or cold, favourable or unfavourable they felt towards their political opponents. The changes in “affective polarisation” were ranked at more than two degrees on a 0 to 100 degree “feeling thermometer”. This was the same amount of increased polarisation that typically occurred in the US in the four decades to 2020. Feeding users fewer posts with antidemocratic attitudes and partisan animosity decreased political division by a similar amount.Social media platforms have long been accused of encouraging divisive content to boost user engagement and therefore advertising revenues. But the research found that while there was a slight reduction in overall engagement in terms of time spent on the platform and numbers of posts viewed when divisive content was down-ranked, those users tended to “like” or repost more often.“The success of this method shows that it can be integrated into social media AI to mitigate harmful personal and societal consequences,” the authors wrote. “At the same time, our engagement analyses indicate a practical trade-off: interventions that down-rank [antidemocratic and partisan content] may reduce short-term engagement volume, posing challenges for engagement-driven business models and supporting the hypothesis that content that provokes strong reactions generates more engagement.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

On Thursday morningmore than 800flights were already delayed, most in the northern states.Although delays were expected, airports have largely recovered from the government shutdown, during which thousands of federal employees worked without pay, leading to staffing shortages.According to a winter storm watch message from the National Weather Service, heavy snow is likely to hit parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, between six and 10 inches, beginning on Friday afternoon and going through Saturday evening.The National Weather Service is warning of potentially “hazardous conditions” that may affect travel on Friday night.In the north-east of the country the temperature is likely to dip, with colder air extending across the eastern half of the US on Thursday, and reaching down to Texas on Friday or Saturday, potentially sweeping away the thunderstorms that are currently predicted.Conditions are generally expected to stay warm in most other southern states, although a storm system is expected on Saturday near the Mississippi River valley.In New England, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said it expected some rain, as well as snow in the Pacific north-west.According to a travel forecast by the American Automobile Association (AAA), around 82 million people are expected to travel this Thanksgiving weekend, by air and by road.

I don’t buy Campbell’s products barely any more. It’s not healthy now that I know what the fuck’s in it … bioengineered meat.“I don’t wanna eat a piece of chicken that came from a 3D printer.”Allegedly referring to Campbell’s employees of Indian heritage, Bally said: “Fucking Indians don’t know a fucking thing … Like they couldn’t think for their fucking selves.”Garza, who was a security analyst at Campbell’s,told a local news outlethe recorded Bally when he met him to discuss his salary and felt something was not right. He is now suing the company for unfair dismissal and is alleging that Bally made racist remarks, admitted to being under the influence of drugs at work, and retaliated when Garza tried to make a complaint about him.Campbell’s – whichrebranded last year, dropping “soup” from its name to reflect a move to selling more snack foods – apologised for the “hurt” caused by Bally’s comments, which it described as “vulgar, offensive and false”.In astatement, Campbell’s said Bally had been dismissed, adding: “This behaviour does not reflect our values and the culture of our company, and we will not tolerate that kind of language under any circumstances.”Campbell’s dismissed Bally’s allegation that the chicken used in its soups was “bioengineered”, calling the comments about its food “not only inaccurate – they are patently absurd”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brian Naugle, tournament director of the Insperity Invitational in Houston and a longtime colleague, said Zoeller’s daughter notified him of the death on Thursday.Zoeller, born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr in New Albany, Indiana, was one of golf’s most outgoing characters across a career that delivered historic highs. He was the first player in more than four decades to win the Masters on his debut, claiming the 1979 green jacket after a three-man playoff. Five years later at the US Open at Winged Foot, he outlasted Greg Norman in an 18-hole Monday playoff after famously waving a white towel from the fairway, believing Norman had just holed a birdie putt to beat him. It turned out to be a par, and Zoeller won by eight shots the next day.US president Donald Trump, who often praised Zoeller, posted a tributeon Truth Social. “Very sad to hear that the highly respected and beloved Professional Golfer, Fuzzy Zoeller, has passed away,” he wrote, citing Zoeller’s major victories and calling him “a truly remarkable person and player”.But for all of Zoeller’s success and easygoing charm, it was the 1997 Masters that irrevocably altered his standing in the sport. As Woods marched toward atransformative, record-breaking victoryat Augusta National, a relaxed Zoeller – drink in hand – was stopped by a CNN crew near the clubhouse and asked for his thoughts. His reply, delivered with a smile and a snap of his fingers, sparked immediate outrage.“That little boy is driving well and he’s putting well,” Zoeller said, before adding that Woods should be congratulated, then joking that officials should “tell him not [to] serve fried chicken next year … or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve.”Zoeller apologized, but the blowback only grew as it took Woods two weeks to address the remarks while traveling. Zoeller later said he received death threats for years. InGolfDigest in 2008, he called it “the worst thing I’ve gone through in my entire life,” adding: “If people wanted me to feel the same hurt I projected on others, I’m here to tell you they got their way.”He said he had “cried many times” and offered “countless” apologies for words he described as a misguided attempt at humor that did not reflect who he was. “Still, I’ve come to terms with the fact that this incident will never, ever go away.”View image in fullscreenFuzzy Zoeller is congratulated by his caddie during the 1979 Masters in Augusta, Georgia.Photograph: Augusta National/Getty ImagesZoeller’s playing record extended well beyond his two major triumphs. He won eight additionalPGA Tourtitles, captured two PGA Tour Champions victories including a Senior PGA Championship, and represented the United States in three Ryder Cups. Known for playing quickly and whistling between shots, he cultivated an image of a player who both competed hard and relished the walk.His 1979 Masters win remains one of Augusta’s most enduring debuts. Arriving as a first-time competitor, he reached a playoff after Ed Sneed bogeyed the final three holes. On the second extra hole, Zoeller stiffed his approach to six feet and rolled in the winning birdie, tossing his putter skyward in celebration. “I’ve never been to heaven,” he once said. “I guess winning the Masters is as close as I’m going to get.”At Winged Foot five years later, he believed Norman’s 40-plus-foot par putt on the 18th was a birdie that had beaten him and responded with a theatrical white-towel wave from the fairway. After an official told him the score, Zoeller forced the playoff and dominated, though he later joked that he regretted giving away the now-famous towel.Zoeller played college golf first at Edison Junior College and later at the University of Houston, then a powerhouse programme. He turned professional in 1973. His wife, Diane, died in 2021. He is survived by three children, including his daughter Gretchen, with whom he often played in the PNC Championship. He was awarded the USGA’s Bob Jones Award for sportsmanship in 1985.Explore more on these topicsGolfTiger WoodsDonald TrumpPGA TourUS sportsShareReuse this content"

She later took a photo of Kilde with Odermatt, who was congratulating the Norwegian on his return to competition.Kildeunderwent surgeryfor a severe cut and nerve damage in his right calf and two torn ligaments in his shoulder after the crash at the classic Lauberhorn downhill in Wengen. He has since said his leg will never be the same again and that there is limited in movement in his shoulder.Given that backdrop, it was an encouraging display by Kilde on a course that is well known to most of the speed racers because it’s been frequented as a training site by all of the top teams in recent years.It was the first of nine super-Gs in a season interrupted by the Olympics. Beaver Creek in the United States hosts the second race next month.It was a 47th World Cup victory for Odermatt, and his 16th in super-G.According to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, it was Odermatt’s 26th podium finish in super-G, tying him for third place with Norway’s Kjetil Jansrud on the men’s all-time list behind Hermann Maier and Aksel Lund Svindal.Explore more on these topicsSkiingMikaela ShiffrinUS sportsShareReuse this content"

For a fanbase that’s grown accustomed to looking up at the division rival Green Bay Packers and looking ahead to the next season’s prospects, it’s reason to smell the roses and indulge in some light strutting. But even as fans find themselves looking forward to the Bears’ first playoff berth in five years, something that once seemed unthinkable with a second-year quarterback and a rookie head coaching helming a squad that managed only five wins last year, no fan is thinking the 2025 Bears have a Super Bowl run in them – not without a rap song to lay the marker down.Before the 1985 edition of the Bears romped to victory in Super Bowl XX, they tempted fate by recording The Super Bowl Shuffle. Although the song only peaked at 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts,the accompanying videocame to rival Michael Jackson’s Thriller for popularity as it popped up endlessly on TV during the Bears’ title run. “The Super Bowl Shuffle went viral in an age where there was no viral existence like we know it today,” the song’s recording engineer, Fred Breitberg, says. “It was a phenomenal entity as well as being a good record.”The Shuffle is HBO’s Behind the Music deep dive into the 1980s banger. (At 40 minutes, the film is about as long as one of those VH1 classic episodes, too.) For younger crowds who may struggle to appreciate how a seven-minute rap line-dance song performed by stiff football players could dominate the airwaves, understand: this was back when hip-hop was just catching on, music videos were making radio stars and the ’85 Bears were chock-a-block with colorful characters like Sweetness (hall of fame tailback Walter Payton), the Punky QB (Pro Bowler Jim McMahon) and the Fridge (335lbs defensive tackle William Perry). It was a dizzying level of enthusiasm that recalled the frenzied days of Beatlemania, in Chicago anyway.Of course, those Bears never would have been so endearing if they hadn’t backed up those big personalities with monstrously bigger play. Anchored by a historic defense that produced four hall of famers, the Bears dominated in practically every statistical category on that side of the ball on the way to registering a plus-258 point differential – 110 points higher than the next best team. They steamrolled through every opponent except the Miami Dolphins on the way to a 46-10 clobbering of the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX.Tom Brady’s part-time side hustle with the Raiders is an unholy messRead moreThe Shuffle draws on interviews with key figures on the Bears – defensive linchpin Mike Singletary, big-play receiver Willie Gault – as well as the producers, techs and bit players involved in making the song and video. All of it was the brainchild of Dick Meyer, aChicagoperfumer who started a record label on a lark and met Gault on a music video shoot in which the Bears receiver was making a cameo. This wasn’t unusual for Gault, an ahead-of-his-time renaissance man who tried everything from modeling to ballet to harness racing.Bewitched by Gault’s adventurousness, Meyers pitched him the idea for a We Are the World-style song performed by the Bears – but Gault didn’t initially see it happening with the season already under way. But when Meyers said the proceeds would go toward a Chicago charity for struggling families, Gault agreed to rally the team behind the idea – and got about 30 of his teammates to join the project after McMahon, Payton and Singletary committed.The players knew they were tempting fate though. This was Chicago in the 1980s, after all. The baseball teams were still very much cursed, Michael Jordan hadjustjoined the Bulls and the Bears hadn’t won anNFLtitle in 22 years. In addition to the team jinxing itself, players worried about the prospect of serving up bulletin board material to their rivals. “If we don’t go to the Super Bowl,” Singletary says in the doc, “we’re gonna be the biggest idiots ever.”Meyers teed up the players for success as best he could. He repurposed a song that was already in his catalog called Kingfish Shuffle, named for a character in Amos ’n’ Andy minstrel shows – a jarring choice for a team largely composed of Black players, in retrospect. Meyers had the song rewritten to draw on themes from the Bears’ season and gave us lines likeThey call me Sweetness / And I like to dance / Runnin’ the ball is like makin’ romance,and from The Fridge: I may be large / But I’m no dumb cookie.The players laid down their tracks at Meyers’ basement recording studio a week before Thanksgiving. It was then that Pro Bowl safety Gary Fencik and others began reconsidering the logic of singing about the Super Bowl with six games still to play in the regularseason.Then came time for the video shoot at Chicago’s fabled Park West theater, which was scheduled for 3 December – the day afterthe team’s loss to Miami. The crew wasn’t sure the team would show after the bitter defeat. And when eventually they did hours later, it was without Payton and McMahon. (They were added in post-production after shooting their parts against a blue screen.)The video’s director, Dave Thompson, and his crew chief, Mike Fayette, worried that the players might be too depressed after their loss to Miami to deliver a workable performance. But Singletary, nicknamed ‘the Samurai’ for his fearsome intensity, rallied his charges and even directed some choreography, a big challenge for this group. The final cut makes a point of not holding focus on any of their dance moves for longer than two seconds. “That’s as long as they could keep their hands moving to the left, and keep their hands moving to the right,” Fayette said.What began as a desultory obligation for many of the players wound up becoming a morale-booster. “That was the fun part, working together in a totally different realm,” Singletary says in the doc, reflecting on his noble choreography effort. “There were guys that were backups teaching guys that were starters. We mixed in a way that we had never had a chance to before, and it became a rallying point that brought us together, got us refocused.”In the end, there was no holding The Super Bowl Shuffle back. It was everywhere on Chicago radio a week after the shoot wrapped, and then all over TV after that. You really had to be there, and I was (albeit just five years old at the time). I can remember going to playdates and birthday parties in later years, and friends playing their 45 rpm records and VHS copies of the tune on a loop. In 1985 though, the players were kicking themselves for going against their instincts not to tempt fate. But after a while, they began to see the song less as a football folly than as a standard to which they could hold themselves accountable, like Babe Ruth calling his shot. When other teams began dropping copycat songs – not least the Super Bowl runner-up Patriots – the Bears knew they had taken the right approach.The rest is football and music history. After the Bears delivered what at the time was the most lopsided Super Bowl victory in history, The Super Bowl Shuffle earned a Grammy nomination for best R&B performance by a duo or a group with vocals at the 1987 awards ceremony – and (correctly) lost out to Prince’s Kiss. It also raised more than $300,000 for charity (worth around $900,000 now). But most importantly, it inspired a raft of imitation songs from NFL teams down the years – although none of them would drive the same cultural heft. If this season’s Bears can somehow manage to pull off the unthinkable and engineer a Super Bowl upset in Santa Clara this coming February, well, their fans will be shuffling in the streets all over again.The Shuffle is streaming now on HBO in the US. It will air on HBO Max in the UK when the service launches there next year.Explore more on these topicsChicago BearsNFLUS sportsChicagofeaturesShareReuse this content"

But we’ve got to hold down the fort.”Curry and Amen Thompson went down hard under the basket with 3:24 remaining and the game tied at 91 after Thompson’s drive to the hoop, which initially was whistled an offensive foul. Houston challenged and the call was overturned to a block by Curry.Kerr said he could see Curry ailing after that play. The two-time MVP finished with 14 points on 4-for-13 shooting – 2 of 9 on 3-pointers – seven rebounds, five assists and seven of the Warriors’ 16 turnovers that led to 22 Houston points.View image in fullscreenStephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors lays on the floor in pain after colliding with Amen Thompson during the fourth quarter of Wednesday’s NBA Cup game.Photograph: Thearon W Henderson/Getty Images“That’s a challenge, if Steph is out everybody else has to kind of improve their game a lot to fill that void,” rookie Will Richard said.Guard Gary Payton II also suffered a sprained left ankle that limited him to just under five minutes.Jimmy Butler said “it’s just sad” how the Warriors don’t follow their game plan and do the little things sometimes and challenged everybody to ”care more” about the details – especially if they’re without Curry.“What will change the most? I think we’re going to have to be damn near perfect. We ain’t going to have the ultimate bailout on our team, but even when he is on the floor we’re going to have to do our job because we make the game real difficult.

McLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella, has denied the team took “excessive risks” with their car in Las Vegas.The race in Nevada last weekend was won by Verstappen but Norris took a strong second and Piastri fourth. However, four hours afterwards, following an investigation by the FIA, both were disqualified after the skid blocks on the floor of their cars were found to have been worn down below the 9mm limit defined in the rules.How did McLaren get it so wrong with their cars in Las Vegas? | Giles RichardsRead moreVerstappen had been 49 points behind Norris going into the meeting but with Norris and Piastri stripped of their points he is now only 24 behind, the same deficit as Piastri, as the season enters its penultimate round in Qatar. Norris can still close out the title here but maintained he felt no extra pressure from Verstappen’s proximity in the title race.“We’ve treated him as a threat the whole year even when he was a few more points behind,” he said. “We treat him as a threat because we know what he’s capable of, we know what Red Bull is capable of, so therefore nothing changes now because he’s still the threat he’s always been through the whole year.“There’s no point in trying to treat it any differently because we’ve been doing a good job and I’m very happy with the job we’ve all been doing. We know what areas we need to do better, we know what things we need to improve on. I don’t feel like I had a bad weekend last weekend or we had a bad result, so that’s a good thing.”Norris’s chances did take a blow in Las Vegas, however. But for the miscalculation, he would have come to Qatar with a 30-point lead over Piastri and 42 over Verstappen, giving him a much greater chance to seal the title and he admitted it had been a blow.“Of course it hurts,” he said. “There’s a lot of effort that goes into every weekend from everyone, including myself, and it certainly made all that effort feel like it disappeared very quickly. But it’s the same feeling for all of us, the mechanics, the engineers, myself, everyone inMcLarenfeels let down by what we had as a result.“We’re all disappointed but actually I found it quite easy just to move on and have a few days off and come to this weekend.”View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri was adamant he would be fighting for the title as strongly as his teammate Lando Norris.Photograph: Darko Bandić/APPiastri expressed similar feelings but was unequivocal that as things stood he would not make any sacrifices to help Norris in a fight with Verstappen, when asked if he would be prepared to help his teammate. “We’ve had a very brief discussion on it and the answer is no,” he said. “I’m still equal on points with Max and I’ve got a decent shot of still winning it if things go my way, so that’s how we’ll play it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which does at least raise some tantalising questions. Mainly, what is this Liverpool team going to look like when he gets there, when a state of full confusion is finally attained, when even Slot’s confusion stops being confusing and reveals its diamond-cut final form.A 4-1 home defeat, Liverpool’s ninth in the past 12 games, felt like a step towards that promised end. Or at least confirmation their season has now reached the gallows humour phase – one of those periods where events haven’t just run away from you, but appear to be openly mocking your best efforts to catch up.‘I’m feeling safe’: Arne Slot insists he retains Liverpool’s support after PSV humiliationRead moreVirgil van Dijk had called for a back-to-basics clarity against PSV Eindhoven, doing the simple stuff, paring it all back. Cue an extraordinary overhead netball‑style Van Dijk handball five minutes in, followed by a bafflingly entitled whinge at the referee over the ensuing penalty kick.He has always been the barometer of this team’s good health. Less Van Dijk is always more. Ideally, he is not playing at all, just chugging about in a vaguely supervisory role.He was all over the place, booked for a poor challenge, whirling around like a broken robot for PSV’s third goal. Even his breezily carefree half-time TV advert for a holiday booking app felt jarringly off message. At least do something back-to-basics, Virg. Do an advert for hammers, or gruel, or quadruple-ply incontinence pants.Slot still seemed confused at the final whistle, albeit fluently and discursively consumed, like the captain of an irreversibly sinking ship who seems interested above all in certain key engineering oddities.But confusion still does not seem the right response to all this becauseLiverpoolare nothing if not predictable right now. They get overpowered and outrun in every game.The second and third goals were so familiar in their frailties it feels unfair to accuse, say, Arsenal, of relying on predictable routes to goal. What exactly was this then, this re-run, this set move, as Mo Salah went to challenge for a loose ball on the left and watched as Anass Salah-Eddine swished past like a man absent-mindedly dodging a high street traffic cone before producing an alarmingly simple scoring pass for Couhaib Driouech.Was this really confusing? Because it felt quite a lot like deja vu, a direct consequence of refusing to drop your non‑combatant star attacker; and another clear case of cause and effect on Liverpool’s right, where playing behind Salah has become an exercise in pure footballing pain for whoever is unfortunate enough to inherit the role that week.The third goal involved the repeat spectacle of Ibrahima Konaté trying to turn and chase back, on one of those days where he appears to have put his legs on back to front. Here is a footballer who has lost form, confidence and physical edge, but has to stay in the team because a summer of Gatsby-style spending also involved not having enough centre-backs by the time August came around. It can only be assumed that Real Madrid do not watch the telly much.Apart from a good period before half-time, Liverpool found opponents with the perfect strengths to expose their own weaknesses, a vigorous press, unceasing energy and quick breaks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool’s success under Jürgen Klopp was based around always being more intense. Now they are always less intense. The only real questions now are where has this come from and is it fixable? Both of which speak to whether there is any real point in persevering with their title‑winning manager, caught now in a startling state of turnaround.But it is also important not to confuse outcomes with causes. The final form, the most visible endgame, is a confused, jaded underpowered team. To talk about standards and players doing more, about easy notions of cowardice and character flaws. But there are obvious root causes.Selling Jarell Quansah, who helped keep Erling Haaland quiet on Tuesday, and spending a record fee on a centre-forward you don’t need. Well, here’s what that looks like.New players have come in, too many of them, a dilution of the collective will. But this comes from the manager too, whose entire job is to preserve the culture.It looks if not irreversible, then in need of a hard reset. There is no method, no actual team, just a Frankenstein’s monster of off-cuts.Slot’s Liverpool are nice to play against. All their games look losable. Can he really fix the malaise he has overseen, which he apparently didn’t see coming? Which is still a source of such confusion? There is enough talent in the squad to build any kind of team you like, but this seems to be a major part of the problem. And this felt like a moment, possibly, of no return.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotChampions LeagueFootball tacticsanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is Liverpool’s worst sequence of results since an identical run in 1953-54 and has heightened the pressure on Slot before Sunday’s Premier League trip to West Ham.Who are the worst champions in Premier League history?Read moreSlot admitted after Wednesday’s home reverse that he would have to see how his employers assessed the situation in their next conversation. At a press conference to preview the West Ham game on Thursday, scheduled before the PSV defeat, he claimed their stance remained unchanged. “We’ve had the same conversations as we’ve had since I’m here,” he said. “Not sure if I said it last night, but we fight on. We try to improve, that’s what we all try, but the conversations have been the same as they’ve been for the past one and a half years.”Slot conceded that the pressure is rising amid Liverpool’s worst run for 71 years, yet denied being let down by his players or that morale has deserted them.“I didn’t see morale being low at the start of the game or at 1-0 yesterday but after the third, fourth or fifth knock I saw a very difficult five to 10 minutes,” he said.“We were able to generate enough chances at 2-1, after more knocks, to make it 2-2 but at 3-1 I could see it hurt the players and it wasn’t a period where our fighting spirit was at its best, and that’s putting it mildly.”Despite that admission, and some poor body language at the end of both defeats, the head coach believes the Premier League champions have not lost their fighting spirit and remain committed.Slot, who expects to have Alisson back from illness on Sunday and could have Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz available, said: “In the first 85 minutes, or for large parts of the [PSV] game, I saw a team that have had a lot of setbacks recently and were still able to fight against that.“Not always with the end product you would like because fighting is of course part of what you should do but if fight was enough to win a game of football then it would be quite easy. You need a little bit of something extra as well, you need quality playing one-v-ones, getting crosses in the box and arriving with the right timing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lot has happened since Trevor Francis’s stooping header clinched the European Cup in Munich in 1979 but Forest still, rightfully, cherish those days. A lot has also changed in the five weeks since Sean Dyche took the reins, Forest reinvigorated and another comfortable win, this time courtesy of goals from Ryan Yates, Arnaud Kalimuendo and Nikola Milenkovic, enhanced their hopes of qualifying for the Europa League knockout phase.For Forest, this victory – against aMalmöside who had not played for almost three weeks after finishing sixth in their domestic league – represented a third straight win in all competitions and further built on the momentum gained from last weekend’s success at Liverpool. For the third successive match, they also scored three goals. This was a rerun of Forest’s European Cup triumph in name but the game itself was free of jeopardy or jitters. Malmö did not muster a single touch inside the Forest 18-yard box and their sole shot, a sixth-minute effort by Sead Haksabanovic, was distinctly forgettable.Nottingham Forest v Malmö, Rangers v Braga, and more: Europa League – liveRead moreThis was an occasion dripping in nostalgia, an eagerly awaited reunion and a third competitive meeting between the teams since the European Cup final 46 years ago. Forest lent into the history, too. They made a fuss of the heroes of 1979, giving them as well as their Malmö counterparts the red-carpet treatment, with 13 members of the Swedish club’s squad from then also in attendance. Forest gave Frank Clark, Colin Barrett and co a rousing reception when they gathered on the pitch 15 minutes before kick-off and there was a typically superb tifo in the Trent End to boot.“30th May 1979, John Robertson crossed it in from the left,” read half a giant banner, in block capitals, and while nobody needed reminding what happened next, the rest of it was unfurled as the players emerged from the tunnel. “And there’s Francis,” it read. Another brilliant tifo depicted Brian Clough observing events beside his assistant Peter Taylor on a bench at the Olympiastadion.View image in fullscreenRyan Yates puts Nottingham Forest in front in the 27th minute with his first goal in Europe.Photograph: Rui Vieira/APSo, Forest had drunk in those beautiful memories, but what about the performance on the night? It was rather good, too. Forest were in complete control from the moment Kalimuendo whistled an effort wide inside two minutes and had established a two-goal lead at the interval. It felt fitting that Yates, who joined Forest aged eight, made the first dent in the Malmö defence led by their own homegrown captain, Pontus Jansson, formerly of Leeds and Brentford. Milenkovic’s attempted cross cannoned off a defender and into the path of Yates, who swept home from inside the box to register his first goal since March.Yates was involved in Forest’s second goal on the verge of the half-time interval, too, his free header saved by Malmö’s goalkeeper Melker Ellborg but Kalimuendo on hand to convert the rebound from close range. James McAtee, the midfielder handed a rare start and just his second outing since September, was the catalyst, chipping a delicious ball towards Yates at the back post.Quick GuideGlasner rues Palace misses in StrasbourgShowOliver Glasner admitted missed chances cost Crystal Palace after they slipped to a 2-1 Conference League defeat in Strasbourg.Tyrick Mitchell's first-half goal had put the Eagles on course for a third win from four European matches. But they were pegged back by the Chelsea-bound striker Emanuel Emegha and then sent packing by a first senior goal from teenager Samir El Mourabet.Crucially, Palace hit the woodwork twice with open goals to aim at after the eccentric Strasbourg goalkeeper Mike Penders, on loan from Chelsea, went walkabout. Ismaïla Sarr's 30-yard shy at an empty net hit the foot of a post and Adam Wharton's half volley crashed back of the crossbar.Palace manager Glasner told TNT Sport: \"It's easy, when you have twice the empty goal in front of you and you miss the goal twice hitting the post. Could be, should be 3-1 up and then we have a big chance and in the next situation you are 2-1 down. We've had this too often, to be honest, this season that we didn't decide the game when we could decide it.\"Strasbourg, they are very good, they have very quick players, we knew it. You can concede the equaliser but then we have the next empty net goal we are missing and then we have the next big chance.\"Then you lose a game and I think that's why we deserved to lose today.\"Palace are down in 18th place in the 36-team league with six points after two wins and two defeats.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.This was Malmö’s first match since the Swedish Allsvenskan ended on 9 November and they struggled to live with Forest’s intensity. Forest made it 3-0 when Milenkovic applied the finishing touch after his centre-back partner Murillo kept alive a corner. Yates’s volley was blocked but the Serbia defender Milenkovic feasted on the leftovers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All of a sudden we’ve corrected that. We’re scoring varied goals – not every goal can be a beautiful goal and I’ve spoken to the players about that. What about finding ugly goals, scraps in the box? To change the way you can score a goal is really, really important.”Forest then went for the jugular, Callum Hudson-Odoi dinking a right-foot shot on to the crossbar before Ibrahim Sangaré sent an ambitious effort wide from 30 yards. It was that kind of night. Dyche discussed how the Forest old guard “still come out with bits of gold” at weekly get-togethers and, almost five decades on, the current crop showed they are pretty capable, too.“Our supporters were the best thing about us – they were trying to help us for the whole 90 minutes and were absolutely amazing,” said the interim Malmö head coach Anes Mravac, who will join Kim Hellberg’s coaching staff at Middlesbrough next month, after taking charge of the Swedish club for the final time against Porto next month. “I’m sad we couldn’t give them more.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueNottingham ForestMalmömatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Villa manager looks a decent bet to win this competition for a fifth time this season.It was in Berne last season that Young Boys fans reacted angrily to a Villa goalscorer when Jhon Durán netted, before being given offside, in his side’sChampions League victory.But their supporters have more history for this sort of trouble after being fined for incidents in Champions League games away to Manchester City and Celtic last season. They surely face more Uefa action after this latest episode.Emery gave the trouble the least oxygen possible – “We need respect for both sides,” the Villa head coach said. “It is not necessary to have what we had today” – but Gerardo Seoane, theYoung Boyscoach, was more forthcoming.He apologised for the crowd trouble but balanced this by suggesting they perhaps felt provoked by Villa players celebrating near their place in the lower tier of the Doug Ellis Stand.There was a five-minute hold-up after Malen’s second goal. Fighting broke out with police even as Loris Benito, the Young Boys captain, went over to plead for peace from his team’s supporters. At least three trouble-makers were escorted away by police.View image in fullscreenYoung Boys fans clash with police and stewards during a controversial first half.Photograph: Paul Currie/Colorsport/Shutterstock“It’s normal when you score a goal that you want to celebrate with your teammates,” Seoane said. “Our fans maybe took this like a provocation, but I think this is part of the football. Our fans should not react so heavily.“The referee asked our captain to go to our supporters, and he was going there to calm a bit, and some supporters came down to have a talk. [But] the police reacted like [the fans] would jump into the pitch, but it was not their intention, and I think [the police] reacted a bit early.“It’s a pity for everybody – for the provocations, for throwing the object, for thinking that somebody would jump on the pitch – and the result is not nice for anybody, and for sure we apologise. We don’t feel good.“The way our supporters are normally, it is not how we want to act when we are guests somewhere. Nobody wins at the end; everybody loses with this situation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their orchestrated clapping, drumming, pogoing and chanting had helped give the early kick-off what sense there was of a continental occasion although what followed each of the first-half goals was unacceptable by any standards.The trouble intensified after Malen doubled the lead three minutes before half-time. As the Dutch forward smiled on doing a knee-slide in the general direction of the travelling fans, they responded by ripping out seats to hurl alongside more plastic cups at the increased presence of police and stewards.It had at least been a very satisfactory half on the field for Villa as they set up a seventh successive home win. Malen, who set up Morgan Rogers’ equaliser as an impact substitute inSunday’s win at Leeds, made the most of his hour at centre-forward.Marvin Keller had had to tip over his brilliant 25-yard shot in the fourth minute and both Evann Guessand and Amadou Onana came close to opening the scoring before Malen headed in Youri Tielemans’ cross as eight players were involved in the buildup.The move for the second goal was somewhat more direct but no less aesthetically pleasing. Malen took Rogers’s superb through pass in his stride down the inside-left channel before cutting back to smash in his sixth goal of the season.Although Chris Bedia had one goal disallowed for offside, Joël Monteiro did wallop home a consolation goal, and this time VAR could not deny Young Boys their moment of celebration.After all the political backdrop to the last Europa League game here, when tickets were not on sale for Maccabi Tel Aviv’s fans in expectation of Free Palestine protests, Villa will head to Basel next month hoping for a calm trip and the three points that should safeguard the top-eight finish that would preclude any need of a two-legged play-off in February.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAston VillaYoung Boysmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Sem Steijn laid the ball off for Ayase Ueda to finish. The goal sparked a flurry of red flares flying in from outside De Kuip, which had a stand closed as UEFA punishment for fireworks use.The visitors were soon in trouble following a cross but Leo Sauer shot over from six yards. Celtic responded but Luke McCowan could not control Yang’s cross. The former Dundee player made up for his missed chances by playing a key role in Celtic’s 31st-minute equaliser. His lofted pass found Hatate, who hooked the ball to the far post where Yang netted from close range.Celtic had two major let-offs before going ahead. They were firstly caught on the break, but AyaseUeda’s shot was saved by Kasper Schmeichel. Another Ueda shot appeared to hit the hand of Callum McGregor but penalty appeals were waved away.Celtic profited from pressing Feyenoord back to their goalkeeper two minutes before half-time when Maeda charged down Timon Wellenreuther’s attempted pass and the ball broke for Hatate, who finished first time from 22 yards.Engels had a free-kick well saved before the hosts forced some sustained pressure, hitting the bar through Gaoussou Diarra’s header.The home side were growing increasingly confident until some positive play from a limping Colby Donovan set up the 82nd-minute clincher. Maeda once again disrupted Wellenreuther and the ball broke for Nygren, who fired in off the bar from eight yards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they were pegged back by the Chelsea-bound striker Emanuel Emegha and then sent packing by a first senior goal from teenager Samir El Mourabet.Crucially, Palace hit the woodwork twice with open goals to aim at after the eccentric Strasbourg goalkeeper Mike Penders, on loan from Chelsea, went walkabout. Ismaïla Sarr's 30-yard shy at an empty net hit the foot of a post and Adam Wharton's half volley crashed back of the crossbar.Palace manager Glasner told TNT Sport: \"It's easy, when you have twice the empty goal in front of you and you miss the goal twice hitting the post. Could be, should be 3-1 up and then we have a big chance and in the next situation you are 2-1 down. We've had this too often, to be honest, this season that we didn't decide the game when we could decide it.\"Strasbourg, they are very good, they have very quick players, we knew it. You can concede the equaliser but then we have the next empty net goal we are missing and then we have the next big chance.\"Then you lose a game and I think that's why we deserved to lose today.\"Palace are down in 18th place in the 36-team league with six points after two wins and two defeats.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.James Tavernier scored a penalty asRangersearned their first Europa League point of the season with a 1-1 draw at home to 10-manBraga.

The French side took the lead in the fourth minute with Abner Vinícius tapping in at the back post after Maccabi failed to deal with a ball across the six-yard box at the TSC Arena in Serbia.Tolisso nodded in a cross floated to the far post to double the lead after 25 minutes and 10 minutes later Moussa Niakhaté converted a penalty after Sagiv Jehezkel fouled Pavel Sulc. The Lyon captain then scored two in quick succession after the break and Adam Karabec wrapped up the win just past the hour mark. Maccabi, who had Jehezkel sent off in added time, are second-bottom with one point.AS RomaendedMidtjylland’s perfect record in the Europa League with a 2-1 home win.

Spurs are desperate for a victory at their stadium having won only once there in the league this season under Thomas Frank. More broadly, their home league record shows three victories in 20 matches.Vitinha’s PSG hat-trick blows Spurs away as Frank changes fail to solve riddleRead moreIt was a strange game for Spurs to analyse against PSG. The view was coloured by Frank’s team having set the bar so low with their performance at Arsenal and also because it was PSG, the star-studded, defending European champions. What was pleasing from a Spurs point of view was that they showed some attacking thrust. Richarlison scored his sixth goal of the season and Randal Kolo Muani, who is on loan from PSG, got two – his first in Spurs colours. Frank went man-for-man in midfield and there was fight and aggression.Yet Spurs were guilty of sloppy defending, especially on the concessions for 3-2 and 4-2. It was a frustration that they were not able to resist after Kolo Muani had put them 2-1 up in the 50th minute; they were 4-2 down by the 65th minute. It was a whirlwind turnaround when Spurs heads were scrambled, the lack of conviction pronounced. The defeat extended the team’s worrying run. Since the end of September, they have won three matches in all competitions out of 12, losing five.“It’s disappointing to lose games of football and we’re not happy after that one,” Gray said. “But we’ve got more positives to take from this game than the last game. We scored three goals so that was obviously pretty positive. It was always going to be a tough game, we were playing probably the best team in Europe. But we showed positives we can take into Fulham. The Arsenal game took a bit out of us but we were always going to bounce back.“The fans were unbelievable [in Paris]. They have stuck with us through a lot of hard times and we can’t thank them enough for the support they give us, especially after a few tough games. Hopefully there were a few positives that we could give them. It’s not good enough these losses at a club like Tottenham but we’re going to look to improve that.”Gray was a plus point against PSG. He pushed high in central midfield in Frank’s 4-4-2 diamond formation when Spurs had the ball, looking to make things happen, and he was involved in his team’s first two goals. Out of possession he dropped deep alongside the holding midfielder, Rodrigo Bentancur.Gray had not played since the 0-0 Champions League draw at Monaco on 22 October because of a calf injury. He started at left-back that night and has been used in numerous roles, notably at centre-half by Ange Postecoglou last season. He wants to be in midfield. It is possible to feel that Gray does not regard his versatility as a blessing.“The pressure [against PSG] was just man-to-man,” Gray said. “Find your man and stay with them. It was just trying to find the spaces where the [PSG] midfielders don’t want to track you and finding the half spaces like with the cross [for the opening goal].skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is just things to learn from and the coaching staff this year have been really helpful with individual plans and stuff like that.”Gray, who is 19, was asked whether he was conscious of the desire of the Spurs fans for their team to play entertaining football. “Yes, definitely,” he replied. “Every club wants to play entertaining football and sometimes when you play teams like PSG you have to alter that a little bit. They have that individual quality where they can take you apart in literally one moment.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

That garnered only 5,000 signatures and the 23-year-old insisted he had “taken it all in his stride”.“You are in the public eye, people can say whatever they want about you,” he said. “But being in the stadium, and how the fans have taken to me in the stadium, is unbelievable. I am not really worried about all of that. It is in the distant past. The last game versus Tottenham was incredible and that gives me such a boost. I play on the side of the pitch, I can feel them [the fans], I can hear them. When they are that positive about me it gives me a massive boost. Honestly, I am made up about it.”Arsenal head to Chelsea on Sunday with a six-point lead over them at the top of the Premier League. Madueke is in contention to start for the first time since the1-1 draw with Manchester Cityat the end of September, with doubts over Leandro Trossard’s fitness after the Belgium forward limped off against Bayern. Madueke said he was comfortable on either flank and was unsure what reception he would receive from the Chelsea supporters.“It might be a little bit hostile, it might not be, but I am a professional footballer,” he said. “I have played in loads of atmospheres. I don’t know if anything will faze me. I will just be focused on the task.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Premier League club accused French police of using pepper spray, batons and shields to subdue supporters in the wake of Tuesday night’s loss at Stade Vélodrome.A club statement said: “We will be formally raising our concerns with Uefa, Olympique de Marseille and French police in relation to the unacceptable treatment of our supporters by police at Stade Vélodrome following Tuesday’s UEFAChampions Leaguefixture.”England deserve a tide of goodwill, yet somehow Jude Bellingham is still a target | Jonathan LiewRead moreAccording to Newcastle, travelling fans were kept inside the stadium for an hour in a planned move for their safety, with groups of 500 then escorted to the metro to go to the supporters’ meeting point. However, that is when plans apparently went awry, with the post-match operation witnessed at close quarters by Newcastle’s stewards and senior staff.Newcastle’s statement said: “Once the first group of supporters was released, the police began using unnecessary and disproportionate force to stop the remainder of our fans from moving any further. This was actioned through a combination of pepper spray, batons and shields, with numerous supporters being indiscriminately assaulted by the police.“Many supporters were visibly distressed, particularly in the upper concourse area of the away sector, where crushing became apparent. Our staff immediately addressed the matter with the police, however this had limited impact on their excessive tactics.“Fans leaving the stadium rightly shared their distress, frustration and anger with our staff, and we have subsequently received deeply concerning witness reports from supporters who were in attendance. Supporter safety and welfare should always be of paramount importance, and we strongly condemn the treatment of our supporters by the police during this incident.”Marseille police said in a statement they maintained a friendly attitude with Newcastle fans but that a crowd surge prompted riot police to intervene.“At one point, towards the end of the operation, in the visitors’ section, a crowd surge required the intervention of the CRS riot police, one of whom made very limited use of tear gas, which caused discomfort to around 20 fans for a few minutes,” the police said. “Apart from this incident, no force was used and the operation went smoothly. No injuries or complaints were reported following this event.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arsenal were rampant against an opponent who have handed them so much pain in the past. The Gunners opened the scoring through their habitual set-piece goal, Jurriën Timber fulfilling the role of the absent Gabriel Magalhães. Lennart Karl, the 17-year-old, showed off his chops with a fine goal; from within Bayern have found the player they desired when they were thwarted in moving for Florian Wirtz. After that, Declan Rice and Eberechi Eze took control in midfield, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli scoring the goals, the latter a humiliation of Manuel Neuer’s sweeper-keeper stylings. Amid the fug of the extendedChampions Leaguegroup-stage format, where matches between elite clubs are routine rather than novelty, this was still a statement victory. “I think they had an incredible match against, in my opinion, the best team in Europe,” Mikel Arteta said of his players. That status surely now lies with his team: Arsenal top the group-stage table with a 100% record.The recriminations at Anfield snowball. Arne Slot now bears the unfortunate nickname of “Arne Lost”, following Liverpool’s ninth defeat in 12. Credit, though, belongs to PSV Eindhoven. The club dominating the Eredivisie stuck to their tactical plan, cuttingLiverpoolto ribbons. While Slot has complained of his team’s vulnerability to long balls, statistics bearing that out, PSV played their own progressive, quick-passing, speedy counterattacking game to take full advantage of Liverpool’s foibles. Their coach, Peter Bosz, said of his compatriot, Slot: “We’re going to have a little drink together and then say something. Possibly something strong, hey?” PSV had collected only their third away win in 26 Champions League trips, veteran Ivan Perisic slotting an early penalty, before Guus Til cut across Milos Kerkez to complete an incisive counter. Two goals from Couhaib Driouech, off the bench, the first a rebound of a shot from fellow sub Ricardo Pepi, completed the rout.Benfica won Tuesday’s battle of fallen European giants, a 2-0 victory at Ajax, who stayed bottom of the table.José Mourinhorecorded his seventh Champions League win over Ajax, struggling badly to modernise. Samuel Dahl scored from the second ball that resulted from a corner and a toothless Ajax attack found no way back. Under the suitably named caretaker Fred Grim, who stepped in after John Heitinga’s sacking, a sorry sequence continues, with now 17 of the 34 goals Ajax conceded coming after a set piece. Benfica ended their Champions League sequence of six successive defeats, Mourinho celebrating by kissing Wesley Sneijder, his former Inter playmaker working as a TV pundit for Ziggo, on the forehead. “The kiss was for Wesley; the fatty guy is very sweet,” said Mourinho; Sneijder has filled out since retirement.Player of the weekEstevão, Chelsea. Meetings between Chelsea andBarcelonamake up a flipbook of Champions League classic moments, such as Ronaldinho’s no-backlift flick in 2005, to Lionel Messi’s coming-out party the following year in ravaging Asier del Horno. The renewal in 2025 will be remembered for one player’s brilliance, and it wasn’t Lamine Yamal, who found no way past Marc Cucurella.Estevãois three months older than Yamal and had to wait a relatively longer time for his breakthrough, though still has 100 senior appearances under his belt, but he completely overshadowed Barcelona’s jewel with a special goal, jinking through defenders to crash home. On a week where Kylian Mbappé scored four against Olympiakos, Vitinha completed a hat-trick as PSG beat Tottenham 5-3, the Spurs manager Thomas Frank hailing the Portuguese as the “best in Europe”, while Randal Kolo Muani scored twice for Spurs against his parent club, the week still belongs to the Brazilian.They said it“It was a special atmosphere, remembering Diego Armando Maradona. We all wanted to honour his memory in the best way. So I am happy about how it went.” – Antonio Conte speaks after his Napoli team beat Qarabag 2-0 on the fifth anniversary of Maradona’s death, Scott McTominay opening the scoring for the Italian champions, who are in 20th place, and trying to haul back up the table.The pundit’s chair“Crisis is a very strong word. That’s disrespectful to this team and the manager who won the title last year. I won’t use this word just yet. You can’t deny this team is struggling. Unless the manager can find answers and stability in this team, it’s going to continue.” Steven Gerrard, Liverpool legend, stays diplomatic on TNT Sports in the UK.“Watch Konaté here, oh my god… I’ve had enough of them, that Konaté, that’s a sackable offence for the manager to keep picking him … he should be sacked for that.” Caught on CBS’s candid camera, Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher is rather less diplomatic about Liverpool.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

City, in wobbly form, face three Premier League matches before travelling to face Real Madrid on 10 December, and could do with a win to climb into the top eight and avoid an extra two-legged tie. The storm around Madrid coach Xabi Alonso, his team squeaking past Olympiakos in a 4-3 win, may well be whipped back up by the time Guardiola comes to town.The other Spanish giant, Barcelona, are dangerously low in the table – 18th – with their freewheeling coach, Hansi Flick, also under pressure. His high-line strategy had little answer to Chelsea’s muscle on Tuesday. Eintracht Frankfurt, in 28th, need a win in the new Camp Nou to keep their hopes alive.Sporting are the surprise team in the top eight, the Portuguese champions beating Brugge 3-0 this week. They travel to wounded Bayern, with striker Luis Suárez, a well-travelled Colombian, once of Watford, proving a decent replacement for Viktor Gyökeres.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalLiverpoolChelseaBarcelonaJosé MourinhoBayern MunichfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That much was acknowledged in July when the former Grenadiers team principal Brailsford, making his return to the Tour de France, admitted that after his sojourn at Manchester United, he had “a lot of catching up to do”.Ineos Grenadiers have not won a Grand Tour since 2021 and the once-dominant team have been criticised by Thomas himself and former staff for falling behind the four-time Tour de France winner Pogacar and his rivals, Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel.“Ineos are not where they want to be, nor where they need to be and the gap is not small,” the ­aerodynamics guru Dan Bigham said, after ­announcing he was leaving the team in 2024.Thomas’s new position was first mooted in 2024 when he told the Guardian the team’s managementwas “like a coalition government”and that “it was a lot more straightforward with Dave at the top. There was clarity with everything.”Brailsford’s long-standing working relationship with the Welshman has been key to his recruitment. “Geraint knows what the process takes, how to deal with the highs and lows of elite sport and his willingness to now share this and mentor others to do the same is a great asset for the team,” said Brailsford.Explore more on these topicsTeam IneosGeraint ThomasDave BrailsfordCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Two of the sessions – Monday and Wednesday – will take place after dark so players can get used to seeing the pink Kookaburra ball under lights.It represents a break from England’s usual pattern of training three days before a Test match. But as well as the vagaries of floodlit cricket, it will also allow players to acclimatise to playing in the increased humidity of Brisbane that has seen a number of electrical storms hit the city in the past week.The challenge may also increase with regards to their opponents amid a growing expectation that Pat Cummins will be added to Australia’s squad when it is named on Friday. Cummins has not played since July after the detection of a lower back “hotspot” but trained with his teammates before Perth and has since been seen bowling with a pink ball in Sydney.One-nil up in the series, and with England having not won at the Gabba since the victorious 1986-87 tour, the hosts may yet hold Cummins until the third Test in Adelaide. Australia’s regular captain may well be the only addition to the group, albeit with Usman Khawaja still needing to prove his fitness following the back spasms that blighted his outing in Perth.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Such contracts would offer no security to the players, as well as keeping them on the same salary for three years even if they enjoyed a stellar first season.Such three-year deals with a 12-month release option are standard practice in India, where there is no players’ association. The Board of Control for Cricket in India recognised the Indian Cricketers’ Association six years ago, but membership is restricted to former players. Current players have no representation.The PCA has been shown draft versions of the players’ contracts, but has yet to sign them off and is understood to be pushing back against the release clause, leading to delays in players signing.There are concerns at the PCA about players losing out either through being effectively dismissed 12 months into a three‑year deal or being retained on terms below their market value.Jos Buttler found himself in the latter situation at the start of his career in the IPL, being held for three years by Mumbai Indians on the relatively modest salary of £385,000 following his international breakthrough.The Hundred owners had hoped to reach an agreement on player contracts before the new salary bands were announced last month, with each franchise’s overall budget increasing to £2.05m in the men’s competition and £880,000 in the women’s, but that has not been possible. The standoff has already led to some signings being delayed, with players refusing to sign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now they’re in the NFLByNo Helmets RequiredGavin WillacyThu 27 Nov 2025 07.21 ESTShareThe United States is a country of immigrants but theNFLremains dominated by players born in the USA. Only 5% of players are born abroad and the majority of them make the step into the sport by going to college in the US. True outsiders are unusual and foreign coaches are especially rare, which makes James Cook’s story remarkable.Cook has been in charge of player development atCleveland Brownsfor the past six months. That’s an achievement in itself but it’s extraordinary considering he grew up in Surrey, is in his late 20s and never played professional sport. Cook discovered the NFL as a 12-year-old when he was channel-flicking with his dad and came across “this weird and wonderful” sport. He started playing locally and soon wanted to become the first NFL quarterback born in Europe. He got as far as playing for Great Britain but his plans to go to college in the US proved financially prohibitive.Instead, he volunteered to help NFL’s nascent International Player Pathway (IPP) – the programme set up in 2017 to recruit players from abroad – all while working in a local cinema. “I was scooping popcorn, cleaning seats, flipping burgers, doing a bit of everything. Any time the NFL guys wanted me, I would switch my shifts and help out. Being a quarterback, the one thing I had was I could throw. So when they worked out with players, I’d show up all over London and throw the ball to them. I wasn’t paid but they’d usually buy me lunch.”View image in fullscreenJames Cook worked with Charlie Smyth, who swapped Gaelic football for placekicking in the NFL.Photograph: Brooke Sutton/Getty ImagesThis is where he met Aden Durde, who had stints with the Carolina Panthers and Kansas City Chiefs in his playing days before he set up the IPP programme in 2017 with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora. When Durde joined the staff at the Atlanta Falcons, becoming the first British full-time coach in NFL history, Cook took over the IPP. “I had a lot of fun with it, working with some really interesting guys,” he says. “We hadLouis Rees-Zammit;Travis Clayton, who got drafted by Buffalo;Charlie Smyth, the kicker from Ireland who’s now with the Saints. I went to Australia to work with younger players from around the Pacific to get them into college football, like I wanted to do.”The Super Bowl Shuffle at 40: how a goofy rap classic boosted the Bears’ title runRead moreLike Durde before him, Cook made the jump from working with foreign players to coaching in the NFL. “The Browns called out of the blue,” he says. “They had a hybrid role supporting younger players, maximising time on the practice field, collaborating with physios, the head coach and general manager. It’s a really hands-on role, which is perfect for me. My background was working with international athletes who had never played the sport. First-year rookies also have to build structure and routines: how to look after their body and deal with a huge playbook. But also just being present for guys. That’s the same everywhere. And I love that.”Does being an Englishman who did not play in the NFL hold him back? “It’s more of a perceived hurdle than an actual one,” says Cook.“I’ve had a lot of reverse Ted Lasso jokes and loads of players call me ‘bruv’ as they love that. It’s more about checking myself. I say ‘trash can’ not ‘bin’. But we get nervous or stressed about the same things and need support in the same ways. If players know you can help them, they don’t care where you’re from or what accent you have. And when people know that you care, all the other stuff melts away.”View image in fullscreenJordan Mailata, a former IPP player, won the Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles.Photograph: Mitchell Leff/Getty ImagesComing from outside the NFL bubble has its advantages. “I spoke in front of the entire team very early on and, as we walked out, one of our offensive linemen wanted to talk rugby with me as he loves it. You make those connections and build relationships. People are genuinely intrigued. NFL buildings are more diverse than people think. We have people from all sorts of backgrounds, a range of upbringings. Our mantra at IPP was: ‘Be uncommon – you are different so lean into it.’ It’s something to celebrate.”The NFL has been more successful at producing foreign fans than developing foreign players. Jordan Mailata, a former rugby league player from Sydney who won the Super Bowl earlier this year with thePhiladelphia Eagles, is one of the few IPP players to have made it to the very top.View image in fullscreenBobby Howfield swapped football in England for the NFL, playing for the New York Jets in the early 1970s.Photograph: Focus On Sport/Getty ImagesForeign players have usually been kickers, recruited from other football codes.Bobby Howfieldswapped playing up front for Watford and Fulham for being a placekicker for the Denver Broncos and New York Jets;Mick Luckhurstgraduated from rugby union in St Albans to the Atlanta Falcons team. If you do not want to be a kicker and were not educated in the US college system, it’s extremely difficult to make the leap to the NFL.Ayo Oyelola, a Londoner who played for Chelsea’s youth team before discovering American football at Nottingham University, has made that step. He played in the Canadian Football League for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers before taking his talents to the Jacksonville Jaguars and Pittsburgh Steelers.Maximilian Pircher’s story is just as unlikely. At 6ft 7in and 23 stone, the Italian was clearly not built for his favoured sports, football and handball, so took up American football in his late teens. He impressed while playing for clubs in Austria and Germany, as well as the Italy team, and was offered a place on the IPP in 2021.A year later, he had his hands on the Vince Lombardi Trophy as a member of the LA Rams practice squad. Pircher went on to have spells on the fringes at the Detroit Lions, Seattle Seahawks and Washington Commanders, before he joined the Minnesota Vikings at the end of August. He has been popular in every locker room but is yet to see action on the field. Is being a foreigner still a challenge?“It’s not really difficult, not an obstacle,” says the 26-year-old. “We have players from all different states, so it doesn’t really matter. At first, they ask: ‘You got an accent –where are you from? But, once we have that figured out, we’re all friends. The Vikings have a really welcoming culture, a great team, a great organisation.”Despite spending most of training with his fellow offensive linemen, Pircher has thrown himself into the social mix at his clubs. “Obviously the O-line is always very tight because we are unit and altogether one, but we have friends from every position group. My best friend, Landen Akers – my best man, actually – played wide receiver at the Rams. Thelong snapperfrom the Packers, Matt Orzech, is a really good friend: we lived together for two years at the LA Rams. Quarterbacks, defensive linemen, special teams: we’ve got to be there for each other.”View image in fullscreenMaximilian Pircher on the practice squad at the Minnesota Vikings.Photograph: Andy Kenutis/Minnesota VikingsPircher is aware he represents more than just Italy and Austria.“I would say all the countries outside the United States. The better each one of us from the IPP does, the more young people who play football in Italy, in Germany, wherever, can see: ‘Oh it is possible – if I put the work in every day, I can get somewhere.’ I have a lot of kids hitting me up, asking for tips. It’s nice to inspire them to experience what I’ve experienced.”The IPP graduates are all invited to Florida each year to coach the next wave of potential NFL outsiders. “Almost all of us come back every year, including Jordan [Mailata], to teach the new people and help them out, tell them things we experienced,” says Pircher. “The international programme is like a family. We are giving back what the programme gave to us. We will be thankful for ever.”Cook is adamant that overseas players have a bright future in the NFL. “It’s going to happen,” he says. “It’s a matter of when, not if. Why not a German quarterback? Why not a Japanese wide receiver? The NFL is for big, fast, strong, diligent, intelligent, hard-working, structured individuals – and those aren’t traits unique to one geographical location. Talent and skill is distributed across the world, but opportunity isn’t. The NFL’s job is to provide opportunity. I can’t wait to watch it happen.”Follow No Helmets Required onFacebookExplore more on these topicsNFLGuardian Sport NetworkUS sportsCleveland BrownsPhiladelphia EaglesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has resulted in a firestorm of recriminationsJonathan YerushalmyWed 26 Nov 2025 19.01 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 19.03 ESTShareWhenXrolled out a new feature revealing the locations of popular accounts, the company was acting to boost transparency and clamp down on disinformation. The result, however, has been a circular firing squad of recriminations, as users turn on each other enraged by the revelation that dozens of popular “America first” and pro-Trump accounts originated overseas.The new featurewas enabled over the weekendby X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, who called it the first step in “securing the integrity of the global town square.” Since then many high-engagement accounts that post incessantly about US politics have been “unmasked” by fellow users.An Ivanka Trump fan account that posts about illegal immigration to the US was shown to be based in Nigeria. MAGAStorm, spreading conspiracy theories about the assassination attempt on Trump, was found to be in eastern Europe. AmericanVoice which posts anti-Islam content, is based in India.Fears AI factcheckers on X could increase promotion of conspiracy theoriesRead moreUsers have noted that a high proportion of these potentially misleading accounts – many of which claim to be in America – are operating from Asia, but experts are in disagreement over whether they may be state-backed influence campaigns or even opportunists trying to make a quick buck.Monetising ‘rage bait’In 2024 theCentre for Information Resilience(CIR) revealed that a network of accounts on X were posing as young American women, stealing images from European influencers to burnish their credibility. Often these images were manipulated to include pro-Trump hats and clothing.The new location feature on X has allowed Benjamin Strick, who ran the original investigation, to confirm that almost all of these accounts purporting to be “independent Trump supporting” women are located in Thailand.Strick noted that while promising to “follow patriots” and “stand with Trump”, these accounts often also posted anti-Islamic content too.In their 2024 report, the CIR found that these accounts exploited “pre-existing societal tensions” in their efforts to spread disinformation.“Accounts seized upon news stories relating to gender and LGBTQ+ rights, in some cases allowing them to undermine Democratic policies and promote Republican views.”Fears that foreign actors are using social media to influence US voters reached their zenith in the months after Trump’s 2016 election win over Hillary Clinton. An intelligence assessment the following year detailed the steps that the Russian state took to bolster Trump using bot farms.In the years since, experts have warned that foreign influence campaigns are becoming more sophisticated, but as America’s politics has become more partisan and voters more siloed, those warnings appear to have been forgotten.However it’s possible though that the sheer number of pro-Trump accounts around the world might have as much to do with turning a profit as political influence, says Simon Copland, a researcher at the Australian National University.“Social media is really based on attention … [and] on places like X or Twitter you can get money from that,” he says, adding that at the moment, the best way to get attention “is to be posting aboutDonald Trump.”Changes to the way X monetises its content could be a factor as well. In 2024, the platform announced that creators would now be paid based on the levels of engagement with their content. At the time, some expressed concern that this would incentivise users to create more and more controversial content.“When platforms begin to reward engagement, creators will begin posting anything that drives a discussion of some sort, including posts that are designed to enrage users, forcing them to reply or comment,” TechCrunch wrote at the time.“That’s where things like rage bait come about,” says Copland. “People deliberately induce rage to try to encourage people to go on to the platforms” and engage in the content.The calculations used to determine a user’s payments remain opaque and it’s not clear how much money overseas users posing as Maga-faithful could be making. A BBC investigation from 2024 suggested that for some, it could be thousands of dollars. Experts in southeast Asia’s disinformation space say such figures could be highly motivating for people in the region.A 2021 report into southeast Asia’s “disinformation crisis” found that many accounts pushing xenophobic and misogynistic messages to appeal to the US right were not particularly invested ideologically, but “driven by almost purely entrepreneurial motivations.”The ‘dark corners’ of the internetWhile the perpetually online cadre of Trump’s followers erupt in anger over the origins of some accounts – many of which have now been suspended – others have been left questioning why the issue matters at all.Copland points to the flow of rightwing ideas, and how policies dreamed up in dank corners of the internet can make their way to the heights of US and European politics.On the night that X began to reveal the location of accounts, Donald Trump shared a post from an account called Trump_Army_. With nearly 600,000 followers, the account regularly amplifies conspiracy theories; in a recent post it asked its followers if “JFK was killed for trying to expose the same crooks Trump is now exposing”. Soon after, another user pointed out that Trump_Army_ was based in India.It’s among the more innocuous examples, but illustrative of the way the wider ecosystem of right-wing politics operates online.“Extreme ideas start in these dark corners of the internet. They spread, they become memes, they go on to more mainstream platforms and then you see politicians pick them up,” says Copland. ‘In May, Trumpambushed South African president Cyril Ramaphosain the Oval Office, accusing him of turning a blind eye to a “white genocide” against South African farmers. These widely discredited claims are thought to have in-part originated in far-right chatrooms.“We have to be taking this stuff seriously,” he warns, because these ideas “are suddenly becoming mainstream.”X was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsXInternetUS politicsDonald TrumpAsia PacificSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

While plenty of these gadgets would make great gifts, you’ll also find plenty of opportunities to upgrade your own home, if you’re so inclined.Here are some of the best deals I’ve been able to find so far. This list will be constantly updated through November, so make sure to check back.This article was updated on 20 November with the latest prices and availability.The very best Black Friday and Cyber Monday tech dealsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAmazon Fire HD 10 tabletNow $69.99, originally $139.99 at Amazon (50% off)Whether I’m reading or watching a movie, the Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet has a beautiful screen and just the right amount of power to stream content: you don’t need much computing muscle to turn pages of a book or play back a video. It’s also very durable, so it’s great for coffee table reading. While a Fire tablet isn’t as useful as a full Android tablet, at this price it’s still a great deal, even if it only ends up as your Netflix screen to go.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJBL Live Pro 2$89.95, originally $169.95 at Amazon (47% off)JBL is an iconic name in sound, and the JBL Live Pro 2 are some of my favorite earbuds. They have excellent Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which makes it easier to listen to your music at a lower volume to avoid hearing damage. You also get excellent battery life, at up to 10 hours on a single charge, so these can be a great musical companion for the vibe-coders in your life to blot out the world for hours while they crack on the next big thing. I’d heartily recommend them at full price, so at half-off they’re a no brainer.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBlink Outdoor 4 Wireless smart security camera$51.99, originally $129.99 at Amazon (60%)Smart cameras typically come with a big trade-off: you need to either run an ugly wire to them or change the battery every couple months. But the Blink Outdoor 4 Wireless camera sidesteps both with a battery that can last up to two years. I’ve had one for about a year so far, and the battery shows no signs of stopping. You can put this camera anywhere it has access to wifi and basically forget it exists, except when you want to see what’s going on in your yard. At 60% off, it’s worth grabbing a few for different parts of the house and yard.The 11 best US Black Friday and Cyber Monday travel deals already taking offRead moreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus$24.99, originally $49.99 at Amazon (50%)The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K plus remains the single easiest way to turn a regular TV into a smart TV. Just plug it into your TV and a power source, and just like that you have access to streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, Amazon and Blink camera feeds, and of course Alexa. The ultra-simple remote makes for easy navigation, and has a built-in mic for voice commands (“Hey Alexa, play The Office.”) At 50% off, you can grab one for every TV in the house, or even one to travel with – it’s tiny.MobileView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: Samsung Galaxy Watch 8$279.99, originally $349.99 at Amazon (20%)Samsung’s latest smartwatch brings a ton of improvements to your wrist, including totally redesigned software that makes it easier to use. Like most smart watches, it can track your sleep and monitor your heart rate during exercise, but it also performs some unique feats like measuring antioxidants to help suggest dietary changes, and tracking blood-oxygen levels to flag potential health issues. It all comes wrapped in an attractive package that lasts for almost two days on a charge.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAmazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Plus Standing Cover Bundle$79.98, originally $132.98 at Amazon (40%)The Amazon Fire HD 8 is a slightly smaller version of the aforementioned Amazon Fire Tablet that’s better suited to travel. This particular bundle also includes a case with an origami-style leg to prop up the tablet up for watching shows on the go. Like the larger model, it’s mainly a media machine, so imagine it more like a portable TV than a full-fledged tablet. At this price, it’s still well worth it.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra$1,057.91, originally $1,499.99 at Amazon (25%)I review phones year-round, and this is the one I go back to when I’m not reviewing anything else. It’s simply one of the best Android smartphones. It has an amazing camera setup great for ultrawide snaps and zooming in to a crazy degree, onboard AI including Gemini Live, epic battery life (easily a day and a half), and a built-in stylus for those times you want precision in your tapping and swiping. This price tag may not seem like much of a discount since the S25 Ultra usually starts at about $1,200, but this is the upgraded model with 512GB storage, which you’re going to want.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsung Galaxy S25 FE$534.99, originally $709.99 at Amazon (25%)Samsung’s “fan edition” (FE) devices are designed for buyers who want a flagship phone experience at a lower price point. That means the S25 FE phone has most of the same chops as its larger siblings, including all the same AI tricks, and an impressive triple-camera setup that’s no joke. It’s a great value even at full price, and at 27% off one of the best phone deals out there for Black Friday.Personal audioView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: SHOKZ New OpenRun Pro 2$124.95, originally $179.95 at Amazon (31%)Bone-conduction headphones don’t go in your ears – they sit above the ear and transit crisp, clear audio with a full range of tones by simply vibrating against your head. That means you can still hear everything going on around you, making them ideal for runners. But they’re great for non-runners too – like me! I use them often on bike rides.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones$199, originally $349 at Amazon (43%)Bose has been a leader in noise-cancelling headphones for decades, and the QuietComfort series of headphones carry on the legacy. These headphones are great for frequent travelers as they can cancel out the drone of planes, trains, or automobiles, while you enjoy the film Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. You don’t often see these headphones at this price, so these would be a great pickup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like their bigger brothers, these offer outstanding active noise cancellation to drown out airplane noise, but they’re also compact and still have good battery life. Since they’re earbuds, they form a great seal in your ear canal, which passively seals out noise even when ANC isn’t active. At this price, these earbuds are hard to resist, especially when compared to their peers at $130.The best Black Friday and Cyber Monday home deals in the US – so farRead moreView image in fullscreenA pair of black Sony WF-1000XM5 EarbudsPhotograph: Courtesy of SonyWF-1000XM5 Earbuds$229.99, originally $329.99 at Sony (30%)Sony headphones are a cut above the rest in terms of sound quality: when I tested the WF-1000XM5, I heard tones in music that I had never heard before. I believe they’re the best-sounding earbuds you can buy, and the Guardian’s reviewerloved them too. Their popularity means Sony seldom needs to discount them, so 30% off is hard to ignore. If you know someone who loves music but still listens with cheap headphones, this will open a whole new world.Smart homeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: Amazon Echo Dot$31.99, originally $49.99 at AmazonOf all the voice assistants I’ve used (all of them), Alexa is the best, providing fast, accurate answers and controlling your smart home devices just as quickly. You can check the weather, get the latest news, listen to podcasts and more with just your voice. While Google Assistant and Siri have stagnated, Alexa continues to evolve and improve: An AI-enabled version called Alexa+ just rolled out this year for Prime subscribers.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonKasa Smart Light Bulbs$15.99, originally $24.99 at Amazon (36%)Lots of smart-home products are gimmicky, but wewholeheartedly recommend smart bulbs. You can have them turn on automatically at dusk, wake you up slowly in the morning as an alarm clock, or just answer to your voice commands. A multicolor bulb like this Kasa model also lets you set the mood with one of 16m colors. A two-pack for $15.99 is an instant upgrade to your home.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonTP-Link Deco X15 Dual-Band AX1500 WiFi 6 Mesh Wi-Fi System$107.99, originally $149.99 at Amazon (28%)If you have wifi dead spots in your home, a mesh wifi network is an easy modern way to fix the issue. A mesh system uses multiple access points to blanket your home in signal, and automatically switches your devices to the closest one, so you’ll no longer drop Zoom calls when you walk into that one corner of your basement. This system comes with three points, which should be plenty for most homes, but you can easily add more.Home entertainmentView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: Meta Quest 3S$329.00, originally 399.99 at Amazon (18%)Meta has been leading the way in the VR space for a decade, and the Meta Quest 3S is the most accessible headset on the market today. My favorite game isHell Horde,a first-person shooter in which demons come running at you through a hole in your living room wall. It’s wild, and there are games for all interests includingThe Climb,Beat Saber,Star Wars: Beyond Victoryand more.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: HoverAir X1 Drone$259.00, originally $439 at Amazon (39%)The HoverAir X1 is less of a drone and more of a flying camera that keeps you the center of its focus. It can fly preprogramed routes to capture the scenery around you or follow you around, dodging obstacles along the way. When I tested this drone, I rode an electric bike for five miles under and around trees, and it kept up beautifully. It’s foldable and fits neatly in a jacket pocket.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSony BRAVIA Theater Bar 6$498, originally 699.99 at Amazon (29%)Few flat-screen TVs come with sufficient built-in sound, and even if yours seems OK, a soundbar takes things to another level. This BRAVIA Theater Bar 6 comes with a separate subwoofer and two rear-channel speakers to fill your room with sound, and the rear channels are wireless for easier installation. Once you hear it, you will never want to watch TV again without it.How do Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 compare against hearing aids? I put them to the testRead moreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of WalmartHisense 75” Class H5 Series QLEDNow $378, originally $499 at Walmart (24% off)We live in an amazing time when you can buy a 75in 4K TV for under $400. This model even uses QLED technology for better color accuracy, which used to be a premium feature just a few years ago. Since it’s a Roku TV, all of your streaming services are at your fingertips right out of the box. This is a one-off model that appears to be exclusive to Walmart, so you won’t find reviews on it, but Hisense is a reputable brand and TVs have matured so much that even budget models hold their own to most eyeballs.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of SamsungSamsung OLED S90F 4K TV$1,399.99, originally $2499.99 at Samsung (44% off)For color fidelity and contrast, most home theater enthusiasts still turn to OLED screens, but they seldom come cheap. This is a great deal on a high-end example, just one rung below Samsung’s flagship S95F. Gamers will appreciate the 144Hz refresh rate for smoother action, and the AI processor for 4K upscaling means that even older shows and movies will make use of every pixel.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Filter USGadgetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yuletide now seems to start roughly whezn Strictly does, and Black Friday seemed to kick off around Halloween. But now, at last, we’ve reached the day that puts the “Friday” into Black Friday.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Black Friday is a devil worth dancing with if you want to save money on products you’ve had your eye on. Some of the Filter’s favourite items spent most of November floating around at prices clearly designed to make them sell out fast. Other deals have been kept back until now, and some won’t even land until the daftly named Cyber Monday (1 December).As ever, we’d encourage you not to buy anything unless you really need it and have the budget to do so – read our advice onhow to shop smartly.Here’s our fully updated guide to the best genuine Black Friday bargains on the Filter’s favourites, from Anker battery packs to KidiZoom cameras via the espresso machine you loved more than any other product this year.For more, read thebest Black Friday deals under £50How we selected these deals (and excluded others)The key toshopping smarton Black Friday, Cyber Monday or any discount event is to know what you want – and we’re here to help you target the good stuff. We’ve tested thousands of products at the Filter in 2025 and warmly recommended hundreds of them, including many that have genuinely good Black Friday discounts.Instead of listing price cuts on all the products we’ve featured, we’ve focused on the things you’ve liked the most this year, and looked for deals that undercut their long-term average prices by a significant amount. Ideally, their Black Friday price will be their lowest of the year.We don’t take retailers at their word on discount size, either. Amazon may say it’s “70%” off the RRP, but we study the price history of every item using independent tools such asthe Camelizerto find out how generous a discount really is. If an item’s price has been all over the place in 2025, we’ll give the average price below instead of a “was …” price, so you can judge how good a deal it is.Q&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The bestBlack Friday deals on the Filter’s favourite productsThe best home and mattress dealsThe best artificial Christmas treeView image in fullscreenHabitat 6ft mixed top upswept Christmas tree, £84 (was £120)£84 (with code XMAS30) at ArgosHabitat’s gloriously lifelike and easy-to-assemble tree topped our test to find thebest artificial Christmas trees, and as December rattles towards us it’s inevitably discounted for Black Friday.

That makes this 120 x 160cm throw ideal for wrapping around yourself (and no-one else) on the sofa as the evenings grow ever colder.Smart baby monitorView image in fullscreenOwlet Dream Sock, from £199 (was £299)£199.99 at John Lewis£199 at AmazonOwlet’s feature-packed smartphone-compatible baby monitor was one of the favouritebaby productswhen we spoke to parents last year.

The handheld bit detaches easily from the body then slots back in when needed, and you get an array of brushes, scrapers, pads and nozzles. This dirt-blitzing package has dropped more than 40% at Currys and Amazon.Smart wake-up and reading lightView image in fullscreenPhilips SmartSleep sleep and wake-up light, £139.99 (avg £179.61)£139.99 at Philips£139.99 at AmazonWhen testing products for his guide to thebest sunrise alarm clocks, our writer Pete Wise was struck by how well this one worked as a reading light. “Even when a bright setting is selected, the light seems relatively mellow and restful,” wrote Pete, who also liked the range of alarm sounds and audio input option. He found it a little too expensive, however – and it’s still north of £100, but somewhat less so.The best heated clothes airerView image in fullscreenDry:Soon Deluxe heated airer, £159.99 (was £199.99)£159.99 at Lakeland£159.99 at AmazonA heated airer dries your clothes fast enough to avoid the dreaded stink of slow-dried laundry, and without the cost or noise of a tumble dryer. Lakeland’s three-tier heated airer – the top performer in ourheated airerstest – has proved enduringly popular with the Filter’s readers, and is now at its lowest price ever. Lakeland has also dropped the price of theairer with coverto £195.98 for Black Friday.The best hybrid mattressView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOtty Original Hybrid double, £533.58with code THEFILTER7 (was £647.99)£533.58 with code at OttyThe most comfortable and supportive foam-and-springs hybrid of all themattresseswe’ve tested, the Otty already came at an impressive price of £647.99 for a double, but the Filter’s exclusive code gives you a small but perfectly welcome additional 7% off for Black Friday. For a deeper dive into this cosy mattress, read ourOtty Original Hybrid review(spoiler: it gets five stars).Sunrise alarm clockView image in fullscreen£29.99 at Amazon£37.49 at BootsLumie Sunrise Alarm, from £29.99 (was £49)One of your favourite Filter recommendations of the year, this gentlesunrise alarm clockwill wake you up with kittens purring, birdsong, gently brightening light – or a plain old alarm sound if you prefer. It’s been around for a few years and saw a price hike in 2022 (cost-of-waking-up crisis?) before settling at just under £50 from most retailers, so this is a deal worth grabbing.Simba Pro hybrid mattressView image in fullscreenSimba Hybrid Pro king size, £948.27 (was £1,299)£948.27 at SimbaMattress “discounts” may seem to be a 24/7/365 thing, but UK watchdogs have given companies short shrift over money-off claims that aren’t all they seem. We’ve certainly noticed Simba playing by the rules lately, and its current 30%-off sale is the first we’ve seen in months. The excellentSimba Hybrid Pro, another of ourbest mattresses, is now hundreds of pounds cheaper in all sizes, from single (now £599.25) to super king (now £1,091.22).Wool mattress topperView image in fullscreenWoolroom Deluxe wool topper (double), from £148.74 (was £174.99)£148.74 at Amazon£165.74 at the WoolroomThe sustainably sourced wool in Woolroom’s bedding is a hypoallergenic temperature regulator, helping to keep you warm in winter and cool on hotter nights. The company’s deluxemattress topperadds a touch of softness to a too-hard mattress, and is one of the easiest toppers we tested to move and store. Woolroom’s 35% isn’t quite as big a discount as Amazon’s, but it applies to everything on its site, including duvets, mattresses and linens.Powerful pressure washerView image in fullscreenBosch UniversalAquatak 135 high pressure washer, £135 (was £209)£135 at Currys£135 at AmazonBlitz the gunk from your patio, decking, gutters and any flat surface you find yourself unable to resist pointing the nozzle at. Our writer Andy Shaw found the UniversalAquatak to be the most powerful of all thepressure washershe tested, and he thought its price was reasonable too. It’s now even cheaper for Black Friday, although not quite its lowest price of 2025 – it was briefly (very briefly) under £120 for Prime Day.Shark vacuum cleanerView image in fullscreenShark PowerDetect vacuum, £314 (was £549)£314 at Shark£314 at AmazonA vacuum cleaner that empties itself? Yes please, said our writer Andy Shaw in his roundup of thebest cordless vacuum cleaners– and you agreed, making Shark’s ingenious and powerful cordless cleaner one of your favourite products of the year. Vacuums that look after themselves don’t come cheap, and it’s great to see this one heavily discounted at Shark’s own website as well as at Amazon.The best robot vacuum cleanerView image in fullscreenEufy X10 Pro Omni, £499 (was £579)£499 at Amazon£499 at ArgosYou wait a lifetime for a self-emptying vacuum cleaner, then Black Friday brings you two at once. The Eufy X10 was named “best overall” by Stuart Andrews in his guide to thebest robot vacuums, and it’s already one of the fastest-selling items in Amazon’s Black Friday sale. Its price cut isn’t quite the 38% Amazon suggests, because it cost £579 throughout 2025, but this is still a legitimately good deal.Damp-destroying dehumidifierView image in fullscreenProBreeze dehumidifier, from £151.99 (was £189.99)£159.49 at ProBreezeThis “workhorse”, which “extracted moisture powerfully” in ourbest dehumidifierstest, has tumbled to its lowest price of the year (except for a few days in May, because no one buys dehumidifiers in May). If the recent cold snap gave you the condensation blues, here’s your chance to snap up the ProBreeze for a chunk below its average Amazon price of just over £180.Microchip cat flapView image in fullscreenSureFlap microchip cat flap, from £55.99 (was £61.99)£56 at Currys£55.99 at AmazonLet your cat (andonlyyour cat) come and go without the risk of the neighbourhood Billy Six Dinners sneaking in through the flap. One of our topcat essentials, the SureFlap hasn’t been this cheap at Amazon since 2023, and Currys is only a penny behind. The moggie-trackingConnect versionis also discounted at £119.99 – its lowest price since 2022.Cuddly heated throwView image in fullscreenBeurer HD150 heated throw, £79.99 (was £84.99)£79.99 at Amazon£79.99 at BeurerBeurer’s “soft and sumptuous” fleece blanket was crowned “best throw overall” in our guide to thebest electric blanketsthanks to its ability to get toasty fast without using much energy. A fiver off is not a massive discount, but this is its cheapest recent price on Amazon, where it normally costs £84.99. Beurer has now matched Amazon’s Black Friday price, dropping from £94.99 to £79.99.Google video doorbellView image in fullscreenGoogle Nest doorbell, from £119.98 (was £179.99)£119.98 at Amazon£129 at CurrysSort the cold-callers from the welcome visitors when they’re still metres away from your front door, with this outstanding battery-powered doorbell that crashes to its lowest price since Black Friday 2023. Andy Shaw named it thebest video doorbelloverall, but lamented that you also have to fork out for aNest Aware subscriptionat £80 a year to save recordings.Subscription-free video doorbellView image in fullscreenTapo D235 video doorbell camera, from £79.99 (avg £101)£79.99 at Amazon£89.99 at HughesThe Tapo doorbell camera from router giant TP-link emerged as a fine mid-range choice in Andy Shaw’s test to find thebest video doorbell, thanks to its good picture quality and ability to record video locally on a microSD card. With more than £30 shaved off Amazon’s average price for the camera, it’s now an even more reasonable buy.Budget electric blanketView image in fullscreenSlumberdown Sleepy Nights electric blanket, king size, from £30.59(was £45.99)£30.59 at Amazon£34.20 at SlumberdownThis Slumberdown Sleepy Nights performed admirably in Emily Peck’s test ofthe best electric blankets, heating quickly to a temperature that was comfortable to keep our reviewer warm through the night. It also has elasticated fitted straps to make fitment easy, and comes in a variety of sizes to suit your bed size. It’s the king-size one that’s been discounted.Subscription-free video doorbellView image in fullscreenEufy Security doorbell E340, £74.99 (avg £151.29)£74.99 at AmazonLots of video doorbells and home surveillance systems come with a recurring subscription to access some of their features, which you may wish to avoid. If so, then the Eufy Video Doorbell E340 was Andy Shaw’s pick in his testing of thebest video doorbellsout there. He liked the E340 precisely because of its dual camera setup to make keeping an eye on parcels a breeze, plus the onboard storage to stick it to cloud storage. Reliability of movement detection needed some work, though. At £74.99 from Amazon, it’s also at its lowest price ever this Black Friday from the big online retailer.The best tech dealsSilk sleep headphonesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianSnoozeband Silk, £84 (was £99)£84 at SnoozebandBlock out the world and drift off to whatever music, podcast or white noise you choose with this comfy silk sleep mask that incorporates flat Bluetooth speakers for pairing with your phone. It impressed our writer Jane Hoskyn in her mission to findsleep aidsthat actually work, but she found it a little pricey – so this discount is very welcome, and makes the Snoozeband an even betterChristmas giftidea.Running watch with SpotifyView image in fullscreenGarmin Forerunner 165 Music smartwatch, £208.05 (was £289)£208.05 at John Lewis£208.05 at AmazonOne of our favouritefitness techgadgets, Garmin’s GPS smartwatch can’t run amarathonfor you, but it sure can help ease the pain with its pace-tracking tools, offline Spotify support and 19-hour battery life. John Lewis and Amazon are both offering this deal on the aqua green edition of the watch, now at its lowest price ever.Professional DJ headphonesView image in fullscreenAiAiAi Audio TMA-2 DJ headphones, £124.94 (was £159)£124.94 at AmazonMany headphones claim to be pro or DJ-level, but this modular set is a favourite withactual DJs. DJ and producerSophie Lloydtold the Filter’s Kate Hutchinson that she loves the sound quality, size and durability of these phones, adding that their modular design means “you can buy a new lead or earpieces separately, which is essential when you’re using them all the time”. This Black Friday deal takes them to their lowest price of 2025.Portable Bluetooth speakerView image in fullscreenBose SoundLink Flex 2nd gen, £108.95 (was £149.95)£108.95 at John Lewis£108.95 at AmazonThis fab portable speaker boasts 12-hour battery life, durability and a range of swish colours, making it a must-have foruniversity lifeand beyond.

What they won’t be so keen to highlight is the huge environmental cost that comes from feeding the capitalist beast year on year, given what an obvious sales vibe-killer it would be.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While the best approach for the planet is to opt out completely and observe the alternate holiday ofBuy Nothing Dayinstead, such an approach can prove self-defeating to your finances in the long term. If youshop smart on Black Fridayand avoid the lure of impulse buys, it’s a good time to stock up on the things you need, at lower prices than at the rest of the year.In other words, if your phone, laptop or TV is on its figurative last legs, Black Friday is a sensible time to seek a replacement. But if you’re hoping to limit your ecological impact, it’s definitely worth considering refurbished options.“As a consumer, you save directly 30-40% versus new, and you also have this feeling of doing the right thing,” says Peter Windischhofer, co-founder and CEO ofRefurbed. “Because you buy a product that already exists, you don’t have to produce a new one.”James Rigg, CEO of Trojan Electronics, agrees: “Very often, it’s the better choice: reliable performance, lower prices and a fraction of the environmental cost.“Buy from someone reputable, look for transparency, and prioritise warranty and repairability over a too-good-to-be-true discount, and you can come out of Black Friday with great devices and a lighter footprint.”Five tips when buying refurbishedRead the descriptionRefurbished can mean different things. See what condition is promised, paying special attention to battery health.Check the warranty and returns policyYou want to know that you’re in good hands should anything go wrong.Research the seller’s reputationLook at customer reviews and internet feedback. If on eBay, look for sellers in the company’sRefurbishedprogramme.Research your chosen deviceThe older the device, the bigger the discount – but this is a false economy if you have to replace it sooner. With phones and laptops, especially, make sure they’re getting updates and will be able to cope with years of use.Don’t cheap outA low price is only a bargain if it actually delivers. Prioritise customer service and a transparent refurbishment process over saving a few pounds.Refurbished vs pre-ownedView image in fullscreenThe process of buying refurbished electronics is often as good as buying new.Photograph: dikushin/Getty ImagesIt’s important at this point to define terms. People sometimes use the phrases “preowned”, “secondhand” and “refurbished” interchangeably, which may have given the latter a bad rap.“They really are quite, quite different,” says Katy Medlock, Back Market’s UK general manager. “Secondhand could be peer to peer: you’re not buying it with a warranty, it hasn’t been through a quality check, you’re not buying it with all the mod cons.”That separates refurbished marketplaces such asBack Market,MusicMagpie,Refurbedand others from sites where you buy directly from a member of the public, such as Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist. “Our mission is all about trying to make the process of buying refurbished electronics as good as buying something new,” Medlock says, highlighting the ability Back Market offers to split payments, its 30-day money-back promise, 12-month warranty and next-day delivery as ways of seeking parity with retailers shipping new stock.By contrast, buying preowned or secondhand on the private market is a gamble, even if you sidestep the risk of being scammed.“I’ve heard so many horror stories from peer-to-peer when it comes to electronics,” says Windischhofer. “I love using those platforms for low-value products; I use a lot of Vinted for clothing, and it’s great. But for electronics, my advice would be to go through a professional where you get a warranty and an invoice, and where, in case this product breaks after five days, they have great customer service to really help you out.”Items sold privately may also have unseen defects or botched repairs using cheap, third-party parts. “There’s a very different performance from the cheapest phone screen that can be put on a phone and the correct screen,” says Murdock. “Products get traded in at times with a $20 screen on an iPhone or Samsung [device] that really should have a wholesale cost of $150. They’re almost illegible.”In other words, peer-to-peer buys are a gamble. If you insist on taking that risk, it’s best to buy in person and to take the opportunity to check both the screen and camera alongside signs of cosmetic wear and tear. If buying an iPhone or Android device, check the battery’s health in the phone’s settings and make sure it’s at least 80%.If buying peer-to-peer on eBay, rather than through a certified refurbished seller, Williams encourages shoppers to look through the feedback and study photos and the product description. “Is this a reliable seller? Have they sold a lot of things in the past? What’s their feedback score? These are all things that are helpful to know that they’ve had good transactions with buyers in the past.”Crunching the numbersView image in fullscreenBuying refurbished tech can shrink your e-waste footprint.Photograph: Pituk Loonhong/Getty ImagesWhat does that ecological improvement look like in real terms? Let’s take smartphones – the bestselling refurbished category.According toresearch from Back Market, buying a refurbished model rather than a new one will save 178g of e-waste and 77,000 litres of water, while preventing 77kg of carbon emissions and 244kg of raw materials from being mined.Trojan Electronics, meanwhile,estimatesthat a refurbished smartphone uses 91.3% fewer raw materials and 86.4% less water while putting 91.6% less carbon emissions into the atmosphere compared with buying a new device.Plenty of variables make the exact figures impossible to pin down. But while there’s still an impact from refurbished buys – especially if a new battery or screen is installed as part of the refurbishing process – there’s no denying that the harm is lessened.“Every time you buy a smartphone, it’s about a 58kg CO2offset if you don’t buy a new one [and instead] buy one that’s been refurbished,” says James Murdock, co-founder ofAlchemy, a company that refurbishes old technology for resale. “That includes the operation to actually refurbish it, and the existence of our business. It’s even more if you’re buying a laptop.”It’s not just phones, either. “Now, people are turning to all different types of electronics, everything from refurbished air fryers through to hair accessories from TVs, coffee machines, ice-cream makers and games consoles,” says Eve Williams, general manager at eBay UK. Unlike its traditional peer-to-peer sales business, eBay has a method by which itcertifies refurbished-reselling businesses.“There’s nothing to lose [from buying refurbished],” she says, pointing out that if you get the same 12-month guarantee as you would if buying new, you’re getting the same product at a cheaper price. “You’re getting something that otherwise would have ended up in landfill. We have this amazing seller calledPreloved Tech. Matt and Andrea, who run it, started their business by working in schools, going in and seeing the times that schools were throwing out laptops and iPads because they didn’t know what to do with them. There are no rules around what some businesses should do to get rid of or recycle technology.“They’re taking a lot of that tech and are able to give money and funding back to the schools, while also then being able to refurbish these items to sell on, and extend the life of them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

For instance, Giffgaff provides a two-year warranty on ‘like new’ phones, while Back Market often gives you the option to have an entirely new battery fitted into your device of choice.”In general, the more information a retailer provides about their refurbishing process, the better. “A proper refurbisher will tell you exactly what’s been checked, what’s been replaced, and how the product is graded,” says Rigg. “If you see vague descriptions like ‘used’ or ‘open box’ with no explanation, that’s your cue to walk away.”Jon Miller, chief commercial officer at MusicMagpie, agrees. “As a rule of thumb, it’s far wiser to be careful when buying refurbished tech. Try to check the warranty length and what exactly that covers. Similarly, check the fine print and ensure ‘refurbished’ means the tech has been properly restored and tested, not just used.”Is there any preowned technology you should avoid? “If you had asked me that question 10 years ago, I would have said: ‘Yes, because technology is so fast and, you know, the new iPhone is so much better than the last one,’” says Windischhofer. “But now? I don’t think there’s any product that I would buy new. I would always buy the generation before that.”Alchemy, similarly, practices what it preaches. “We’ve got hundreds of MacBooks, iPhones and other products in the company. We have about 350 employees, and no one, including me, has ever had a new one,” says Murdock.There are limits, however, to how old a device you should get, and it varies by category. APlayStation 4will continue to play all disc-based games made for it indefinitely, but something internet-reliant may end up losing functionality with time. Older OLED TVs, too, are considered more prone to burn-in than their modern counterparts.Equally, buying a five-year-old refurbished phone will be cheaper than buying last year’s model, but if you end up needing to replace it sooner – for example, if it’s an Android that’s stopped receiving security updates – then it’s a false economy.“It might be tempting to get an old MacBook Air from 2015, but it won’t receive regular updates like M-series MacBooks will,” says Deehan. “I think there’s a good balance to strike where you sometimes buy things new and other times go down the refurbished route. It’s about saving money where it makes sense so that you have the freedom to spend a bit more on a device that you’ll make the most of.”Finally, don’t forget the age-old adage of “buy cheap, buy twice”. Or, as Rigg puts it: “A gadget that fails quickly and can’t be repaired is only cheap for about five minutes.”“Don’t be tempted by the cheapest offshore, interesting-looking eBay seller that looks like it’s been there for five minutes,” says Murdock. “Buy from a legitimate-looking local partner that’s offering a warranty, as they would with any other kind of new product, and is willing to stand behind that.”For more, read our guide onwhat to look for in a refurbished phoneWhat about your old tech?View image in fullscreenIf you plan to resell your old devices, giving them a good clean will make them look their best.Photograph: MDV Edwards/Getty ImagesSo you’ve bought a refurbished phone, laptop or tablet and now have one that’s surplus to requirements. What should you do?Recycling is an option, but one that should be considered a last resort, according to Medlock, especially as there are limits on capacity. “With the amount of new electronics that are produced every year … there’s no way that … the amount sold in the UK could ever be recycled.”Many sites will offer a trade-in when you buy the replacement, which will increase the likelihood of a device getting a second lease of life in the refurbished ecosystem.Alternatively, you could take it toCeXor try your luck on the peer-to-peer market throughGumtree,Facebook Marketplace,CraigslistoreBay. If you go down this route, do be sure to wipe all your personal data first and give it a good spruce-up.“This should go without saying, but prior to being listed or sold, your tech should be given a good clean to make it look the best that it can,” says Deehan. “Some retailers will dock the value of your device based on its cosmetic appearance, so make sure to do your part in keeping it all lint- and fingerprint-free.”Donating is also an option. I recently donated an old laptop toScreen Share, which repurposes computers and phones for refugees to help tackle digital exclusion, and a quick search online will uncover many other worthwhile places to donate.Whatever you choose, Medlock suggests putting some thought into the end of life for today’s Black Friday tech buys. “If people are upgrading, the pathway is obviously to buy refurbished … and encouraging people at that point to buy better.“There is a cost saving there, so people can use that saving to buy devices that last longer, are built to last and built to be repaired.”For more readhow to shop smart this Black Fridayand thebest Black Friday deals for 2025Alan Martinhas more than a decade’s experience of writing about and reviewing consumer technology.

Here’s whyDave SchillingDining at 3pm allows for an ideal holiday schedule. Let’s retire the term ‘dinner’ from our Thanksgiving lexiconThu 27 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 08.55 ESTShareWithout question, my favorite holiday isThanksgiving. I relish the opportunity to appreciate all the wonderful things about life. I also love that it is simultaneously a holiday all about complaints, criticism and arguments. Every holiday should contain such multitudes. I might be feeling grateful for my blessings while also wishing the gravy had more salt in it. There’s something uniquely American about turning a holiday that’s meant to be a joyous celebration of abundance into a chance to vehemently disagree about something trivial.Of course, I love arguing about trivial things. In fact, that might be what I’m most grateful for. Thanksgiving traditions are fertile ground for arguments. What to eat and, even more crucially, when to eat. Every year, someone in your life – a family member, friend, know-it-all writer – will tell you they have settled the eternal debate about when to commence Thanksgiving dinner. Some (wrong) people think the word “dinner” should be taken literally, in the American sense. These strict constitutionalists can see no nuance in the holiday traditions and believe (falsely) that the meal should begin between 5pm and 7pm, when it’s properly dark outside.My family took the opposite path. My mother would start cooking the meal the day before, then get up early to keep cooking the day of. As food would be finished, we’d be able to eat it as we pleased. All the while, the TV would be tuned to either a James Bond marathon or a football game. My brother and I could leave and go to the movies and come back whenever we wanted. Perhaps what my mom was most grateful for was her freedom from us.Because of this lackadaisical approach, I have very few actual memories of Thanksgiving dinner. Instead, my mind wanders to the scene in Moonraker where thepigeon does a double takewhen James Bond rides a gondola through a piazza.While my experience is perhaps a bit extreme, it was at least clear-eyed about the most crucial facet of Thanksgiving. It is likely to be the largest meal you will have all year – a meal loaded up with carbs, fat and sugar. Many of you will be combining this depravity with alcohol or the weed-smoking jaunt dubbed the “cousin walk”. Why would you want to put your body through this anywhere close to bedtime? And when you’re with your family, why would you want your bedtime to be after 10pm?Those of us with evolved sensibilities, who aren’t beholden to literal readings of words like “dinner”, understand that thebest time to start eating is 3pm. Let me walk you through it: eat a light breakfast, skip lunch, see a movie, and be back around 2.30pm at the latest. If you would rather stay in and watch football instead of the movie, resist the temptation to snack on cheese or whatever might be lying around the house while cooking is happening. If you’re the one cooking, that’s even better. Once 3pm rolls around, you’ll be starving. For the actual meal, you have full rights to eat as much as you want, because you now have hours to let your food digest, clean up, make small talk with relatives, and partake in all that other cheerful activity.Imagine if you wait until 6pm or, God forbid, 7pm or 8pm to eat Thanksgiving dinner. This means you need a real breakfast. You have to eat a midday meal in between. If you don’t eat, because you don’t want to be full before a giant, heavy dinner, you’ll be pestering your parents (or getting pestered by your kids) about when the food will be ready. You’ll devolve into some kind of rabid animal, pacing back and forth and waiting for the carcass to be dumped on the table. Thanksgiving goes from a time to reflect to a sadistic game of seeing how long you can go without basic sustenance.Thanksgiving is meant to be a grand occasion, a meal unlike any other in the calendar year. So why would we treat it like any other meal and slot it at night? I truly do think our culture has gotten hung up on the word “dinner”, which doesn’t even mean the same thing in every region of the United States. In some places,“dinner” is the word for “lunch”. Don’t ask me what “lunch” means there. Maybe that’s what they call a “cousin walk”.This is why I think it’s time to retire the term “dinner” from our Thanksgiving lexicon. We simply call it the “Thanksgiving feast” and embrace that it is the one and only meal we are having that day. That it should come at a nice, convenient time during the day. And that you absolutely should not watch GoldenEye with your familybecause of this scene. Please, don’t make the same mistake as I did.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsThanksgivingOpinionFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

That is good news for PalestiniansThu 27 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 13.04 ESTShareIsraeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahushould be quaking in his boots at the decisive victory ofZohran Mamdaniin the 4 NovemberNew York Citymayoral election. Not because of absurd allegations ofantisemitismfor which there is no evidence, but because Mamdani has broken the longstanding taboo for successful New York candidates against criticizing theIsraeligovernment. And he has only reinforced his approach in the month since his election.New York has thelargestJewish population in the United States – and the second-largest of any city in the world afterTel Aviv. The longstandingassumptionwas that many Jewish votersprioritizedthe defense of the Israeli government over other issues, so criticism of Israel would set them against a politician.Mamdani blew that assumption out of the water. During the campaignhespokeaccurately and openly about thegenocidethat Israel was committing in Gaza. He insisted that all residents of Israel should haveequal rights. He said he wouldarrestNetanyahu were he to show up in New York. Yetone-thirdof New York’s Jewish voters cast a ballot for him. As did many others.Is Queens the new political belleweather of America? | Michael MassingRead moreSome Jews may have been uncomfortable with Mamdani’s criticism of Israel but liked other aspects of his candidacy, such as hisrelentlessfocusonaffordability. Others, myself included, wereattractedby his candor on such an important issue as Israel. Many were also probably appalled by the efforts of Mamdani’s principal opponent, Andrew Cuomo, to tar Mamdani with fact-freeallegationsof antisemitism.Mamdani has only continued his openness on Israel since the election. In hisremarkably friendly meetingwithDonald Trumpin the White House on 21 November, Mamdanirepeatedhis genocide views and noted that the US government was funding it. Trump let the comment slide without a response.After a major Manhattan synagogue hosted a group that was encouraging American Jews to emigrate not only to Israel (a normal enough appeal) but also to Israel’s settlements in the occupied West Bank, Mamdaninotedthe illegality of the settlements. That is an accurate reflection ofarticle 49of the fourth Geneva convention, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its population to occupied territory.It is hard to overstate how unusual such comments are on the part of a successfulNew YorkCity candidate.It is not as if New York candidates never criticize Israel. In March 2024, Chuck Schumer, the Jewish Senate minority leader from Brooklyn who represents New York state, gave a muchcommented-uponspeech in which hesaidthat although Israel has a right to defend itself, it must do so while minimizing harm to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. But his language was carefully couched – tame compared to Mamdani’s – and he refused toendorseMamdani, even after he won the Democratic mayoral primary.Already Mamdani isattractingother progressivecandidatesto New York City congressional contests who are willing to criticize Israel and challenging those who don’t. By all appearances, he has broken the ice and started atrend.We shouldn’t equate New York with the US at large. It is a solidly Democratic, extraordinarily progressive city. More to the point, my experience as a longtime resident is that much of its Jewish population shares that progressivism. As I have traveled around the United States, I have noticed that smaller Jewish populations are more likely to see themselves as a vulnerable minority and hence to backIsraelas a potential haven from persecution. In New York, Judaism is part of the fabric of the city. The sense of security that being a New York Jew engenders is more likely to yield an openness to honest criticism of the Israeli government.The political shift on Israel that Mamdani’s victory represents should be a wake-up call for the Netanyahu government. Its genocidal conduct in Gaza has turned Israel into apariahstate in much of the world. Even Germany brieflysuspendedthe sale of arms that could be used in Gaza. Britain, Canada, France and Australiarecognizeda Palestinian state. Israel has been charged withgenocidebefore the international court of justice, and Netanyahu and his former defense minister facewar-crimechargesbefore the international criminal court for starving and depriving Palestinian civilians. Israel today is overwhelming dependent on the military aid, arms sales, and diplomatic support of one country: the United States.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

He must see that even hisChristian evangelicalbase – traditionally themostreliably pro-Israel votes – is havingqualmsafter Israel’s atrocities in Gaza.Israel’s growing unpopularity in the United States seems to be part of why Trump felt free to impose his 20-point peace plan on Netanyahudespiteits failure to accede to his maximalist demands. The diminishing esteem for Israel will undoubtedly play a role again as Trump decides whether to insist on a clear pathway to aPalestinian state, as Arab leaderswant. Trump will depend on them to fund Gaza’s reconstruction and to provide an international stabilization force for the territory.That support for Israel is no longer de rigueur in New York could come to mean that it is no longer obligatory in Washington either.

In what are clearly dangerous times for democracies around the world, the Australian parliament has demonstrated emphatically that ambitious economic reform remains possible. And yes, I do mean “economic” reform.Labor strikes deal with Greens to pass long-awaited overhaul of nature protection lawsRead moreAs in the past, courageous leadership has been rewarded with agreement. As in the past, the parliament has engaged constructively, in the national interest, rising above the debilitating personality politics and culture wars of recent years.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe winners stand to be future generations of Australians. In this instance, our elected representatives have demonstrated they understand that this is where their most weighty obligation is owed. But meeting that obligation is hard. Democracies often appear carefully designed to reward short-termism. Yet the success of a parliament can only be assessed according to what it does for the future. In the final sitting week of 2025, the Australian parliament appears to have delivered.The package of reforms to the EPBC Act fixes an ugly policy mess. The mess had been called out in several reviews, including Graeme Samuel’s review delivered more than five years ago.As I observed in an address to the National Press Club mid-year, report after report tells the same story of failure. The environment is simply not being protected. Biodiversity is not being conserved. Nature is in systemic decline. The environmental impact assessment systems embedded in the laws are simply not fit for purpose. Of particular concern, they are incapable of supporting an economy in transition to net zero.The mess of poorly constructed environmental laws has been undermining productivity. I noted that we simply cannot afford slow, opaque, duplicative and contested environmental planning decisions based on poor information, mired in administrative complexity.This week’s reforms promise to fix the mess.The reformed act will deliver a set of standards that aim to protect matters of national environmental significance. It will provide certainty for all stakeholders about impacts that must be regarded as “unacceptable” and therefore avoided.It builds integrity into the administration of the laws through the establishment of an independent, national EPA. It promises to end the absurd carveout for native forests, the landscapes that remain most richly endowed with biodiversity and healthy ecosystem functioning. And it lays the foundations for the development of regional plans that provide an opportunity for the three levels of government to work with local communities, including First Nations custodians, to design sustainable futures.Significantly, long-overdue protection will be provided for our forests. The lungs of the Earth, a lifeboat against climate change, a filter against sentiment destroying the Great Barrier Reef and a haven for wildlife will be provided real protection, while incentives will be provided to support a modern forestry industry based on plantations.Australia’s emissions from fossil fuels down as electricity from renewables passes 40%Read moreAnd there is another thing that should be called out at this time. This may be the most important thing.For centuries, humans have believed that economic and social progress necessarily comes at the expense of the environment. We have believed that the destruction of the natural world is a price that must be paid for everything else that matters to us; as we accumulate physical and financial capital, we must run down the stock of natural capital.We have acted as if we can choose, indefinitely, to trade-off environmental integrity for material gains. Our choices have created deserts, waterways incapable of supporting life, soils leached of fertility, climate change driving weather events of such severity and frequency that whole towns, suburbs and agricultural landscapes are fast becoming uninsurable.This week’s amendments acknowledge that the state of the natural world is foundational. That without its rebuilding, future economic and social progress cannot be secured.We should think of economic and social progress as exercises in constrained optimisation. This framing is familiar to those immersed in economic policy. And yet, as I noted in the National Press Club address, economics has for the most part ignored the most important constraints on human choices. These are embedded in the immutable laws of nature. Our failure to recognise that is now undermining productivity growth and having a discernible impact on economic performance. It threatens livelihoods, even lives.Writing into law an acknowledgment that environmental protection and biodiversity conservation necessarily underpin everything else, and that they must therefore have primacy, is a profound achievement. An unprecedented bequest to future generations.Dr Ken Henry AC is a former treasury secretary and chair of the Australian Climate and Biodiversity FoundationExplore more on these topicsConservationOpinionTrees and forestsEndangered habitatsEndangered speciescommentShareReuse this content"

But now some people are fighting backThu 27 Nov 2025 12.20 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 14.10 ESTShareFor the past six years, every Black Friday – that made-up carnival of consumption – Amazon workers and their allies have mobilised across the world in coordinatedstrikes and protests. At first glance, these disputes look like the standard struggle between a giant capitalist employer and the people who keep it running. But Amazon is no ordinary corporation. It is the clearest expression of what I call technofeudalism: a new economic order in which platforms behave like lords owning the fiefs that have replaced markets.To appreciate Amazon’s extraordinary power, we must recall the system it is helping to bury. Capitalism relied on markets and profit. Firms invested in productive capital, hired workers, produced commodities and lived or died by profit and loss. But the emerging order is one in which the most powerful capitalist firms have exited that market altogether. They own the digital infrastructure that everyone else must use to trade, work, communicate and live.Amazon sits at the apex of this new order because it owns the cloud computing platform – Amazon Web Services (AWS) – upon which other technological firms, such as Uber, rely, but also large parts of banking, healthcare, logistics, public administration, media and education sectors. Once these businesses are embedded in AWS, switching costs become prohibitive. Firms thus become vassals on Amazon’s vast cloud fief and surrender their customers’ data. In 2020, the European commissioncharged Amazonwith using the sales data of other sellers to illegally gain an advantage in the European marketplace.Amazon fuses logistics, cloud infrastructure, data extraction and algorithmic command into one vertically integrated system. Inside Amazon’s warehouses, technofeudal domination takes a more visceral form. Workers are subjected to minute-by-minutesurveillance: handheld scanners and other devicestrack their movements; algorithms measure their pace, track productivity and monitor behaviour. Amazon, however, has said that claims of excessive surveillance are “factually incorrect” and any recording was necessary for ensuring safety and efficiency in its operations.Consumers, too, are drawn into the system. Each click, scroll, search and purchase on Amazon trains its algorithms to predict our needs and manipulate our desires. We, effectively, labour so that Amazon’s cloud capital accumulates. Each time we buy, Amazon can takeas much as 40%of the sale price from the sellers in what I call cloud rents.Governments have a job, ostensibly, to regulate behemoths such as Amazon, but they are also becoming its serfs as public institutions run their data and communications on Amazon servers.According to the Guardian, key ministerial departments that have contracts with AWSincludethe Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HMRC, the Ministry of Justice, the Cabinet Office and Defra.Unsurprisingly, cloud capital has invaded battlefields and the shadowy world of surveillance. Amazon Rekognition, launched in 2016, was aimed at law-enforcement bodies including ICE in the US. Palantir – the surveillance firm that produces software used in everything from counter-terrorism to predictive policing to ICE’s deportation machine – hasa partnershipwith AWS. Amazon is also directly involved inProject Nimbus, the 2021 cloud contract through which Amazon and Google provide the Israeli state with advanced cloud computing, AI and secure data storage.Amazon is a technofeudal rentier owning the digital infrastructure on which privateers, states and societies depend. Thankfully, there are signs of a pushback. The campaign that brings workers and citizens together every Black Friday –Make Amazon Pay– recognises this transformation. What began as a fight for workers’ rights has grown into a coalition of unions, climate campaigners, tax justice groups, digital rights advocates and migrant and Palestine solidarity networks. They understand that Amazon’s reach extends across logistics, finance, governance, ecological destruction, surveillance and war.Itsdemands– decent wages, safe workplaces, collective bargaining, climate action, tax justice, curbs on Amazon’s vast water consumption, an end to its entanglement with surveillance agencies and military operations – are integrated. Together, they map the much needed unified resistance to technofeudal domination.In the early decades of industrial capitalism, cross-border worker solidarity was hard. Today, the resistance to cloud capital can use its own tools to coordinate at planetary scale. Campaigns such as Make Amazon Pay offer a glimpse of the alliances required to confront our new cloudalist overlords. It may be only a beginning – but it is a hopeful one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now it is goneLucy Powell is deputy leader of the Labour partyThu 27 Nov 2025 12.04 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 12.12 ESTShareYesterday the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delivered aLabourbudget. People have been asking for Labour’s purpose and values to be more clearly expressed. Through the choices made – a shift to a fairer tax system, targeting wealth to pay for tackling child poverty, good public services and the cost of living – we have clearly set out what we stand for.That’s why Labour MPs cheered in the Commons, and it’s why we are up for the fights to come. And it’s why the cries from the right began immediately.The central dividing line in British politics is once again on the economy. On the one side Labour, who want to change it so it benefits ordinary working people, and on the other, our political opponents, who support the status quo and the failed ideology of the past. We must now take on, and win, the argument.The Torieshad 14 yearsto fix things and instead, by any measure, they got much worse. Their ideological austerity and trickle-down economics–tax breaks for the wealthy, cutting off investment (leaving us with low productivity and wages), and failing to support young people post-Covid–didn’t work.Living standardsfell by the largest marginsince records began, child povertyreached record levels, NHS waiting lists in England were the highestthey’ve ever been, wageswere stagnant, a housing crisistook hold, young people scarred by Covid wereleft on the scrapheap. The record of failure goes on.One budget alone can’t put all this right, so Labour has a long-term plan for renewal and for rewiring the country. And we have to go out and keep making the argument for why our approach will reap dividends.Take welfare spending and child poverty. Under the Tories, welfare spendingsignificantly increased. As did child poverty, because they didn’t address the root causes: low pay, high housing costs, deep inequalities in education, health and regions. The state ends up paying more to deal with the symptoms instead of the cure.It’s why we are building more social housing than for a generation, increasing wages andnew rights for workers, massively boosting investment in infrastructure and new industries, getting waiting lists down andbringing downthe costs of childcareand energyas we drive for clean power.It’s also why we are absolutely right to use this budget tolift the two-child benefit cap.For eight long years, since George Osborne introduced it, poorer families with children have suffered from acruel social experimentthat was branded as fair for working people when it was anything but. Most of the families affected by it have a parent in work.It’s done nothing but push 300,000 more children into poverty – which, in the end, costs us more, as well as being callous and immoral.I know from my own constituency – where over 5,000 children will be lifted out of poverty as a result of ending the cap– the real impact it’s had. Children wearing £1 Matalan wellies as school shoes, children going to bed hungry and cold, living in cramped, mouldy homes, parents this Christmas relying on food banks for a modest meal or small gift for their kids.I also see the impact on schools, teachers, social workers, doctors and charities who are already stretched but have to divert time and resources tosupporting children who are living with the consequences of deep poverty.Just one in four pupils from the poorest families achieve five good GCSEs, compared with nearly three in four among affluent families. This sets them up for the disadvantages they face throughout their lives: missed potential, financialstruggles and ill health. Children who grew up in poverty are more likely to be unemployed or poor as adults.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Poverty costs the economy far, far more than the £3bn cost of lifting the two-child cap, or extending free school meals.That’s why we acted urgently in the budget, despite the very difficult economic context. Every day with this cap in place sees more than 100 additional children pushed into poverty. The effects of lifting it won’t happen overnight either, so acting early in the parliament was vital.The cap was a totem to 14 years of failed rightwing ideology. Now it is gone.We, as Labour, can also be clear that these measures are being paid for in a fair way – from a new gambling levy, closing tax loopholes and a new “mansion tax”.Fairness and purpose – that’s how we will win the battle of ideas. This budget is a clear statement that we won the election as Labour, and will govern as Labour. As I repeatedly said during my campaign to become deputy leader, we must seize back the political megaphone and set the agenda more strongly about what’s really wrong with the country and how we are fixing it. We’ve certainly done that this week.So let’s keep hold of it and win this fight about how we will renew Britain and tackle the deep inequalities holding us back.Lucy Powell is MP for Manchester Central and deputy leader of the Labour partyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Somehow we make it workRebecca ShawShe has read 57 books this year, whereas I have watched all of Selling Sunset. But we listen to each other – and enjoy itThu 27 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 16.50 ESTShareThere are some pretty big differences between me and my girlfriend. She is from Aotearoa, I’m from Queensland. She is 10 years younger than me. She loves Marmite and loathes Vegemite; I hold the reverse and correct opinion.But probably our biggest difference is in our attitude to the internet. We are in what is called an offline/online gap relationship. She hates her phonesomuch. She treats it like a sometimes food, often has no idea where it is and, when she does have it, it’s not charged and has a haunted aura. In her dream world she wouldn’t have to own a phone and could just communicate via telepathy or little birds and woodland creatures passing occasional messages. Often her loved ones get in touch with her via me, and I often am messaging friends she is with to get a message to her.Her relationship to her phone is even more extreme in comparison with mine. I treat my phone as though it’s been soldered to my hand in some sort of terrible but fortunate accident. It is my miracle infant that I love playing with for hours and hours.I am almost always texting a group chat or tweeting something. I love knowing the breaking news, the pop culture gossip, what people are saying about … everything, the niche jokes that you only get if you spend too much time online finding out about things that definitely don’t concern you. I am not bragging about this or saying it’s good or normal for the human brain – but it’s me. I contain multitudes, and they are all on my phone.My girlfriend is supportive as a partner, but completely baffled by my love of sports | Rebecca ShawRead moreMy girlfriend is unburdened by the discourse of the day, preferring to have her own busy interior life. She has read 57 books this year, whereas I have watched all of Selling Sunset and read countless posts about a wide variety of topics (it counts!). She brings me talk of what she’s reading, what she’s thinking, her layered emotional experience with a particular kind of paper or her new favourite pen. I bring her a story of a weird man who went viral for looking like Willy Wonka (or something). She talks about the next thing she’s making with her hands, I tell her annoying movie news and which couples have broken up. I don’t sit her down for a daily briefing, it mostly just comes up when I reference something I assume she knows about because it’s been all over the entire internet for weeks – and she looks at me with a blank face.Sometimes I do mention something on purpose. But I have a scale. For some things there is simply too much context to explain, as happened a few nights ago.I was online as all the buzzkicked offabout the Vanity Fair journalist Olivia Nuzzi. If you are another offline person, Nuzzi’s ex-boyfriend published a piece that included poems he claimed were written to her by Robert F Kennedy Jr, after claims that they had an inappropriate relationship when she profiled RFK Jr for the magazine. One thing led to another in a group chat, and obviously I had to send a voice memo impression of RFK Jr saying: “I am a river. You are my canyon. I mean to flow through you.”My girlfriend was in another room not engaging in the world (crafting) and I didn’t think she could hear me. But out of the blue I heard her say, “What … are you doing?” I paused, opened my mouth, but there was just too much to explain. I knew she would never have heard the name Olivia Nuzzi, so I would have to go back several steps. Instead I just said, “Don’t worry about it.” She said OK and went happily back to what she was doing, unbothered by not knowing.I think our dynamic is good for us. The important thing is that we listen to each other, and enjoy it. I love how emotional she gets about books, how she connects to the characters, how she looks as though she is in a 4D cinema chair when a book is heating up. And I think she likes getting updates from the online world, the pop culture world, through me, a beautiful conduit. It’s also a helpful reminder for me – when I start explaining some of this out loud – that none of it really matters.She’s very offline, I’m too online and, somewhere between those two extremes, we’ve built a life that makes sense.Rebecca Shaw is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsInternetOpinionSocial mediaDigital mediaMobile phonesSmartphonesRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

Our research shows how to address itTarik Abou-Chadi,Silja HäusermannandBjörn BremerThe mantra of ‘build, build, build’ misses something crucial: that few can afford these new homesReport: European progressives must tackle housing crisis to beat far right, say researchersThu 27 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 10.33 ESTShareHousing costs across Europe have become a growing burden for many households, both for those trying to buy and those trying to rent. Over the past decade, property prices have surgedfaster than incomesin many European countries. The same is true for rents, which have increased exponentially in large cities but have also increased substantially in suburban areas and smaller university towns.Given how much housing costs affect Europeans’ quality of life, it is comparatively absent from the agenda of progressive political parties. When politicians do emphasise housing, the focus is usually solely on building more houses. Former German chancellor Olaf Scholz, for example,promised to build 400,000 new homesin Germany every year – a goalhis government failedto reach by some distance. At the same time, far-right parties such as the Freedom party (PVV) in the Netherlands or Chega in Portugal havemade the housing affordability crisisinto a campaign issue. Their equation is simple: housing should be available and affordable only for nationals.What are the hurdles that keep other parties from politicising housing? And what would a progressive European housing agenda look like? As part of the Progressive Politics Research Network – an initiative to promote social science research findings to a broader audience –we have published eight research briefsto that end.European societies fundamentally differ in how housing is organised. Home ownership remains the dominant form of housing in most European countries, but ownership rates vary significantly. In some countries – including Germany, Austria and Switzerland – more than half of the population lives in rented accommodation. And as home ownership becomes increasingly unaffordable, renting has become the modal form for younger people, especially in Europe’s larger cities.To compare housing politics across countries, it is helpful to think of two policy paradigms:housing as an assetv housing as a social right. In the housing as an asset approach, housing is seen as an investment to generate financial returns – a system that depends on rising prices. Over the past decades, this has become the dominant paradigm. Even parties of the left have significantly reduced social housing, deregulated rental markets and created new investment and market structures that affect house prices.These reforms have eroded housing as a social right. The inequalities of who can live where, and under what conditions, have created massive grievances among a large share of the population. These grievances contribute to theincreasing electoral successof the radical right.If progressive parties want to reclaim this issue, they have to accept that housing is fundamentally a question of distribution and redistribution. They should not treat housing as an issue where parties simply compete over who is more competent, or who can deliver more units. Housing policy involves profound choices about who benefits and who bears costs, about the balance between markets and collective responsibility, about whether housing is primarily an asset or a social right. From a progressive perspective, the goal should be clear:housing needs to be affordable, secure and nonspeculative.To achieve this, progressive parties first need toreinvest in social housingas part of a broader strategy to increase supply. Yet simply recreating the social housing of the 1970s won’t work. Social housing cannot be revitalised today if it is only targeted at the poorest: tight eligibility rules can undermine cross-class political support and lead to stigmatisation and exclusion. As an example, in Vienna, around 40% of households live in limited-profit or public housing: this broad access, together with strong rental protections, helps build the broad political coalitions necessary to support sustained investment.Second, progressive housing policy must address both supplyanddistribution. The fixation on “build, build, build”misses a crucial fact: under-occupation of existing housing stock now rivals overcrowding in many European countries. In Germany, demographic factors – especially age – correlate with housing inequality more than income does. Younger households and immigrants face severe overcrowding, while older households are increasingly under-occupied. Policy must incentivise the redistribution of existing space alongside new construction.Third, increasing housing density is unavoidable but must be done correctly.Large-scale surveysfrom cities in Europe and the US show that public acceptance of densification depends critically on design and implementation. When projects include participatory governance, protect neighbourhood amenities and green space, and ensure affordability, resistance drops significantly. Densification without social inclusion and environmental sustainability will fail politically.This agenda requires substantial public investment. Wealth-to-income ratios are driven largely by housing booms, providing funding resources. Whileinheritance taxes remain unpopular, net wealth taxes and reformed capital gains taxes command public support – especially when revenues are credibly tied to popular investments such as affordable housing.Austria demonstrateshow dedicated housing funds, fed by modest levies and reinvested profits from limited-profit providers, can sustain large-scale provision.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Land-use planning, construction regulation, and public loans can be tied to conditions: obligations to reinvest profits, provide housing at cost-based rents, respect limited-profit constraints, or meet social and ecological criteria.Housingpolicy is not simply about market v state, but about steering both toward social ends.The European far right has seized on housing precisely because progressives have abandoned it. Their answer – blaming immigrants for scarcity – is both morally and economically wrong. However, it will continue to gain traction if the centre left offers only market solutions and technocratic supply-side fixes.Housing is fundamentally a question of distribution and social rights, not merely construction targets. It shapes who can live where, access what opportunities, and build what kind of life. A progressive housing agenda must be bold enough to challenge the norm that housing has become an asset for wealth accumulation, and ambitious enough to build the broad coalitions of support necessary for sustained public investment. Our research shows such policies can work and command public support. The question is whether progressive parties have the will to fight for them and offer a real alternative to the far right’s politics of scarcity and blame.Tarik Abou-Chadi is a professor of European Politics at the University of Oxford; Björn Bremer is an assistant professor at the Department of Political Science at Central European University in Vienna; Silja Häusermann is a professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of ZurichDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The big question is: what happens when ‘later’ arrives?Larry ElliottThe chancellor has given Labour breathing space with modest giveaways, but can only hope for an upturn in the government’s fortunes before tax increases kick inThu 27 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 12.45 ESTShareSome budgets are important but quickly forgotten. Some budgets are trivial but linger long in the memory. The package of measuresRachel Reeveshas delivered is a rarity: a budget that matters and will go down in the history books. And perhaps not for the right reasons.Make no mistake, the buildup was shambolic, and real damage has been caused by the leaks and counter-leaks coming out of the Treasury.The early releaseby the Office for Budget Responsibility of the contents of what the chancellor had in store was a final, chaotic twist marring what was supposed to be Reeves’s big day.Despite the embarrassment of having pundits dissect her measures before she had actually announced them, the chancellor put in a combative performance, defending her policy choices and attacking the Conservatives for their record in office between 2010 and 2024. In this, she was helped no end by the still vivid memories of the Liz Truss mini-budget of three years ago. ForLabour, Truss is the gift that keeps on giving.Expectations were so low ahead of the budget that it didn’t take much to exceed them. Things may yet unravel quickly, but the signs are that the package provides the chancellor – and the government – with a bit of much-needed breathing space.That’s because, after all the dire predictions of gaping black holes in the public finances, the OBR’s forecasts were not nearly as bad as the City pundits had expected. There was never any need to consider theheavily trailed 2p risein the basic rate of income tax. Through a hodgepodge of other measures, Reeves has more than doubled the size of the buffer against any unexpected bad economic news to £22bn.November forecast more than doubles fiscal headroomBut a breathing space is one thing; a sustained improvement in Labour’s political fortunes is quite another. The chancellor had best be hoping that her second budget is received better than her first, because the future of the government hangs on how well it goes down with two audiences: the financial markets and voters. Keeping both onside is going to prove a difficult – and perhaps impossible – task.The markets liked the fact that Reeves was increasing the size of her rainy-day fund to £22bn by the end of the decade, but were much less keen on the live now, pay later shape of the budget. Spending is increasing in the short term, but the higher taxes will only start to kick in as the date of the next election approaches, when the government will be looking to keep voters sweet. The markets are already starting to wonder how serious the commitment to financial rectitude actually is. Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo markets, summed up City scepticism when he commented: “Big spending increases front-loaded, massive tax increases and restraint has been back-loaded – the classic policy mix: jam today, pain tomorrow. I hardly think it seems credible.”But nor for that matter would be front-loading tax increases at a time when unemployment is rising and growth is stagnant. That would simply increase the real risk of the economy getting stuck in a doom loop of depressed activity leading to weaker public finances and hence pressure for still higher taxes or public spending cuts. There was already a Groundhog Day feel to Reeves’s second budget, and she will want to avoid another tax-raising package next year at all costs.From 2026, GDP growth is less than previously predictedInstead,she is banking oncuts to energy bills, the freezing of rail fares and the increase in the minimum wage to buy her a little time. It is possible, for example, that the reduction in inflation next year from lower energy bills will speed up the pace at which the Bank of England cuts interest rates.There are two problems with this approach. First, the giveaways are much more modest than the eventual tax increases, and the tax increases will hit even low-paid workers. Someone on the minimum wage working full-time will be payingan extra £137 a yearby 2030 due to the extended freeze on tax thresholds.The second problem is that there is no guarantee that the Bank of England will accelerate cuts in interest rates, or that the financial markets will continue to have faith in the chancellor. Reeves and her fellow ministers talk a good game about how the government is turbo-charging growth, but there is precious little to show for it. Growth would indeed solve all sorts of problems. It would raise tax receipts, reduce the deficit and obviate the need for tough choices. Yet the budget contained no new supply-side measures that might boost the UK’s growth potential.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our panel responds | Polly Toynbee and othersRead moreFor Reeves, the hope is that her package will do for Keir Starmer what Geoffrey Howe’s 1981 budget is supposed to have done for Margaret Thatcher: mark a turning point in the government’s fortunes. Then, too, the government was hugely unpopular. Then, too, the chancellor froze tax allowances. Little more than two years later, Thatcher won a second term in office by a landslide.Howe was in the happy position, in the days before Bank of England independence, of being able to announce a two percentage-point cut in interest rates on the day after his budget. That option is not available to Reeves. Nor is there likely to be a repeat of the Falklands war – arguably a bigger factor in Thatcher’s re-election than Howe’s budget.So Reeves can only sit tight and hope that something turns up. There is no guarantee that it will.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025OpinionRachel ReevesLabourTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

Watch out for the narrative that will followFrances RyanThe right is already in a frenzy about the migrant groups it thinks will benefit – and the budget contained other trade-offsThu 27 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 15.10 ESTShareAnd just like that, the two-child benefit limit was finally abolished.“I don’t intend to preside over a status quo that punishes children for the circumstances of their birth,” the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, told the Commons, as she used the budget to scrap, from April 2026, one of Britain’s most controversial policies.Four hundred and fifty thousand children will be lifted out of poverty as a result. That means 450,000 children who won’t go to bed hungry any more or walk to school with holes in the soles of their shoes. That means Keir Starmer’s government, after 16 months in power and endless will-they-won’t-they procrastination, has – at last – done the right thing.Introduced by the Conservatives in 2017 to curb public spending and teach low-income parents that“children cost money”, the policy means parents can claim universal credit or tax credits only for their first two offspring. As of this summer, a staggering1.7 million childrenlived in households affected by the policy. That’sone in nine kidswho miss out on help worth £3,514 a year.Over nearly a decade, the cap has become a key part of the “war on welfare” narrative – and the key driver of worsening child poverty. The two-child limit fundamentally broke a core tenet of the welfare state: rather than helping a child because they are in need, it arbitrarily denied support based on the order of their birth.The notorious“rape clause”– in which women have to prove to the state that their third pregnancy was conceived without consent to get an exemption – came to symbolise the scale and casual cruelty of Tory austerity. As Reeves, Britain’s first female chancellor, said with palpable emotion on Wednesday, she won’t tolerate it.Labour MPs, charities and civil groups will all be relieved that the Treasury has finally found the funds to repeal it, though not everyone will forgive Reeves for the wait. Each day that she and Starmer prevaricated, an average of 109 more childrenwere pushedinto poverty.No one can pretend they didn’t know the harm it was causing. As far back as six years ago,research showednearly all families affected by the limit were cutting back on food, medication, heating or clothing. Domestic violence survivors have long warned that the policy makes it harder to leave an abusive partner. Other women have said they felt pushed towards an abortion, often after their contraception failed. Politicians – both those with either a blue or a red rosette – let it continue anyway.But if those on the left rue Starmer’s failure to end the policy sooner as a sign of his abandonment of Labour values, those on the right will use its abolition – in a tax-raising budget – as proof that he is prioritising benefits claimants. Or as the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, put it on Wednesday: “The Labour party should be renamed theWelfareparty.”Days before the budget, the Daily Mail published a poll asking readers whether Reeves should use a raid on the “salary sacrifice” tax break on private pensions to fund ending the two-child cap. Expect much more of this worker v shirker propaganda in the coming days, despite the fact nearly three in five families affected by the cap were already in work – and that any of us might lose a job or fall ill after having a child we could previously afford.Watch out also for the rise in anti-migrant sentiment adding a layer of racism to this longstanding classism. When the Times reported on the two-child limit’seffect on child povertythis week, it noted that rising immigration “may” be a “contributing factor” to hardship and large families, with white British people less likely than “Bangladeshi families” or “Pakistani families” to have three or more children. In recent days, hard-right social media accounts have been posting about the groups that will supposedly benefit from the policy change, often accompanied by unidentified photos of large minority-ethnic families. In the 2010s, the right’s fear was the working class breeding too much; in 2025, it’s working-class people who aren’t white.That Reeves felt she had to pair repealing the two-child limit with removing tax relief for the Motability scheme and leases for “luxury cars” for disabled people shows starkly the deal that she is making with the rightwing media and potential Reform voters. It is not enough to give children a warm meal because they are hungry. Ministers must justify it by reassuring critics they have not gone “soft on welfare”. Compassion, it seems, comes with a footnote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes, it is both at once. Eight years of campaigning,court casesand a change in government have at last rid the country of the scourge of the benefit limit. Hundreds of thousands of children will be safer; their parents less afraid.And yet the energy it took to get here and the backlash it has already provoked show starkly how progress is an uphill battle. Decency is not a simple sell. Prejudice and resentment are, sadly, much easier to spread. The most obvious of truths – that every child matters, that some things go beyond partisan point-scoring – are, to some, not obvious at all.Cheer the victory today. Tomorrow, the fight continues. The two-child limit is at last abolished but the sentiment that created it is alive and well.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025OpinionChild benefitsChildrenPovertyWelfareRachel ReevesBudgetcommentShareReuse this content"

After she delivered her second budget statement, it still is. Even more than usual, Wednesday’s speech was full of significant fiscal changes, altered spending commitments and adjusted economic forecasts, most of themaccidentally (and, for journalists, conveniently) releaseda short while in advance by the obviously misnamed Office for Budget Responsibility. Politically, however, almost nothing has changed at all.Reeves arrived in the Treasury last year offering what she, like Keir Starmer, had promised as the Conservative years ebbed: competence, stability and, above all, a focus on economic growth. Her problem, despite her upbeat assessments, is that she hasdelivered none of them. Nothing about the 2025 budget guarantees any early change in that, however defiantly Reeves spoke about reversing the OBR’s reduced new growth and productivity forecasts.No one is more aware of the dispirited national mood than Reeves herself. In her pre-budget video, she acknowledged the public’s continuing frustration and anger. What she did not acknowledge – although she is painfully aware of it in private and it shaped big parts of her budget – was that the same frustration and anger that carriedLabourinto government is now threatening to sweep Labour out of it again.Only an incorrigible Labour optimist – and there are very few of these at the moment – could say the 2025 budget has calmed those feelings, let alone laid them to rest. In some respects, indeed, the 2025 budget has made things worse, and not simply because of the many tax rises which, do not delude yourself, are never popular. All this will be overstated by a largely hostile press, but it seems inevitable that the 2025 budget will be remembered for the many taxes Reeves put up, rather than for the big one, income tax, that in the end she did not.From 2026 GDP growth is less than previously predictedBetween now and Christmas, political and media focus will be on whether Wednesday’s complex mix ofnew duties, stealth taxes and public spending hikes can cut it with the public, the bond markets and the Labour party. The budget blowbacks experienced in the past by chancellors such as Gordon Brown and George Osborne should remind all of them to expect the unintended. My own tuppenceworth is that higher taxes on private pension contributions may deter savings and boost consumer spending in quite significant ways for the economy.Right now, it is still the Labour party, particularly its fearful MPs and its candidates facing tough elections next May, that matters most in political terms. The backbenches seemed to welcome most of what Reeves announced – the end of thetwo-child benefit capin particular. Hardly surprising this, since this became a budget designed to calm a fractious Labour party, not one aimed at swing voters in marginal seats. This remains a very vulnerable time for both Reeves and Starmer. Their party still holds a lot of power over them.This budget will not merely define Reeves’s career and Labour’s prospects. Anyone with good sense in Whitehall should use what happened in this budget to force a comprehensive rethink of the whole budget preparation process. The OBR’s humiliating premature launch was merely the last straw for a more general failure. The long run-in to a very late budget meant a loss of good decision-making. The official strategy of pre-budget leaking is also completely out of hand. It is disreputable, insults parliament, stokes public contempt, empowers journalists to speculate not report and weakens the chancellor’s authority. The 2025 experience has been an object lesson in how not to do things. It should be the last budget of this kind.A lot of these issues predate Reeves’s chancellorship. Yet it remains her responsibility. Her own original sin remains the irresponsible pre-election commitment not to raise the three key personal taxes in this parliament. This underlay the undignified on-again, off-again mixed messages in this year’s drawn-out pre-budget period. It also implied she did not know what she was doing. That judgment is boosted by the fact that lifting the child benefit relief cap sits awkwardly with Reeves’s previous protestations of fiscal prudence. A budget that pleases most of the Labour party in its fissiparous current state is probably a budget with something pretty seriously amiss with it.By Reeves’s own rather modest standards, her speech was decent performative politics. The content may have been grim, but the shape of the statement was smart. There were one or two jokes and some sharp back-and-forth with the opposition. None of this will have harmed her with the Labour benches. But she plainly does not command the Commons as a more powerful chancellor ought to do. Though one accepts that all too few modern ministers of all political tribes seem capable of doing this, it is still a weakness which limits her authority to do difficult things.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The problem for Reeves is that Lawson was right. As Hugo Young once wrote in these pages, budget day is the day when a chancellor does not have a single alibi.

Deep Rising (1998)Stephen Sommers’ sci-fi horror pulp follows a bunch of scene-stealing character actors playing mercenaries hired to destroy the cruise ship Argonautica for insurance purposes. But a giant mutant octopus has got there first! Among the potential cephalopod fodder are Treat Williams, Kevin J O’Connor, and Famke Janssen as a jewel thief.19.

The highlight of Giuseppe Tornatore’s whimsical hokum is Roth fighting a piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton, rather unfairly depicted as a smug bastard.18. Waterworld (1995)Kevin Costner: Waterworld is ‘beloved around the world’Read moreKevin Costner plays a samurai-like drifter with webbed feet and a souped-up trimaran in this megabudget sci-fi B-movie, set in a future where melting polar ice-caps have flooded the planet. Everyone is searching for mythical Dryland while fending off Dennis Hopper and his band of chain-smoking pirates.17. Titanic (1997)View image in fullscreenKate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio in TitanicPhotograph: Landmark Media/AlamyTwo hours of tiresome canoodling between a posh chick (Kate Winslet) and an itinerant yobbo (Leonardo DiCaprio) are redeemed by James Cameron’s spectacular recreation of one the 20th century’s most infamous catastrophes. You have to admire the chutzpah of a film-maker who manages to twist a death toll of 1,500 into an emotionally uplifting tale of emancipation.16. Ship of Fools (1965)View image in fullscreenShip Of Fools.Photograph: Columbia/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockPeasants, flamenco dancers and Nazi eugenicists rub shoulders on a passenger ship sailing from Mexico to Europe in 1933. Stanley Kramer’s epic features Vivien Leigh, in her final role, as a sad divorcee, but it’s Oskar Werner, as the ship’s doctor, and Simone Signoret, as a radical countess, who provide the film with its emotional wallop.15. The Last Voyage (1960)View image in fullscreenRobert Stack in The Last Voyage.Photograph: Cine Text / Allstar/Sportsphoto Ltd. / AllstarThe USS Claridon is ripped apart in an explosion and Robert Stack’s wife (Dorothy Malone) is trapped in their cabin in this gripping proto-disaster pic. Can Stack and a heroic engineer (Woody Strode) save her before the ship sinks? Fun fact: the Claridon is played by the legendary French liner Île de France.14. Death on the Nile (1978)View image in fullscreenFrom left, David Niven, Peter Ustinov and Bette DavisPhotograph: RONALD GRANTBette Davis and Angela Lansbury are among the murder suspects on board a Nile paddle steamer in this all-star Agatha Christie whodunit. Peter Ustinov, as Hercule Poirot, fails to stop half the cast being stabbed or shot, which whittles down his suspects to a manageable number. Bags more fun than the2022 remake.13.Dead Calm(1989)View image in fullscreenNicole Kidman in Dead Calm.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarNicole Kidman and Sam Neill play a married couple trying to get over the trauma of their son’s death by taking their yacht for a spin in the Pacific, where they rescue Billy Zane from a sinking schooner. Big mistake! Phillip Noyce’s thriller is essentially a slasher movie at sea, but an ultra-classy one that put Kidman on the map.12.

Juggernaut (1974)View image in fullscreenRichard Harris in JuggernautPhotograph: Moviestore/REX/ShutterstockRichard Lester gives his disaster thriller a state-of-the-nation tilt in this nerve-shredding yarn of explosives planted on a luxury liner, the SS Britannic. Red wire or blue wire? Richard Harris and David Hemmings play bomb disposal experts; Roy Kinnear, as the ship’s entertainments director, serves up a heartbreaking study in tragicomic desperation.10. The Poseidon Adventure (1972)View image in fullscreenThe Poseidon AdventurePhotograph: Moviestore collection Ltd/AlamyThis adaptation of Paul Gallico’s novel is one of the peaks of the 1970s disaster genre. The SS Poseidon is flipped over by a tsunami, and it’s up to Reverend Gene Hackman to lead his flock through the upturned hull to safety. Shelley Winters is unforgettable as a shopkeeper’s wife with a useful history of competitive swimming.9. All is Lost (2013)View image in fullscreenRobert Redford in All is LostPhotograph: Photo 12/AlamyRobert Redford gives a late-career masterclass in solo performance as a man struggling to survive in the Indian Ocean after his yacht, the Virginia Jean, is damaged in a collision with an errant shipping container. It’s stressful enough to watch, so heaven knows how physically gruelling it must have been for the 76-year-old star to film.8. Captain Phillips (2013)View image in fullscreenTom Hanks in Captain Phillips.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyTom Hanks does sterling work in one of his regular-guys-under-intolerable-pressure roles, as the captain of an American cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa. He’s matched by Barkhad Abdi (“I’m the captain now”), making a sensational film debut as the pirate chief in Paul Greengrass’s thriller, based on real events. If the last scene doesn’t make you blub, you’re not human.7. Triangle (2009)View image in fullscreenTrianglePhotograph: Cinematic/AlamyFreak weather conditions capsize a yacht in Christopher Smith’s terrific Anglo-Australian sci-fi chiller, stranding a frazzled single mother (Melissa George) and her fellow passengers on an abandoned liner in mid-ocean. The timeline gets complicated, so it’s just as well Smith’s plotting is meticulous, anchored by a superb performance from George and capped by a devastating payoff.6. And the Ship Sails On (1983)View image in fullscreenAnd the Ship Sails onPhotograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyFederico Fellini’s gloriously artificial late-career masterpiece is set on board the Gloria N, sailing from Naples towards a Mediterranean isle where a bunch of opera singers plan to scatter a diva’s ashes. But the real world intrudes in the form of Serbian refugees. Freddie Jones, as a genial but bumbling journalist, is our guide to the onboard shenanigans.5. Apocalypse Now (1979)View image in fullscreenApocalypse NowPhotograph: United Artists/Allstar“Never get out of the boat!” Wise words, though bad things happen both on and off the US Navy river patrol boat Erebus as it ferries Captain Willard upriver to Cambodia to terminate Colonel Kurtz’s rogue command “with extreme prejudice” during the Vietnam war. It’s a nightmare journey into the heart of darkness, the title of Joseph Conrad’s 1899 anti-colonial novella that inspired Francis Ford Coppola and John Milius’s screenplay.4. Lifeboat (1944)View image in fullscreenLifeboatPhotograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarAlfred Hitchcock’s wartime survival drama, adapted from a John Steinbeck novella, is a case study in how to film a handful of characters in a cramped location and keep it thrilling. Among the survivors stranded in a lifeboat after their ship is torpedoed are Tallulah Bankhead, as a journalist who offers her diamond bracelet as fish bait, and Walter Slezak as a sneaky German.3. Jaws (1975)View image in fullscreenRobert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss in Jaws.Photograph: Cinetext/Universal/AllstarThe second half of Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster moves from dry land to a fishing boat, the Orca, as salty shark expert Quint (Robert Shaw) teams up with a thalassophobic police chief (Roy Scheider) and nerdy ichthyologist (Richard Dreyfuss) to kill the great white maneater terrorising Amity Island. A bigger boat might have been advisable.2.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)View image in fullscreenRussell Crowe in Master and Commander.Photograph: Stephen Vaughan/APRussell Crowe and Paul Bettany play mismatched nautical chums, Captain Jack Aubrey and nature-loving Dr Stephen Maturin, in Peter Weir’s exemplary conflation of two Patrick O’Brian novels. It’s like a virtual reality immersion in another time and place – on board the HMS Surprise, off the South American coast, during the Napoleonic Wars. Booming cannon, amputation, superstition, sea-shanties and not a single duff note.1. L’Atalante (1934)View image in fullscreenL’AtalantePhotograph: RGR Collection/AlamyA barge captain brings his new bride back to live on his canal boat in one of cinema’s most sublime flights of visual lyricism. While filming his only full-length feature, Jean Vigo was already suffering from the tuberculosis that would kill him at the age of 29.

Then, finally, I started on new music. The “you” in the single are people who feel they have the right to have autonomy over other people’s bodies and make it unsafe for people to be who they want to be. I’m especially talking about queer and mostly trans rights. The song’s like a mantra or chant, a way to empower people in only a few sentences.As a fan of your concert costume design as much as your music, what can we expect from the upcoming tour?KelechicaI was thinking about sustainability and went to a costume sale at the Berlin opera and bought a bunch of opera costumes. I’m working with Charlie Le Mindu, who is transforming them into weird new creations. In the video for Not in Your Mouth, I’m wearing my sister’s leather jacket. It’s just been the fifth anniversary of her passing, and I wanted to keep something of her, so I kept her leather jacket that she wore the crap out of since the 90s. So, in a way, she’ll be in the show.Your album titles –The Teaches ofPeaches, Impeach My Bushand now the forthcomingNo Lube So Rude– are like rallying cries wrapped in provocation. Does the title come first or does that crystallise once the songs have taken shape?VerulamiumParkRangerThe title is always the last thing to come, once I have the big picture. No Lube So Rude is the name of one of the songs, which is about how we can help the friction of the world. We need to smooth it around a little because we have so much irritation and dryness.Is it true that you used to be roommates withFeistin Toronto? What was that like?seoalwatYes – she was making her album Monarch (Lay Your Jewelled Head Down) and I was making The Teaches of Peaches. We lived above a queer sex shop called Come As You Are, where they’d do porn workshops for women, and lectures, but we lived a few floors up so customers never wandered upstairs. Feist and I got along really well and had amazing parties, then we’d go into our rooms and make our albums. Our music was completely different, but we were similar in terms of socialising, and were constantly crushing cockroaches or trapping mice. Our scene in Toronto was very vibrant. Even though we all had different bands, we had a Super 8 film collective and would support each other.Chilly Gonzaleshad a riff-rock band called Freedom; we also had other bands like the Permanent Stains. Feist would be my B-girl in my early Peaches shows. I’m still good friends with her.As a long-term resident of Berlin, do you think it’s losing its edge?meansardineI think the whole world is losing its mind, to be honest, and moving towards crazily dysfunctional gentrification and a wealth gap. Berlin is feeling it like everybody else. Politics and club culture are changing, but I still feel there are pockets of the city that you can cling on to, and we have to keep fighting a good fight and find our place. I moved there 20 years ago because it was cheap and there was lots of space. I felt there was a big creative openness and that what I was doing was more understood there than inCanadaat the time. The politics are complicated now – funding is being cut and such – but it’s still a great place to be creative.View image in fullscreen‘When I went solo I kept the Shit attitude’ … Peaches on stage in London in 2015.Photograph: Jim Dyson/RedfernsWere you really in a band called the Shit?Topcat89I was – with Chilly Gonzales, Mocky [Dominic Salole], who produced some Feist albums, and another member, Sticky [Henderson]. In about 1996, the four of us got together in a basement. We’d smoke a lot of weed and yell whatever we wanted to about what we felt about each other sexually or how we were feeling. It was very impulsive and improvisational. After our first jam, we changed instruments, which was the first time I ever played drums or bass, and I fell in love with keyboards. We just said, “Oh my God, we are the shit!” so named ourselves that. Our live album never came out, but [we] did put out a cassette tape, which had an early version of [Peaches’ 2003 song] Operate. It was actually a very important period for me – when I went solo I kept the Shit attitude.Fatherfuckeris still my go-to karaoke song, much to my daughter’s discomfort, but I feel like our generation of riot queer artists were louder, angrier and more demanding. Is it different working creatively and politically in 2025 v 2005?SUSE____I think it feels important to realise that there’s a younger generation that listen to me, but there’s also an older generation that are not going to stay home and sleep. That’s a wild shift: the older generation is still feeling that punk energy, but the world is a more pressurised place compared to 20 years ago. That’s why I don’t want to water things down, so I give it like I give it, but with the punch of 2025.What do you do in your downtime? Any mountaineering, birdwatching or collecting antiques?mattsketchI drink wine, sleep … I don’t really have much extracurricular stuff because I have so much going on all the time, but I do like a game of ping-pong. I think I’m pretty good, but I just love the sound of the ball and it’s so good for the brain and coordination. There’s a 2012 movie calledPing Pong: Never Too Old for Gold, about older people who play table tennis. One of them was 100 years old, which is so inspiring. I hope I’m playing ping-pong when I’m 100.View image in fullscreen‘The older generation are still feeling that punk energy, but the world is a more pressurised place’ … Peaches.Photograph: The Squirt DeluxeHave you got any more plans to collaborate withChristeene?DrMagicChristeene [AKA “drag terrorist” Paul Soileau] is like a sister, and we’re always talking about collaborations, although there’s nothing concrete. In 2019, when Christeene started the project to honour Sinéad O’Connor, I sang Troy. It’s such a powerful song and I can really belt it out. Sinéad’s first album influenced me a lot as I was going from folk music to understanding dance music, and she had all that. Also, she had a hit song, Mandinka, about genital mutilation, and sang it at the Grammys in a bra top with [the] Public Enemy [logo] etched on her head because they’d been boycotted by the Recording Academy. Just incredible. She also had her baby’s bib in her back pocket, because her record label told her if she had a baby she would never make it. Just a brilliant artist.‘The epitome of amazingness’: how electroclash brought glamour, filth and fun back to 00s musicRead moreIn 2009,the Flaming LipscoveredPink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moonalbum and you guested onThe Great Gig in the Sky.

I ended up being the backup singer for the whole show, which was really fun. Otherwise, I sing the entirety of Jesus Christ Superstar as a one-person show, with a piano player. I do that live, but I would like to record it – use my voice in a different way.The world mostly knows you as a sexually charged rapper and “shock” performance artist, butdo you have any music outside the concept of Peaches sitting on a shelf somewhere?clevergunsI don’t, actually, but it needs to happen.

These phrases have been around so long they can feel as old as language itself.But aphorisms aren’t just historical artifacts. People regularly come up with new ones, and even if they haven’t come from the pen of Confucius or Emily Dickinson, they can shed light on the modernhuman experience with just a few words. In fact, “the aphorism is, in some ways, perfectly suited to the digital age: the oldest form of literature finds its ideal vehicle in the most modern short modes of communication,” writes James Geary in The World in a Phrase: A Brief History of the Aphorism.Geary calls himself an “aphorism addict”. The author has been fascinated by these nuggets of wisdom since he was an eight-year-old reading the Quotable Quotes section of Reader’s Digest. “I loved the puns, paradoxes and clever turns of phrase. And I was amazed at how such a compact statement could contain so much significance,” Geary writes. “These really were words to live by, and when I was about 13, I started collecting them.”They continue to guide him through adult life, Geary says. When he was laid off from a job in journalism years ago amid media downsizing, he panicked. But within minutes of receiving the bad news, he thought of this line from Swedish poet and aphorist Vilhelm Ekelund: “to be placed on treacherous ground is good, because we only learn to stand on our own two feet when the ground is shaking underneath them.” Like any aphorism, it didn’t solve his problem – “but they kind of give you the headspace and the confidence and the affirmation to solve it for yourself. And so I use them every day.”The bestselling book, whose second edition was published this month, contains a chunk of Geary’s collection, ranging from the ancient world to today, along with explanations of the history and significance of each phrase. And while the classics still serve their purpose, modern aphorisms help guide us through the endless digital, cultural and political upheaval that is life in 2025. Here are a few recent ones that might come in handy in 2025:‘I shop therefore I am’This phrase is the work of the New Jersey-born artist Barbara Kruger, born in 1945. Kruger, a former graphic designer for women’s magazines, often places bold words over black and white images, using “the language and format of advertising for aphoristic purposes”, Geary says. “Her aphorisms appear on billboards and they look like advertisements, but they’re advertisements for critical thinking.”‘The right has no trouble speaking their rage’: artist Barbara Kruger on America in crisisRead more“I shop therefore I am” appeared on an image of a business card held in someone’s hand, in various iterations beginning in 1987.The artwork, a play on the philosopher René Descartes’s “I think therefore I am,” might bedecades old, but it feels even more relevant today. “In today’s attention economy and social media dynamics, how do I know I exist? Because I just bought something,” Geary says.‘Adults think with their mouths open’In the liner notes to Talking Heads’ 1984 album Stop Making Sense,David Byrnepenned a list of aphorisms including “everything on stage should be larger than in real life” and “there is always something on television.” “Adults think with their mouths open” lends itself to a couple of interpretations, Geary notes: it conjures an image of a person puzzling something out in their head with their mouth agape, but it also suggests people tend to speak before they think – again particularly relevant in the era of social media.View image in fullscreenDavid Byrne in 1984.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyGeary recalls David Letterman once asking the frontman if his lyrics meant anything; Byrne replied: “Not if you try to figure them out.” Aphorisms like this one, however, are the opposite – they demand to be thought through, and “when you do, you come to these secondary, tertiary meanings that make that single sentence so rich”, says Geary.‘Ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have’The writerJames Baldwinmade this assertion in his book No Name in the Street, published in 1972 – so it may be a stretch to call it modern. But it feels as relevant as ever. “All around the world, expertise and knowledge is under assault, facts are under assault and journalism is under assault,” Geary says. “There’s a really unsettling and dangerous resurgence of people and leaders who don’t want to know inconvenient facts.”This phrase is typical of Baldwin’s nonfiction. “There are these beautiful, ferocious sentences that just erupt out of the essay,” Geary says. “Whenever I’m reading anything, I look for those kind of moments.”‘The trouble with setting goals is that you’re constantly working toward what you used to want’It’s an upsetting idea – undeniably accurate, but it also undermines conventional wisdom about the importance of goal-setting. Still, in Geary’s reading, the writer Sarah Manguso’s remark functions more as cultural criticism than firm life advice. He argues this line from her 2017 book of her own aphorisms,300 Arguments, is a critique of our obsession with achievement – “this kind of ceaseless striving for the next thing when you may not even want the next thing. You may be happy where you are.”‘Life is the abyss into which we deliberately and joyfully thrust ourselves’This advice comes from an animatronic figure at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,on display until next year. The 7ft-tall Fortuna is part of Kara Walker’s Fortuna and the Immortality Garden (Machine), an installation featuring an array of automatons made from obsidian. Fortuna herself points to her mouth and offers visitors printed-out fortunes, including this one, which suggests an enthusiastic embrace of uncertainty, or a glimmer of hope amid darkness. To Geary, it speaks to the creative process. “Whether you write or paint or make music or sew, you always are starting from zero,” he says. “You’re always starting from staring into this abyss.” But, he says, “once you get into the flow of it, it’s the most joyous thing.”View image in fullscreenJames Baldwin on 27 April 1972. (Photo by Sophie Bassouls/Sygma via Getty Images)Photograph: Sophie Bassouls‘Don’t mistake movement for progress, or quiet for failure’OK, these wise words don’t actually appear in Geary’s book. Instead, they were created by an oracle known as ChatGPT, when I asked it to make up an aphorism. It seems like decent advice: whether you’re an activist or an artist, just because things are changing doesn’t mean they’re improving, and just because things look static doesn’t mean you’re on the wrong track.Geary agrees that it’s solid , much better than the slightly unhinged aphorism ChatGPT spit out for him: “In life’s tapestry, metaphors weave truth’s cloak, disguising wisdom in the folds of everyday moments.” Whether the program’s advice is good or bad, Geary doesn’t see it as a threat to human wisdom, which will always be unique to the individual. His larger concern is that relying on AI to generate ideas and shape our languageremoves the challenge of writing, and by extension the essential challenge of thinking. A large language model can do the work for you – but “that defeats the whole purpose of having a brain, being an individual and living your own life,” he says. “Let ChatGPT write aphorisms too – great. I don’t mind. But let’s keep writing aphorisms ourselves.”The World in a Phrase: A Brief History of the Aphorism is available in theUSandUKExplore more on these topicsBooksJames BaldwinDavid ByrnefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A wild season finale loomsZach VasquezThu 27 Nov 2025 07.31 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Nov 2025 07.49 ESTShareTonight’sSouth Parkis something of a breather in what has been their most story-driven season (or seasons, as it turned out) ever. There is some advancement to the overriding plot of Donald Trump attempting to kill the unborn baby he’s expecting with his lover, Satan, before it can unleash the prophesied apocalypse – a plot that involves master manipulator (and new Trump sex partner) JD Vance and billionaire/self-proclaimed antichrist expert Peter Thiel (recently incarcerated by South Park’s finest for kidnapping Eric Cartman). But tonight’s instalment, Turkey Trot, focuses more on the goings-on in the titular town than in Washington DC.As Thanksgiving approaches, South Park finds its annual holiday marathon in jeopardy. None of its regular sponsors – Stan Marsh’s Tegridy Weed Farms, recently shuttered, and City Asian Popup Store, beset by high tariffs – can afford to pay for it. Desperate for a solution, the town reaches out to the one entity that has plenty of money to spend in America: the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.The Saudis are only too happy to sponsor the foot race, going as far as to offer a $5k prize to the team of the first-place runner. Their one caveat: “Disparaging remarks towards the Saudi royal family are strictly prohibited.”Everyone in South Park is desperate to win the prize money, but none more so than Cartman, who is convinced he can lead his team to victory using “race science”. An obvious double entendre, his plan is simply to get the one African American boy in their class, Tolkien Black, to join the team, convinced that “[his] race always wins races”. But Cartman’s plan goes to pot when Tolkien quits in protest after learning of the Saudis’ involvement. Much of the remainder of this plotline involves Cartman referencingthe hugely criticised Riyadh comedy festivalheld in Saudi Arabia as he tries to persuade Tolkien that it’s a good idea to let Saudi Arabia spend money on American sporting events. Otherwise they would just “go back to what they were doing … hacking up reporters and inviting Pete Davidson to come do comedy”.View image in fullscreen‘Hacking up reporters and inviting Pete Davidson to come do comedy’ … Eric Cartman gives Tolkien his South Park verdict on the Saudis.Photograph: Comedy CentralThis is far from South Park’s most transgressive takedown of a powerful and dangerous force, with none of the Saudi royal family or government coming in for any personal sendups. That’s more than can be said for members of the American regime, as the episode’s other storyline focuses on idiotic defence secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempts to spring Thiel from his fictional lockup. Hegseth acts like a macho commando, but he’s too concerned with posting content on social media – including videos of him pitifully attempting to do chin-ups, as seen in the real-life video he appeared in alongside the health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr – to carry out his mission.(Trump, in the one scene he appears in tonight, chides Hegseth: “Don’t just make a bunch of content. Like, actually go and do something!”)Oh my God, they riled Donny! The 15 biggest South Park scandals … rankedRead moreHegseth is outmatched at every turn by the town’s usually buffoonish Det Harris, who has zero patience for his douchebag antics (Hegseth gets his own theme song all about being a douchebag, set to the tune of Kenny Loggins’s Danger Zone) and continually kicks him in the ass. Humiliated, Hegseth assembles his forces in the town square and, with the unwanted help of Kristi Noem’s ICE agents, wages war on the Turkey Trot, shooting the runners with teargas and rappelling down on them from Black Hawk helicopters. This assault ends up earning Cartman and Tolkien, who have found themselves in the middle of the fracas, the victory and grand prize, but Hegseth is unable to carry out his own mission. Harris, having had all he can stomach of Hegseth, kicks his butt into the same prison cell as Thiel. The episode ends with Hegseth angrily proclaiming: “South Park is gonna pay for this! They’re all gonna pay!”Initially, this season of South Park was expected to run for 10 episodes. While the decision to split the season in two changed the length of each, the forthcoming episode, set to air on 10 December, is expected to serve as the big finale. The pieces are certainly in place for an epic showdown, with the forces of darkness – both Trump and the antichrist – set to descend upon the town.There’s no point in trying to predict how things will end, or even if they’ll end at all, as series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker may choose to keep Trump and his cronies a central focus of next season and beyond, having inkedtheir new deal with Paramountearlier this year for 50 new episodes. But given how newsworthy this run of South Park has proven, with record high ratings and more national attention than they’ve seen in years, you can bet it’ll be plenty wild and likely very, very offensive.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkAnimation on TVTelevisionUS televisionTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That spawned six books, a TV series, a film, comics, stage adaptations – and branded bath towels.Booming business indeed yet it is odd to see the sale of merchandise as part of thisimmersive show(there is one booth selling branded goods within the production and a second in the foyer), as well as a bar at every turn. That commercial opportunism grates. Is this an attempt to take the audience into Adams’s imaginative universe in a new, interactive way – or merely a cash cow?View image in fullscreenDelightful … Andrew Evans with Marvin.Co-created by designer Jason Ardizzone-West and writer Arvind Ethan David, it reverently cross-references across the books and seems to be aiming for its own story, despite the hard sell. This chimes with the spirit of Adams who added new, sometimes contradictory, aspects across the many manifestations of the original tale.But despite a vast set spread across several rooms, the final one opening up to a virtual bonfire of luminous, super-computer effects, there are too many mere nods to Adams’s characters, without flesh around them or the plotlines. This might leave initiates bamboozled too: who are these people, what makes them tick, what is the jeopardy in their world?A promenade show directed by Georgia Clarke-Day, with discrete casts over different time slots, it begins with Arthur (Robert Thompson) typically in his dressing gown and bath towel (at least one member of the audience came dressed the same way). There is no Trillian, the one other – female – human survivor of the first book, but Fenchurch (Kat Johns-Burke) instead, from a later book, whom Arthur meets for a karaoke date in Rickmansworth, along with his friend, Ford Prefect (Oliver Britten).They blast out a couple of well-sung pop classics (What’s Up? by 4 Non Blondes and Gnarls Barkley’s Crazy) and there is a too quick disclosure by Ford that he is an alien in disguise before the Vogons – destroyers of the Earth – descend.The invasion is reported on screens and audio breaking news. We are herded from an initial bar space to another room, representing a rescue spacecraft. Urgency is announced but not felt. Then it’s on to another room, and another aircraft, this time with iconic characters from Adams’s world, including Beeblebrox (Lee V G), Eccentrica Gallumbits (Briony Scarlett) and Slartibartfast (Richard Costello).Scrooge gets a hip-hop spin and the RSC does the BFG: 20 of the best UK stage shows this ChristmasRead moreThe problem is that they pop up as cameos, not nearly rounded enough, although they are fabulously dressed by costume designer Susan Kulkarni (metallic dresses, purple frills and a glittery dressing gown for Arthur in the final scene). The audience is left to wander around the room, initially. When the drama kicks in, it does not do enough, despite the eye-catching optics.Arthur is a flatly diffident, depressed type; Fenchurch is equally flimsy. The Earth’s destruction takes a backseat to romance between them but it is too brief to sweep you in. It is a shame that the arc of the story is so truncated because there are some incredibly strong vocal performances during the song and dance numbers, along with the lavish visuals. But without the story to tether it, these are just floating effects.What is singularly winning is Marvin (the paranoid android), a red-eyed robot puppet who is excellently voiced and manipulated by Andrew Evans. Surly little Marvin is so delightfully entertaining - like ET on a downer – that you want more from him. Please can he have his own immersive show?AtRiverside Studios, London, until 15 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreDouglas AdamsScience fiction booksFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The fifth and last season arrives almost three-and-a-half years after a fourth run that felt like a finale, not least because it seemed the kids had grown up. Having originally aped beloved 1980s films where stubbornly brave children avert apocalypse, the franchise now starred young adults and had adjusted plotlines and dialogue accordingly. Life lessons had been learned. Selves had been found. Adolescent anxieties – as personified by Vecna, the narky telekinetic tree-man who rules a parallel dimension adjacent to the humdrum town of Hawkins, Indiana – had been put aside.But Stranger Things now belatedly returns, with the cast all visibly in their 20s. This is a problem. The whole point is that it’s fun to watch kids outrun monsters by pedalling faster on their BMX bikes, or ignoring their mum calling them to dinner because they’re in the basement with their school pals, drawing up plans to bamboozle the US military using pencils, bubblegum and Dungeons & Dragons figurines. If everyone looks old enough to have a studio apartment and a stocks portfolio, none of the above really flies.View image in fullscreenEveryone now looks old enough to have a studio apartment and a stocks portfolio … Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas and Sadie Sink as Max in Stranger Things season five.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/PAThe four new episodes – three more are coming for Christmas, with a further, definitely final one at New Year – get around this by shrinking the Stranger Things world. We don’t leave Hawkins, unless it’s to visit nightmare mirror town the Upside Down, or the mind-palace realm made of memories that Vecna takes his victims to if he really wants to mess with them. Even Hawkins as a location hardly exists: parents, teachers and the general populace no longer appear unless entirely necessary. There’s just the sinister government research facility (now heavily guarded by soldiers) where all the trouble started, and the main group of characters, scheming to break into the Upside Down and defeat Vecna for good – a quest that has obliterated all other concerns.View image in fullscreenA solidly thrilling spectacle … David Harbour as Hopper and Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in Stranger Things season five.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/PAOur friends have become ageless, their core characteristics trapped in amber. Gadgetty herbert Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), fast-talking free spirit Robin (Maya Hawke), intense psychic warrior Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and determined nerd Mike (Finn Wolfhard) all continue to do their thing. Pals such as Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), who have never really found their thing, are still welcomed along for the ride, as are the token adults in the group, Joyce and Hop (Winona Ryder and David Harbour).‘It’s time for it to end’: the stars of Stranger Things open up about their final, epic seasonRead moreWith each of the four episodes running on from the previous one, we have a five-hour action-comedy-horror movie, where each part of the story is luxuriously stretched. Episode one is all set up; episode four is a solidly thrilling 90 minutes of flame-throwing, bullet-dodging spectacle that makes good use of what looks like a virtually limitless effects budget, and which culminates in a moment that will have fans standing on their chairs and hollering joyfully.Along the way, the gang set traps, crawl through tunnels, recruit spies and fiddle with radios, encouraging and arguing with each other as they improvise their way out of every impossible situation just as they always have. This year’s reference points, in lighting, composition or plot, include The Exorcist, Home Alone, Back to the Future, Little Red Riding Hood, The Great Escape, Jurassic Park and the cult 1985 French-Canadian animated movie The Peanut Butter Solution – but the overriding influence is Stranger Things itself. It has successfully patchworked its own unique genre vibe, a formula that can be profitably re-run, at least once more.View image in fullscreenWorth indulging it one last time … Noah Schnapp as Will.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/PAAnd, crucially, character development is not totally absent. Much of the action is driven by budding investigative journalist Nancy (Natalia Dyer), who is prompted to find her inner fire when an older man pats her on the shoulder, calls her “sweetheart” and tells her not to worry about difficult adult things. Then there’s the long-awaited blossoming of Will (Noah Schnapp), who was Vecna’s first victim in season one, episode one. As it succumbs to the instinct to end by returning to the beginning, Stranger Things opens season five by revisiting that moment, then works to turn Will, who for ages has been a frustratingly pale, baleful presence defined by his trauma, into the most important member of the ensemble.Will is secretly gay, which could be just another coming-of-age tribulation, but writers/directors the Duffer Brothers have always treated their creations with more thought and sensitivity than you might expect a billion-dollar retro fantasy thriller to allow. Now, in Will, they find not just one more journey of self-discovery to embark on, but the show’s most moving one of all. Stranger Things definitely needs to switch off its boombox, hang up its catapults and admit it’s too old for these capers, but it’s worth indulging it one last time.Stranger Things season five is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsStranger ThingsTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

And as the devastating end neared, then the initial grief of losing her daughter, Rice mostly coped by huddling over her typewriter, crafting what became her first novel: the enduring classic Interview With the Vampire.“I knew that writing was the only thing I could do, and when I wrote it was like fighting the darkness, pushing all the absurdity and horror away,” Rice later said of her novel about vampires fighting the complications of immortality, including a five-year-old girl inspired by Mouse.When Rice was done, the first read went to her husband, Mouse’s father, the poet Stan Rice. Stan Rice once recounted how he read it in “approximately one sitting” and upon finishing it told himself: “Our life will never be the same.”“And,” he said, “it never was.”Indeed it was not. The bestselling book, released in 1976, inspireda moviestarring Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and a young Kirsten Dunst, and more recentlya Netflix series. It spurred sequels including Queen of the Damned and aBroadway musicalscored by Elton John. It gained Rice international fame, a huge following and a fortune, the most visible reminder of which was one of the most recognizable mansions in her home town New Orleans: the old St Elizabeth’s orphanage.View image in fullscreenBrad Pitt and Tom Cruise in Interview with the Vampire.Photograph: BFA/AlamyNow, atAnneRice.com, that story and myriad other related ones are being retold in an anthology of documentaries being made available for streaming for free starting Thursday.Anne Rice: An All Saints’ Day Celebration was helmed by her son, the author Christopher Rice, and his business partner and her close friend Eric Shaw Quinn. It contains archival footage, privately held photographs and new interviews, paying tribute to the literary titan whodiedat 80 toward the end of 2021 following a stroke. And it chronicles a live event in New Orleans at the beginning of November that celebrated Rice’s legacy.Part of the documentary anthology, previewed by the Guardian, not only honors the role that the big sister Christopher Rice never met played in their mother’s career. It also explores the influence Rice had on authors who came after her, including the fantasy and romance novelistJennifer Armentrout, who says on screen: “Many of us would not have the careers that we have now without her.”And it unpacks the feeling of acceptance engendered through some of the characters she created in the early years of the LGBTQ+ civil rights movement, especially Lestat de Lioncourt and Louis de Pointe du Lac. In Rice’s debut as an author, that pair fashioned a family of sorts with their fellow vampire, the kindergarten-aged Claudia.“When I was a kid reading Interview With the Vampire, I was a gay kid,” Rob Roth, the director of the Elton John-backed stage play Lestat, says in the anthology. “And the love between Lestat and Louis, just reading about it … made me feel better – like not so alone.”View image in fullscreenA musical tribute at the Anne Rice: An All Saints’ Day celebration live event in New Orleans.Photograph: Frank L Aymami IIIQuinn, a novelist himself, says in the film that he encountered Interview while “going through one of the worst times in my life”.“And it was like Anne reached out to me and said, ‘You are OK – exactly the way you are,’” Quinn remarks. “And you don’t have to apologize to anyone for it.”The approach vaulted her to rarefied air. For instance, one of the anthology’s clips sees Rosie O’Donnell introducing Rice as a guest on her talkshow – and describing how the host, arguably at the peak of her career, waited five hours outside a bookstore for the author.Christopher Rice, speaking with the Guardian recently, shared another anecdote he had otherwise guarded about the kinds of celebrities who would seek her out. Ozzy Osbourne left his mother backstage passes once when he was performing inNew Orleans, but she didn’t attend, primarily preferring to spend her evenings – as her son put it – “in a Laura Ashley sundress eating crackers and cheese”.Her absence from the performance so crushed Osbourne that when Christopher Rice and a friend tried to use the passes, the former Black Sabbath frontman refused them entry. “They wanted to meet Anne – that was that,” Christopher Rice said, laughing nostalgically.View image in fullscreenChristopher Rice delivers a final remembrance at the Anne Rice: An All Saints’ Day celebration live event in New Orleans at the beginning of November 2025.Photograph: Frank L Aymami IIIChristopher Rice and Quinn said they also made it a point for viewers of their documentary anthology to hear from those who got a look behind the curtain of Anne’s public persona. One of the staples of that persona were coffins – to either arrive at book signings in or display in her imposing home at the north-east corner of Napoleon Avenue and Prytania Street in New Orleans.One of the more humorous voices in Anne Rice: An All Saints’ Day Celebration is that of Amy Troxler, a religion schoolteacher in New Orleans who also worked as a part-time assistant to the author – and addresses those coffins in a distinctive local accent.“There was a coffin in the living room, and I thought, ‘What is that coffin?’” a clearly befuddled Troxler says in one of the anthology’s documentaries. “‘What kind of people put coffins in their living room?’ It was a pretty coffin, though, I must say.”If Christopher Rice and Quinn have their way, the anthology won’t be the final word on Anne. Her son said he and Quinn had been “reviewing the archive of Anne’s work, both published and unpublished, with an eye towards future publications and productions across many platforms.“Stay tuned.”Explore more on these topicsAnne RiceNew OrleansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The disappearance of my work from bookshops would mark a truly extreme incursion by the state into the realm of artistic expression.”Rooney described Palestine Action’s work as “courageous and admirable” and said it was dedicated to preventing crimes against humanity by Israel. The author said she had not been presented with any reason to withdraw her support for the direct action protest group other that “it would be more convenient to me personally and professionally if I pretended to do so”.The court heard on Thursday from Adam Straw KC, representing Ben Saul, the UN special rapporteur on protecting human rights whilst countering terrorism, one of three intervenors in the case (the others beingLiberty and Amnesty UK).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So, I have some good news and some bad news. Good news, we’ve had a full circle moment. I’m back making TikTok content in my parents’ house.

The estate said that while it has previously licensed Cash’s songs,Coca-Coladid not approach them for permission in this instance.“Stealing the voice of an artist is theft. It is theft of his integrity, identity and humanity,” said Tim Warnock, a lawyer for the Cash estate. “The trust brings this lawsuit to protect the voice of Johnny Cash – and to send a message that protects the voice of all of the artists whose music enriches our lives.”The singer on the ad is namedShawn Barker, who works as a professional Cash impersonator.The estate is seeking an injunction to remove the ad from the air, damages under the Elvis act, as well as damages for alleged violations of consumer protections in Tennessee.‘He’d turned into a weird old grandpa’: how Johnny Cash resurrected his career – and became an iconRead more“This case arises from Coca-Cola’s pirating Johnny Cash’s voice in a nationwide advertising campaign to enrich itself – without asking for permission or providing any compensation to the humble man and artist who created the goodwill from which Coca-Cola now profits,” the complaint said.Coca-Cola has yet to comment on the matter. A representative for Barker told Billboard magazine that his team was “thrilled when we were approached to have Shawn sing vocals for this commercial”.His manager Joey Waterman said: “Shawn Barker has been performing with his Cash tribute The Man in Black: A Tribute to Johnny Cash for over two decades, touring the world sharing his love of Johnny Cash’s music and stories with fans both old and new.”Last year the Cash estate releasedSongwriter, a collection of previously abandoned songs made by the country star when he was down on his luck in the 90s – before a collaboration with Rick Rubin restored his legend for his final years.

Joseph hopes to write a profile of the reclusive artist, but soon, to his surprise, becomes his model. “A seductive combination of romance, puzzle and poetry, The Artist also offers a considered interrogation of the value of art,” wrote Christobel Kent in aGuardian reviewof the novel.Waterstones’ head of books, Bea Carvalho, described it as a “gorgeously escapist novel which seamlessly transports the reader to the sticky heat of sun-soaked 1920s southern France.” Steeds “is a writer of staggering, rare talent and it has been a joy to see this bookseller favourite become a word-of-mouth sensation,” she added.Meanwhile, The Café at the Edge of the Woods by Mikey Please was named children’s book of the year, having won the children’s prize in March. Padella, a pasta cookbook, was chosen as gift of the year.The winners will receive the “full and committed backing of Waterstones shops and booksellers across the UK”.Along with the three winning titles, the book of the year shortlist – made up of fiction, nonfiction and children’s contenders – featured Ocean by David Attenborough and Colin Butfield, Universality by Natasha Brown, Donut Squad: Take Over the World! by Neill Cameron, Sunrise on the Reaping by Suzanne Collins, Craftland by James Fox, The Raven Scholar by Antonia Hodgson, Alice With a Why by Anna James, Katabasis by RF Kuang, So Long, See You Tomorrow by William Maxwell, The Let Them Theory by Mel Robbins, Mother Mary Comes to Me by Arundhati Roy and Strange Pictures by Uketsu.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In 2023,writers were invited to submit narrative nonfiction, but now the prize will focus on fiction for the first time.Open to writers living in the UK or Ireland, the prize is intended to uncover new literary voices whose work reflects the experiences of migration. Footnote Press, an imprint of Bonnier Books UK, and Counterpoints Arts, a national organisation focusing on arts, migration and cultural change, say the award will highlight fiction “centred around themes of displacement, courage and belonging”.The winner will receive a £7,500 cash prize and a further £7,500 advance as part of a publication agreement with Footnote Press. The Southbank Centre in London will support the prize by hosting a public event in May, where the shortlisted writers will read and discuss their work.This year’s judging panel includes Dina Nayeri, author of The Ungrateful Refugee, Waterstones’ head of books Bea Carvalho, Footnote Press commissioning editor Serena Arthur, and Almir Koldzic, director and co-founder of Counterpoints Arts.“In a time marked by deepening divisions and intolerance, the prize feels especially necessary and urgent,” said Koldzic. “We hope it will help us amplify remarkable new literary voices and lived experiences of displacement, bringing us fresh perspectives and questions about our society today and in the future.”Submissions are open and will close 13 February. Entries must include an 8,000–10,000-word sample and a synopsis of at least 1,500 words. A shortlist will be announced in May, with the winner revealed during Refugee Week in June.“The prize is still centred around themes that are core to both Footnote’s ethos and list, but I’m especially excited to be turning to fiction this time around,” said Arthur.The first Footnote x Counterpoints prize, awarded for nonfiction, was won by Sabrin Hasbun in 2024 for Crossing: A Love Story Between Italy and Palestine. Published in May this year, it is a memoir tracing the love story between Hasbun’s Palestinian father and her Italian mother.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I am generally sceptical about books that use child narrators to add poignancy to dark plots, or novels that use nazism as a means of introducing moral jeopardy to their characters’ journeys. And yet by the end Jolly had won me over. This is a book that walks a tightrope between sentimentality and honesty, between realism and imagination, and creates something spirited and memorable as it does so.We meet our fierce narrator, Adelheid Brunner, when she is brought into a children’s hospital by her grandmother, who cannot cope with the little girl’s fixations. Adelheid is obsessed with the matchboxes of the title, which she is constantly studying, ordering and occasionally discarding. In the hospital, she finds that she and her fellow child inmates are the object of obsessive study in turn by their doctors – sometimes understood, sometimes valued, and then, tragically, sometimes discarded.Adelheid sees how certain disabilities spark particular interest from one of the key doctors, Dr A, who is intrigued by the children he calls his “little professors”. This, we come to understand, is Dr Hans Asperger, whose research in the Vienna children’s hospital in the 1930s laid the groundwork for the understanding of autism.Adelheid works out how she needs to present herself in order to thrive in this milieu: to show that she is valuable and not to be discarded. “One can put on the coat of a Life,” she realises, “and perhaps change for another garment when the need arises.” She is able to leave the hospital for a time, and watch the rise of nazism from her position as a waitress in her grandmother’s crowded cafe, returning as a ward assistant during the dark years of the second world war.While the narrative is pretty impressionistic at times, Jolly is clearly trying to keep to the historical reality of this hospital. This was indeed where staff carefully observed their patients, but it is also where, during the war, decisions were taken to send many of them to another clinic, where they were subjected to medical experiments or murdered.Adelheid’s joy in ordinariness adds up to a great paean to the humanity that the Nazis wanted to destroyI’m no expert on this harsh corner of history, but it had recently sparked my interest after readingNaomi Klein’s book Doppelganger. Klein also explores the way that the Vienna children’s hospital under Asperger became a “key node in the system of sorting who would live and who would be murdered”. Klein dissects Asperger’s shift from care to callousness, from curiosity to murder, in order to ask how we can resist that shift right now. As a novelist, Jolly is less interested in the bigger lessons and more interested in the moment-by-moment anguish and chaos of those times. But there is a synergy between Klein’s work and Jolly’s, both of whom seem to be on a journey to identify what makes us human and what destroys that humanity.Adelheid is not a straightforward guide on that journey. As the novel begins, the Reich’s ostensible love of order appeals to her. When the Germans march into Vienna, she is ready for them: “My flag is already positioned in a vase on the windowsill and I also have a most shiny tin badge.” She recognises its darker side slowly, as its cruel and arbitrary threats – including to her own survival – unfold.Nobody ever hears Adelheid speak, but her inner voice is wild. In fact, her delivery can be so chaotic, with its constant distractions and random capitalisations, that at first I struggled to settle into her point of view. But gradually I warmed to her, and her restless, needling observations. She gives us moments of true jeopardy – hiding from Nazis, running from murder – and stretches of poignant ordinariness. In the end, Adelheid’s joy in this ordinariness adds up to a great paean to the humanity that the Nazis wanted to destroy: “The World vastly varied and luminous and brilliant. Everything separate and known and entirely beautifully brilliantly itself.”At times, Jolly becomes too invested in her own research, so the narration occasionally jumps around, leaving Adelheid’s point of view to cross centuries and continents in order to explore Asperger’s legacy and how his actions are seen by others. That makes the book a little baggy. But in the end, Jolly manages to mould all her fragments together into a distinctive narrative, which brings both the darkness of nazism and the courage of those who tried to resist it very close to the reader.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

When the quips revolve around interior design, you know Norwegian big-budget film-making is taking a softer path than its raucous American inspirations.This is aNetflixsequel to Norwegian horror comedy Troll with the original director Roar Uthaug returning, and home is clearly a theme dear to the franchise’s heart. The first film’s Scandi-kaiju was returning to its roots, on a mission to trash Oslo. But the new “megatroll” – looking like Danny McBride in the throes of a full-body fungal infection – is headed for Trondheim, bent on revenging itself on the nation’s founding father and chief troll-scourge, King Olaf. Trollogist Nora (Ine Marie Wilmann) and ministerial adviser Andreas (Kim Falck) return, again trying to hold the authorities back from simply lighting up the enraged behemoth after it escapes from a government black site.With much talk of the country’s Christian forefathers imposing uniformity by wiping out the trolls, Uthaug may be implying some rottenness in the state of present-dayNorway. The cast is pointedly diverse too, with Sara Khorami joining as a scientist. But if Troll 2 is some kind of allegory for immigration or multiculturalism, then it wears it lightly. Widescreen mayhem is the main preoccupation here, the highlight being when the marauder peels open the top of a nightclub and helps himself to apres-ski amuse-bouches.The problem though, is that Troll 2 wears everything lightly. It flits between elements of Spielbergian wonderment, Indiana Jones-esque treasure hunt, and Arrival-style communication with alien entities, without majoring in any of them. The characterisation is token (Nora expeditiously switches from troll-whisperer to firing on them with holy water-filled grenades), and the quip embellishment is weak. Norse mythology is an atypical starting point for monster movies, but deploying it as rotely as this, the film has little chance of standing out from the mockbuster wallpaper.Troll 2 is available on Netflix on 1 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsAction and adventure filmsNorwayNetflixEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Adapter Theresa Heskins and her co-director, Vicki Dela Amedume, present theirs as an all-ages gig-theatre show. We’re even introduced to each member of a house band nestled among the audience before meeting the main characters.Rhiannon Skerritt plays the title role, here named Coralie, in a production that accentuates how Andersen made her the littlest of several merfolk. The romance isn’t entirely extinguished but the power of siblinghood rises to the surface instead in this telling, which also stresses the suspicion and division between the inhabitants of land and water.Early on, this makes for some upstairs-downstairs comedy as the mermaids tell tales about the world above. But Heskins muddies the waters by showing them to be gleefully cruel and she makes the pearl-diving prince, Caspian (Darcy Braimoh), as guilty of exploitation as the Sea Witch (Harrison Sweeney). A related message about trade feels awkwardly forced, however, as does the show’s ending. It’s also surprising to see the damage to our oceans go unexplored for a young audience.View image in fullscreenIn a spin … Rhiannon Skerritt as Coralie.Photograph: Andrew BillingtonThat was the focus of an eco-fablelast Christmas at Bristol Old Vicwhich conjured the mermaids’ aquatic life through the aerial skills of Holly Downey, a circus director and performer. Downey joins the ensemble here and assists circus choreography by Amedume that befits performers with little wiggle room inside their tailed costumes. Sweeney’s suppleness conveys the witch’s slippery nature in a routine with ropes suggesting how Coralie is ensnared by their deal. The aerial silks blend well with Daniella Beattie’s shimmering projections and performers also use whirlpool-like spiral apparatuses mid-air. Designer Laura Willstead’s stage floor functions as seabed and sand, a maze-like structure is used for the water’s rippling surface (cue golden lighting from Beattie) while Willstead provides glowing rod puppets, too, for iridescent sea creatures.One challenge for adapters is a heroine whom Andersen depicts as reticent then robs of speech. Heskins tweaks the deal with the witch so that it’s Coralie’s “siren song” that is lost rather than her voice. The witch is voiced in darkness by Inês Sampaio (also doubling as a narrator who fades out of view for too long) while the aerial Sweeney remains silent, eerily emphasising the witch’s longing to steal Coralie’s song.When she arrives on land, Coralie is given a mock-Shakespearean parlance while Caspian uses extravagantly slangy dialogue – both are jokes that get old very quickly. But Skerritt appealingly handles the physical comedy and ensures a message of goodwill without coming across as goody-goody.Costume designer Lis Evans gives the band costumes that are funkier than the nevertheless lively and soulful compositions of Arun Ghosh (the lyrics are occasionally drowned out). And when band member Alexander Bean becomes a deus ex machina Poseidon, he does so with a voice as deep as the bottom of the ocean. This is a bubbly production with dark undercurrents but it’s the designs that dazzle.AtNew Vic theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreChristmas showsHans Christian AndersenCircusDanceFairytalesChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

With interlocking scenes between two actors at a time, they rotate every few minutes. It’s a useful device for packing variety into a single story, like tossing a big salad of ideas. Though neatly performed by its young cast, this new, modern-day mix by the writer of the incomparableIphigenia in Splottstruggles to add up to more than the sum of its parts.La Ronde caused controversy, deemed immoral and too sexual for the stage. Ring Ring takes a far softer approach. Owen seeks to illuminate the modern anxieties that keep us awake at night: the things we fear to share, to pass on, to tackle by ourselves. We have nervous couples, anxious about whether to become parents. People working dead-end jobs who hope a shag will help them forget their existential dread. Individually, the scenes are quick and full of yearning, a beautiful bluntness to Owen’s dialogue. Collectively, we miss a sense of accumulation or forward momentum.Originally commissioned by theRoyal Welsh College of Music and Drama, and directed by David Bond, the school’s former director of performance, this is the show’s first professional outing. With a hard-working cast of five, it has difficulty shedding its roots as a student show and getting beyond an exercise for the actors to cut their teeth on. This isn’t helped by the self-conscious moments of movement during the scene transitions or the shelves on Alberto Aquilina’s corrugated set, intended as physical reminders of these encounters, that in reality become awkward prop trays for the cast.Petty Men review – understudies plot their own version of Julius CaesarRead moreTiger Tingley does the most to unearth the tenderness of the script, first as a harried worker aggressively flirted with on the street, and later as an exhausted parent desperately wanting to reconnect with his partner. Leisa Gwenllian and Iwan Bond also adapt with ease, leaping between charm and anxiety. There is some fine storytelling inShed theatre’s production, but it serves its audience in glimpses and fragments, rather than as a whole.AtWhite Bear theatre, London, until 6 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreGary OwenreviewsShareReuse this content"

The group was founded in 1975, and this pairing of perhaps the two greatest violin concertos in the repertory is being released to mark the ACO’s 50th birthday. The soloist and conductor in both works isRichard Tognetti, who has been the orchestra’s leader and artistic director for the past 35 years.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Both recordings are taken from concerts given in Sydney’s City Recital Hall, theBeethovenconcerto in 2018, the Brahms last February. The close recorded sound very faithfully reproduces the intensely involving approach of the ACO when heard in the flesh, with its amalgam of modern playing techniques with the use of historical instruments (gut strings, period wind). For both concertos the orchestra’s permanent core of 20 players was more than doubled with guest instrumentalists from other Australian orchestras, but the suppleness and coherence of its textures are as persuasive as ever.View image in fullscreenYet Tognetti’s approach may not persuade everyone. In the Beethoven especially, he favours urgency over lyricism, though that does not prevent his 27-minute account of the first movement of the Beethoven being one of the most expansive on record. In part that’s because of the choice of cadenzas, which Tognetti describes as “a synthesis” of those composed for the concerto by Vieuxtemps (which bring back the timpani with which the concerto opens), Auer and Kreisler among others.For theBrahms, Tognetti incorporates elements of Busoni’s cadenzas in what is in general a more mainstream account of the work than his Beethoven. It is characterised by outstanding woodwind solos woven around the solo line, while textures always remain light and transparent. Even if these performances do not rival the finest of the myriad other versions on disc, they are thoroughly convincing, and a wonderful souvenir of one of one of the most remarkable partnerships in music today.Listen on Apple Musicor on SpotifyExplore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was also reassuring to learn that in an area swept by forest fires in September, species such as strawberry trees (which are fire-resistant thanks to their low resin content) were beginning to bounce back – alongside highly flammable eucalyptus, which hinders other fire-retardant trees such as oak. Volunteers were being recruited to help with rewilding.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

The shoreline is certainly wild and dramatic but the region is also keen to highlight the appeal of its inland areas. With the development of year-round hiking and cycling trails, plus the introduction of nature festivals, attention is being drawn to these equally compelling landscapes, featuring mountains and dense woodlands. TheAlgarve Walking Season(AWS) runs a series of five walking festivals with loose themes such as “water” and “archaeology” between November and April. It’s hoped they will inspire visitors year round, boosting the local economy and helping stem the tide of younger generations leaving in search of work.View image in fullscreenStretching it out at Walk & Art Fest.Photograph: Carlos Afonso/Sarah RodriguesOur visit to the national forest coincided with a weekend festival with the theme of “art”, focused on the white-washed village north-west of Barão de São João. As well as guided hikes, departing from the cultural centre, free events ranged from learning how to make natural coloured inks, to theatre workshops, tai chi and sketching. There were two photography exhibitions running plus several other child-friendly activities, such as leaf safaris and making bird-feeders.Even before our drop-in afternoon screen-printing session at the cultural centre our walk into the forest with Joana had the feeling of an art trail. Marked at the start by standing stones painted with images of traditional agricultural folk, it was studded en route with smaller, permanently placed stones depicting examples of wildlife, including hedgehogs and lynxes – the latter’s population reviving, thanks to a rehabilitation centre based in the castle town of Silves.View image in fullscreenHikers on the Via Algarviana.Photograph: Stephen Taylor/AlamyAs the trail wound up to its highest point, themenhir(standing stone) on thePedra do Galotrail, it became more densely vegetated and a lingering hint of ash gave way to the resinous scent of pine. There was a ripeness to the air and solid, amber-hued bubbles bulged from bark. Limestone glistened underfoot and tiny frogs sat by pond edges, throats pulsing. In the distance, wind turbines cartwheeled against the sky.Francisco Simões, our guide the following day, was again keen to point out these inland areas can be explored year-round. Waymarked hikes, established in recent years, are offshoots of theVia Algarviana, a route that stretches from the border with Spain for 186 miles, all the way to the Atlantic, and many are now linked to an app that makes navigation even easier.View image in fullscreenAt the tile painting workshop.Photograph: Sarah RodriguesFrancisco established ecotourism outfitAlgarvian Rootsin 2020 and offers experiences from birdwatching to full-day guided hikes, all with the same aims as the AWS: to promote the region by way of immersion, education and cultural awareness. The art connection is here, too – his mother, ceramicist Margarida Palma Gomes, had taught us to paintazulejos, the distinctive blue and white glazed tiles seen throughout the country, two days earlier on a festival workshop. Visits to her studio, as well as to a local potter, can also be arranged through Algarvian Roots.Francisco urged us to do our bit for the industry by drinking generous quantities of good wine sealed with corkAfter an excellent lunch of pork cheek and cabbage inA Charrettein Monchique, a pretty mountain town flanked by the Algarve’s two highest peaks, the 902-metre Fóia and 774-metre Picota, Francisco led us down steeply cobbled streets and into a side lane, where an older couple sunned themselves at the front of their home. A steep path took us into the woods, the ground strewn with acorns. Here, Francisco was eager to show us cork trees, Portugal’s national tree and legally protected since the 13th century. Not only are they naturally fire-resistant, but their pliable bark is a source of income for locals, who harvest it to sell to other industries, particularly wine making and construction. Each tree is marked with a number, denoting when it was last stripped, ensuring that the tree’s nine-year regenerative cycle is observed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was perfect timing as, walking back into Monchique, strains of tinny, discordant music reached our ears, and a smell of smoke hung in the air. On arrival we were swept up by a multi-generational crowd, armed with cups of wine and thimblefuls of chestnut liqueur, as the nuts were roasted on glowing coals. Everyone swarmed around the firepits, brown paper bags in hand, and scooped their fill. Faces were wreathed with smiles and children shrieked excitedly; the music we’d winced at a few minutes earlier now had us dancing.It was a joyful, authentic celebration of local life and culture.

So says Beth Howard, expertpiemaker, cookbook author, memoirist, and now documentary film-maker.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“No matter what, pie brings us together.Pieis love,” says Howard, who never tires of talking about anything with a flaky crust and filling. She’s spent the last few months at community screenings – over 100 and counting – of her new documentary – Pieowa – that’s Pie + Iowa (her home state). The film chronicles the history of pie and how it brings people together. It’s full of church ladies, blue ribbon winners, home bakers, expert pie makers and cyclists, which is where Iowa comes in.The state has a special relationship with pie, fueled by farm culture’s tendency to create simple, hearty desserts from what’s available, small-town diner fare, and, more recently, a tradition at RAGBRAI, the annual 500-mile week-long bike ride across Iowa that draws some 30,000 participants from all over the world. Pie is the official treat at route stops – with slices served up by locals. One cycle team, comprised of National Public Radio employees and friends, is so enthusiastic they are known as team NPR: No Pie Refused.Howard’s own backstory is replete with pie.In 2001, she burned out as a web producer for a Silicon Valley startup. During her exit interview, she told her bosses she needed to do something with her hands – like make pie. She had fond memories of making pie as a youth. “They said they also wanted to make pie, but they had mortgages and car payments,” recalls Howard. She didn’t.View image in fullscreenPieowa is the combination of Pie and Iowa, film-maker Beth Howard’s home state.Photograph: Beth HowardShe wound up in Malibu at Mary’s Kitchen, a gourmet deli she heard had great pie. That’s where Howard implored co-owner Mary Spellman to employ her as a pie maker. When Spellman asked for her qualifications, Howard blurted out “I’m from Iowa.” She was hired on the spot. For the record, just because you’re from Iowa doesn’t make you an expert baker; Spellman ended up teaching Howard how to make pie.“She was so sweet and patient with me. She taught me how to make it the way she made it, and that was with her hands, no food processors. The amazing thing is that’s exactly what I was craving,” says Howard.So began Howard’s obsession with all things pie. She launched the blogthe World Needs More Piewhile also making pies for celebs like Barbra Streisand (lemon meringue), Dick Van Dyke (strawberry rhubarb), and Steven Spielberg (coconut cream). She left Malibu after she met and married her husband Marcus, whose job required them to relocate often.By 2009, though, Marcus had relocated to Germany and Howard stayed behind, working on a memoir about her time as pie maker to the stars. Their love persisted, but Howard didn’t see a future in a relationship that required constant uprooting. She asked for a divorce. That summer, hours before Marcus was to meet with their divorce mediator, he collapsed and died of a ruptured aorta. Howard was flattened.Pie – and an old friend – rescued her.Janice Molinari, an LA producer/director, admired Howard’s pie blog and wanted to help. She suggested they load up an RV and hit the road looking for stories about pie.“We found lots of pie stories and ate a lot of pie, but that trip was really about helping Beth though her grief,” says Molinari. Later, the two tried to get Hollywood interested in telling heartwarming stories about pie makers but had no luck. “We kept hearing ‘do a pie making competition’. They said we needed drama. But I didn’t want to do that,” says Howard.Instead, Howard finished the book she’d started before Marcus’s death – it ended up becomingMaking Piece: A Memoir of Love, Loss and Pie. She was also invited to judge pies at the Iowa State Fair, which she calls the granddaddy of pie competitions.After judging, she road tripped to her childhood hometown of Ottumwa to savor a slice of nostalgia at the diner her father used to take her to before the family moved. Howard pit-stopped at the American Gothic House, a small tourist attraction in Eldon (population 783). The white clapboard abode with the Gothic window that served as the backdrop for painter Grant Wood’s American Gothic – to her surprise – had a for rent sign. Howard became the new tenant and set up the Pitchfork Pie Stand.Local farmer Doug Seyb was a regular who stood in line to buy her pies. After four years, Howard shuttered the pie stand and took off on a three-month world pie tour. Seyb dog sat her Jack Russell terrier at his farm near Donnellson. Once Howard returned, she planned to move back to LA. But one thing led to another.Today, she’s a farmer’s partner and splits her time between Seyb’s place in Donnellson, Iowa and LA, but she’s mostly on the farm. She calls it Camp Doug(h) and sometimes holds piemaking classes there. I visited Camp Doug(h) a few years back with a group of college roommates and my sons. We had a blast creating our imperfect pies, which is exactly what Howard wants. “Pie is not about perfection,” she says.“Even I can make pie,” agrees Seyb, a pie class graduate who encouraged Howard to rekindle her desire to tell pie stories on the screen. He became the first investor in Pieowa and received a producer credit, plus an “executive producer” ballcap from Howard (he saves it for dress up, like when they go out to taco Tuesday dinner at the local bar). Seyb notes, too, that while making and sharing pies is generally convivial, he disagrees there’s no drama.For example, opinions on crust can quickly get heated.“You’ll see it in the film,” says Seyb. “There are pie makers who swear by all butter and then others say you gotta use lard only and then some say half butter and half lard. Somebody uses cold water and somebody else uses vodka in their crust.” Don’t even get him started about whether you need to refrigerate the crust overnight.Howard scoffs at the overthinking.“Just use a light touch with your dough. Don’t overwork it. Leave chunks of butter visible. That’s it,” she recommends.Howard says she once dreamed of a streaming service picking up Pieowa, but she’s reconsidered. After being invited to film festivals, local theatres, churches (which she says have amazing AV systems), performing arts centers, historical societies and even retirement communities, she understands at an even deeper level what the film – and pie – is about.“Most often, the community gathers and shares pie afterward,” says Howard. “The beauty of this film is that it’s an equalizer. It’s about finding something we can all agree on.”Pieowa is now screening in Iowa and across the US, find out more info at https://theworldneedsmorepie.com/pieowa/Beth Howard’s Apple Pie RecipeBasic Pie CrustMakes a 9” deep-dish double crust pie2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour (plus approximately 1/2 cup more for rolling)1/2 cup butter, chilled1/2 cup vegetable shortening or lard1/2 tsp saltIce water (fill one cup but use only enough to moisten dough)In a deep bowl, work the butter and shortening into the flour with your hands until you see marble-sized lumps form. Think mixed nuts, like peanut and almonds. Add ice water a little at a time, sort of “fluffing” the flour. Keep your movements light, as if you are tossing dressing into a salad with your hands. When the dough feels moistened enough, do a “squeeze test” and when it holds together you’re done. Do not overwork the dough! You are not kneading it like bread. It takes very little time and you’ll be tempted to keep touching it, but don’t! Now divide the dough in two, form and flatten each half into a disk shape and roll flat and thin to fit your pie dish. (Roll thin to where you can almost see through it.) To keep the dough from sticking, sprinkle flour under and on top of your dough, and keep rolling surface and pin free from gunk. Trim excess dough to about 1 inch from the dish edge with a scissors.Apple Filling3lbs Granny Smith apples, peeled (approx. 7 or 8 apples depending on size)*It’s also okay to use a variety of apples. Try Braeburn, Jonathan and Gala. Avoid Fuji or Delicious as they’re too juicy and not tart enough.3/4 cup sugar (or more, depending on your taste or tartness of apples)4 tablespoons flour (to thicken the filling)1/2 teaspoon salt (you’ll sprinkle this on so don’t worry about precise amount)1 to 2 teaspoons cinnamon (or however much you like)1 tablespoon butter (put dollop on top before covering with top crust)1 beaten egg (you won’t use all of it, just enough to brush on pie before baking)The pie is assembled in two layers. Layer one: Slice half of the apples directly into the pie, pressing down gently to remove extra space between slices. Fill dish enough so you don’t see through the first layer to the bottom crust. Sprinkle on half of your other ingredients (salt, cinnamon, sugar, flour)'; then, slice the remaining apples and sprinkle second half of ingredients. Add a dollop of butter on top and cover with top crust. Trim, seal and crimp edges by pinching with fingers or press with a fork, then brush with beaten egg. (The egg gives the pie a nice golden brown shine; be careful not to let egg pool in crevices.) Use a knife to poke vent holes in the top (get creative here with a pattern), then bake at 425 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes, just until crust browns. Turn oven down to 375 degrees and bake for another 30 to 40 minutes until juice bubbles. Keep an eye on it as it bakes. If it gets too brown, turn down the temperature. To be sure it’s done, poke with a knife to make sure apples have softened. Do not over bake or apples will turn mushy.Explore more on these topicsFoodWest CoastDessertPieThanksgivingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Your usual night in with your partner becomes a party for six. Dinner with the family becomes an enormous pre-Christmas do, with thirsty adults and kids in the wayeverywhere. And watering the masses can get expensive, not to mention cumbersome.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

I’ve written beforeabout the joys of bag-in-box, but to give you the top line: it’s at least two bottles in a fridge-friendly box, and it stays good for up to six weeks. But if you prefer the allure of a glass bottle, and the idea of all attention in the room being drawn to what’s in your hand as you enter it, then a magnum might be a fun thing to unsheathe during the festivities, after the first cocktails have been sipped and glasses are empty.At one and a half litres, a magnum is simply twice the size of a regular 750ml bottle, but the closure (ie, the entrance to the bottle) is the same size as a regular one, which means that less oxygen gets into the wine. Many wine lovers say this works wonders on the liquid inside. I asked Sandia Chang, co-founder of the two Michelin-starredKitchen Tablein London, about serving from a magnum – does she believe the wines are better? “The ratio of wine to oxygen is much less in a magnum, so any ageing that the wine has under cork is slower and more gentle.”What’s the science behind this? Well, because it has the same size of closure as a regular bottle, the wine-to-ullage (that is, the air under the cork) ratio is significantly less. Air is key to the development and aging of a wine, which is why we decant bottles and serve them in expensive glasses with wide bowls to help usreallytaste it. And the less air there is in the bottle to interact with the wine, the slower its evolution and development.That’s not to say all magnums are created with the intention of ageing; there are plenty of fresh, fruity wines and simple sparklings bottled in magnum that are designed to be drunk right this minute. A magnum of Provençal rosé, for instance, is most likely about the spectacle, rather than the promise of an old wine.As the owner of grower champagne specialistBubbleshop, I assume Chang’s favourite wine to serve by the magnum is champagne, but I’m wrong: “My favourite is actually riesling,” she tells me. “Traditional riesling bottles are taller and more narrow, meaning a magnum can be strikingly tall. It feels more playful and it’s just fun!”Four magnums to get you in the moodLa Gioiosa Prosecco Rosé DOC£22 Majestic, 10.5%.
