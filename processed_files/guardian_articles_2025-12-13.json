I rarely give anything else. I strongly approve of the Icelandic tradition of theJólabókaflóðið(Yule book flood), whereby books are given (and, crucially, read) on Christmas Eve. Nan Shepherd’sThe Living Mountainis the one I’ve given more often than any other; so much so that I keep a stack of four or five to hand, ready to give at Christmas or any other time of the year. It’s a slender masterpiece – a meditation on Shepherd’s lifelong relationship with the Cairngorm mountains, which was written in the 1940s but not published until 1977. It’s “about the Cairngorms” in the sense that Mrs Dalloway is “about London”; which is to say, it is both intensely engaged with its specific setting, and gyring outwards to vaster questions of knowledge, existence and – a word Shepherd uses sparingly but tellingly – love.View image in fullscreenElif ShafakMost years, I like to give novels as holiday gifts, but this year I am thinking of sharing either Marcus Aurelius’sMeditationsor one of Byung-Chul Han’s books, particularlyThe Burnout SocietyorThe Spirit of Hope. The South Korean-German philosopher describes himself as an “optimistic refugee”, and his style is quite distinctive, blending various disciplines and philosophical traditions from east and west. These short but dense books may not exactly be cheerful, Christmassy reads, but they make excellent companions for anyone interested in “thinking about thinking” in a digital world of noise and distraction; for anyone concerned about the future of humanity.View image in fullscreenColm TóibínThere is a book I buy as a present that never goes out of fashion. It isThe Good Soldierby Ford Madox Ford. It is hardly about a soldier at all, but the title is good because it distracts people and thus the extraordinary plot creeps up and bites you before you know where you are. The narrative curls and twists; the narrator knows too much or too little. But at some point the appalling and ingenious nature of the treachery – what is called “cheating” nowadays – becomes apparent and you feel that you have been let in on some intriguing and explosive secret. It is perfect, thus, for Christmas.Jeanette WintersonTo the young people in my life I give Italo Calvino’sInvisible Cities. It’s a series of perfect micro-fictions that both stand alone and build towards a deepening message on the nature of reality. It’s also an optimistic text that locates power in the individual. We can change things – if we know where to put our energy.To my contemporaries, I give out whatever I think will do them good! Books are more than entertainment. We shouldn’t be shy about wanting to provoke or challenge our friends – or ourselves. This year it’s Robert Macfarlane’sIs a River Alive?View image in fullscreenFlorence KnappI’ve given copies of Claire Keegan’sFosterto so many friends, I worry about unwittingly doubling up. At just 88 pages, it makes a slender gift, but one that won’t sit onerously on a bedside table and whose concision hints at its specialness. Set over one Irish summer, the story is told through a child’s eyes, as she is sent to live with relatives during the final weeks of her mother’s pregnancy. Coming from a household of neglect into one of warmth, the girl’s observations about people reveal both a guilelessness and devastating insight.Nussaibah YounisView image in fullscreenMother Mary Comes to Meby Arundhati Roy is a gorgeous, brave and nuanced account of the novelist’s life – anchored in an astonishingly truthful exploration of her relationship with her mother, Mary. She describes her as “my shelter and my storm”, and in the book’s pages we meet Mary the celebrated feminist campaigner and Mary the volatile, threatening mother. Without ever flattening or reducing this formidable and complicated woman, Roy parses the ways her own life has developed – both as a rejection and as homage to her mother. The work is also unapologetically political, and after the horrors in Gaza, I appreciate an author who can speak to the world we are in. The book is beautifully bound and makes for a lovely gift, and I haven’t stopped buying it for people since the day it was published.Frank Cottrell-BoyceWhen The Wind in the Willows first came out, the reviews were mixed. “As a contribution to natural history,” said one, “it is negligible.” AA Milne set out to proclaim its genius. He used to give copies to people “as a test of character”. I feel the same about Terry Pratchett’sTruckers. It’s the story of a group of Nomes who have come to believe that the department store in which they live is the entire universe (its slogan is “everything under one roof”). A satire on consumerism, sexism, dogmatism and … you name it, it is above all warm, hilarious and wise.View image in fullscreenMichael RosenSarah Crossan’sWhere the Heart Should Beis a gripping and moving free verse novel set in the time of the famine in Ireland. It brings you face to face with the tragedy and solidarity of those times. So-called YA, but a great read for anyone.Katherine RundellI have two books I keep stocks of to give as gifts. One, for book-hungry older children, isThe Count of Monte Cristoby Alexandre Dumas: it’s dauntingly huge, yes, but also one of the most perfect adventure stories ever written, and I have found that the children it does catch hold of become dizzy with the pleasure of it. The other, to lure in children who have not yet become eager readers, is Sharna Jackson’s superbly wittyHigh RiseMysteryseries; I’ve not yet met a child who doesn’t adore it.Max PorterThe book I have most often given, for over 20 years now, is Alice Oswald’sDart, her miraculous translation of a river into polyphonic poetry. Ecologically and philosophically it is profoundly (and increasingly!) radical, and line by line it is a pure enlivening delight to read. I give it to people who never read poetry, as well as poetry experts. I give it to visitors, friends, newlyweds, students, grievers, swimmers; and I hope they pass it on to others, because nobody owns a river.View image in fullscreenKamila ShamsieSince 2010, all five stories shortlisted for theBBCNational short storyawardhave been published in book form by the wonderful Comma Press. It’s always a stellar shortlist, varied in all ways other than quality. As gifts go, the anthology is perfect: first-rate fiction, the stories as compact as the physical book itself (you can carry it in the deep pocket of a winter coat). And, best of all, next Christmas you can give it to the discerning reader all over again.Derek OwusuView image in fullscreenAs I’ve got older, it’s become harder for me to engage with books on that magical level that feels as if the whole world were concentrated in the palms of your hands. So when it does happen, the impulse is to share it.Kingfisherby Rozie Kelly is a gentle and compassionate novel that explores the nuances of queer love and friendship, the moral dilemmas of sharing someone else’s life through life writing, and the choices we make for our chosen family and those bound to us by blood. I’ve given it to many people so far, but the most significant was to the Casual Readers book club, where, uncommonly, there was unanimous love for the book.Ali SmithOver the years the books I’ve tended to give most?Wise Childrenby Angela Carter andWhen Will There Be Good Newsby Kate Atkinson. Carter’s final novel is infused with such a high-kicking joyousness that it’s a pleasure to hand it to anyone. Atkinson is always good news, and this work of humane detective fiction is so satisfying that I can give it to folk who don’t know her work, trusting they’ll love it. But this past year the book I’ve found myself giving to most people isMichael Kohlhaas, a slim novella from 1810 by Heinrich von Kleist, translated by Michael Hofmann. Why is the world in such conflagration again? Kleist’s tale about the consequences of injustice will never not be relevant and is so thrilling that once I started reading it I couldn’t stop for anything. Stunning.Diana EvansI’m a lover of short stories and one of my favourite collections is Sarah Hall’sSudden Traveller. The stories are simply stunning in their emotional and imaginative leap; her use of language is beautiful and glittering. As far as gifts are concerned, this is one you could give to someone who likes a quick yet wholly transporting read.Catherine Newman“Amos, a mouse, lived by the ocean.” Everybody in my family – maybe in my life – knows the opening line of the picture bookAmos& BorisbyWilliam Steig. It’s the story of an unlikely friendship between a shipwrecked rodent and a kind-hearted whale, and it’s a combination of plainspoken and magical and deeply, even existentially, philosophical. There’s nobody in my life I wouldn’t give this book to – especially children and friends, and children who are friends – except there’s nobody I can give it to, since I have already given it to everybody.View image in fullscreenJoe DunthorneI can tell which books I really love because I never have copies on my bookshelf. These are the ones I repeatedly give away, so that my shelves have become a repository for all the books that are not my actual favourites. Sam Lipsyte’sThe Askis a novel I have bought on many occasions. For anyone who needs reminding how straight-up fun reading can be, it’s a great reviver: funny, sharp, alive – and with a wonderfully dark undertow. I haven’t kept hold of a copy in years.View image in fullscreenTessa HadleyI giveRumer Godden’s novelsto people –Kingfishers Catch Fire,perhaps, orThe River– because a lot of readers don’t know her work.She’s such a warm and entrancing storyteller, but with a steely eye too, and ruthless truthfulness. She’s the best kind of comfort read.Nina StibbeI love to giveRestorationby Rose Tremain at Christmas. I’ve never known anyone able to resist protagonist Robert Merivel – a young medical student who lands in the court of Charles II, rises quickly in the king’s favour, then suffers a catastrophic fall from grace. Honest, mischievous, spiritual and self-indulgent, Merivel is above all lovable. Tremain’s depiction of 17th-century life – contrasting the opulence of court with the brutality of the time – is gloriously bawdy one moment, and stop-in-your-tracks profound the next. And as an added bonus, the book’s cover, over the years, has always been Christmassy. Note: the sequel,Merivel: A Man of His Time,is just as wonderful – if not more so.View image in fullscreenSarah MossI often give Tove Jansson’sThe Summer Book. Best known for the Moomins, Jansson was also a mistress of the short story, and The Summer Book shows both the gift for parable that underlies the best children’s picture books and the literary economy of short fiction. The central characters are a little girl and her grandmother, and the story turns around the missing mother without ever mentioning her. There’s lots of beautifully observed play and adventure and attention to the natural world. It’s set on a small Finnish island in midsummer, among people who know very well how to appreciate sunlight, so good midwinter reading.View image in fullscreenEsther FreudAt Christmas I often give the gift of Tove Jansson’sA Winter Book– a collection of short stories selected by Ali Smith, and an exquisite companion to The Summer Book. These stories reflect Jansson’s core passions: small boats, islands, and the vital need for art and inspiration. They’re about land and sea, youth and age; my favourite is a description of two elderly women locking up their home for the last time – a house on a remote rock in the Pellinge archipelago I was lucky enough to visit – leaving the key and some purposefully muddled instructions for anyone who may be passing by.Megan NolanThe book I’ve given most often – by a large margin – is a collection of poetry calledFearof Descriptionby my friend Daniel Poppick. I bought it before I’d ever met Dan, and it had been a long time since I’d got anything out of poetry. I was relieved and amazed to find myself laughing aloud, and then winded with emotion by the final line. I’ve given it since to friends, lovers, at least one parent – partly because it’s a pleasure to share work by someone I’m proud to be friends with and partly because it’s a low-stakes burden gift-wise, something you can dip in and out of with ease and pleasure.View image in fullscreenNikesh ShuklaThe newUltimate Spider-Manseries deserves everyone’s attention. Written by the legend that is Jonathan Hickman, alongside artist Marco Checchetto, it’s the Spidey reboot we’ve all been waiting for. There have been many reinventions of everyone’s favourite webslinger, but nothing meets the moment like this does, and with Hickman’s incredible attention to character, it’s the best Spidey’s been in years.View image in fullscreenSaba SamsI am not sure if it’s wrong to suggest you give the same book to all the vegans in your life, as if suggesting that all vegans are the same, but I do think Olga Tokarczuk’sDrive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Deadfits this bill. I love to imagine people I know reading it, even people who eat meat, who would probably like it too. It’s kooky and fun and strange; it’s important without being depressing. I think a lot about the scene at the annual Mushroom Picker’s Ball, which Janina, the main character, attends dressed up as a wolf. Actually, this book is rather festive.Andrew Michael HurleyI was given a copy of JL Carr’s novellaA Month in the Countrymany years ago by a work colleague and it’s a book I’ve gifted ever since, so that others can have the joy of reading it for the first time too. It’s a profound, funny, elegiac meditation on lost youth and unrequited love, so sharply observed and economically written that it can be devoured in one sitting. For me, that makes it the perfect present: immediately pleasurable and something that stays with you for life.Jonathan CoeI occasionally giveThe Echoing GrovebyRosamond Lehmann, in the (so far unfulfilled) hope that one day somebody else will agree with me that for narrative complexity and jagged emotional impact there is almost nothing that comes close to it.Nicola DinanRecently, I’ve been givingFree Food for MillionairesbyMin Jin Lee. Published a decade beforePachinko, it follows a Korean community in 00s Manhattan. I’m currently crawling through Middlemarch, and the influence of Eliot’s writing on Lee’s work, and Free Food for Millionaires in particular, is clear. If you’re looking for a sprawling contemporary novel with intersecting and heartfelt narratives, this is for you.William BoydI am a great reader and buyer of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, but many of my cultured and sophisticated friends think modern poetry is “difficult” or “obscure”, not to say “incomprehensible”, and consequently don’t read it. So, deciding to proselytise, I give the recalcitrant friend a copy of Philip Larkin’sThe Whitsun Weddings, with certain key poems marked. Namely, the title poem, Broadcast, MCMXIV, Sunny Prestatyn, Afternoons, and An Arundel Tomb. More often than not, they’re hooked. Larkin, at his best and most inimitable, speaks to – and for – everyone.View image in fullscreenYomi AdegokeThe last book I gave someone was a birthday present that went down so well, I intend to fill a stocking or two with it at Christmas. It was Elizabeth Day’sOne of Us, a dark comedy that slickly satirises the lives of a British establishment family. It’s brimming with sharp commentary on class in modern Britain and paints an intimate portrait of the super-privileged’s messy family dynamics. But most importantly, it’s a lot of fun.Philippe SandsOn the theory that a gift should raise spirits, I opt forThe Man Who Planted Treesby Jean Giono – a naturalist’s quest to improve a strip of land. First published in 1953, it’s a reminder in these torrid times of what really matters in life, and how to make a difference. It can be read in an hour, and few books offer more joy or warmth for your buck.Curtis SittenfeldErin O White’s debut novel,Like Family, was published in the US last month, and I’ve already given it to two friends and my two sisters. I’m still planning to give it to my neighbour, my oldest friend and my sister-in-law. It’s about three intertwined families in upstate New York, and it’s smart and warm and queer (as in mostly about lesbians) and middle-aged and funny. Admittedly, I’m friends with the author in real life, but writer friendship obligates you to buy just one book; this for me is a case of true literary love. And the beauty of Like Family is that reading it will make you feel like you’re friends with the author, too.To browse all books mentioned in this article, visitguardianbookshop.com.

Truffles may come in endless variations, but at their core, they are simply chocolate and cream, which makes the quality of both non-negotiable.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A good dark chocolate, about 60-70% cocoa, brings complexity and depth without bitterness, while the right cream-to-chocolate ratio creates a ganache that’s smooth, rich and just soft enough to dissolve in the mouth. Any further additions such as salt, liqueur, citrus, coffee or spices should never be dominant. And, whatever the finish, be it cocoa powder, toasted nuts, coconut or a glossy shell, it should complement rather than compete with the chocolate ganache inside.The best supermarket chocolate trufflesBestoverall/best bargain:M&S Swiss truffle assortmentView image in fullscreen£12.50 for 665g at Ocado (£1.88/100g)★★★★☆A slightly thick shell, but decent chocolate and a good selection of milk, hazelnut, blond and dark.

I’m surprised because to me he’s a sleepy son of a bitch.”Exulting in Biden’s drowsiness, the US president and his supporters seemed blissfully ignorant of a rich irony: that 79-year-old Trump himself has recently been spotted apparently dozing off at various meetings.The unlikely simpatico between the two men did not end there. Tuesday’s event marked the launch of a Trump roadshow designed to reassure voters that the US economy is in safe hands despite the evidence of their pockets. In that there was an uncomfortable echo of Biden’s travels to champion “Bidenomics”, which did not end well for him.At every turn, Trump seeks to distance himself from his Democratic rival, accusing him of driving up inflation and illegal immigration and botching the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan. Yet now the Republican is finding himselfshouldering the same burdensof an affordability crisis and the inexorable march of time.“It’s hard not to see the parallels both in terms of their age and how that manifests itself and certainly the condition of the economy,” saidKurt Bardella, a political analyst and NewsNation contributor. “Trump has been cast in this role that Joe Biden had to play out and seemingly trying to use the same script, which is to convince people that you’re not feeling what you’re really feeling. It’s an unenviable political challenge.”Biden and Trump are the two oldest presidents in US history. The Democrat was dogged by concerns over his mental and physical fitness during his four years in office, reaching a climax after a disastrous debate performance that led him to decide against seeking re-election. Biden’s aides were condemned fortrying to shield his frailtyfrom the public and media.That has been useful political fodder for Trump, seeking to contrast Biden’s decline with his own political virility. He has created a “presidential walk of fame” at the White House where Biden is represented bythe image of an autopen. He said of Biden recently: “He sleeps all the time – during the day, during the night, on the beach. I’m not a sleeper.”Yet Trump is now facing health issues of his own. In July the White House announced that he had amedical checkupafter noticing “mild swelling” in his lower legs and was found to have a condition common in older adults that causes blood to pool in his veins.Photos also showed bruising on the back of Trump’s hand, covered by makeup that was not an exact match to his skin tone. This week he has been sporting bandages on his right hand. On Thursday White House press secretary Karoline Leavittsaid they were the resultof the president “constantly shaking hands”.MeanwhileTrump admittedthat he had “no idea” what part of his body had been the subject of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in October. The White House subsequently said he had MRI imaging on his heart and abdomen in October as part of a preventative screening for men his age and the result was “perfectly normal”.Perhaps most striking, on more than one occasion lately Trump has appeared to be fighting sleep. In the Oval Office and at a cabinet meeting his eyelids could be seen drooping, even as cabinet secretaries showered him with praise.Critics say that Trump’s rambling, repetitive speeches and social media posts are further evidence of cognitive decline since they often shoot from topic to topic with bizarre non sequiturs. However, like the gaffe-prone Biden before him, it is not always clear what can be attributed to age and what to his essential character.Reed Galen, president of the Union, a pro-democracy coalition, said: “He’s older, he’s worse, but I don’t know that should surprise any of us at this point. Whereas Biden got older and got quieter, Trump gets older and gets louder – when he’s awake.”As Trump’s second term wears on, the scrutiny is only likely to intensify. ANew York Times analysisof his schedule found that he has fewer public events and is traveling domestically far less than he did by this point during his first year in office, in 2017, although he is going on more overseas trips.The president responded on social mediathat he was history’s hardest-working president with a lengthy list of accomplishments. He said he went out of his way to do “long, thorough and very boring” medical examinations, including three cognitive tests that he “ACED”.He added: “The New York Times, and some others, like to pretend that I am ‘slowing up,’ and maybe not as sharp as I once was, or am in poor physical health, knowing that it is not true.”The health of US presidents has long been a delicate and sometimes thorny issue between the White House and the press. Bardella, a former Republican congressional staffer who switched to the Democrats, said: “Donald Trump and Republicans are going to be held to the same standard that they set for Biden.“You don’t get to challenge the media constantly and accuse the media of covering up Biden’s health and mental deterioration, and then turn around with someone who is certainly manifesting signs of old age and be bewildered that the same media that you ginned up and lectured and chastised and sued is now doing the same thing to you.”Both presidents began their terms like men in a hurry. Biden, inheriting the Covid pandemic, sought to turn a crisis into an opportunity with a blitz of executive orders and the $1.9tnAmerican Rescue Plan, following up with ambitious legislation on infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing and the most substantial climate and clean energy investment in history.But from mid-2021 inflation surged, reaching a 40-year high for reasons including pandemic supply-chain disruption, stimulus-driven demand, global energy volatility and the war in Ukraine. Although the administration eventually brought inflation back down to around 3%, it struggled to sell a message in the court of public opinion.In a2023 address in Chicago, Biden insisted: “Bidenomics is working … Today, the US has had the highest economic growth rate, leading the world economies since the pandemic.” But by August 2023 just 36% of Americans approved of his handling of the economy, according to a poll by the Associated Press-Norc Center for Public Affairs Research. In 2024 fact checkers found Biden guilty ofmaking false claimsabout inflation.Now the shoe is on the other foot. The cost of living was a top voter concern in the 2024 presidential election and again in last month’s races for governor of New Jersey and Virginia and mayor of New York, whereDemocratsswept the board.Government data shows that job growth has slowed during Trump’s second term, unemployment has risen to its highest level in four years and consumer prices remain high, due in part to his sweeping tariffs. He is accused of not paying sufficient attention to voters who say they are struggling to make ends meet.His 90-minute speech on Tuesday veered into attacks on the word “affordability”, which Trump derided as a “hoax” by Democrats to exaggerate the cost of living. While he did acknowledge that prices were high, he insisted the economy was booming and people were taking home more pay.Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat,posted on social mediathat Trump spent his speech “telling Pennsylvanians not to believe what they can see with their own two eyes – the skyrocketing cost of living and rising prices at the grocery store”. It was precisely the kind of charge that Republicans used to level against Biden.Bardella commented: “Just as manyRepublicans– rightfully so in my opinion – mocked Biden and his team and Democrats for the Bidenomics vocabulary, for the ‘I know you feel like the economy is tough but whatever … ,’ here Trump is also facing a very sceptical electorate that doesn’t feel like the economy is working for them.“It’s incredibly ironic that, for the better part of this decade, we’re looking at two presidents pushing 80 trying to convince the American people that they have a better pulse on their economic situation than than they do.”Trump’s approval rating edged up to 41% in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll as he reversed some tariffs on food imports and spoke more about combating inflation. But the approval rating on his performance on the cost of living was just 31%. His chief of staffSusie Wiles has saidshe wants him to “campaign like it’s 2024 again” to help turn out his supporters for congressional midterm elections in November.Some observers suspect that he will walk into the same messaging trap that Biden did.Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “One of the oddest political dynamics we’re seeing today is that Donald Trump appears to be repeating Joe Biden’s mistake and underestimating the potency of inflation and the difficulty in affording the basics in life.“This idea that Donald Trump can give a few speeches and this is going to make a dent in what polls show to be the number one issue in the minds of Americans is foolish. The political consequences for Donald Trump are going to be similar to what they were forJoe Biden, which is potentially quite significant losses in midterm elections and a crippling of the Republican party, perhaps in 2028.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJoe BidenUS politicsRepublicansDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

The half-hourtrain journey to Cobh(“cove”), through Cork’s island-studded harbour, was especially lovely. As the railway crossed Lough Mahon, home to thousands of seabirds, there was water on both sides of the train. I watched oystercatchers, egrets, godwits and common terns, which nest on floating pontoons. Curlews foraged in the mudflats, and an old Martello tower stood on a wooded promontory.Spanning one of the world’s largest natural harbours, Cork’s bridge-linked archipelago includes 20-sq-mile Great Island at the seaward end. Here you’ll find Cobh, with its colourful terrace houses, prom-side palm trees and smell of toasting soda bread. The town was theTitanic’s last port of call before its doomed voyage. Today’s Cork is a sustainable-transport trailblazer:cycle greenwaysrun through huge reedbeds across Ballyvergan marsh and eight new railway stations are coming soon.Phoebe TaplinAffordableskiing inBulgariaView image in fullscreenBorovets was Bulgaria’s first ski resort.Photograph: Roy Conchie/Alamy“I don’t smile, I’m Bulgarian,” Yuri my ski instructor told me, “but I can make you a better skier.” By day three I had earned a “not too bad”, and my grin stretched from ear to ear.There’s plenty to smile about in Borovets, droll instructors aside: the price for a start. A half-term ski break here is far kinder on the wallet than heading to the Alps. Borovets, in the Rila mountains, was Bulgaria’s first ski resort and has 58km of well-maintained slopes bordered by forests. To keep our energy up, we ate hot flakybanitsa(stuffed pastries), sausages cooked over an open fire, and hearty bean stews.My teenage sons and I stayed at the no-frills Soviet-styleSamokov Hotel, where I loved using the 25m pool after a day on the slopes, and they loved pushing the limits of the hearty buffet evening meals.Ailsa SheldonA lakes escapein SwitzerlandView image in fullscreenLake Neuchâtel.Photograph: Imagebroker/AlamyFor a landlocked country, Switzerland is surprisingly obsessed with messing about in boats. Paddle steamers and scenic ferries are common currency on lakes Constance, Léman and Lucerne, but sailing across the unfathomably blue surfaces of lakes Biel, Neuchâtel and Murten (in theThree Lakes region,about 90 minutes by train from Geneva) this summer was a first for me. The temperatures, with the sun splitting the waters, felt Mediterranean. The late evening swims and paddleboarding did the trick too.I hopped between Neuchâtel and Le Landeron on Lake Biel, slipping through time-warp villages on the slopes of the Jura mountains. I swam in the Zihl Canal with only kingfishers and herons for company. I drank too many glasses of chasselas white wine in Ligerz, where a wonderfully pretty church sits amid the grapevines. I discovered forgotten St Peter’s Island, home to a 12th-centurymonastery hoteland where Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau once turned his back on the world. As I explored, I thought I’d like to do the same.Mike MacEacheranWatching a‘skydance’overLancashire’s wetlands, UKView image in fullscreenMartin Mere Nature Reserve.Photograph: Media World Images/AlamyMartin Mereon the west Lancashire plain, once the largest lake in England, was drained by arable-avaricious lords. Mercifully, they didn’t empty it completely and the wetlands, managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, is now a precious habitat for waders and reed-loving birds. In autumn, more than 45,000 pink-footed geese roost here.Like many who grew up in the north-west, I bypassed Martin Mere every summer, bound for Southport. Leisure time meant beach, fairs and shopping. Perhaps the area’s industrial heritage encouraged the notion that land was for turning into houses, roads and workplaces. It’s only since returning to live in the county five years ago that I have re-educated myself about its natural assets.Earlier this year, I was lucky enough to see ring ouzels, peregrines, a merlin and, greatest prize of all, hen harriers – famed for their “skydancing” and victimisation by grouse rearers – in theForest of Bowland national landscape.Season by season, Lancashire becomes something other than a place framed by the past. Growing up, I wondered at all the contrails; I’ll grow old gazing at the kinder, quieter patterns of nature’s aviators.Chris MossA country house in the middle of MilanView image in fullscreenVilla Necchi Campiglio.Photograph: Stefanos Kyriazis/AlamySummers in Milan are, inevitably, very often hot, humid affairs. Like many Italian cities, its residents are likely to head for the sea and countryside as the temperatures rise. However, the Necchi Campiglios, a wealthy family who made their fortune manufacturing sewing machines, chose to build their perfect country house in the middle of the city.Designed in the 1930s by Piero Portaluppi,Villa Necchi Campigliostill stands like a mirage in Italy’s second largest city, set in lush gardens with a swimming pool – a perfect little oasis to escape the heat yet on a very ordinary street. There’s much to admire inside, with chic furniture and fittings, wood panelling and marble floors, and an impressive art collection. It’s hard to imagine a nicer place to cool off as the heat of the city intensifies than the veranda overlooking the garden.Max BenatoWalking in Kosovo’s mountainsView image in fullscreenThe Accursed Mountains.Photograph: Gryf/AlamyHistory books provide crucial context for hiking in Kosovo, but don’t prepare you for the beauty of the mountains. Ispent a weekon the recently remappedVia Dinarica Kosovoin the summer. We hiked past edelweiss flowers on the border ridge with Montenegro; craggy and sheer on one side and vibrant green on the other, sloping down to pink and yellow wildflower meadows.Choughs flew around high rocky outcrops, while brightly coloured bee-eaters perched on branches lower down. Wildlife lost to much of Europe still thrives here (bears, wolves, lynx) in a mosaic of oak and beech trees, blueberries and shrubs, deep valleys and high plateaux. Mountain lakes make for dreamy swim spots beneath the high peaks near Albania.We stayed in secluded huts with mountain backdrops, wherebörek(savoury pastries) were devoured in the evenings and washed down withrakia– a homemade fruity spirit varying wildly in quality and strength.Stuart KennyA peaceful villagein ProvenceView image in fullscreenSouth Park Lodges in Cotignac.Wiggling across France in a car groaning with kids and camping gear has become a summer tradition. This year, on our way to the Gorges du Verdon, we detoured via Cotignac and landed upon the very specialSouth Park Lodges. Owners Stan and Wendy Kluba have spent five years restoring three wild hectares just outside the village, which are now home to two bell tents on hillside terraces among the pines (sleeps four, from £160 a night).Everything has been so thoughtfully put together: a handbuilt kitchen under the shade of a canvas sail, an outdoor shower soundtracked by cicadas. Days were slow: walking to buy pastries atLou Gourmandises, long lunches atLe Bistrot de Lou Calen, climbing the steep steps to explore old cave houses in the limestone cliffs above the village. But mostly the kids loved the pool and the Shetland ponies (Scotchy and Whisky), and I fell for the deep sense of peace.Fiona KerrGoing off the beaten track inAlbaniaView image in fullscreenA swimming spot in Albania.Photograph: Holly TuppenThe first stop on afamily hiking holiday in Albaniathis summer made a lasting impression and proved that stepping off the beaten track often brings the greatest rewards. We spent two nights inBujtina Lëpushë, a guesthouse surrounded by orchards, beehives and small farms that peter out towards the Accursed Mountains – a towering amphitheatre. Arriving at dusk, the kids (10 and 12) played with kittens on our cabin’s porch while we chatted to the owner about life in Lëpushë. Migration abroad or to cities is a problem (the local school has only one pupil), and tourism is a lifeline for anyone left behind.Luckily, Lëpushë has a lot going for it. On the first day, we jumped off rocks into a brilliant-blue swimming spot and gorged on homemade cheese and bread at a shepherd’sstan(summer encampment). On the second, we hiked to the top of Maja e Nagvacit (2,412m) on near-deserted trails, scoffing wild blueberries along the way. Despite all this, Lëpushë receives a fraction of the visitors that nearby Theth and Vusanje welcome, because it isn’t on the popularPeaks of the Balkans hiking route.Holly TuppenAluckydiscovery onSpain’s Costa TropicalView image in fullscreenCalahonda in Andalucía.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenA long smile of a beach braced with blocky hotels at the edge of a snowdrift of white plastic-covered greenhouses – we had no expectations of Calahonda, in Andalucía. We stopped in this former fishing village near Motril, not to be confused with the much bigger Sitio de Calahonda further west, for no other reason than it seemed the least built-up place to break a journey along Spain’s Costa Tropical.Finding a room at theHotel Embarcadero, we photographed the shoal of tiny boats bobbing beneath the town’s headland, swam in leagues of deep, Kool-Aid-blue water, ate fatboquerones(fried anchovies) at a simplechiringuito(beach bar), and watched elderly Spanish couples stroll languidly to dinners that were just starting as we went to bed. Back on the road the next morning, our swimsuits drying on the back seat, we agreed that sometimes the best travel plan is to have none.Rhiannon BattenUntouched islands in FinlandView image in fullscreenLake Saimaa.Photograph: ShinyHappy74/Getty ImagesThe most spectacular sunset I’ve seen this year? Whizzing back across the iridescent waters of Finland’s Lake Saimaa on a chilly afternoon in late September, as the liquefying sun and white feathers of wispy cloud interrupted vivid blue skies.We’d gone out from our base, the Järvisydän resort, to see the most endangered seal in the world – just 530 ringed seals are estimated to live in the lake. They were shy on the afternoon we were out, their basking rocks empty, but it couldn’t have mattered less; we stopped at one island to pick chanterelle mushrooms and blueberries, and at another to follow a hiking path up to a viewpoint that looked out over dozens of untouched islets, thick with pine forest and fringed with silver-grey rocks. In winter, when the lake freezes, there are 38 miles of ice-skating trails. I can’t wait to go back.Annabelle ThorpeA night in Italy’s smallest townView image in fullscreenAtrani on the Amalfi Coast.Photograph: Veronika Pfeiffer/AlamyWe took each bend carefully as we descended Monte Aureo. On the final turn, Atrani appeared through a tunnel in the rock, its bridge lit up against an October night sky and its houses cascading down the cliffs towards the Tyrrhenian Sea. Roberto, our driver, said we were entering the smallest town in Italy – and the most beautiful.The entrance to our hotel lay hidden beneath the bridge, a narrow opening leading to a maze of whitewashed steps twisting between old walls. We awoke to the sound of bells from Santa Maria Maddalena and stepped on to the balcony, where tiled roofs tapered up the cliffside and, below, the sea moved softly against the beach. A cock crowed and a single car crossed the bridge.After breakfast, we took another tunnel, this one longer. On the far side was Amalfi, its port lively and bright, as if we had slipped through a portal and returned to another age entirely.Vic O’SullivanTasty fish in Tynemouth, UKView image in fullscreenSeafood from Riley’s Fish Shack.A handful of surfers rode the waves of the North Sea beneath a brilliant blue sky. But instead of swimsuits we were wrapped in wool jackets on this brisk January day.Three generations of my family had come to the one-of-a-kindRiley’s Fish Shackset beneath Tynemouth’s green cliffs and the ruins of apriory and castle. We were lured by the shipping container’s chimney – a lighthouse-like beacon of smoke. Brave diners sat on the patio and on deck chairs in the sand, bundled up in blankets. We had reserved a wooden table in the cosy interior, warmed by the wood-fired grill.I had expected fish and chips. Instead, we devoured enormous fish empanadas loaded with salsa verde; squid ragu topped with parsley mayo; roast turbot chop bathed in ancho-chilli butter, with caperberry and cucumber salad; and irresistible fresh sourdough – all sustainably served in wooden boxes with disposable wooden cutlery.I dream of returning despite living about 1,000 miles away in Marseille. Thankfully, my cousin lives in nearby Newcastle, so I have an excuse to return.Alexis SteinmanAn unsung Northern Irish cityView image in fullscreenNewry town hall straddles a river.Photograph: Stephen Barnes/AlamyMy latest book,Sh*tty Breaks, champions unfashionable cities and makes the case that anywhere can be enjoyable if given half the chance. The Northern Irish city of Newry is known for its shopping, being in the thick of the Troubles and former goalkeeper Pat Jennings. It’s not known for the quality of itsmuseum, the friendliness of its people, or the staggering beauty of its countryside – but it should be.Thetown hall straddles a riverand is a sight for sore eyes; a bakery calledThe Cake Grannysits alongside a number of excellent cafes –Measured,Finegan & Son,Nine Squared. TheBridge Barwill see you through to midnight. TheCanal Court hotelis a decent accommodation option in the centre, whileBalance Treehouseis a rural alternative with a stargazing hammock and a hot tub.Ben AitkenThe perfect Parisian bistroView image in fullscreenBistro des LivresI’m perpetually on the hunt for the best bistro in Paris and, on a spring trip this year, I think I found it. Following a cobbled backstreet en route to the inimitableShakespeare and Companybookshop, I came upon the blue awning of a cosy restaurant namedBistro des Livres. It resembled a sunlit wine cellar, with pale stone walls, black marble-topped tables and books everywhere: patterned, leatherbound books with yellow pages piled in the window.The menu featuredvin à la ficelle– wine “by the string”, measured and charged by what you drink – along with a concise and no-nonsense list of five mains, plus a tomahawk steak, aubrac rib and veal chop for the carnivorous. Grilled bone marrow was sizzling on arrival, rock salt sparkling on its surface like diamond dust. My confit de canard was a crisp leg which fell apart into dark gleaming chunks, steam piping off the bone. But it was the chocolate pudding that brought me back for my second and third visits. Arriving at my side – lugging a casserole dish of whipped dark mousse – the waiter ladled a mountain in to my bowl; rich, smooth, and enough for four diners. When the bill came, the waiter gave my well-consumed Côtes du Rhône a cursory glance and barely charged me €10 for drinks. The meal itself came to €35. Oddly, it was quiet, so I still like to think I’ve stumbled upon a spot of magic on the Left Bank.Monisha RajeshA memorable meal off MullView image in fullscreenThe Boathouse restaurant on Ulva off Mull.Photograph: Matt Limb/AlamyTo summon the ferry for Ulva – a small, community-owned island off Mull – you flick the wooden board above the slipway from white to red and Rhuri, the boatman, will chug across the narrow strait to fetch you. Unless it’s a Saturday, his day off. It was a sunny Sunday in summer when I headed over for lunch at theBoathouse, the waterfront restaurant everyone was talking about after its takeover by Banjo Beale ofDesigning the Hebrides, his husband and cheesemaker Ro, and farmer, baker and charcuterie-maker Sam this year.I was early, so followed one of the island’s impossibly pretty walking trails, skirting round the coast, through ancient woodland, past a cluster of old stone barns and the Thomas Telford-designed church, before circling back for a pile of langoustines, apple-sour salad and warm brioche at a picnic table beside the sea, dogs splashing in the shallows, children skimming stones, families chatting on the rocks – wonderfully old-school and unspoilt.Lucy GillmoreTreasurehuntingin Prague’sflea marketA waiter, recalling his grandmother’s dumplings and her kitchen’s “terrible” decor, alerted me to the existence of theu Elektryflea market. “She had the kind of stuff everyone throws out at u Elektry; nobody wants reminders of being poor under communism,” he said with a shrug.It’s located in Prague 9, and getting there requires a lengthy-ish tram ride. The market is open 6am-2pm every Saturday and Sunday, and when I arrived mid-morning, people were already leaving, laden with items I was certain I wanted. A fee of 30 koruna (about £1) is payable at the entrance, where there are also food stalls and – because you never know – an ATM.Hundreds of vendors had their wares – ceramics, linens, brass and mirrors, signed and framed oil paintings, nude photographs, you name it – set out over a seemingly interminable area. I had to squat, sift and search, but my heart and hands were full by the end – and low prices and cheerfully haggling locals meant my wallet wasn’t much depleted, either.Sarah RodriguesDramatic scenery and saunason the Fife coastal path, ScotlandView image in fullscreenOne of the saunas on the Fife coastal path.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyIt’s always good to meet an old friend, even better when unexpected. There I was, strolling through the Scottish coastal village of Lower Largo, when I spottedRobinson Crusoe. I hadn’t thought about him for a while, but there he was, or at least his real-life inspiration,Alexander Selkirk. A statue of the man stands on the site of the cottage where he was born in 1676.The joy of theFife coastal pathis like that. Unexpected pleasures abound amid picturesque villages, dramatic scenery and beaches. The 117-mile route starts in Kincardine with a few miles of post-industrial landscape that soon gives way to a more bucolic coast. Villages such as Anstruther, Crail and St Monans hold plenty of historical interest, fine old harbours, plus a few great food outlets (try theBowhouseand theCocoa Tree). TheElie chain walkat Kincraig Point is a particularly good section if you enjoy scrambling.North of Cellardyke, watch forTide Line, an art installation byJulie Brook. Apart from Crusoe, however, the real discovery was thesaunasthat are being installed along Fife’s many beaches.Kevin RushbyAn art trail in a picture-perfecttown in Puglia, ItalyView image in fullscreenMonopolio in Puglia.Photograph: AGF/AlamyIt’s less than half an hour by train along the Adriatic coast from Bari to Monopoli, a historic town with a pretty harbour, winding alleys, a 16th-century castle and an impressive cathedral. While nearbyPolignano a Mare– Insta-famous for its dramatic cliffs – felt busy, Monopoli had a laid-back vibe and a string of uncrowded beaches where local families were picnicking.It’s worth a visit any time of year, but mine coincided with thePhEST international festival of photography and art, which uses the town and its buildings as a backdrop. Every year it runs for four months, from August to November, with a packed programme of photography, screenings, music, guided tours and talks.We followed an artwork trail around town, some outdoors, some inside churches and the castle. We loved theMartin Parrworks – some seen by looking through telescopes out to sea – and Gregg Segal’s thought-provokingimageshighlighting over-consumption, with people photographed lying in the rubbish they generated in a single week.Jane DunfordFinally finding paradise–in PembrokeshireView image in fullscreenThe cathedral in Saint Davids.Photograph: Sonja Ooms/Getty Images/iStockphotoGrowing up, we always went south for holidays – to Dorset, or Brittany, or as far as my dad could put up with driving three children in summer without aircon. Wales never even made the shortlist. When I finally discoveredPembrokeshirein June this year, and saw how incredibly beautiful it was, I felt irrationally cross that its charms had been kept from me for so long. “Oh yes,” my parents said airily when I complained, “St Davids is lovely, isn’t it? Great cathedral.”Not only was the cathedral indeed stunning, with an excellent, dog-friendly cafe to boot, but the countryside around it was even better, and the coastline … well, the coastline took my breath away, literally, when I tried to run it one morning after overindulging in fish, chips and gelato. Rocky cliffs, green water, wide sandy beaches and little whitewashed pubs where the locals have their own tables – why had no one told me paradise lies at the end of the A40?Felicity CloakeCroatia without the crowdsView image in fullscreenThe Greeting to the Sun installation.Photograph: Imago/AlamyWith Dubrovnik hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons this year, I was wary of contributing to overtourism. But the lure of the Med on a budget took me on a four-day break with my four-year-old to Zadar.What I discovered was a Croatia without the crowds, a pretty walled city and lots of kid-friendly (and free) things to do. Without spending a bean, we explored the Old Town – wandering along the city walls, enjoying theSea Organ– an experimental musical instrument on the front that plays notes as the waves move in and out of its underwater pipes – and dancing at sunset on theGreeting to the Suninstallation, a 22-metre wide circle of solar panels that harness energy during the daytime, then, when night falls, create an environmentally friendly light show that keeps kids of all ages entertained.For just a few euros, we took a ferry over to Ugljan Island, where we swam in the sea at Preko and climbed to the summit of the fort, parts of which date back to the sixth century, for views over to Italy. Then, before we left, we ventured toVrana Lake nature parkto kayak amid some of the 260 species of birds that call the place home. A perfect break for a family.Phoebe SmithSeafood under the pines, FranceView image in fullscreenCooking éclade de moules.Photograph: Isabel ChoatThe village ofMornac-sur-Seudrein the Charente-Maritime is famous for the oysters that are cultivated in the surrounding marshes, but the dish that caught our attention waséclade de moules– mussels cooked under pine needles. We ordered ours atLe Parc des Graves, where we sat on a terrace overlooking the water. Theécladeis prepared on the road outside – at a safe distance from diners. First, the mussels are arranged on a wooden platter in concentric circles, then they are covered in dry pine needles which are set on fire. The result is an ashy platter of shells that looks more like a sculpture than something edible. But the mussels are surprisingly tasty – smoky and sweet. Virtually every table was tucking into them during our visit – including small children, their faces streaked with ash. We ordered oysters too, and plates of crevettes and langoustines – but theécladestole the show. Once we’d had our fill, we wandered up Rue du Port, past pretty blue-and-white houses, to Saint-Pierre church, known for its giant shell font, a reminder that on this coastline, shellfish are treated with near religious reverence.Isabel ChoatInnocent fun on a Swedish islandView image in fullscreenA fishing hut on South Koster island.Photograph: Mauro Toccaceli/AlamyAs the ferry docked at South Koster, an island off Sweden’s south-west coast about 100 miles north of Gothenburg, it seemed I’d arrived inside a Famous Five novel. Life for the next few days was all carefree cycling down quiet lanes (cars are prohibited), splashing about in the clearest seas (where cold-water coral thrives), kayaking between the smooth granite skerries ofKosterhavet national park, and hauling up on empty beaches to picnic on (lashings of) coffee and hunks of banana bread.The only thing missing was a Blyton-esque mystery to solve – though something was flummoxing me: where were all the people? Coastal Sweden has a curious tourism season. For five weeks in July and early August the place is heaving. Outside of that? Bliss. It was early September: the sky was blue, the berries bright, the water brisk but deliciously swimmable. With the summer crowds gone, it was like discovering my very own Treasure Island.Sarah BaxterStep back in time in a boutique hotel inLatviaView image in fullscreenKukšu Manor hotelI discovered a beautiful 10-bedroom boutique hotel while travelling in the tranquil, lushly green region of Kurzeme in Latvia. Restored by German chef and hotelier Daniel Jahn,Kukšu Manorhas spectacular interiors and a wonderful lakeside location – cranes fly overhead, storks perch on chimney-top nests, nightingales warble. But it isn’t on any booking sites so it remains something of a secret.Every door, wall and architrave is delicately painted with 18th-century frescoes, stencils and murals. Every piece of cornicing is intricately carved. Beneath lavishly painted ceilings (my favourite was ultramarine blue scattered with golden flowers), each room is an extravagant curation of antique finery. But there’s nothing formal here: Jahn and his two labradors greet visitors like old friends.This is a place where you can step back in time and imagine yourself as aBaltic baron. And the breakfasts are to die for: garden berries, homemade jams, marinated vegetables, forest mushrooms, local fish and meat, freshly baked bread and pancakes. All for the price of a very average British B&B.Annabel AbbsWales’s answer to Land’s EndView image in fullscreenAndy Pietrasik on the Llŷn peninsula in WalesThe long slender finger of the Llŷn peninsula had been beckoning me for years, but I only made it to this area of outstanding natural beauty in north Wales this year. It was love at first sight.It probably helped that my initial encounter was with the head-turningTŷ Coch Inn, set in a stunning little cove near Nefyn. But over the course of a few days’ walking and camping along theWales Coast Path, there were so many other beguiling moments: the sweeping curve of Whistling Sands beach; the pod of seals lolling in a secluded bay that mimicked the outline of Wales; the kestrel hovering above a promontory; the musical lilt of people speaking Welsh.But perhaps the standout moment was arriving, after a long day’s ramble, in the picturesque fishing village of Aberdaron at the tip of the peninsula, and settling in for a couple of pints in the sunshine outside theShip Hotel. This was followed by crab cakes, chips and mushy peas at the Sblash fish bar around the corner. Perfect.Andy PietrasikMeeting theresident cat in Norwich CathedralView image in fullscreenBudge the cathedral cat.Photograph: Bill SmithI am fond of cats. I am keen on churches. Better yet are churches with resident cats. How delightful then, on a recent visit to Norwich Cathedral, to encounter Budge. He was seated on a pew, eyes as green as The New English Hymnal, a small creature in that great ancient space.I hadn’t meant to visit, but found myself with an hour to spare. Long enough to stroll from the bright copper font to first world war heroineEdith Cavell’s grave. Time, too, for a circuit of the cloister, sun slanting through the tracery and making the flagstones gleam.Budge, though, was the highlight, and I learned his story. As a young cat, he roamed the pubs, but has long since left that roguish life behind. “He’s found God,” I was told. “He’s found a place he feels at home.” His day begins with morning prayer and ends with evensong. He makes a wonderful place even more wonderful. He let me stroke his back then padded off up the nave.Peter RossExplore more on these topicsTravelEurope holidaysCity breaksSkiing holidaysWalking holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Through it all, the hot tip for Sports Personality of the Year has kept a cool headSat 13 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareAt the end of last year, Chloe Kelly was seriously considering stepping away from football. She was deeply unhappy at Manchester City, her team since 2020, where it seemed as if they wouldn’t let her play, nor let her leave. She wasn’t getting enough time on the pitch, so wasn’t sure that she would be selected for England, who were preparing to defend the title she had helped win in2022 in the Euros tournament. She was 26, about to turn 27. She had been a professional footballer since she was 18, but her mother was starting to get concerned. She desperately wanted her daughter to be happy again. “I remember my mum coming up to see me and she was meant to go home, but she didn’t go home, because she was so worried,” recalls Kelly.Less than a year later, and things are very different. At the time of writing, Kelly is favourite to win Sports Personality of the Year after a history-making comeback. At the end of January, she was loaned to Arsenal and inMay shelifted the Champions League trophy with the team, very much the underdogs in the final against Barcelona, whom they defeated 1-0. At the end of July, she scoredthatpenalty for England, securing them a second Euros title, against arch-rivals Spain. She was fifth in the Ballon D’or Féminin, and named in theFifpro World 11 squad for the first time– a peer-voted list of the best footballers in the world. Against the odds, then, 2025 has turned out to be a great year. “For sure,” Kelly smiles. “To bounce back, that’s what makes it the best year of my career.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenKelly with the 2025 Champions League trophy (top), and with her fellow Arsenal players (front right, above), who beat Barcelona 1-0 in the final. Photographs: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ Shutterstock; Soccrates Images/GettyTrying to pin down Kelly is not the easiest of tasks. The football calendar is notoriously overstuffed, to the point of controversy. We finally speak the day afterArsenal beat Real Madrid in the Women’s Champions League, a much-needed victory in a turbulent season for the team so far. It is only midmorning, but she and her husband, Scott Moore, drove up to Manchester from London first thing, so that Kelly could see a chiropractor. The appointment was at 7.30am. “I’ve had a little niggle in my back,” she explains. The next women’s World Cup is not until 2027, so there’s plenty of time, but, is it anything we need to be worried about? “No, no, no!” she says, quickly. “I just had a little spasm in the Bayern Munich game. I’m fine. Nothing that stops me.”We speak on video call; she’s casual in a hoodie, with a massive rock on her ring finger and Moore sitting next to her. She keeps him off-camera, but regularly turns to check with him that she’s right about things like dates, or the ages of her siblings. They’re waiting to go to a spa for the afternoon. “Not so many days off in football, so we make the most of when we do get them,” she shrugs. It’s their dog Brody’s first birthday at the weekend. (She has two dogs, whom she refers to as “the boys”.) They’re throwing a little party for Brody and his brother, who belongs to her mum. And after the party she’ll be reporting for international duty at St George’s Park, the final England camp of the year before friendlies against China and Ghana. The bounce back continues.(It may have hit a temporary bump in the road. A couple of weeks later, Kelly was injured during the first half of the Ghana match. Arsenal manager Renée Slegers gave an update at a press conference in early December, calling it “an injury, a little ligament in the back of her knee”. It looks as if Kelly will be sidelined until Christmas. “We’ll see,” Slegers has said.)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Titlow/The Guardian. Dress: Burberry. Boots: Kalda. Earrings and rings: YSSOFew footballers are as cool and composed on the pitch as this striker, no matter how high-pressure the situation. She is regularly described by commentators as a combination offire and ice. In 2022, in the Euros final, she scored the winning goal for England against Germany – her ecstatic top-off celebration earned her a yellow card – but to do it again required next-level calm. In 2025, the England-Spain final had come down to penalties. It was up to Kelly to bring it home for a second time. She took her trademark run-up and thumped it past the Spanish keeper, then jogged back to her teammates as if there had never been any question that England would do it all over again.Her family feel the pressure far more than she does, she says. “Scott definitely gets nervous. When I asked him, did you think I was going to score a penalty against Spain, he said yes. Whereas my brothers were … quite nervous.” Did they say no? “They didn’t sayno. They just said it was nerve-racking!”View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly and Jill Scott celebrate England winning the 2022 Euros.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/ReutersKelly is so preternaturally collected and confident that sports psychologists must be fascinated by her. “I work closely with psychologists, to make sure my game is at the top,” she nods. “It doesn’t just happen overnight. I think throughout my career … maybe I’m too confident at times? But I really back myself. I like to play on the edge quite a lot.”It wasn’t always that way. She was 19 when she got her first senior England cap. “I went on to the pitch and my legs were just like jelly,” she recalls. It wasn’t until she tore her anterior cruciate ligament in 2021 that her mindset began to shift. “Before my ACL, I was definitely more of a nervous player. Having the injury allowed me to think, what am I nervous for? I’ve gone through the worst situation and I’ve had to do my rehab for that. So what is fazing me?”The injury was no surprise in a way; research suggests thatfemale footballers are two to eight times more likely to tear the ACL; this WSL season alone, seven players, including Kelly’s fellow Lioness Michelle Agyemang and Arsenal teammate Katie Reid, have suffered an ACL injury. Players have spoken out about a congested calendar, including the England captain,Leah Williamson, who has called the schedule “unsustainable”. Is it being taken seriously enough? What can be done? “For me, there’s not enough research because, actually, we haven’t been professionals for long enough,” says Kelly. She lists potential issues: who knows what kind of boot design is better for women’s feet, or what sort of pitch is right for women? “But what I will say is, the negativity around ACLs make it harder to go through, than actually what it is.”Write your own script, control your destiny: I stick by that, because I wasn’t in a position to do so for so longView image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Titlow/The Guardian.

Earrings: Completedworks.What does she mean? “If a player does their ACL and the first thing you see is negativity around it, it automatically puts you in a negative mindset,” she says. “I don’t know. Maybe it’s just the way I think.” From a sprain to a break, any injury can be tough, but the ACL has become a particular kind of bogeyman. The first thing she told Reid was: “It’s gonna be tough and it’s gonna be horrible, but it’s not as bad as sometimes it is [portrayed as being]. You know you’re missing a long period of time, but any injury you’re going to miss that.” There needs to be far more research into why women appear to be more susceptible, Kelly insists. “The calendar is crazy. You want the best players on the pitch, but maybe there’s too many games in the calendar, in both women and men’s football, for our bodies to deal with the loading.”For Kelly, the hardest moment in her professional life was not her ACL injury. “It was not being able to control what was happening in my career.” She is talking about the events that finally came to a head in January. “It was a dark time,” she says. She had been at Manchester City since 2020, but her relationship with the club had soured. She spent most of her time on the bench, starting only once in the first nine matches of the season. In November 2024, England manager Sarina Wiegman describedKelly’s lack of minutes as “a concern” and “a hard situation”. “Chloe knows that she is not in the best position with her club at the moment,” Wiegman said.Just before the transfer deadline,Kelly posted a statement to her Instagram, stating that her future was not with the club, and asking to be released from her contract, adding that, “to be dictated whom I can and can’t join with only four months left of the football season is having a huge impact on not only my career but my mental wellbeing”.City allowed her to leave and join Arsenal on loan for the rest of the season.(She signed for them permanently in July.) But the drama continued. Just over a day later, she posted another note, accusing the club of“briefing journalists against me,” calling reporters “to assassinate my character”and planting negative stories in the football press. Looking back on the situation in August, City’s then boss Gareth Taylor told the BBC that he had“always tried to remain as professional as possible” and had “stayed true to his role”as manager.“Taking charge of your own destiny is massive,” Kelly says, today. “After we won the Champions League, I said, write your own script, control your destiny, and I stick by that. Because I wasn’t in a position to do so for so long, but speaking out for what you believe in is huge.” She is proud to have come back from those dark days. “But also, on reflection, I wish I spoke earlier.” So no regrets, other than that you wish you’d done it sooner? “No, definitely no regrets,” she says, firmly.Goalkeeper Mary Earps was Kelly’s teammate for years, and they won England’s first Euros trophy together. Inher autobiography, Earps went public about her feelings towards Hannah Hampton, who replaced her as England’s No 1. She wrote about how she felt that Hampton’s“behaviour behind the scenes at the Euros had frequently risked derailing training sessions and team resources”, and accused Wiegman of rewarding it.View image in fullscreenKelly celebrates scoring England’s winning penalty with goalkeeper Mary Earps in the Women’s Finalissima against Brazil at Wembley Stadium, 2023.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA WireThe story was massive, sending shock waves through the world of women’s football. Other players shared their views on it. Lucy Bronze argued that female players are“constantly under a magnifying glass”. Former Lioness Ellen White spoke of an“unwritten oath”, that what happens in the dressing room, stays in the team.So has Kelly read the book? “I haven’t,” she says, though she is clearly prepared for it to come up, and looks as unruffled as ever. “I think, for me, I’m in a position where Hannah is my teammate, and we support our teammates. We support Mary, who was our teammate, too. Mary’s told her story. And, of course, in football, you don’t really see it too often, but I think, for me, Mary’s voiced herself.”In her own statement about Man City, Kelly said she felt it was “time to be open and transparent”. Is this a similar situation? She disagrees. “I think, for me, it was either, I speak up and I speak out on what was happening, or I take a step away from the game. Mary’s situation is obviously writing a book of her whole journey. So, probably a little different.” And, honestly, Kelly jokes, she’s really not a reader. “For me, both are my teammates, and I’m proud to stand side by side with my teammates.” That’s very tactful and balanced, I say. “But that’s me! I can’t comment on something if I haven’t read the whole book. Maybe one day I’ll listen to the audiobook. Because reading isnotmy forte.”To many, and for good reason, Kelly is a hero. Predictably, to some, her self-belief can seem like arrogance. There are corners of the internet where people post about how she comes across as cocky, or cringe. When she says that she might be “too confident”, what does she mean? Sometimes, she explains, she’ll have confidence on the pitch, and then afterwards she’ll be hard on herself, and wonder if she could have done it differently, or done it better. “Maybe that’s ‘too confident’. But I think confidence is huge. Especially as a woman, to be able to step on to a pitch or to be able to step into a room, I feel a lot of confidence within myself. I think that comes from playing with my brothers and growing up with my mum and dad. They would say, be yourself, and just don’t change who you are.”Kelly is the youngest of seven. She has one sister, Paris, who doesn’t like football. “She wishes me good luck, and she’ll say to me, ‘Oh, your hair looked lovely today’, but she couldn’t care less if I score, if I miss, if I have a great game, if I have a bad game,” she says, not unhappily. She has five brothers, three of whom are triplets, and they had a big role in making her confident, tough and unflappable. She grew up playing in the cages of the Windmill Park estate, in Southall, west London. There’s a commemorative plaque there now in her honour. “If I bring someone to my mum’s house, me and Scott are always, like, let’s drive to show them the cages,” she says. “It’s a very special place to me. Always will be.”Her brothers never treated her differently because she was a girl. “They never made it easy. Even to their friends, they’d say, ‘Don’t go easy on her, she’s playing here with us.’” Her oldest brother is 10 years older than her, but playing against his friends never fazed her. “I’d be, like, ‘I can beat you, let’s go,’” she grins. “They’d say to my brothers, she’s a bit cheeky, ain’t she?” And did you beat them? “Yeah,” she says. “I think sometimes I did. Sometimes I lost! But I learned from it.”At school, she played on boys’ teams. She would arrive for a match and know they were being judged for having a girl on the squad. “And then I’d come away with player of the tournament. And I remember seeing my mum’s face, like, so proud, saying, ‘You did it, girl.’” She knew then that football was what she wanted to do. “And, academically, I wasn’t too clever,” she laughs. “Still ain’t.” Unlike some of her teammates, who felt they needed a backup career and qualifications outside football, Kelly never had a plan B. “I actually didn’t, I won’t lie. I just always wanted to be a footballer, and that was my overconfidence.” Then she remembers that she did have another job. “I worked for one day,” she laughs. “I went to work with one of my friends, at an Olly Murs concert. We sold merchandise, and I was, like … I don’t want to do this.”She describes her parents as “hard-working people”. Her father fits big machinery, she says, then turns to Moore. “Is that a rigger?” Her mum worked at the same nursery school that Kelly attended and, later, worked with children with additional needs. Neither of them drove, which meant that getting their daughter to training sessions involved a lot of early morning buses and trains. When she was 16, Kelly got the call to train with the Arsenal first team, then known as Arsenal Ladies. She had her first professional contact by 18. The money was so bad that her father had to help her out with her living costs. “I was on a professional contract, but my dad would pay me each week so that I could get to training and I could actually live,” she says. It is a sign of how much the women’s game has grown, and how quickly. And that was less than 10 years ago? “Yeah. 2017, I’d say?” Her salary is not disclosed, but in 2023 Forbes estimated her annual club earnings to be £400,000.View image in fullscreenKelly with Hannah Hampton after winning the final of the 2025 Euros against Spain in July.Photograph: Sports Press Photo/Getty ImagesShe was playing for Everton when she met Moore, a groundsman there. I want to talk about him, I say, but is it awkward if he’s sitting next to you? “No!” she beams. “It’s fine! I always speak about Scott, whether I’m with him, or not.” At the time, Kelly was in rehab, recovering from a torn syndesmosis and subsequent ankle surgery. “I was coming out of the indoor astro [pitch], and Scott was walking behind me. I held the door open for him, and that was our first interaction.” She laughs. “When I say interaction, he said, ‘Thank you.’ And I said, ‘It’s OK.’”Moore plucked up the courage to slide into Kelly’s DMs, but the message languished in her requests. Eventually, she saw it, realised they had mutual friends, and they started to talk. Moore took her to Ikea for their first date, and she asked him to stay and help her build the furniture.“I remember sending a picture to my mum of Scott putting the drawers together,” she says. Their story sounds impossibly sweet. “We’d go and get milkshakes, or just have a drive. We used to go to just watch the planes come in at Liverpool airport. Even now, we’re inseparable.” They got married in July 2024. A week before their first wedding anniversary, Kelly was playing for England against Sweden in the Euros, in that hellish quarter-final match, though she says it was her favourite of the tournament. She worecustom-made shin pads, with her wedding photos on them.Moore works with Kelly’s management team now. “Honestly, I love it,” she says. “It’s funny, because when we text about work we don’t put any kisses. It’s just direct, blunt. Then we talk about something else, it’s just two kisses, after every text. So the balance is amazing. It allows us to spend a lot of time together, which, in football, is crazy, so you have to make the most of that.” Who does he support? “Scott’s an Evertonian, so it was nice that I played for the club,” she says. And when you’re playing for Arsenal, does that change anything? “Well, no. To be honest, at our wedding, in his speech, he said the best thing to come out of Everton was our relationship,” she laughs. “I hold a close place in my heart for Everton, especially with the happiness that it has brought me in my relationship. But I’m a QPR fan, so I don’t celebrate too much, either!”Kelly’s fellow Lioness Ella Toone tells a story about when she first realised she might be famous. “I got papped eating a pasty in Tyldesley,” she said,in a moment that went viral. What about Kelly? After the 2022 Euros, she remembers taking her nieces and nephews to Legoland, where people kept stopping her, asking for pictures. “My nieces and nephews were  like, ‘Chloe, is this gonna happen all the time?’ They were so confused.” Are they excited that you’re well-known? “They just see me as their auntie! They don’t see me as Chloe, the footballer.” But her nephew sometimes texts her if he’s playing EA Sports FC (the video game that used to be called Fifa). “He’ll get me, and he’s, like, ‘Look, Chloe, who I’ve got in my team!’ But I don’t know if they realise how huge the women’s game has got.”As the women’s game grows in popularity, so does the scrutiny. “There’s definitely misogyny when women are successful. People don’t like women being successful. People don’t like women being in an environment where maybe you don’t think we should be,” says Kelly. Fire and ice, they say, but that’s the fire, right there. “We are exactly where we should be, and we’re here to stay.”Does she think that female players are held to a higher standard? She says she’s not sure, to be honest, and that plenty of male players are on the receiving end of harsh criticism and comments. But the pressures are a little different. “I think as women players, we try to be the best, inspiring young girls, inspiring women to take a step into something that they enjoy and something that they can be great at.”But what’s different is that you don’t often get comments about male players’ appearances. “For sure. If you comment on if I’m good or bad at football, that’s fine. That’s your opinion.” She has to listen to the opinions of the staff every day. “If you’re going to comment on me as a human being, it’s a little bit different, but I am myself, and I’ll be myself wherever I go. For young girls that maybe are a little more insecure, that’s when it’s not nice.” Still, she tries to see it from another angle. “But I guess it’s a sign that we are being more successful than they wanted us to be.”Being around my family so much, I’d love to have one of my ownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Titlow/The GuardianA recentBBC investigationfound that over the course of a single weekend in the Premier League and WSL, more than 2,000 abusive messages, including death and rape threats, were sent to players and managers on social media. “You obviously see it,” says Kelly, on trolling, which she struggles to understand, adding that she doesn’t watch tennis, but that doesn’t mean she’s about to start slating tennis players. “I’m not going troll you for doing your job. It just doesn’t make sense to me. I’d love to be in a world full of full of peace and happiness. But, yeah,” she sighs, “we’re a million miles off that.”Kelly has started to notice that, as well as young girls, more boys are looking up to female players now.  “I meet so many that say, ‘Oh, you’re my idol, you’re my favourite player.’ Which is amazing, because  actually, we’ve changed something. You’re actually changing the mindsets of those young boys, and as they grow up they will then teach their kids that this is normal.”Kelly has a lot of plans outside football. She’s becoming a more regular fixture on red carpets, joining the fashion set at thepink-themed British Museum Ball in October, wearing see-through bejewelled couture at theHarper’s Bazaar Women of the Year Awards at the start of November. She’d like to move into fashion herself and wants to show more of her personality off the pitch. “And I would love to have a family. For me, being around my family so much, I’d love to have one of my own.”But she isn’t thinking too hard about that just yet, because there’s something else on her mind. “I’ll know when the time is right, and right now I have a World Cup to get to and to win. So my focus is to make sure that I’m at my best to represent England.” And how is she feeling about the World Cup? She smiles. “I don’t look too far ahead. Who knows what the journey looks like to get there?” But, equally, she can’t help herself. “I’m hungry,” she says.”Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamArsenal WomenWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The network of anonymous channels includes alarmist rhetoric, AI scripts and British narrators to attract hits.Starmer is personally targeted. The prime minister was either named in the video title or description 15,600 times.Reset Tech, the non-profit group that produced the research, said the channels were part of a global trend to produce synthetic propaganda on the platform. It pointed to the proliferation of cheap AI tools that could be deployed to make a quick profit from divisive topics.One channel called Britain News-night talked about Starmer and Reeves facing arrest. Another, TheUKPoliticalBrief, touted videos on the “explosive truth” about immigrant crime and marches on Westminster.The UK NewsCore channel focused on how Nigel Farage was ousting Starmer, and claimed the prime minister was “sacked live” and thrown out of parliament.Other videos featured bizarre, fabricated stories about a row between the royal family and the government. One channel, Gold Up!, said the dispute had left Starmer “melting down on live TV”.Some of the videos and channels were removed by YouTube’s checks. However, all 150 were taken down when the platform was approached by the Guardian. Reset Tech said some channels had created tens or hundreds of similar videos without being deplatformed.The research found similar channels operating in German, French, Spanish and Polish, targeting other politicians or political issues. In total, it mapped 420 problematic channels operating in Europe. Reset Tech said Russian-speaking creators operate some of the channels.It is believed channels aimed at the UK were being driven by opportunistic creators trying to monetise political division over issues like immigration, rather than overseas political actors. However, it said their presence still posed a risk to public trust.The content has caused concern insideLabour. “The rise of fake news online is a serious threat to our democracy,” a spokesperson said. “The public will be rightly alarmed that democratically elected leaders and institutions are being undermined by bad faith foreign state actors and those seeking to profit from misinformation.“We’ve already seen attempts from overseas to influence fair elections and manipulate public opinion both here and abroad.“The government is stepping up its efforts to work with online platforms to tackle this scourge on free and fair democracy. But it’s important that tech bosses take this threat seriously and live up to their obligations to remove this type of content wherever it’s found.”Dylan Sparks, UK director of Reset Tech, called for YouTube to take swifter action. “Malicious actors are permitted by YouTube to spread synthetic ‘news’ that disrupts political debate in the UK, while also earning revenue from it,” he said. “This AI-generated, low cost content spreads across the platform undetected, revealing clear weaknesses in YouTube’s monetisation and content moderation systems.“This specific network focuses on the prime minister and Labour government, but the same loopholes could be exploited by any hostile actor to push an agenda. Because social media platforms profit from engagement, their business model creates an in-built tension between enforcing their own policies and reducing the spread of malicious content that drives revenue.“The rapid spread of AI has also introduced new risks to the online environment, and platforms need to move faster and invest more to address them.”A YouTube spokesperson said: “Spam and deceptive practices that try to take advantage of the YouTube community are not allowed on the platform, which is why the channels flagged by the Guardian have all been removed.“We enforce our policies consistently, regardless of political viewpoint expressed, or how the content is generated. Our teams work around the clock to monitor for harmful content, taking swift action as needed.”YouTube is now working with Reset Tech over its findings. The platform said its systems prominently feature authoritative news content on the YouTube homepage, in search results, and through recommendations. It has removed more than 2.1m channels for violating its community guidelines.Ministers have already formed an online advertising taskforce to see what action can be taken to address the advertising-based monetisation of harmful and misleading content.Explore more on these topicsYouTubeArtificial intelligence (AI)LabourKeir StarmerDeepfakeShareReuse this content"

While there is absolutely no room for complacency, it shows that #TommyRobinson’s momentum can be broken.“Now let’s go all out to build a massive #Together against the far right demo on Saturday 28 March.”Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, told the crowd he used to “hate the church” but met a pastor in prison who taught him about the Bible.Hymn sheets were handed out to the crowd and a woman walked around selling St George’s flags and Santa hats.C of E responds to Tommy Robinson’s carols event with ‘Christmas is for all’ messageRead moreBefore the event, the Church of Englandreleased a video on its YouTube channelin which people ranging from the archbishop of York to schoolchildren spoke about the “joy, love and hope” of Christmas.The message is “a simple reminder thatChristmasbelongs to all of us, and everyone is welcome to celebrate”, the Church of England said.Several leaders spoke out against the dangers of Christian nationalism and the appropriation of Christian symbols to bolster the anti-migrant views of Robinson and his supporters.Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, warned of the potential “weaponisation” of events, and said the Church of England must be “absolutely clear” that the true Christian message was one of compassion and welcome to all.Adam Slonecki, the Met commander who was in charge of the policing operation, said: “Every weekend in London is busy but that is especially the case at this time of year when the transport network, shops and public spaces will see much higher footfall.“In that context, it is particularly important that we ensure that where groups are exercising their lawful right to protest, we use the powers available to us to ensure those protests don’t cause serious disruption to the many other people – Londoners and visitors alike – going about their lives.”Explore more on these topicsTommy RobinsonFar rightMetropolitan policeLondonChristmasAnglicanismChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

Those who breach the orders could be jailed for up to five years, the government said.Government’s process behind tackling violence against women ‘worse than under the Tories’Read moreIt also announced it would invest almost £2m in “crack police squads” made up of “covert online investigators” to target internet abusers.“This government has declared violence against women and girls a national emergency,” Mahmood said. “For too long, these crimes have been considered a fact of life. That’s not good enough. We will halve it in a decade.“Today we announce a range of measures to bear down on abusers, stopping them in their tracks. Rapists, sex offenders and abusers will have nowhere to hide.”The government said that the plans for the new rape and sexual offences teams would be headed by “specialist investigators” trained to understand offender behaviour.The plans are in part a response toOperation Soteria, a Home Office project commissioned under the Conservatives in 2021 in response to concerns about how reports of sexual violence were investigated and low charge rates. Early data from the project suggested half the rape investigation teams were not fully qualified.Sources have indicated training will have a particular focus on “rape mythology” and “problematic cultural issues”, which lead to some victims being dismissed or blamed. They added that some officers would be trained as sexual violence “first responders” in an attempt to ensure initial contact with victims is handled appropriately.The Guardian understands there will be no additional funding for these units, so forces will have to absorb the costs from existing budgets. The speed at which they are set up is also expected to vary between forces and will depend on the existing level of expertise in each area.However, the teams are expected to be supported by theNational Centre for VAWG and Public Protection, a £13m project unveiled this year to improve the response to this type of offending.Domestic abuse protection orders were introduced under a pilot scheme in November last year, operating initially in Greater Manchester and parts of London before being extended to north Wales and Cleveland.The orders are expected to target those who perpetrate all types of domestic abuse. The government said this would include “economic abuse, coercive and controlling behaviour, stalking and ‘honour’-based abuse”. It added there would be no maximum time limits placed on the orders.In this age of authoritarians, online abuse of women is soaring – and it’s leading to ‘real-world’ violence  | Julie PosettiRead moreHalving gender-based violence in a decade was one of Labour’s key manifesto pledges but ministers have faced criticism for delays and an apparent lack of engagement with experts in the sector.Karen Bradley, chair of the home affairs select committee, wrote to ministers this week to express concerns about how long it has taken to publish the strategy, originally expected in spring this year.She said: “The delay is creating significant uncertainty across the VAWG sector, leaving stakeholders unclear about the guiding principles that should shape their work. Repeated delays in publication sends the message that tackling VAWG is not a government priority, despite the ambition to halve VAWG within the next decade.”In her letter, Bradley added the committee understood there had been “poor engagement and transparency with VAWG stakeholders” throughout the development of the strategy.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

They seem to be doing pretty well.”“This was an Isis attack on us and Syria,” Trump added. “We will retaliate.”“The attack occurred as the soldiers were conducting a key leader engagement,” the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, Sean Parnell, said ina statement. “Their mission was in support of on-going counter-ISIS / counter-terrorism operations in the region.”The attacker “was killed by partner forces”, Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary,wroteon the social media platform X.Central Command said ina poston X that as a matter of respect for the families and in accordance with defense department policy, the identities of the service members “will be withheld until 24 hours after their next of kin have been notified”.Syria’s state media and a war monitor reported earlier on Saturday that shots were fired at Syrian and US forces on Saturday during a visit by American troops to the historic central town of Palmyra.According tothe state-run Sana news agency, two members of Syria’s security force and several US service members were wounded. The injured were taken by helicopters to the al-Tanf garrison near the border with Iraq and Jordan.Sana said the attacker was killed, without providing further details.Syria’s interior ministry spokesperson, Nour al-Din al-Baba, said a gunman linked to Islamic State opened fire at the gate of a military post. He added that Syrian authorities are looking into whether the gunman was an Islamic State member or only carried its extreme ideology. He denied a report from the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that the attacker was a security member.The US has hundreds of troops deployed in eastern Syria as part of a coalition fighting the Islamic State.Last month, Syria joined the international coalition fighting against the Islamic State as Damascus improves its relations with western countries following last year’s fall of Assad when insurgents captured his seat of power.The US had no diplomatic relations with Syria under Assad, but ties have warmed since the fall of the five-decade family rule. The interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, made a historic visit to Washington last month, where he held talks with Donald Trump.The Islamic State was defeated in Syria in 2019 but the group’s sleeper cells still carry out deadly attacks in the country. The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops, which have maintained a presence in different parts of Syria – including the al-Tanf garrison in the central province of Homs – to train other forces as part of a broad campaign against the Islamic State, have been targeted in the past. One of the deadliest attacks occurred in 2019 in the northern town of Manbij, when a blast killed two US service members and two American civilians as well as others from Syria while they were conducting a patrol.Explore more on these topicsUS militarySyriaIslamic StateMiddle East and north AfricaShareReuse this content"

All the victims are Bangladeshi nationals, serving in the UN interim security force for Abyei (Unisfa).“Attacks targetingUnited Nationspeacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law,” said Guterres, who called for those responsible for the “unjustifiable” attack to be held accountable.The Sudanese military blamed the attack on the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a notorious paramilitary group that has been at war with the army for control of the country for more than two years. There was no immediate comment from the RSF.The attack “clearly reveals the subversive approach of the rebel militia and those behind it”, the military said. It posted a video on social media showing plumes of dense black smoke over what it said was the UN facility.UK imposes sanctions on four RSF officers for ‘heinous’ mass killings in SudanRead moreThe oil-rich Abyei is a disputed region between Sudan andSouth Sudan, and the UN mission has been deployed there since 2011, when South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan.Guterres also called for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan to allow “a comprehensive, inclusive and Sudanese-owned political process” to settle the conflict in the north-east African country.Sudan was plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country. The conflict has killed more than 40,000 people – a figure rights groups consider a significant undercount.The fighting has recently centred on Kordofan, particularly since theRSF took control of El Fasher, the military’s last stronghold in the western region of Darfur.The war has wrecked urban areas and has beenmarked by atrocities, including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings which the UN and rights groups have said amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur.The war has also created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and pushed parts of the country into famine.Explore more on these topicsSudanSouth SudanAfricaUnited NationsAntónio GuterresMiddle East and north AfricaDarfurnewsShareReuse this content"

Mountbatten-Windsor’s ties to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein led to thestripping of his royal status.His alleged victim, Virginia Giuffre, claimed in a 2021 US lawsuit that Andrew had sex with her after she had been trafficked by Epstein at a home in Belgravia, London, in 2001 when she was 17.In a US lawsuit she said she was “lent out for sexual purposes” to the then Duke of York in London, and on two other occasions outside the United Kingdom.Mountbatten-Windsor, 65, has always denied that claim and any other wrongdoing, and maintained his position when he paid money tosettle the lawsuit in 2022.The family of Giuffre said they were “deeply disappointed” by the force’s decision to drop the investigation “without explanation” and that they were not told this announcement was coming.They said in a statement: “We emailed with a detective from theMetropolitan policeyesterday, Friday, Dec 12th, who gave us no indication that this announcement was imminent.“Indeed, he asked us if we had any evidence we would like to present; we had not yet replied.“With the Epstein files about to be released by [the US] Congress since the passage ofthe Epstein Transparency Act, we are surprised that the Metropolitan police didn’t wait to see what further evidence might appear.“While we have hailed the UK’s overall handling of the case of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor previously, today we feel justice has not been served.“We continue to challenge the system that protects abusers, especially as more evidence comes to light that can hold people accountable. Our sister Virginia, and all survivors, are owed this much.”It is understood that on some of the former prince’s meetings with Epstein, a Met protection officer accompanied him, as he was entitled to police protection given his royal status.On Saturday, the Met said no allegation against Mountbatten-Windsor would be the subject of any formal criminal investigation in the UK. That includes claims he asked his Met police protection officer to investigate Giuffre in 2011, after she had gone public with her claims against him.Any criminal investigation would have involved the king’s brother being interviewed under criminal caution, if not arrested. The Met’s decision was reached without speaking to the former prince.In a new statement, the Met commander Ella Marriott said the force had decided to stand by its previous decision. Marriott said: “In 2015, the Metropolitan police service received allegations relating to non-recent trafficking for sexual exploitation involvingJeffrey Epsteinand Ghislaine Maxwell.“These allegations primarily concerned events outside the United Kingdom, with one allegation of trafficking to central London in March 2001.“Officers assessed all available evidence at the time, interviewed the complainant, Ms Virginia Giuffre as well as contacting several other potential victims. This did not result in any allegation of criminal conduct against any UK-based nationals.“The MPS sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service and liaised with US authorities, who were leading investigations into related matters involving US nationals. Following this legal advice, it was clear that any investigation into human trafficking would be largely focused on activities outside the UK and perpetrators based overseas.“Officers therefore concluded, in consultation with the CPS, that other international authorities were best placed to progress these allegations. Officers maintained close liaison with the US and other relevant authorities throughout their investigation to ensure any UK matters could be identified and to consider any support requested.“A decision was made in November 2016 not to proceed to a full criminal investigation. That decision was reviewed in August 2019 and again in 2021 and 2022; in each instance, the position remained unchanged, and Ms Giuffre and her legal representative were informed.”The Met said there would be no criminal investigation into claims Mountbatten-Windsor tried to get his police protection officers to smear his accuser.It is understood none of the protection officers at that time, who have been spoken to by Met investigators, supported claims that Mountbatten-Windsor asked them to find material that might undermine Giuffre.Detectives examined the Met’s records dating back more than a decade to see if any officer searched for material on Giuffre. Some records no longer existed.In October, the Mail on Sunday claimed an email showed Mountbatten-Windsor passed Giuffre’s date of birth and social security number to his bodyguard in 2011 and asked him to dig up dirt to smear his accuser.On Saturday Marriott said: “This assessment has not revealed any additional evidence of criminal acts or misconduct.“In the absence of any further information, we will be taking no further action. As with any other matter, should new and relevant information be brought to our attention, including in any information resulting from the release of material in the US, we will assess it.”A former senior prosecutor said there could be enough reason to criminally investigate Mountbatten-Windsor for his alleged sexual attack on Giuffre.Nick Vamos, the former head of special crime at the CPS, said: “If Ms Giuffre did not consent to sex, and Andrew did not reasonably believe that she consented to sex, then it would be rape. If it could be proved that Andrew knew that Giuffre had been trafficked then that would be compelling evidence that he could not have reasonably believed that Giuffre had the freedom to choose whether to consent.”Giuffre is now dead, but her New York lawsuit said the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her for Epstein’s sex trafficking enterprise. Maxwell is in a US prison.In her 2021 civil lawsuit brought against the former prince in the southern district of New York, Giuffre said: “Prince Andrew committed sexual assault and battery upon plaintiff when she was 17 years old. As such, Prince Andrew is responsible for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress pursuant to New York common law. The damage to plaintiff has been severe and lasting.“Prince Andrew abused plaintiff on separate occasions when she was under the age of 18 years old. On one occasion, Prince Andrew sexually abused plaintiff in London at Maxwell’s home. During this encounter, Epstein, Maxwell, and Prince Andrew forced plaintiff, a child, to have sexual intercourse with Prince Andrew against her will.”Giuffre also alleged the former prince had sex with her on two other occasions outside the UK. Giuffre’s sworn statement said: “During each of the aforementioned incidents, plaintiff was compelled by express or implied threats by Epstein, Maxwell, and/or Prince Andrew to engage in sexual acts with Prince Andrew, and feared death or physical injury to herself or another and other repercussions for disobeying Epstein, Maxwell, and Prince Andrew due to their powerful connections, wealth, and authority.“Prince Andrew engaged in each of the aforementioned sexual acts with plaintiff at Epstein and Maxwell’s invitation, knowing that she was a sex-trafficking victim being forced to engage in sexual acts with him.“During each of the aforementioned incidents, plaintiff did not consent to engaging in sexual acts with Prince Andrew. During each of the aforementioned incidents, Prince Andrew sexually abused plaintiff for the purpose of gratifying his sexual desires.”Vamos said Giuffre’s book published posthumously this year could not be used as evidence, but her testimony for the New York lawsuit could be: “A sworn statement she had made in the past could be admissible such as her statement in the New York lawsuit. The book would probably not be.“You would have to prove that she did not consent, had been trafficked, and Andrew knew that and thus could not reasonably believe she had freely consented.”Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied Giuffre’s claim and any other wrongdoing.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorMetropolitan policePoliceJeffrey EpsteinLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

That means it is either taken on board the RSS Sir David Attenborough, or via British Antarctic Survey aircraft.“We had a ship call a couple of weeks back, so we had post that went north on that, and then the next one will be 22 January – a flight leaves and that’s going to the Falklands,” Shaw said, adding that because the most recent ship did not come via the Falklands, it did not bring any post.But while slow and infrequent, there are benefits. “The stamps are cheaper,” said Shaw, noting it costs just 87p to send a letter to the UK from Antarctica.View image in fullscreenA curious penguin inspects the new postbox.Photograph: British Antarctic SurveyShaw added there is also an informal system to send post out to field parties.“Although our internet communications are much better now, even with the deeper field parties, it’s still just really nice being able to get an actual handwritten tangible piece of paper from somebody, and that takes all forms,” Shaw said.“I managed to get a letter attached to a fuel drum, which was airdropped into the middle of Antarctica.”Shaw is among the staff who will be at the Rothera Research Station over the festive period.“We often have special Christmas movie nights, and on Christmas Eve this year, actually, I am organising the eighth annual Rothera quidditch match,” she said.But with no postal deliveries yet this season, Shaw has had to think ahead.“My partner sent me down [to Antarctica] with some presents and things. So I’ve got some presents to open on Christmas Day, which is really nice.”Explore more on these topicsAntarcticaRoyal MailPost OfficefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 81-year-old had been admitted to hospital after one leg swelled up and turned black. “Going to lose the leg today,” he wrote.The message was not sent to his son, Thomas, who lives with him in Cebu in the Philippines, nor to his older daughter, Samantha, who is based in Florida. Instead, Markle contacted Caroline Graham, the US editor of the Mail on Sunday, who is based in Los Angeles. It was she who called Markle’s two older children to let them know the news. Shewrote laterthat they were “flabbergasted”.“He had chosen to break the news of the amputation to me before his own family.”Markle’s youngest child,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, would learn of her father’s health crisis “through news coverage”, Graham reported coyly several days after the operation, after she had flown to the Philippines to be by his bedside. “However, Mr Markle last night said he has not heard from Meghan ‘but would love to speak to her’.”Few dysfunctional families would find harmony under the close scrutiny of the tabloid press, as British royals have known for half a century and more. For the past eight years, since Meghan’s relationship with Prince Harry became public, that has been the story of the Markles, in which the toxic swirl of the past week is merely the latest unedifying chapter.View image in fullscreenThomas Markle appears on Good Morning Britain in 2018.Photograph: ReutersMeghan, having heard of his ill health last week, had been trying to reach her father, herspokesperson said, but “given that a Daily Mail reporter has remained at her father’s bedside throughout, broadcasting each interaction and breaching clear ethical boundaries, it has been exceedingly difficult for the duchess to contact her father privately, despite her efforts over the past several days”.If Meghan had emailed, her father had not received it, wrote Graham. Eventually, the duchess’s spokesperson said she had written him a letter and “with the support of reliable and trusted contacts, her correspondence is now safely in his hands”.Before Meghan married Prince Harry in 2018, the former actor and her father, a retired lighting director in the TV industry, were reportedly on reasonable, if distant terms. Meghan’s father, then living in Mexico, was in effect a “recluse”, his sontold the Mailin late 2017. “I haven’t seen him in years. He hates the attention Meghan’s romance has brought on to him. He loves her but hates the idea of being in the spotlight.”Thanks to the charms of sections of the press, he appears to have come round to the idea. Thomas, who separated from Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, when the future duchess was two, had initially been due to walk his daughter down the aisle ather wedding, but at the last minute she announced he would no longer be attending, amid reports of a heart attack – and after he had posed for staged paparazzi photos.A five-page letter written by Meghan to her father after the wedding was leaked by her father to the Mail on Sunday the following year. “I have to defend myself,” he told Graham.

What I have been through, I should be rewarded for.”Meghan accuses Daily Mail of ethics breach over reporting from father’s bedsideRead moreHaving lost touch with one daughter, he appears to have acquired another, of sorts. Having “met through work”, Graham wrote that she and Thomas had been “rock solid friends” since 2018. “We speak most days and I consider him a father figure.” DMG Media, the parent company of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, has denied Meghan’s accusation that the relationship breaches journalistic ethics.“As well as being a journalist, Caroline has been friends with Mr Markle since 2018. She has been with Mr Markle in hospital every day, providing him with care and support … The suggestion that Caroline has breached ethical boundaries is demonstrably false and vehemently denied,” said a spokesperson.The publisher willface a lawsuitfrom Prince Harry and others in the new year over allegations of illegal information gathering, which it denies.For now, the family agrees. Meghan’s half-brother, Thomas Jr, said this week that Grahamwould remain the trusted conduitfor his father’s health updates: “I trust her, she’s doing a great job, she’s never thrown anybody in the family under the bus … That is where your news is going to come from.”Explore more on these topicsMeghan, the Duchess of SussexMonarchyNewspapers & magazinesPrivacy & the mediaPress intrusionFamilyNewspapersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, more than ever, we must invest in hopeSam WollastonSat 13 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTShareDashing through the snow with Father Chris … It does not get any more seasonal, even if it feels like there might be a final syllable missing. To be honest we are not really dashing, it’s more a leisurely walk-and-talk, around North Shields. And the snow, the remnants of an early Tyneside flurry, is patchy and dirty rather than deep and crisp and even.Father Chris is real though – Father Chris Hughes, Catholic priest; the diocese is a strategic partner for the local chapter ofCitizens UK, one of five charities supported by this year’sGuardian charity appeal, under the theme of “hope”. The appeal supports grassroots voluntary groups that nurture community pride and positive change, providing an antidote to division and hate.Citizens UKis all about bringing people and communities together, in order to build a better, fairer society. I’m getting a little tour around the sites of some of its “wins”.We are accompanied by people involved in those wins: children from two local schools, teachers, mums, parishioners and Sara Bryson the community organiser. There are about 25 of us in all and we are calling it a Walk of Hope. Bryson, an atheist (Citizens is not affiliated with any religion) reminds us that Saint Augustine said hope had two beautiful daughters, Anger and Courage. “That’s the two strands: anger in the community because things aren’t great, and how you respond to that anger. It can either be organised in a way which is destructive and hateful or in a productive, compassionate way.”View image in fullscreenFather Chris Hughes: ‘People are losing faith that democracy works. Unless we can reimagine democracy and have people in their community at the heart, it worries me where it will lead.’Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFirst stop, the local Camhs (children and adolescent mental health services) centre. Three students from St Thomas More high school – Lily, Maggie and Brionna – explain that when they got together with Citizens UK to discuss what did and did not work for their mental health, a couple of things came up. First, they wanted a full-time school counsellor, and second, this Camhs building was not really doing it for them. They did not like gloomy rooms, or the bars on the windows.Who would listen to a few teenagers though? A lot, as it happens. They had meetings, with local MP Alan Campbell, with another local, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, and with Jim Mackey, now the chief executive of NHSEngland.They did not just get a counsellor for their school, they got acommitment for 8,500mental health professionals in schools across England. “Bridget Phillipson and Alan Campbell both said students at St Thomas More were affecting national policy,” says Lily.And the Camhs centre? The window bars were removed and the doors painted. Bright orange.View image in fullscreenCommunity organisers during the walk around North Shields highlighting their successes.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBrionna is wearing a Show Racism the Red Card badge, a campaign started on Tyneside in the 1990s when the Newcastle goalkeeper Shaka Hislop was racially abused by some children, who then recognised him and asked for his autograph. North Shields has a sizeable immigrant community, particularly workers in the NHS and carers.Hughes’s congregation has been boosted by families from Nigeria, India and the Philippines, but it has led to tensions. “This is where one of my parishioners, a Ghanaian woman, got spat at by a white British woman,” he says as we pass a pub. It happened soon after recent local elections in which Reform UK did well. “It emboldens people.”Walking through the Meadow Well estate, St George’s flags hang from many of the lamp-posts, and graffiti reads RULE BRITTANIA (sic). “It’s frightening,” says Hughes. “I get people’s anger, but this is classic scapegoating. Immigrants aren’t the problem, the problem is they haven’t been heard. People are losing faith that democracy works. Unless we can reimagine democracy and have people in their community at the heart, it worries me where it will lead. That’s where you get confrontation and violence on the street.”View image in fullscreenGraffiti on the Meadow Well estate.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAt the bus station, Mish Sony relates another win. When she was at St Thomas More she and a lot of other sixth formers were struggling to pay full-price bus fares after turning 16. Some were skipping classes or getting off the bus early because they could not afford the whole journey. Sony emailed the bus company Arriva but did not get a reply. “Through our relationship with Citizens we managed to get a seat at the table with the mayor, explained our situation. He emailed Arriva and lo and behold got an answer within an hour.”Sony and her friends arranged a meeting with Arriva top brass and went along wearing their parents’ work clothes to emphasise they were not adults. “My mum’s a nurse so I wore her scrubs,” she says. And they sang parody nursery rhymes:“The wheels on the bus don’t go round and round …”The result of this boldness: theGet Around for a Poundscheme across the north-east, offering single fares for a pound on the bus and metro up to the age of 21. It can feel hopeless at the moment, especially as a young person, says Sony, who is now studying pharmacy at Newcastle University. “On your own it’s like there’s no point in talking about or sharing this, who’s going to listen? But having been involved with Citizens UK it’s clear you can make a change, people will listen to you.”Alexander Scott park used to be a no-go place, strewn with bottles, needles and dog poo. The swings had no seats because they were being eaten by dogs, according to the council. Wendy McConnell, who runs a group called MumsSpace, which is part of Citizens UK, organised a litter pick and arranged a meeting with the council in the park. One of the mums, Penny, addressed them. “I’m not used to public speaking, it was nerve-racking,” she says. “But I’ve got two kids and I thought I’ve got to do this not just for my lot, but so others can enjoy it too.”View image in fullscreenHughes leads people through a park during the walk of hope around North Shields.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAnd they do. It is clean, the grass is mown, the swings have seats, there is even a zip wire, out of canine reach.More dog poo issues, I’m afraid, outside St Cuthbert’s primary school, when a bin was taken away so the poo was left on the street. And then started to come into the school, via shoes, bike and pram wheels. “Yuk!” says Ava, whose school this is, summarising the situation succinctly.Of course Ava and her classmates (Lukas, Freddie and Bella are also here) did not stand for it – they got together, told the council what they wanted and where they wanted it. And this is the site of a double win, because they also got a zebra crossing, with a lollipop lady, after the council initially said it was impossible.Nothing is impossible, it seems, when you get together and make it happen. Now it is getting cold, so it is time to get together inside and make tea and biscuits happen.Donate to the Guardian charity appeal 2025 hereExplore more on these topicsCommunitiesGuardian charity appeal 2025Tyne and WearChildrenVoluntary sectorNorth of EnglandSchoolsYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Do you think we talk too much about real estate?In my experience, Australians never talk about real estate but the Australian media talks about it all the time. It’s a little bit like politics in the UK, where the right wing occupy a tiny minority and yet they’re all over the BBC. The media will always pick up on something they think should be the topic of national conversation because it sells newspapers. But in my dealings with Australians, I find I talk about pretty well every other subject. There is something very exciting about Australia’s can-do attitude. The British national default is to say, “Maybe, I don’t know – ask me in six months”. We’re very good at circumlocuting an issue. But the moment I get off the plane in Australia, it is, “What can we do?” I love the optimism of Australia.Bernard Fanning: ‘The Beastie Boys were really rude – I gave Adam Yauch the finger’Read more[Tim & Kev’s Big Design Adventureco-host] Tim Ross and I are currently selling tickets for our live show and I have been wanting it to go more slowly. There’s no reason why I should be like this – diffident and British and not wanting the thing to be a success.What is the most important room in a house?Any room with a lock on it is quite good. Most teenagers will agree with me on that. There’s a beautiful book that was given to me by a friend recently, called The Poetics of Space by French philosopher Gaston Bachelard. What he says is that all our relationships with place, and therefore real estate, are forged in our childhoods and the houses in which we grow up. He says there’s something that buildings do that defines our home, which is providing a space for intimacy – not physical intimacy but psychological. It is really important that you have a space, perhaps a corner of a room or a window with a view, where you can daydream and know that you can do so safely.View image in fullscreen‘Australia is the most fantastic destination for modernism.’ Kevin McCloud in Sydney.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianWhat’s one Australian building you would take back to England?So many Australian buildings are unique to their place and consequently not easily transportable. Growing up in the UK, the Sydney Opera House was always so important in my mind because it was on the airmail postmark. I have loads of family in Australia – my parents had their £10 pom tickets and then my mum discovered she was pregnant with me so they cancelled.You were almost Australian, Kevin!Yes! I actually have more relatives in Australia now than I have in the UK. But rather than take the Opera House – a lovely thing about Australia is the way it takes its 19th- and 20th-century history really seriously. Australia is the most fantastic destination for modernism. And up the road from Tim’s house in Sydney, there is a bungalow that is the most exquisitely conserved piece of 1920s architecture. I would put one of those bungalows in every town in Britain, and I would say, “Look at this! All that plastic double glazing you put in, that big garage you put up, the paint colours you’re choosing, the porch you bolted on the back –thisis the perfect thing.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIs there a particular trend in design right now that you find depressing?Too many bathrooms. I often visit homes where there are more toilets than human beings occupying the building. Even if you have a party for 100 people, no more than two people at any one moment are going to want to have a wee. Now we measure the value of a home by the number of toilets and bathrooms it has, which is bonkers. I’ve just finished doing up a little barn and I got so incensed by this idea of the bathroom being this object of financial fetish that there is only one toilet and it is the only room in the house with a door. You know, the wall behind me actually is a bat loft – we’ve lost about 15% of the footprint of the building because it’s now dedicated towards a rare species of bats. That’s British planning law for you. If the historic mob don’t get you, the bats will. I love having a bat loft though.The great American architect Charles Moore once said, architecture should be an instrument of connection – not isolation. We build these perfect worlds with all these toilets and makeup mirrors and media rooms, so each household can live in a castle and you can pull up the drawbridge to be entirely independent of your neighbours and the natural world. It can’t come in and you don’t need to go out. We pursued a very self-centred agenda. This is all to say – I’d go for the bats every time.Who is the most famous person in your phone?Wouldn’t that be bragging?Yeah, that’s the point.Monty Don: ‘Everything about gardening is personal. It heals my troubled brain’Read moreWell … you meet a few people along the way because of the club I’m in, which is the club of TV people. People who are in the public eye and therefore also have to deal with social media and the constant clamouring for a selfie. And you’ve always got something to talk about, right? So there’s Monty Don, who lives near me. He’s very private and I’m very private, but occasionally we have a chin wag.What are you secretly really good at?Increasingly, with age, I think I’m much less good at things than I thought I was. I can build – I physically rebuilt the building I’m sitting in, and I can do a bit of woodwork and joinery. But I’m not confident about any of it and consequently I like to employ plumbers, electricians and curtain makers now. The arrogance of youth is fantastic, isn’t it? I don’t believe there’s such a thing as the arrogance of old age, that’s for sure.What is the weirdest thing you have eaten?For the purposes of television, I’ve been made to eat all kinds of things. I don’t really have a sense of smell, which is a huge advantage. I’ve had insects, frogs legs, eyeballs of goat – it sounds like a witch’s recipe. I once made coffee out of dandelion root, which was quite delicious. And I brewed some oak beer out of acorns, which I didn’t like much. I’ve had some fermented shark, which had been buried underground in Iceland. It’s absolutely foul. You don’t need to eat it to imagine what it tastes like. Like eating vomit mixed with ammonia. And I have to do all this stuff on camera.What book, album or film do you always return to and why?I watched Trading Places last night. It’s Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd at their peak, and the whole cast are Hollywood greats of the 20th century. But the language and some of the ideas are beginning to feel very uncomfortable now. It deals with racism head-on, right? But the language of the early 80s is embarrassing now. But I do cling to the fact it deals with race and issues of privilege. So I love it; I salute it, almost. But I don’t know how long we’re going to be able to watch it before it becomes unacceptable.If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be on it?I am so tempted to just describe my favourite sandwich. But if it was named after me, it would have to be super sustainable and contain wood chips or something eco-friendly. Yes – it would be structural insulated panels filed with recycled expanded polystyrene.What’s been your most memorable interaction with a fan?This is something that happens regularly and it always blows me over: when somebody in their 30s comes up to me and says, “I’m an architect or an engineer, and what got me into it was watching Grand Designs when I was eight with my mum and dad.” Of course, I’m not at all responsible for anybody making these decisions. But the thing is, television just disappears and sometimes you think, “That’s my entire life and there’s nothing to see for it.” It’s just arseing around in front of a camera. So when someone says that, that’s powerful. It validates the job. It is what a vain television person like me dreams of hearing.Kevin McCloud and Tim Ross, hosts of podcastTim & Kev’s Big Design Adventure, are taking their show Live in Interesting Places around Australia in February; tickets and detailsbigdesignadventure.comExplore more on these topicsPodcasts10 Chaotic QuestionsTelevisionKevin McCloudArchitectureDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Any free time I had was spent on working towards a coveted spot at a performance company.As soon as I graduated school in Brisbane, I left to begin my career as a performer.After moving around the world for work, I landed my dream job as an assistant creative director at Cirque du Soleil in 2019. But as I was settling into my new life in Los Angeles, the pandemic shut everything down. I was let go from a job I had worked my entire life towards.I was an unemployed circus person and he was a guy who worked in finance. What on earth were we going to have in common?When I moved back to my parents’ place in Noosa, I felt lost for the first time in my life.Surfing the dating apps helped break up the monotony of my days. I connected with a couple of guys but nothing eventuated. Until a familiar face popped up on my screen: Tom from high school. He had caught my eye back then, and his profile pictures showed me he still had it. But we had been in different social circles and had rarely crossed paths.We matched on the app and he sent the first message. I told him he looked familiar and we exchanged some small talk.View image in fullscreenAsh and Tom’s first football game together in October 2020.The first time he asked me out, I declined as I was set on leaving Australia as soon as everything reopened. The second and third times, I cancelled at the last minute. I was an unemployed circus person and he was a guy who worked in finance. What on earth were we going to have in common?By the fourth time, I surprised us both by agreeing, realising I didn’t have anything to lose and the pandemic was going to last much longer than three weeks.We planned to meet at his house and he ordered an Uber to pick me up. I waited outside looking like a total dag with wet hair and baggy clothes. My low expectations for the date meant I didn’t put in too much effort.When the Uber arrived, I was startled when he opened the door for me as I wasn’t expecting him to be inside. When he held my hand to help me into the car, I knew I had made a grave mistake by cancelling all the other dates. His looks were obvious, but his politeness struck me.I had a bit of life under my belt before I met Tom, so I was surprised that men like him still existed. The simple act made me realise there were people worth slowing down for.It also helped that we got along. Although we had taken different life paths, we were both very driven – not only in our respective fields but also in striving to be the best versions of ourselves. This understanding made it feel as though we had known each other forever – which was somewhat true.I ended the first date early as I thought I had blown it and was embarrassed with the careless outfit I’d worn. But thankfully, after 24 hours of painful silence, he messaged to ask if I wanted to try again. After that, our relationship was like a fire – it was wild and moved very fast. He drove up from Brisbane every weekend to visit me in Noosa. I counted down the days until we would be together again.The time we spent together opened my eyes to a life and love outside of work. I wanted to grasp hold of it with both hands. We moved in together a few months after that less-than-ideal first date.A short time later I got a call from Cirque asking me back. I was also pregnant with our first child. I happily declined and for the first time I didn’t feel left out for not touring.View image in fullscreenAsh, Tom and their children in Fiji this year.Photograph: Ash McCreadyI loved my new life as a soon-to-be mother, but that didn’t stop me from creating, especially with Tom’s encouragement and support. When I was 36 weeks pregnant with our first child he helped me produce my own show called Cirque Bon Bon. In the days after giving birth to my second child via an emergency caesarean section, Tom pushed me around the theatre in a wheelchair, helping me with the final touches for opening night.The moment I knew: we were discussing Jane Austen when I told her I wanted to be with her for everRead moreFirst loves are incomparable and mine has always been dance.

The ethical Paris trainer worn by A-listers and royaltyVeja doesn’t do surveys or freebies, hates greenwashing and Black Friday, and as demand for trainers wanes, it continues to go its own wayMorwenna FerrierSat 13 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareIn the grand hierarchy ofParisfashion, it’s tricky for a brand to stand out. Especially one whosecoup de maîtreis a goes-with-everything white sneaker. Yet 20 years after Veja first began selling sustainable footwear, it has become the ultimate affordable It brand for scooter-wielding mums, sustainably minded millennials and A-list bigwigs who want to wear their values on their ethical leather-clad feet.Veja’s co-founder Sébastien Kopp says he doesn’t know if people buy his trainers because of how they are made or because of how they look. The company is fastidious about social and fairtrade practices, “but because we don’t do surveys, we don’t do marketing, we simply don’t know this information”, he says, speaking from Veja’s Paris headquarters.It also doesn’t do freebies. When the actor Emma Watson wanted a pair, she did what no celebrity has ever done, “and she bought”. So did Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. “I received an email from the [palace] asking about them, but I thought it was fake so I didn’t reply.”View image in fullscreenReese Witherspoon wearing a pair of white Veja trainers in 2020.Photograph: Broadimage/ShutterstockThe actorMarion Cotillardonce listedit as a favourite brand alongside Valentino and Alexander McQueen, and it’s been reported that the company even received a request from the maximalist costume department ofEmily in Paris(on this, Veja prefers not to comment).What Veja does know is that it has sold almost 15m pairs worldwide. Its success hinges on several factors. Like aDaunts tote bag, or even aLabubu, branded accessories have become material signals of taste or interest, a way of wearing your values.“The Veja V tells the world this trainer is responsibly designed and produced, and that you care about that,” says Ima Shah, the director at the trend forecasting site Stylus. Fashion helped, too. Oversized clothing is popular right now, but inherently casual. “Big trousers and big shoes don’t work. A sharper shoe formalises that look – it smartens it,” she says.Veja makes sports shoes, but the earlier models, which are most popular, are in effect trainers for people who don’t want to wear trainers.View image in fullscreenMeghan, Duchess of Sussex, wearing Vejas in Sydney with Prince Harry.Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty for the Invictus Games FoundationStill, these are strange times for shoes. Of the 23bn shoes produced each year, about 60% are trainers. But according to Katy Lubin, the vice-president of brand and communications at the fashion marketplace Lyst, “demand for sneakers is currently down around 30% year on year”. The trend forecasting agency WGSN said sneakers were projected to decline next year, too. People wants boots and loafers, says Lubin.It doesn’t help that right now, no sneaker style dominates. Earlier this year, the New York Times declared the end of the dad trainer, but according to Lyst, the paternally shapedNew Balance 204Lis one of the hottest trainers of the year.Gen Z are wearing slimline shoes such as Puma Speedcats, whereas millennials, such as Chanel’s creative director, Matthieu Blazy, are still wearing Nikes (Blazy wore his for his debut Chanel bow).View image in fullscreen‘Trainers for people who don’t want to wear trainers.’Photograph: VejaOn the catwalk you’ll see Asics at Cecilie Bahnsen, and Prada went so far as to design its own. And despiteRishi Sunak’s best efforts, even the Adidas Samba is back from the dead.Step up: what to wear to a ‘no-shoes’ houseRead moreYet the white sneaker prevails. The most popular Veja sneaker, according to Lyst, is the Campo. As spare and elegant as its noughties predecessor, the Stan Smith, much like the “quiet luxury” trend and no-makeup makeup, its blankness is also its appeal. The main difference is its customer.“Stan Smiths are comparable, yes, but have always skewed younger,” says Shah. While Stan Smith had cultural cache – Jay-Z once rapped about them – “Veja’s values are more linked to responsible purchasing rather than trends.” It helps, too, that they’re French, which grants them a certain chicness.Until 1980, Veja’s Paris headquarters were the French Communist party’s printing building. Updated with a poured concrete floor and a Bauhaus-esque staircase, it has a vegetarian canteen, although like some of its shoes, even that used to be vegan.View image in fullscreenThe Princess of Wales wearing Vejas.Photograph: Arthur Edwards/WPA Pool/ShutterstockVeja began phasing out vegan sneakers because “the more we looked at leather, the more we realised natural materials have better traceability”, Kopp says. Vegan leather is often just polyester or plastic. “I know Stella McCartney is an icon [in the UK] but the vegan PVC shoes. For me?Non.” As for the canteen, it stopped being vegan because the staff supposedly missed cheese.Kopp launched the brand with his childhood friend François-Ghislain Morillion – they both worked in finance – after noticing a lack of shoes that advocated ethical practice and traceability in their production process. The company now employs 500 people and has produced 14m pairs of sneakers, reaching the commerciality and ubiquity it once arguably resisted.The sticking point with the ideal sustainability model – which advocates a “don’t make, don’t buy, don’t throw anything away approach” – is that there are also jobs at stake. For this reason, Kopp thinks the issue is consumer moments such as Black Friday. “It creates an economy and a mindset that is not good.” Veja does not participate. The company’s website discloses the contracts of its producers and wages of the factory workers.Greenwashing is also a problem, says Kopp. “The word recycling has been co-opted,” he says. This is particularly true in footwear where a single pair of sneakers can contain up to 40 different materials.View image in fullscreenTrainers from Veja’s autumn-winter 2025 collection.Photograph: VEJA“This is not just hard to recycle, it’s virtually impossible,” says Daniel Schmitt, Veja’s head of repair operations. For this reason, it now runs several cobblers, the idea being that one pair can be recycled – “or reborn”, says Schmitt – up to five times.As the global capital of swank, recycling is not something you associate with Paris fashion. But nor is fast fashion and yet last month, Shein opened a shop in the French capital. “It’s not crazy at all,” Kopp says. There is Primark, there is Zara. Nobody can stop or is really trying to stop consumption.”That its practices “show what’s fine with our supply chain and what’s wrong with the supply chains of others” is just how it goes. “We are the grandfathers of this industry, we are from another era,” Kopp says.Explore more on these topicsFashionWomen's shoesMen's shoesParisFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Surely this one would be forArsenal. Never before in English football history had a team endured a worse league record after 15 matches than Wolves. In any of the professional divisions. Their haul of two points gave an outline of the grimness, although by no means all of the detail.Before kick-off, the bookmakers had Wolves at 28-1 to win; it was 8-1 for the draw. You just had to hand it to the club’s 3,000 travelling fans who took up their full ticket allocation. There were no trains back to Wolverhampton after the game, obviously. It was a weekend. Mission impossible? This felt like the definition of it.Yet Wolves would scrap and they would confound. For most of the occasion, it felt as if we were watching the shock result of the season play out. Arsenal were horribly off their game. ThePremier Leagueleaders might have cited fatigue as an excuse. It was also possible to wonder whether complacency was at work – in the Emirates Stadium stands, as well, where it was strangely flat and subdued, particularly in the first half.View image in fullscreenSam Johnstone scores an own goal as Bukayo Saka’s corner bounces back off a post.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesMikel Arteta’s team played their trump card on 70 minutes; from a corner, naturally. Little had gone for them in open play. It was Bukayo Saka who sent over the inswinger from the right and it was when Sam Johnstone’s world fell in. The Wolves goalkeeper misread the flight and, scrambling back, he seemed to brush the ball against the far post. Whereupon it bounced back, hit him and went in.The crazy thing was that Rob Edwards’ visitors rebelled. Arsenal tried to protect what they had towards the end and they dropped deep, almost inviting their opponents on. Arteta would be furious about this afterwards.Wolves pushed in the 89th minute, the Arsenal substitute Myles Lewis-Skelly needing to make an important tackle on Tolu Arokodare, who had also come off the bench. Then it happened. When another substitute, Mateus Mané, crossed from the left, Arokodare got in front of Piero Hincapié to flash a header past David Raya. The Emirates announcer gave the goal to Mané. But if he was scrambled, so was everybody.Arsenal found the answer deep into stoppage time; a goal to avert disaster, to paper over the cracks. Just about. Arteta had sent on Gabriel Jesus and he challenged in front of goal when Saka crossed from the right. The ball, though, flew in off the head of Yerson Mosquera. Another own goal; devastation for him and Wolves. The defender lay supine for what felt like an age.View image in fullscreenWolves players celebrate after the late equaliser that seemed to have earned them an unlikely point.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesThe relief for Arsenal was palpable. Arteta had seen his team’s lead at the top cut to two points after the 2-1 loss at Aston Villa the previous Saturday. He could not countenance another slip. He needed to apply the pressure on Manchester City before their visit to Crystal Palace on Sunday. The positive reading was that winning ugly is the hallmark of champions. It was certainly ugly.“We had a period of two or three minutes [being] deep, totally passive, with horrible defensive habits,” Arteta said of that spell near the end. “That is nowhere near the level that is required. We are relieved because we managed to score a goal at the end and go on winning but we need to improve in that sense, for sure. We made it even harder with what we did in the manner that we conceded the goal. That’s unacceptable.”Wolves had set an extraordinarily low bar with their performance in the 4-1 home defeat against Manchester United last Monday but even so, this was much better from them from the first whistle. The commitment was there, especially in the duels. Emmanuel Agbadou was a symbol of it at the back, slamming the door on Viktor Gyökeres. Toti was good alongside him and so was João Gomes in midfield.Arsenal were terrible in the first half. So slow, so predictable. Pretty much everything in open play went through Saka on the right but try as he did and slippery as he was, he could not make it happen. Arteta’s team had only one big chance before the interval which, inevitably, came from an inswinging Declan Rice corner. Gabriel Martinelli was unmarked beyond the far post but he directed his header across goal and wide. Martinelli had two other flickers only to lack conviction.Quick GuideMatch factsShow• Yerson Mosquera putting through his own net was the 18th 90th-minute winning own goal in Premier League history. 33% of these have been for an Arsenal win (6/18), with two now against Wolves at the Emirates Stadium (also José Sá in February 2022).• Wolves have now scored two own goals in a single Premier League game on three occasions, with two of those coming against Arsenal (also at Molineux in the hosts' 4-1 defeat November 2009). No side has conceded multiple own goals in more different games.• This was the seventh time a team have scored twice in a Premier League match with both goals being own goals, and the first since Leicester lost 2-1 at Liverpool in December 2022.OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The moment to quicken the pulses in the first half came at the other end, when Wolves broke after repelling a 27th minute corner. Hwang Hee-chan ran from his own half with nobody bar Raya in front of him and a posse of chasing red behind him; a cat among the pigeons. He kept running and unloaded the shot, Raya getting down to save. Hincapié did well to block from Jørgen Strand Larsen on 45 minutes after initially slipping over.View image in fullscreenHwang Hee-chan clatters in to Myles Lewis-Skelly to earn himself a yellow card.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesArteta had gone as strong as possible with his lineup – no rest for many of his overexerted players – and the task was to plot a route through Edwards’s 5-3-2 system. William Saliba and Rice were back after absences and Arteta was forced into a reshuffle when Ben White, on a rare start at right-back, was forced off on the half-hour with a hamstring problem.With almost an hour on the clock, it was impossible to ignore the anxiety in the home seats. Was it going to be one of those nights? The sluggishness of their team was hard to explain. Arteta made a triple change, introducing Mikel Merino, Martin Ødegaard and Leandro Trossard. Off went the ineffective Martín Zubimendi, Eberechi Eze and Martinelli, the last of whom had just curled a shot past the far post.Arteta raged when Hwang slid into Lewis-Skelly and was booked – the manager wanted a red card, although there was not enough in it for that. Arteta watched Rice go close with a free-kick and then force a fine low save out of Johnstone. The goalkeeper’s descent from potential hero to villain was stunning, the first own goal of the night a real howler. The second brought Wolves to their knees.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It ended with the Egyptian doing a one-man lap of honour at Anfield, an attempt to rebuild trust with the supporters after creating a ceasefire, if not a complete truce, with Arne Slot.Over the past seven days a lot has changed, but one thing remained the same, Salah started a Premier League game on the bench, not that he needed to wait long for a chance to do his talking on the pitch. He would finish with an assist after playing 75 minutes against Brighton in a game in which he desperately wanted to score. Maybe his parade was the beginning of the end, but it felt more like the start of the apology that should continue after the Africa Cup of Nations, giving both parties space to breathe.Mohamed Salah returns and sets up Ekitiké to help Liverpool beat BrightonRead moreDropped for the trip to Inter after his combustion at Elland Road, having sat idle whileLiverpool drew at Leeds, Salah had been recalled to the squad. Criticism has been thrown at him from all angles and Liverpool supporters will have wondered if this was their last chance to see him in the flesh.“Salah has been part of a group that has provided me with unrivalled joy as a football fan, which will be the overwhelming memory, but there will be that little asterisk now,” said Navneet Singh, aLiverpoolseason-ticket holder. “There’s a difference between the best and your favourite players. Robbie Fowler and John Barnes are my favourite Liverpool players. But part of the reason they’re my favourites is because they didn’t have incidents like this.”Some supporters would have been happy if Salah had not played for the club again. At times that felt a real possibility, but he was still in red after the air was somewhat cleared on Friday by talks between Salah and Slot.Salah’s face is at the forefront of Anfield, featuring on banners and murals, one with a crown atop his head. In a region where royalty is often dismissed, only footballing heroes deserve to be crowned, but supporters do not like it when someone thinks they are more important than the collective. Many stopped to take selfies in front of Salah’s image, possibly worried that if things deteriorated it would only take a few spray paint cans for a new hero to emerge.View image in fullscreenLiverpool fans show their support for Mohamed Salah at Anfield.Photograph: Jon Super/APThe mascots were pleased to see Salah, exchanging high fives in the tunnel. He walked on to the pitch with Dominik Szoboszlai’s arm around his shoulder, before taking in the surroundings of his second home by standing alone on the edge of the penalty area. His family was in the stands.View image in fullscreenArne Slot allowed his set-piece coach Aaron Briggs to give Mohamed Salah instructions when he came on.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAWith the expectation of a watching brief, Salah got to enjoy an intense conversation with Andy Robertson, before turning to jokes. Salah’s face was stern, and an opener after 46 seconds from Hugo Ekitiké must have made him question if he would be required. He did not need to wait long.The sparsity of experienced substitutes brought Salah into the game in the 26th minute, replacing the injured Joe Gomez as part of a tactical rejig. The coaching instructions did not come directly from Slot, instead set-piece coach Aaron Briggs informed Salah what was required. It was not a raucous introduction, but he was more than warmly applauded when his name was announced, followed by a chorus of ‘Mo Salah running down the wing’. That song immediately came to life and Salah could have had an assist within seconds.He brought his own high-tempo brand of energy, desperate to prove a point to his manager and using his anger to fuel his performance. Having not started the past four games, and not featured at all in the previous two, there was plenty of pent up rage Salah wanted to channel into goals, but fell short.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Federico Chiesa lined up an easy chance for Salah in injury time, only to watch his teammate fire over from close range. Salah was left on the ground, exhausted from a week that will provide a lengthy chapter in his Liverpool career.Being at the centre of a storm is draining and Salah has felt the full effect. Using his time to praise the fans gave the impression of an admission of guilt that he committed the cardinal sin of putting himself above the team. “He will always be a legendary player here, but he might have cost himself a statue outside the ground,” Singh said.Earning trust back from those who have idolised him will be important because even if the relationship is strained, when the Egyptian does leave, he will be desperate for it to be on better terms.Salah was the last man to leave the pitch, but he has come back in from the cold. His comments in the mixed zone were cool, too, saying “two weeks in a row?” and smartly walking on.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was far from obvious. There was a clear sense Maresca was directing a message to somebody: he made the statement in response to a question about Malo Gusto’s form and repeated it before clarifying: “I love the fans and we are very happy with the fans.” Nor did it seem that he meant the media; he has never previously given any indication he cares what journalists and pundits say, there was no sense of hostility and he had appeared in perfectly good spirits at his pre-match press conference.Mohamed Salah returns and sets up Ekitiké to help Liverpool beat BrightonRead moreGiven he accepted the blame – again, without being pressed on the issue – for thedefeat at Leeds, saying he had got the team selection wrong, the implication was that somebody within the club has challenged or in some other way annoyed Maresca sincethe Atalanta defeat. The issue, though, is far from clear; asked if he was talking about some “internal” problem, Maresca replied “in general”.After three games without a win, this was a much-needed victory but it was one that highlighted the oddity of Maresca’s side. They have a squad packed with extraordinary talent, and are capable of passages of exceptional football, but they are also wildly inconsistent, even within individual games.They won easily, could have won more easily, and yet also had spells in which the game threatened to slip from their grasp. Every time it looks like everything might be coalescing into something coherent, perhaps even title-challenging, they stumble, and every time it looks like a blip might become a crisis, they embark on a run of positive form.WhenChelsea drew against Arsenaltwo weeks ago, despite being reduced to 10 men before half-time, it meant they had lost just one in 12 in all competitions and it was possible to see them taking advantage if Arsenal faltered. Since then, though, they have lost to Leeds and Atalanta and beenheld to a draw at Bournemouth. They began the weekend fifth, eight points off the top, and are 13th in the Champions League table. Perhaps that level of inconsistency is inevitable with a squad so young; which is where it’s worth remembering that their youth is a policy based not in economic necessity but through a conscious policy of regarding players as assets to be spun and sold at profit.View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca was all smiles at the final whistle, but his later comments were puzzling.Photograph: Robin Jones/Getty ImagesThe loss of Moisés Caicedo, suspended for three league games after that red card against Arsenal, obviously has not helped, but he was available against Atalanta and couldn’t maintain second-half control.Injuries at the back have not helped, with Levi Colwill suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury in August. Although Wesley Fofana is back after missing four games through concussion, Maresca is reluctant to risk playing him more than once a week. The difference when he plays is stark: one defeat in 10 when Fofana has started this season, five defeats in 14 when he has not. Chelsea have not conceded more than once with him on the pitch in any game this season. It is not that Trevoh Chalobah, Tosin Adarabioyo or Josh Acheampong aren’t up to it; more that they benefit from having an experienced head alongside them. Thiago Silva, arguably, has never properly been replaced.Cole Palmer, making his first appearance at Stamford Bridge since the opening weekend of the season, got his first goal in almost three months as he latched on to Gusto’s through-ball to put Chelsea ahead in the 21st minute. Gusto added a second, turning in a cut-back from Pedro Neto, just before half-time.View image in fullscreenMalo Gusto leaves Everton on the floor after putting Chelsea two goals up.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesWithout ever really looking like they would get back into the game,Evertonhad their chances, and Iliman Ndiaye rolled an effort against the post late on.“I’m disappointed because we didn’t win, and disappointed because we got a couple of injuries but not disappointed with how we played,” said David Moyes. “Maybe we just ran short of the quality needed when we got the chances.”If one chance had been taken, the mood might have changed and it might have been a different story. But that’s the nature of this Chelsea: for all their glitter, for all they are capable of challenging the very best, there is a brittleness to them. And that, ultimately, will probably prevent them winning the very biggest titles.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He was being treated for leukaemia.The Seaham-born Rowell, who scored a hat-trick in a 4-1 Division Two win over Newcastle at St James’ Park in February 1979, died on Saturday. His death comes 50 years to the day since he made his Sunderland debut and just a day before the Black Cats host the Magpies in the first Premier League derby between the clubs since March 2016, at which the hosts will mark Rowell’s death.A club statement said: “We are truly devastated to announce the death of the legendary Gary Rowell, who has passed away at the age of 68 after a long battle with leukaemia.“Gary passed away on Saturday afternoon – 50 years to the very day he made his Sunderland debut – surrounded by his sons Chris and Peter, who accompanied him when he was inducted into the SAFC Hall of Fame in 2020.”Rowell made 297 appearances for the club of which he was a lifelong supporter and scored 103 goals during a 12-year stay at Roker Park.

That tournament can be seen in hindsight as a watershed for the English game, the first indication that the elite player performance plan (EPPP) and the England DNA project – taking youth football seriously – might be beginning to pay off.Youth football is notoriously unpredictable and England’s record in the Under-17 World Cup since shows a failure to qualify and a pair of last-16 exits, but following that 2017 success, England’s senior side have reached two European Championship finals and a World Cup semi-final, while the under-21s have won two European titles. Two previous Golden Ball winners from Under-17 World Cups – Cesc Fàbregas and Toni Kroos – have gone on to win the senior World Cup. Some, such as Landon Donovan, Anderson and Kelechi Iheanacho have had perfectly decent careers. And others have vanished almost entirely: Sani Emmanuel of Nigeria, for instance, won in 2009 then made just 16 senior appearances, 10 of them in the Swiss second tier with Biel-Bienne; while another Nigerian, Kelechi Nwakali, winner in 2015, joined Arsenal but, after a series of loan moves and stints in the lower reaches of the Spanish and Portuguese systems, was kicked out of Barnsley this past summer after returning late for pre-season.View image in fullscreenPhil Foden arrives at Heathrow after being part of England’s Under-17 World Cup triumph in 2017.Photograph: Anthony Upton for FA/ShutterstockThe road from prodigy to glory is a rocky one. Foden has been an England regular since 2020, but there was a point earlier this year when it seemed he might not even make the squad for next summer’s World Cup. He asked to be left out of the squad in June as he dealt with personal issues, and then was not selected for the September internationals when England suddenly clicked, hammering Serbia in Belgrade, for the first time under Thomas Tuchel looking as though they might be capable of winning the World Cup. Theomission of Jude Bellinghamdrew the headlines in October but Foden was also missing. He did return in November, coming on in the second half in both games.It says much about the success of the EPPP that England find themselves in a position in which Foden’s place in the team is not guaranteed. A couple of decades ago, any world-class creator would have been regarded like a minor deity without whom success was impossible. No matter how bad their form, how recent a fractured metatarsal, how many games they would miss through suspension, the great creator would be included.It also says a lot about Tuchel and his focus on balance over individuals that he could state that Foden, Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham cannot play together, or at least not in the structure he prefers. It’s not, he said, “because they don’t individually deserve it” but because “we will always do what’s best for balance and we will try to keep the clarity, even if it means that we have to take tough decisions”.The idea that a player “deserves” a call-up because of their club form has been an irritating constant in English football discourse for years, but a cap is not some sort of merit award. As Alf Ramsey said when he picked Jack Charlton for the first time, what is important is not to call up the best players but the right players.Tuchel has been adamant that he will pick specialist wide players for those roles, players who will drive beyond Kane into the space vacated when he drops deep, rather than taking “five No 10s” to the United States. England experienced the logjam that sort of approach can lead to at the last Euros when Gareth Southgate, for the first time as England manager, seemed to be selecting on ability and status rather than utility.Which leaves Foden in a slightly strange position. When he has been used by England it has tended to be in a wide role, but that has rarely got the best out of him. AtManchester City, the inter-movement was sophisticated enough that he could come infield without creating an imbalance. Like Trent Alexander-Arnold, the unusual collection of attributes that made him such an effective player at a club, where systems could be developed to accentuate his strengths and cover for his deficiencies, counted against him an international level. He is sui generis, perfect for City, but not the sort of plug-in-and-play model that is easier to accommodate with a national team.View image in fullscreenPhil Foden started every game for England at Euro 2024.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianFoden, having just been named Premier League player of the season, started every game for England at the Euros in 2024, four times on the left and three times in more central roles as Southgate scrabbled for a workable system. He was not alone in struggling on his return to the club game and last term probably had his poorest season since becoming a City regular.Once he had recovered from an ankle injury, Foden has played much of this season on the right, although with a clear remit to move into the centre. There have been games, such as the last two, against Sunderland and Real Madrid, when he has been part of a central midfield three with Rayan Cherki as the right-sided player.Football Daily | A £3,120 ‘value’ ticket and other bleak news for fans heading to World CupRead moreAt least from an attacking point of view, he has thrived in both positions, scoring five goals in his last three league fixtures, although the fact City conceded two against Leeds and four against Fulham in two of those games suggests perhaps some issue with balance remains. It was notable against Madrid, though, how much more open City looked after Foden went off as part of a triple substitution with 20 minutes to go. His link-up with Erling Haaland is becoming better and better. There’s a sense of him taking on at least some of the responsibilities of Kevin De Bruyne.Not that long ago, that would have been more than enough to guarantee Foden privileged status in the England team. Now he’s not even guaranteed a place in the squad, a remarkable turn of events for the poster boy of England’s great reset. He’s certainly not an Emmanuel, but England’s strength in depth and Tuchel’s single-mindedness mean Foden might not get the chance to be a Kroos.Explore more on these topicsPhil FodenInside footballEnglandManchester CitycommentShareReuse this content"

This matter is being taken seriously and is now being managed through the appropriate channels.”Adelaide should be England’s best chance: expect changes after Noosa debrief | Ali MartinRead moreEngland have declined to comment but privately the flare-up has been viewed as stupidly needless, not least given relations between the players and the very same broadcast crew had been cordial while the squad enjoyed a mid-tour break in the Queensland resort of Noosa.The subject of numerous headlines and photographs, the trip itself had passed without incident. Despite being 2-0 down in the series andthe subject of ridicule locally, Ben Stokes and his players accepted requests for selfies from the public and allowed their time playing golf to be filmed.Broadcast journalists at airports have become a feature of Australian tours in recent years.CricketAustralia’s media manager has sent out multiple requests for players in this series to be given space and that no questions be asked, requests that have not always been adhered to.A year ago, Virat Kohli was involved in a heated exchange with a broadcast journalist at Melbourne airport during India’s tour after reportedly believing his children had just been filmed.Meanwhile, Australia’s Usman Khawaja has declared himself fit for the third Ashes Test, brushing aside speculation about his future and saying he will keep playing as long as he is valued by the team. The left-handed batter, who will turn 39 during the Adelaide Test which starts on Wednesday, missed the pink-ball encounter against England due to a back problem, and was also unable to open in either of the innings in Perth last month.“I could have retired two years ago, or at any time,” Khawaja told reporters in Adelaide on Saturday. “I am always mindful of the future, I always have been. I am not here to hang on, I am just here to enjoy my cricket. “As long as I am valued I am here, I am doing my job.”“I’ve got to be totally honest, it doesn’t really faze me,” Khawaja said on the chances of his return to the playing XI. “The older I have got, the more comfortable I have got with things that I can control and things that I cannot. And I feel really good. I am ready to go. The rest of it is not in my control. So we will see what happens.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Now that South Africa has been incorporated into theChampions Cup, these long trips are part and parcel. It meant Saracens changing 10 of their starting lineup. It meant Sharks changing 14 – and a head coach to boot.JP Pietersen, the former Springbok, stepped up to fill his new role this week when John Plumtree resigned after the Sharks’ heavy defeat in Toulouse on Sunday. One match, one win, his record now reads. ForSharksthis was only a second win of the season. They were just about worth it, but still they must despair at finding any rhythm among a squad packed with Springboks.Parling frustrated as Leicester blow half-time lead against Leinster to lose againRead moreFour tries againstSaracensis not to be sniffed at, even if the visitors travelled short of a few stars themselves, but only a stolen lineout at the death denied the visitors a fourth try of their own and the win. Andy Onyeama-Christie could not quite gather James Hadfield’s throw-in at a five-metre lineout, the clock in the red. In the slippery chaos that followed, Ethan Hooker belted the ball into the stand in relief.Those high, steepling banks of seats (mostly empty) at Kings Park rattled throughout, as the wind whipped in from the Indian Ocean. Handling was a skill at a premium. As was kicking. Charlie Bracken and Fergus Burke harnessed the conditions well to bombard the Sharks’ back three, against whom Angus Hall wreaked havoc in pursuit.But the Sharks forwards had the edge in the tight. In the first few minutes, in particular, their scrum was destructive. In only the fourth, their lineout was pretty unanswerable too, Bongi Mbonambi finishing one devastating drive after a penalty to the corner.Quick GuideChampions Cup roundup: Glasgow stun Toulouse with comeback winShowGlasgowproduced one of the greatest wins in their history by recovering from a 21-point deficit to topple the Champions Cup heavyweightsToulouse28-21 at Scotstoun. Toulouse, six-time European champions, celebrated Antoine Dupont's first start since sustaining a serious knee injury in March by running in three tries, with the France captain crossing once and Kalvin Gourgues adding two more.Dupont was pulling the stings brilliantly, but the game was turned on its head in the 58th minute when the full-back Josh McKay galloped over to ignite a stunning comeback. Gregor Brown and Sione Tuipulotu crashed over from close range before the hooker Gregor Hiddleston propelled Glasgow in front for the first time when he was at the end of a lineout drive in the 70th minute (pictured). Adam Hastings, the man of the match, nailed all four conversions on a momentous night for the indomitable Warriors.Salefinished strongly to give their campaign liftoff with a 35-14 victory overClermontat the Stade Marcel-Michelin. Responding to their home defeat by Glasgow on the opening night of the competition, the Sharks built a 20-7 half-time lead through tries by Tom O’Flaherty, Marius Louw and Arron Reed. They were then forced to weather a Clermont storm when Lucas Zamoa crossed in the 47th minute and at 23-14 down the fallen European heavyweights were pressing hard to add another score.However, a spirited Sale showed their hunger by scrambling a try through Joe Bedlow and when Alex Wills went over in the 73rd minute it was all over.Craig Casey starred asMunsterswept aside an inexperiencedGloucesterside 31-3 after bursting into life in the second half in Cork. An ugly first half that was full of errors ended with the hosts holding a 7-3 lead after Dan Kelly had crossed in the 21st minute. But with scrum-half Casey acting as the catalyst, they found their rhythm to conjure further tries for Mike Haley, Ruadhan Quinn, Tom Farrell and Tadhg Beirne. Munster finished with a bang and benefited from yellow cards shown to Gloucester’s Jamal Ford-Robinson and Caio James in each half.Bordeaux, the holders, overpoweredScarlets50-21 as they scored five first-half tries at the Stade Chaban-Delmas. The Welsh side had taken an early lead from Fletcher Anderson’s try before Bordeaux hit back through Matthieu Jalibert. Bordeaux then took control with tries from Jefferson Poirot, Gaetan Barlot and a second for Jalibert on the counterattack to secure a bonus point. Although Henry Thomas barged over for Scarlets after 29 minutes, Bordeaux extended their lead to 31-14 when South Africa’s Tiaan Jacobs touched down. In the second half Pablo Uberti touched down in the corner for a sixth try just ahead of the hour. Anderson then scored his second try before Xan Mousques powered over and Louis Bielle-Biarrey touched down too.PA MediaPhotograph: Stuart Wallace/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Saracens rode the early storm. Theo Dan replied in kind 10 minutes later to open their account and Sam Spink claimed a second. Eliot Daly played a wicked chip behind, which Aphele Fassi, making his first start since he injured his ankle inthe Springboks’ famous victory in Wellingtonin September, completely missed. Spink fell gratefully on the loose ball.Suddenly Saracens reversed their fortunes at the scrum. With a penalty at that set piece, Burke put them more than a score ahead with 10 minutes until the break. That ought to have been enough, but Sharks scored twice in the last three minutes of the half.The seesaw contest at the scrum continued. The Sharks won another penalty at the next, sending it to the corner. Andre Esthuizen, captain on his 100th appearance, carried hard off the lineout and George Whitehead found Fassi in plenty of space.Still Saracens held the lead and had seemingly lasted to the break, but Onyeama-Christie tackled Grant Williams late, allowing the Sharks one last tilt. A brilliant pass from Williams was taken by Hooker, who engineered a brilliant pass of his own to send Edwill van der Merwe to the line. The Sharks went in 21-15 ahead.Quick GuideSharks v Saracens teamsShowSharks:Fassi (Jordan Hendrikse 50), van der Merwe, Hooker, Esterhuizen, Mapimpi, Whitehead, G.

Another accidental collision involving the head meant a yellow card for Dan, who caught Makazole Mapimpi high as Theo McFarland tackled the latter. Sharks scored from the next play, Williams sent to the post by Hooker, who had split the Saracens defence.That opened up a 10-point lead, but the visitors would not go away. They sent a series of penalties to the corner and finally forced their way over, the tireless Tom Willis finishing the lineout and drive. Bonus point secured, but Saracens could not repeat the feat in the dying seconds.The result keeps Pool 1 tight. Saracens host Toulouse in the next round, in January, while the Sharks make an even longer journey to Manchester to take on their namesakes from Sale, who won with a bonus point in Clermont Auvergne and sit level on six points with Saracens. Every point is likely to prove valuable. Saracens will settle for theirs in Durban.Explore more on these topicsChampions CupSharksSaracensRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Hansi Flick’s men now sit on 43 points, comfortably clear of second-placedReal Madrid, who have a game in hand and play atAlavéson Sunday.Despite their control of the game, Barcelona struggled to break down Osasuna’s deep defensive block until the 70th minute when Pedri’s incisive pass cut through the visitors’ defence, finding Raphinha in his stride. The Brazilian forward took a controlled touch before unleashing a thunderous strike from the edge of the area, the ball arrowing inside the left post to finally break the deadlock. Raphinha sealed the win in the 86th minute. A deflected cross from Jules Koundé on the right found the Brazilian unmarked at the far post, and he calmly volleyed the ball into an empty net, giving the scoreline a more comfortable look.Atlético Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann came off the bench to guide them to a 2-1 victory over strugglingValencia, helping snap their losing run in La Liga. Koke opened the scoring in the 17th minute, his first league goal in nearly two years, but Lucas Beltrán provided the equaliser for the visitors in the 63rd minute with a stunning strike from the edge of the box. The goal seemed to unsettle Atlético, but Griezmann restored order 12 minutes later, the 34-year-old expertly controlling a long pass from Marc Pubill before hammering a thunderous half-volley into the top corner from close range.View image in fullscreenAntoine Griezmann nets the winner for Atlético Madrid.Photograph: Florencia Tan Jun/Getty ImagesGriezmann told Dazn: “The team was coming off a tough win at PSV in the Champions League midweek.

I’m going to make the most of every minute I get.”Atlético remain fourth and are one point behind third-place Villarreal, who visit Levante on Sunday. Atlético are nine adrift of Barcelona.In the Bundesliga, theBayer Leverkusensubstitute Martin Terrier staked a claim for goal of the season when he scored with a remarkable mid-air back-heeled volley to help his team to a 2-0 victory overColognein the Rhine derby. The 28-year-old broke the deadlock in the 66th minute, connecting with Arthur’s cross, which was behind his back, to score with a back-heeled scorpion kick. Cologne found themselves 2-0 down six minutes later, with Robert Andrich powering in a header from a corner.

It was a more innocent time and, rather than being called The Preacher and The Hitman, they were just Billy and Ricky then.They were still years away from the mass adulation and the desperately lonely end. But, even when reminiscing, The Preacher can’t escape the fact that, this weekend, it will be exactly three months since his lost friend is thought to have taken his own life at the age of 46. On 14 September, Hatton’s body was found at home, in Hyde, six miles from where we sit now in Mossley, on the outskirts of Manchester.View image in fullscreenBilly Graham and Ricky Hatton after victory over Freddie Pendleton in 2001.Photograph: Andy Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersFor weeks there was anoutpouring of grief and lovefor Hatton in Manchester and boxing. The pain continues, privately, among thefighter’s familyand friends. But a national story brought a sobering acceptance that such glory and fervour will not return soon to boxing in this country. It is hard to imagine a fighter today being able toconjure up the magicwhich Hatton once created. Tens of thousands of fans, most of whom considered themselves personal friends of The Hitman, followed the wise-cracking, ferocious urchin-faced boxer from Manchester to Las Vegas with roaring joy.Before then, in mid-December 1999, two years into his pro career, Hatton’s record was a pristine 16‑0. But, rather than thinking about endorsement deals or pay-per-view sales, the boxer and his trainer had history in mind. “We sat on the steps all the time,” Graham says. “All the other fighters had gone and we’d talk about what we were going to do. I told him how good he was and that he’d definitely get in the Hall of Fame.”Last year, 15 months before his death, Hatton was inducted into the InternationalBoxingHall of Fame in Canastota, upstate New York. It completed a 25-year odyssey to reach the pantheon. “You can’t get better than that,” Graham says. “There’ve been loads of great fighters who can’t make the Hall of Fame. You can be a ‘world’ champion or even the undisputed but the Hall of Fame is the ultimate, innit?”The Preacher covers his eyes as tears slip through his fingers. “Can you get me some tissues?” he mumbles. “I’m not a soft fucker. When I get angry, I don’t cry. But I am now …”In 2010 Grahamtook legal actionagainst Hatton and his father, Ray, in a dispute over money owed to the trainer. The Hattons settled out of court. Ricky and his parents, meanwhile,became bitterly estrangedand did not speak to each other for years.View image in fullscreenBilly Graham at his home in Manchester.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianGraham still feels bereft. But he wipes his eyes after I mention a specific bout, in June 2000, when Hatton fought Gilbert Quiros in Detroit. Against Quiros, who was nicknamed The Animal, Hatton was tested like never before. “That fight was the most important fight of Ricky’s life,” Graham says.“Ricky handled nerves better than any fighter I ever had. But he was agitated because he’d found out his girlfriend was pregnant [with his now 24-year-old son Campbell] and he was cutting weight. We went down to the Kronk [the famous Detroit gym] as I wanted to see Quiros. He looked so dangerous on the bag, like Thomas Hearns. Tall, skinny and every shot he landed was really hard.“Nobody else wore body belts [the protector which Graham used to absorb Hatton’s blows in training] then. I was also wearing ridiculous shorts because I’d forgotten to wash my kit. So everyone was laughing at us. We were the only white guys – and Ricky was the whitest kid they’d ever seen. I didn’t want to exhaust Ricky but I said: ‘I want one fantastic round where you show everything and back me up against the ropes.’ They were taking the piss out of us but then, when Ricky started throwing punches, they were whooping:‘Wow! Whoa!’They all fell in love with him.”Graham shudders. “The fight was horrendous. Quiros was scary, landing jabs, uppercuts, body shots. But Ricky never panicked, even after a huge cut above his eye. He came back to the corner after the first round and went: ‘I’ve got double vision and he winded me.’ I said: ‘You’ve got to back him up because this is drastic.’”Hatton tore into Quiros and stopped him with a deadly body shot after a blistering series of combinations. Graham says: “The natural reaction of any young fighter when cut like that is to back off. It’s not normal to walk straight into the tornado. That’s when I really knew how special Ricky was because he came through a terrible situation. The last doubts were gone.”Five years later, in June 2005, Hatton reached the summit of his career when he faced theformidable Kostya Tszyuat the MEN Arena in Manchester. Hatton had won all 38 of his previous contests but the IBF junior-welterweight title showdown between two driven men was framed by a darkness.View image in fullscreenRicky Hatton fights Kostya Tszyu in Manchester in 2005. ‘A lot of people didn’t want that fight because Tszyu was so dangerous’.Photograph: John Gichigi/Getty Images“A lot of people didn’t want that fight because Tszyu was so dangerous,” Graham recalls. “But Ricky was mad for it because he wanted the glory. That was our dream – to be the best in the world. We knew how good Tszyu was and that his style was really dodgy for Ricky. I was confident but I knew Tszyu could knock him out. I went to his house the day before and said: ‘Listen Ricky, you’re going to try to break each other, and it’s going to be really hard.’”When Graham was picked up by a car the following night, he was “absolutely shitting myself. But by the time I got to the dressing room I was completely different. As I walked in, Ricky was shadow boxing in front of the mirror. I started shadow boxing in front of him. Ricky held his nerve like Clint Eastwood in a gunfight.”View image in fullscreenBilly and Ricky celebrate in the ring after the victory over Kostya Tszyu, which was a fight that changed both of their lives.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyGraham adds: “When I was a boxer people used to ask: ‘Are you looking forward to the fight?’ I’d go: ‘No, I’m looking forward to getting it over with.’ When it’s over you think: ‘That was fucking fantastic!’ But it’s horrible until then.”The intensity, he confirms, was “unbelievable. We all have dreams but it’s very rare they come true. Ours did that night.”Tszyu was rescued by his corner before the last round. “I turned around and saw what had happened,” Graham says. “I told Ricky: ‘It’s over. It’s over.’ Oh, the relief on his face. I went: ‘You fucking did it.’ And Ricky said: ‘No,wedid it.’”Graham cries silently, his chest heaving. I try to comfort him, telling him that tears are understandable. “No, they’re not,” the 70-year-old says gruffly. “I’m sick of crying.”The Preacher believes “the lunatics took over the asylum” after their momentous victory. Money and fame rolled in and Hatton, needing to feel loved, revelled in the adoration. But he also drank too much and, as his searing focus diluted, the demons gnawed at him. Hatton had eight more fights in four years but they included two cataclysmic knockout defeats byFloyd Mayweather JrandManny Pacquiao.He slipped into a deep depression, fuelled by alcohol. In 2012,Hatton told me: “It got to a point where I didn’t care if I lived or died. I’d been this working-class hero, this down-to-earth Manchester lad, who people liked so much that 25,000 of them flew to Vegas to watch me fight, singing: ‘There’s only one Ricky Hatton …’ They ended up with another Ricky Hatton altogether – a drunk, crying in the corner of a pub. They used to say: ‘What a fighter! What a cracking lad!’ and then they saw this weeping wreck.”View image in fullscreenManny Pacquiao delivers a devastating second round knockout defeat to Ricky Hatton in 2009.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesHatton’s comeback that same year ended in another stoppage defeat toVyacheslav Senchenko, an unheralded Ukrainian. The next dozen years were difficult but his greatest achievements in the ring meant the Hall of Fame came calling in 2024.Jane Couch, who had defeated the British Boxing of Control in court in 1998 when they refused to grant a professional licence to her or any female fighter, became a hall of famer that same summer. She was a courageous pioneer whosuffered enormously from cruel prejudice. Hatton was one of her staunchest supporters and they shared their personal struggles.It was a beautiful ending in boxing for both of them when theytravelled to Canastota to be honoured. Couch says: “When I got the call from the Hall of Fame I was in shock. I sent Rick a message: ‘We made it.’ Ricky rang me and he went: ‘I can’t fucking believe it.’ We met at Manchester airport and had a Guinness before we got on the plane to New York. We then had to get a car to Canastota and we had a natter for the next seven hours – but I’m good at reading people and I knew he wasn’t right.“A few days later we went for a wander round the grounds of Canastota and he told me the story of him and Billy sitting on the steps of the gym and dreaming of being in the Hall of Fame. I knew they hadn’t spoken much for years but I said: ‘Should I ring Billy now?’ Ricky was like: ‘Er … yeah. Go on.’ I tried but we couldn’t get hold of Billy.View image in fullscreenBilly Graham with the retired boxer and close friend of Ricky Hatton, Jane Couch.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I could tell Ricky was agitated and not well. When he had to go on stage in Canastota he turned it into a comedy show because he liked to make everybody laugh.”A few weeks later Hatton said he had spoken to his old trainer.“That never happened,” Graham tells Couch and me.“Ricky was struggling,” the 57-year-old Couch reminds him.“Of course,” Graham stresses. “I should have been the bigger man. But I couldn’t understand how he was fearless in the ring but would let people manipulate him outside. He couldn’t stand up for himself.”Hatton tried previously to speak to him and Graham looks mortified. Even when we urge him to think of all he did for Hatton over the years, rather than torturing himself for not calling the fighter in the last few months, he is adamant: “There’s no way I can stop feeling guilty.”The day after Hatton died, Graham left a bunch of flowers outside the fighter’s house, with a simple note: “Sorry I wasn’t there for you. Love Billy (The Preacher) x.”View image in fullscreenBilly Graham’s note and flowers laid outside of Ricky Hatton’s home.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAEarlier that devastating Sunday, Matthew Hatton, Ricky’s brother, was at home when the police arrived.“I immediately knew something was wrong and I think I was the first person they told,” Matthew says at his brother’s old gym in Hyde. “My wife, Jenna, was out and [their children] Jack and Lola were still in bed. Jenna and I agreed we’d tell them together but Jack came downstairs. I couldn’t talk and so Jack just asked me: ‘What’s wrong?’ I told him.”Seventeen-year-old Jack and 13-year-old Lola are both boxers. They were close to their uncle and Matthew says: “We went on family holidays together to Tenerife. Ricky wanted to be with us and he felt wanted and needed by Jack so they had a great relationship. Ricky was a coach so he also saw that Jack had plenty of boxing ability.”Reflecting on how his family has coped these past three months, Matthew believes “the boxing has been a distraction because, after a break, Jack and Lola have done so well. We speak about him every day and, while it’s easy to get down, people’s stories about Richard have helped us so much.“But it’s still like a bad dream – even though he’s so well thought of round here you see pictures of him wherever you go. For two weeks I didn’t leave the house much or answer my phone. I only went to see Mum and Dad, Campbell and the family. But I started drifting back into the gym because people depend on me. My own kids need me and they’ve kept me busy.”Matthew, who is 44, was good enough toface Canelo Álvarezin a WBC world title fight in 2011. But he was different to his big brother. “Rick liked being in the spotlight but, as we get older, we fade away and he’d have hated that. He had a big soul and his problems with alcohol – but Ricky crammed more into his life than some people would cram into three lives.”Hope surges through the gym where Jack and Lola are as thoughtful as they are confident. When I ask them to describe Ricky, Lola says, “I never saw him as a legend like the world did. He was just our uncle and we’d go around for tea and on holidays together. I’d describe him as loving and funny.”Jack nods. “You wouldn’t think he was thisbig, famous personfrom the way he acted. He were just funny, down‑to-earth and caring.”Ricky loved the fact that Jack and Lola were boxers. “Definitely,” Jack says. “He was my uncle but on other days he’d be my coach. We miss him a lot.”View image in fullscreenMatthew Hatton with his teenage children Lola and Jack, who are both boxers following in the footsteps of their father and their uncle.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianDo they watch his fights? “Yes,” Lola exclaims. “I remember watching the Kostya Tszyu fight and he was such an entertaining fighter. He was on the front foot constantly.”Lola has won eight out of 10 bouts and her two narrow losses came against a girl on the England team. “She was good,” Matthew says, “but we thought Lola possibly won the last one.”“Next time,” a determined Lola says. Her immediate aim is to box for England while Jack dreams of fighting professionally. He has won three national titles, the most recent beinglast month, and 43 of 48 fights.“Jack asked me to do the amateur badges so I could go in his corner and it’s gone extremely well,” Matthew says. “He’s had 18 fights and won them all since I’ve started working his corner. But I’d be a liar if I said I didn’t get nervous.”How does Lola feel when watching her brother? “If he’s fighting someone good, I’m a bit nervous. But I don’t doubt him. He always wins.”“I like that answer,” Jack says with a grin.“We were on holiday in Tenerife,” their father remembers, “and someone wanted a picture of Jack as he’s quite well-known already. I started laughing when Lola said: ‘I want some of this.’ We’ve never really encouraged the boxing. But we’re a sporting family, with my boxing background and their mum swam for Great Britain. Jack used to tell me he hated boxing. I thought: ‘Yeah!’ But we started doing a little in lockdown to keep fit. He got into it and then joined an amateur gym. Lola’s interest started when she saw how well Jack was doing.”Asked if they feel the weight of the Hatton name, Jack and Lola answer sensibly by stressing that they can just do their best. “Ricky was such a fantastic fighter and character that I suffered criticism in my career,” Matthew says. “You get great opportunities but with it comes pressure. At first I didn’t want them to box because of that pressure but, now they’re doing it, they’re going to do it properly. I’m quite tough because people always perform better against them. They want that Hatton name on their record. That’s got to push these two on in difficult moments. But they really embrace it.“When Jack won his latest national title we took a coach [of supporters] and everyone enjoyed it. People are itching to get behind Jack. It will be the same with Lola. I think there are going to be some really good nights ahead.”View image in fullscreenRicky Hatton at the Mottram and Hattersley ABC boxing gym in 1999.Photograph: John Gichigi/Getty ImagesThere was a special night last month as, on his way to that title as National Boys club champion in the 57kg division, Jack won two fights in Fleetwood, Couch’s home town. Couch, who organised the show, says: “It seemed fitting for Ricky that we were all together – Matthew, Jack, Lola, me and Billy.”Graham trained Matthew for a considerable period. And Couch, who headed Hatton Promotions for a spell, helped promote Matthew to the European welterweight title in 2010. “I love Matthew,” she says. “He’s such a good guy and went straight over to Billy. They shook hands, hugged and had a good conversation. Then Jack and Lola met Billy. It was beautiful and Billy told Jack his body shots reminded him of [the light-heavyweight] Callum Smith. I loved seeing Billy look happy again.”The Preacher smiles. “It was great. Jack and Lola were fantastic and I was proud they wanted photographs with me.”As the sadness ebbs a little I ask Couch how she will remember Ricky. “As my friend,” she says.Couch plays me the last voicemail he sent her. The boxer’s familiar voice echoes from her phone and, after a rambling but grateful message to his old pal,Ricky Hattonsays a last few words: “Hope you’re all right, sweetheart.

That is, when it comes to boosting the economyEspecially not when Whitehall is dominated by a single activity – procrastination. That is, when it comes toboosting the economy.Time after time, a department produces a document setting out a problem and a framework for dealing with it, often winning cross-party praise (this summer’s industrial strategybeing a case in point) only to freeze when considering what should happen on the ground.And then, after months of delay, a quick decision is made that ends up being harmful.The new business rates regime is the latest example. Since the budget last month, pubs and hotels have been calculating how much they will pay from April under a regime pieced together by Treasury officials without apparently being road tested.Small, independent pub chains will be among the worst hit, with some saying the rise in business rates will be 500% or more for an individual pub.Signs have begun appearing outside local taverns –200 and counting– barring Labour MPs with the #taxedout slogan.The campaign, which originated at the Larder House pub in Bournemouth, is a painful reminder of the delicate ecosystem in publand and the difference between massive chains such as Wetherspoons and the much smaller local pub groups, often operating on wafer-thin profit margins.James Fowler, owner of the Larder House, called the changes a “devastating blow”.He was joined by Andy Lennox, owner and managing director of the Fired Up Collective, which operates three pubs and three restaurants in and around Dorset.Lennox told the Caterer magazine: “One of my pubs, The Old Thatch, is Dorset’s best pub having won pub of the year, I employ 200 people and turnover is good – we’re not in a bad place, but we’re just not making any money.”He says his business rates are poised to increase 126% by 2028. “We took £1.5m last year and made £50,000 – what’s the point?”View image in fullscreenFarmers say the tax on inheritance tax changes will be too onerous and many farms will be sold.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianIt’s the same Whitehall mindset that identifies farmers as a legitimate target for extra tax.Rachel Reeves wantsfarmers to pay a new inheritance tax (IHT) levyfrom next April that in many cases denies them passing on the land to their children.Despite a tweak in the recent budget, farmers say the IHT changes will be too onerous and many farms will be sold, most likely to private equity firms or foreign businesses.It should go without saying thatfarmers are different. A report by an independent body or even a conversation with the farming community would have revealed why it is not like other industries. For one thing, like pub owners, they can occupy expensive land and yet operate on slim margins.It is the same for family businesses. A panicked grab for cash in the chancellor’s first budget meantfamily-owned businessesmust also pay IHT after four decades of not paying any.The previous justification for not paying IHT was that the assets were worthless as long as the owners kept the business going. If the assets were put up for sale, then capital gains tax would apply. Without a sale, the assets were passed through the generations.Understandably, family businesses have proved reluctant to make much noise about their predicament. The cost of living crisis means that special pleading by a group with significant paper wealth is not a good look.All these tax increases should be reviewed and their effects reduced. Otherwise, much of British farming and the family business sector will be shut down or sold off to foreign interests.This trend is already under way, but is likely to accelerate from next April when the new taxes take effect.Starmer’s advisers want to put every decision through an election MRI scanner to decide whether it is a vote winnerOne reason procrastination has become such a problem is the Labour leadership’s two-term, 10-year project, which allows for endless meetings and delayed decision-making. This contradicts the short-term demands of Keir Starmer’s advisers, who want to put every decision through an election MRI scanner to decide whether it is a vote winner in next year’s local elections and the 2029 general election.With these cross-currents sweeping ministers this way and that, almost on a daily basis, it becomes difficult to reflect on proposals, checking for the unintended consequences.It’s possible the economy will hand Labour a new year present and the recent run of poor economic data transforms 0.1% monthly contractions into 0.1% increases.Yet, for the long-term health of the economy, the inherent contradiction of procrastination and electionitis will mean that the industrial strategy, most of the proposed new towns, local government reform and much public investment remains stuck in the Whitehall mud. And a series of poorly targeted taxes will, in the meantime, hit British businesses, which could do without the extra punishment.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsViewpoint columnHospitality industryLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

At times, in his evasiveness and discomfort, he has looked like that most un-Farage of things: a nervous politician, anxious not to say the wrong word.Last week, however, he angrily returned to his preferred posture: brimming with indignation at the moral hypocrisy of elites. He lashed out at the BBC’s “double standards” for indulging the allegations, when the broadcaster itself showed racist jokes and skits back in those days. Farage announced it was not he who should apologise, but apparently the BBC that should say sorry “for virtually everything you did throughout the 1970s and 1980s”.This was undoubtedly Farage’s most Trumpian moment yet, and the reaction from many commentators on the left and centre was shock and ridicule. His dismissal of the many credible allegations was unsettling; his reference to a “lower grade” BBC journalist was nasty; he appeared thin-skinned, incoherent, almost deranged; everyone seemed to agree that Farage should have simply said sorry and sought to move on. But in this understandable distaste, it was also possible to detect a certain complacency: a belief that Farage had overstepped the mark and would suffer the consequences, that any behaviour deemed “Trumpian” was a losing strategy. Farage has every reason to believe that such assumptions are false.Despite (or because of) the blowback, Farage probably considers his rant a success. It put him back on the attack, transgressing social norms and setting the news agenda. The rightwing media sphere, which Farage knows he can rely on, lapped it up. The Daily Mail splashed the story on Friday’s front page with the words: “Reform UK leader turns tables on broadcaster”. Isabel Oakeshott, TalkTV’s international editor (whose partner is Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader),saluted Farage’s righteous grievancewith the BBC’s “outrageous” bias. Meanwhile GB News, Farage’s personal national broadcaster,shared his ranton social media with the tagline: “Nigel Farage destroys the BBC”.Farage chose his target well: even putting aside the BBC’s crisis-afflicted state, the broadcaster has been a bugbear among conservatives since its inception. But the form of his attack was even more revealing than the target. While he did briefly deny making any offensive statements at school “in any malicious or nasty way” –he also producedan anonymous letter from a Jewish Dulwich classmate who said that despite the “macho tongue-in-cheek schoolboy banter”, he had never heard Farage racially abuse anyone – the main purpose of the tirade was to imply that everyone was as bad as each other. So even if he did say things like “Gas the Jews” or “That’s the way back to Africa” – which he didn’t, or at least not with malice, not that he can remember or that it matters – why are his accusers pretending that they are any better than him?3:51Nigel Farage demands apology from BBC over racism allegations – videoThey are either complicit in the allegations, like the BBC, or – in another of Farage’s favoured rebuttals – “politically motivated”, like his former classmates who have spoken out. In the same vein, the Spectatorfollowed up this weekwith a defence of Farage that stated “all schoolboys were once obsessed with Hitler” and “so even if the teenage Farage made the sort of remarks attributed to him – and he has denied doing so – he would be entirely typical of his class and generation.”This strikes at the essence of Farage’s political style, and why he is unlikely to ever apologise. He would rather a country where every accusation of prejudice seems fraudulent. To apologise would be to seek forgiveness, and thus to acknowledge a higher moral authority – whereas his liberating promise to his supporters is that no one has the right to look down on them. Farage knows that it is cynicism and contempt – contempt for the major parties, contempt for the mainstream media and for metropolitan elites – that fuels his rise.Farage’s degradations of the public sphere are akin to Trump’s, but they follow older precedents, too. Hannah Arendtonce arguedthat totalitarianism thrives not through cunning lies and gullible masses, but by making cynicism pervasive – by cultivating “the essential conviction” that “politics is a game of cheating”. Once this conviction spreads, brazen lies and immorality could be cast as brave and virtuous, because they exposed “the duplicity upon which the existing society seemed to rest”. Arendt noted how the leaders of these movements revelled in allegations of hypocrisy: it was part of “the old game ofépater les bourgeois”, shocking the middle classes, what we might refer to now as “owning the libs”.A braver Tory leader than Badenoch would dare to call out Farage’s bogus patriotism | Rafael BehrRead moreApplied to Farage’s politics, this insight suggests that he does not want to be innocent: he wants everyone to look guilty. He does not need to be believable; he needs no one to be credible. He does not need to provide hope, only to sow cynicism and contempt. No wonder that Reform, despite its small size, seems to attract so many unseemly characters and allegations. Hardly a fortnight had passed since the news of its former deputy leader in Wales being sentenced to jail foraccepting Russian bribeswhen a former Reform councillor told the police theparty spent beyond legal limitsin its campaign to win Farage’s seat in Clacton (an allegation that the party denies). If politics is a game of cheating, why play by the rules?Farage knows anything that deepens thefeelings of contempt and nihilism in Britain helps his cause. His questions right now won’t be whether voters care about the school allegations or alleged electoral impropriety, but whether he at least appears distinct from the major political parties that they disdain. The task for Farage’s opponents is not only to sustain scrutiny on his character – the nature of which we have long known – but, more importantly, to find a vision of the country that challenges the nihilism on which Farage feeds.Samuel Earle is a writer based in London and the author ofTory Nation: The Dark Legacy of the World’s Most Successful Political PartyExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionReform UKBBCcommentShareReuse this content"

Is it really his best child-rearing hack?Sat 13 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 09.01 ESTShareFather’s little helperJust how does he do it all? Every time I look at the news, Sam Altman’s face seems to be staring back at me. The CEO of OpenAI,a well-known workaholic, is constantly in the public eye explaining how AI will probablycure cancerand transform thesocial contractand generally change the world. While doing all that he’s reportedly gearing up for OpenAI to file for a stock market listingvaluingthe company at $1tn, as soon as next year. And he’s also a new dad: Altman and his husband, Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their first child into the world in February. So he’s got a lot on his plate.The billionaire does have a little bit of help though, and he’s not afraid to admit it. On Monday Altman made hislate-night debuton Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show, where he waxed lyrical about how helpful ChatGPT has been in helping him raise his son.“I cannot imagine having gone through figuring out how to raise a newborn withoutChatGPT,” Altman gushed to Fallon. Perhaps a little self-awareness crept in at that moment because he added: “Clearly, people did it for a long time – no problem ... but I have relied on it so much.”How exactly does Altman use ChatGPT to help him figure out “how to raise a newborn?” Well, he told Fallon, once heaskedthe large language model: “Why does my kid stop dropping his pizza on the floor and laughing? [sic]” Altman didn’t explain what ChatGPT answered, but I imagine it was along the lines of: because he is a kid and that’s what kids do.Another moment when ChatGPT helped Altman along his parenting journey, we learned, was when he felt a little insecure after another parent boasted about their six-month-old crawling. Altman told Fallon that he then ran to the bathroom and asked AI if it was “okay” that his son wasn’t crawling yet; ChatGPT offered some soothing words of wisdom.Fallon is not a journalist. His job isn’t to ask tough questions, it’s to cackle every few minutes and slap his hands on his desk. Still, it would have been nice if the late night host had spent just a couple of minutes asking one of the most powerful men in the world a few tough questions instead of just lettingAltman do PRfor himself and OpenAI.He could have asked Altman, for example, about his appearance on theOpenAI podcastearlier this year, when the CEO noted that people have a “very high degree of trust in ChatGPT, which is interesting because, like, AI hallucinates. It should be the tech that you don’t trust that much”.And if Fallon didn’t want to go deep into the thorny issues of AI hallucinations andAI psychosis, he could have at least investigated Altman’s child-rearing arrangements a little more. Fallon could have asked Altman, for example, if his husband did all the caregiving, or if he happened to have a nanny.Altman and his husband have never made any public comments about having a nanny, to be clear. And they are, of course, entitled to keep their private life private. However, considering the fact that Altman hasgushedabout how “kid-pilled” he is and how “everybody should have a lot of kids”, I think it might be helpful for him to also point out the ways in which his particular experience of child-rearing might be different to that of the hoi polloi.Altman and his husband had their child via surrogate, for example. It’s easy to be gung ho about how everyone should be having lots of kids when you don’t have to do any of the carrying and delivering. It’s easy to be breezy about pumping out children when you’re not the one taking on any of the risks that pregnancy and childbirth involve. And while pregnancy alwayscomes with risks, research has found surrogates have a greater chance of bothphysicalandmental complicationsthan women who carry their own offspring.While Altman may not be able to imagine figuring out how to raise a newborn without ChatGPT, I’m fairly confident he would be able to find a way to manage. What I have a harder time imagining, however, is a world in which high-powered executives (including female executives) would be able to do their jobs and have children without a lot of hired domestic help. There’s nothing wrong with hiring help, of course. What’s problematic is pretending that all this labour – which tends to beunderpaid, underappreciated, and disproportionately performed by women – doesn’t exist.Gaza newborn mortality rates up 75% compare with pre-war levelsThat’saccording to figures releasedon Wednesday by Unicef, which looked at the number of babies dying on the day they were born in Gaza during the three months before the “ceasefire”. Meanwhile, Israel is still restricting essential items from entering Gaza and there have been reports that at least one child has died because of theextreme coldin the last few days.Gwen Stefani receives backlash for promoting ‘anti-abortion’ prayer appThe pop star recently shared a collaborative post on social media for Hallow, a Catholic prayer subscription service which has receivedfundingand support from the likes ofJD Vanceand Peter Thiel. This hasn’t gone down well. The influencer Matt Bernstein, for example, called out Stefani in a videowhich notedthat there are numerous anti-abortion prayers on the app, including one that asked to bless women “pregnant from acts of rape and incest” who are considering abortion.Democrats publish more photos from Jeffrey Epstein estateThe latestphoto dumpincludes new pictures of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.Eleven women jailed in Texas allege rampant sexual abuseThe Guardianspoke with six of the womenalleging abuse at FMC Carswell in Texas, who said sexual assault is common and ignored by staff. “Coming into the system, whether you’re guilty or not, it’s like you’re punished over and over again,” said one incarcerated woman. “It’s like human trafficking behind prison walls.”Bestselling author Sophie Kinsella dies of a brain tumour age 55Kinsella’s “deceptively light” books cheered up millions of people.

What’s yours?Jonathan Nunn is the author of London Feeds ItselfSat 13 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 14.01 ESTShareAlmost 24 years ago, a small British food magazine called Restaurantassembled an all-star panel– made up of Gordon Ramsay, John Torode, Aldo Zilli and 65 other food guys – to adjudicate on the world’s most stupid question: what is the best restaurant on the planet? It didn’t matter that no judge had been to all the restaurants on the shortlist, or that two of the judges happened to be Jeremy Clarkson and Roger Moore – what the editors of Restaurant understood is that peoplelovea list, and if you order a group of restaurants from 50-1 and throw a party, people might take it seriously.“This could run and run,” the editors wrote in their intro, half hoping. They were right. Within two decades, The World’s 50 Best Restaurants had gone from what critic Jay Rayner described as a “terribly successful marketing exercise” to an insurgent alternative to the ossified Michelin Guide, solidifying the reputations of El Bulli, the Fat Duck and then Noma as the “world’s best restaurant”.Since then, we – by which I mean food writers, journalists and general punters – have become obsessed with restaurant lists. On the premium end of things, you have institutions like The World’s 50 Best and Michelin itself, which will announce the starred restaurants for its Saudi Arabia guide next week. On the other, there is – well, everything else: The Best 22 Date Night Restaurants in London Right Now, The Hot 50: the most popular Mancheseter restaurants and bars, The 17 best restaurants in Glasgow you simply have to try andits sequel, The 18 best restaurants in Glasgow you simply have to try.During the 2010s, the list overtook the review as the main form of restaurant writing, taking advantage of internet search-engine optimisation, publications’ smaller budgets, and the alliance of journalism with PR, which allowed writers to list restaurants they hadn’t paid for, or necessarily been to. The success of the list, and the decline in criticality, has precipitated restaurant writing’s downfall. Today, one of the most powerful forces for restaurant recommendations is the Instagram duoTopjaw, whose questions to chefs – “best restaurant in London?”, “best curry in Manchester?, “most underrated restaurant in New York?’ – are nothing more than the list cleverly updated for short-form video.If it sounds as if I consider myself above all this then I can reassure you: I absolutely do not. I started out writing restaurant lists myself for the now-defunct site Eater London, mainly concentrating on London’s outer boroughs, where restaurants tend to serve their own neighbourhoods and not get included on lists. This week, for my own publication Vittles, I published a larger, even more ridiculouslist of 99 restaurantsthat took me two years to eat through, write and whittle down from about 3,000 meals eaten out over the last seven years. I could tell you that it’s an attempt to connect this vital part of the London hospitality industry with its more central scene of restaurants – the ones with Michelin stars, private dining rooms and, in one case, its own private island – and accurately reflect the bewildering diversity of London’s food culture. But really, I just like writing lists and people love reading them – and especially, arguing about them.The central argument of a “best of” list contains a problem, one that I kept running into while writing my own list: what do we really mean by “best”? At some point, the World’s 50 Best moved away from its eclectic first list, which included shepherd’s pie and ketchup at the Ivy alongside a restaurant inside a giant fish tank in Dubai, and started to laud the same type of restaurant. In the end, it was itself accused of becoming a homogenising andunrepresentativeforce for bad. But when we talk about “best”, why can’t we meaningfully compare, say, the Ritz to a fish and chip shop? Whose idea of what “quality” means do we deem to be important? Is it possible to acknowledge that while the work that goes into the creation of a tasting menu and the work that goes into nourishing a community may not be the same, they do have an equivalent importance and require a similar level of skill?A new start after 60: I moved on to a boat, fell in love – then opened my own restaurantRead moreI’ve loved discussing these questions with people. Recently, I have been asking everyone I know what they consider to be the five best restaurants where they live without worrying about what a “best restaurant” looks like. The answers have never been the same, or given for the same reasons. It might be the restaurant they take a loved one to on a special occasion, or the restaurant that they eat at so often they don’t need to order. It might be a place that has the capacity to transform an ingredient into something completely new, or a place that makes the same thing over and over again, aiming for perfection. When I asked my dad for his list, he pointed to Ognisko, the Polish restaurant he had his birthday at, Survivor, his go-to Jamaican takeaway, and a pie and mash shop which reminds him of his childhood. Each one, I think, is an equally valid interpretation of “best”. Each one reflects an important experience ofLondon.This is why my favourite restaurant lists tend not to be the ones like Michelin or World’s 50 Best that have been written by committee, but the personal ones. A personal list shows up the inherent ridiculousness of the enterprise – it can no longer even fake a veneer of objectivity. There is the late Richard Collin’s New Orleans Underground Gourmet, which wrote about French fine dining next to po’ boys and eventually got embroiled in a city-wide scandal over Collin’s evaluation of a spaghetti sauce. There are Jonathan Gold’s lists, which, for a whole generation, via Gold’s opinions, defined the contours of Los Angeles dining. These lists tend to be passionate, strongly argued and completely unreasonable – they are there, hopefully, not there to cement a fake consensus, but to sharpen our own sense of what we believe quality means. Ultimately, the best thing a list can do is to force us to make lists of our own.Jonathan Nunn is a food and city writer based in London who co-edits the magazine Vittles.

Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few? … From Denmark. Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people. But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”Referring to the US representative Ilhan Omar’s hijab as a “little turban”, Trump continued: “She should get the hell out. Throw her the hell out.” His supporters erupted in chants of: “Send her back.”The rant is abhorrent and factually incorrect, but it does hold one truth – the Trump administration’s vision for the United States is one of a white Christian nation. And the path to accomplish it is through the exclusion and removal of all who do not fit that vision – in other words, throughethnic cleansing.To that end, Trump and his acolytes haveincreasinglybeen using the term “reverse migration” and even proposed an “office of remigration”. The idea, borrowed from white supremacists in Europe, understands immigrants as an inherent threat to the identity of what they imagine to be “white” nations. Immigrants’ forcible and systematic removal – remigration – is envisioned as a way to “restore” that whiteness.This vision of an ethnically cleansed, white US is being enacted in policy.Contrary to Trump’s ranting, the United Statesdidin fact restrictadmission to only include white, European immigrants by law through much of the past century. Racial quotas were only abolished through Black activism and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s.Whether immigrants are welcome or not has always been an issue of racial inclusion in this settler colonial state – it is the mechanism by which we decide who belongs in this nation.Today, the Trump administration is closing immigration pathways by which people enter the US, and gain status when here. Asylumis dead. Resettlement is cancelled except, tellingly, forwhite Afrikaners. Temporary protective status, which protects people from deportation due to turbulence in their nations of origin, has been or will be cancelled for Haitians, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Syrians and others, leavinghundreds of thousandsof people deportable to countries the US recognizes as unsafe. Fees for all immigration processes havesharply increased.Meanwhile, the Trump administration is exploring how to block pathways to citizenship for people who qualify. Citizenship ceremonies are beingcancelledas people are being pulled out of line while waiting to take their oaths. Mohsen Mahdawi was detained on 14 April at hiscitizenship appointmentfor his participation in a civil pro-Palestinian protest at his university.Trump issued an executive order tocancel birthright citizenship– the mechanism by which formerly enslaved Black Americans became citizens – that has made its way to thesupreme court. And he has said he would “absolutely”denaturalizeAmerican citizens if he could.While this commentary seems bombastic, it isnot without precedentin United States history, where in the first half of the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of people weredenaturalizeddue to politicized accusations of fraud, lacking “good moral character” or having “racial ineligibility” (ie not being white).These current policies sit against the backdrop of the grotesque expansion of the mass deportation system. In September, two months after the so-called Big Beautiful Bill was passed – adding $75bn to ICE’s budget, giving it a bigger budget than all butseven of the world’s militaries, and making it thehighest-fundedlaw enforcement agency in the federal government – the supreme court authorized ICE officers toracially profilepeople.This makes every person of color, regardless of status, a potential target. And, in a nation that remainssegregated by race, where people of color often live apart from white people, ICE is terrorizing communities of color.US citizens have also been caught up in ICE raids: members of theNavajo and Mescaleronations; a Black man in Chicago with hisbirth certificate in his backpack; a20-year-old in Minnesotaof Somali origin who kept trying to show ICE officers his passport, only to be forced by officers to undergo a facial scan to prove his citizenship. The investment of millions of dollars in cybersurveillance technology – which can hack phones in a certain radius and uses AI to recognize faces and places – presents a violation of privacy for every single person in this country regardless of race or status.Meanwhile, the rhetoric that once justified deportations has been revealed as a lie. Data shows that the vast majority of immigrants detained haveno criminal record. Concerns of the fiscal burden that immigrants pose (never actuallyborne out in data) are shown for their absurdity when Trump says there is “no price tag” on his mass deportation agenda. Somalisadded $8bnto Minnesota’s economy, though their contributions should have no bearing on their humanity.There seems to be joy in the cruelty, when Trump trolls “I love the smell of deportations in the morning” as we watch men and women dragged from the arms of their children, sobbing. Many of them are sent to privatized detention centers rife withhuman rights violationsthat turn a profit on human lives –incentivizedto limit healthcare, food and comfort to detainees to maximize shareholder profit.But it is not just through the physical brutalization that this ethnic cleansing is being executed. There is also violence in systematic disinvestment that disproportionately cuts essential lifelines for Black and brown people. The Big Beautiful Bill rolls back social spending, denying millions of peoplehealthcare coverage, food benefits and welfare benefits. It enacts policies that exacerbate burdens of student debt. It raises the budgets of police and carceral facilities.The idea that those who cannot be removed should be subjugated is alive in our academic institutions, through attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion, on students’ right to dissent, on affirmative action.The strength of this imperfect nation, which has never repaired for its original sins of genocide and enslavement, is in the incredible diversity of people who make it great, in the freedoms it claims to uphold – of life, liberty and justice. This ethnic cleansing can only be accomplished through the destruction of all of the above, in ways that touch the lives of each and every person within the nation, American or not.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionTrump administrationUS constitution and civil libertiesDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

I was curious about what was sparking his renewed interest in an activity he hadn’t thought about since he was 12. His response: “The ban.”I was thrilled. As far as I was concerned, Australia’sworld-first social media lawaimed at preventing children under 16 from accessing social media apps was already a success. But this week, as the ban took effect, my son wasn’t so sure. Access to his accounts remained largely unchanged. Many of his friends were in the same position. Across the country, the rollout has been uneven, as social media companies try to work out how to verify kids’ ages.When the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, spoke about the ban this week, he warned there would be teething issues. However,Albanese’s main message was to kids.He encouraged them to spend the school holidays outside or reading, instead of scrolling on their phones. The comments were popular with parents but the PM’s TikTok account was spammed by younger people letting him know they werestill online. Teenage content creators on social media platforms wasted no time making parody videos about older people’s earnest hopes that the ban would make kidsgo outsideandtouch grass.The jokes tapped into one of my core concerns. I am a gen X parent whose children have come of age in the era of the smartphone. My partner and I monitored screentime with our kids, but we were totally unprepared for the effects technology would have on them. Like many parents, we resent the time and attention big tech companies have stolen from our family and we see the government’s move as an opportunity to wrest control back from big, powerful companies.But in the days since the ban took effect, I have noticed that protecting our kids is not the only agenda we are pursuing. Many of my generation seem to want to go back to the good old days when childhood in Australia was dominated by sun, surf and backyard cricket. I sympathise with the sentiment, but I am also mindful that this idyllic vision of childhood only existed for some.The majority of Australians are first- and second-generation migrants. Many of us live far from the sandy beaches and tree-lined avenues of the country’s cities, in places where green space is shrinking even as temperatures rise, and where traffic congestion poses a risk to children on the street. In the country Australia is today, scrolling is not the only obstacle to children’s capacity to play.Despite these wider social challenges, there is broad agreement that children need protection, and that social media and tech companies must be more robustly regulated. Many parents are relieved the government is tackling the problem.Australia’s willingness to take on some of the largest tech companies on the planet isn’t surprising. There is a strong culture here tied to taking precautions to reduce risk. This includes well-funded public health campaigns on everything from sunscreen to cycle helmets to learning how to swim. In 2012, the government defeated numerous legal challenges by big tobacco companies to pass aworld-first lawmandating the removal of branding colours and designs from cigarette packets. During the Covid pandemic, the country adopted some of the mostrestrictive and successful measuresin the world.In times of crisis, trust in government is high. Support soars when Australians perceive an external threat and the fight against big tech companies is seen in this light. It is no surprise then that77% of Australians support the ban.And as a country we can afford the fight. Despite the nation’s small population, it operates with the kind of swagger that comes with wealth. Until the pandemic in 2020, Australia had experienced29 consecutive yearsof economic growth. And while wages have stagnated and the cost of living is on the rise, it is still a wealthy place that can afford to pick fights it thinks it can win.While there is strong support, the law has vocal critics who have called for tighter regulation of social media companies, rather than prohibitions on individuals. Advocacy groups working with children were dismayed that onlyone daywas set aside for public consultations on the law, leaving no time for real consideration of how the ban might affect children’s ability to connect with each other. In the broader child rights sector, there have been pointed critiques about the hypocrisy of protecting children under 16 from online harms while doing nothing to address the fact that Australia has one of the lowest ages of criminal responsibility in the world. Children as young as10 years oldcan be charged with crimes and sent to prison, andIndigenous childrenare over-imprisoned in this group, making up 70% of those in youth facilities.Despite these criticisms, Australians have decided to make a start, in large part because as Australia’s esafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, has argued, there is no“fair fight”between children and social media algorithms. The country recognises that the playing field is stacked egregiously against kids. The ban – as imperfect as it is – gives parents and communities a starting point for limiting the reach and power of social media giants.It’s already playing out in interesting ways. After school on the first day of the ban I told my son that even though his accounts hadn’t been deactivated, using them was now considered illegal. He smiled, put the phone down and went for a bike ride. When he got back he told me he knew the law was aimed at the companies, not the kids, and that no one was going to check. I looked at him sheepishly. “It’s OK,” he said. “I felt like a ride anyway.” I took the win.Sisonke Msimang is the author of Always Another Country: A Memoir of Exile and Home (2017) and The Resurrection of Winnie Mandela (2018)Explore more on these topicsSocial media banOpinionSocial mediaChildrenDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Cambodia announced it had suspended all border crossings with Thailand.Thai forces carried out strikes, including with fighter jets, while Cambodia fired rocket barrages along the border area on Saturday. The Thai army announced that at least two civilians had been seriously injured by Cambodian fire while running to a bunker.‘It’s not going to end’: Thai evacuees fear for future after fresh clashes with CambodiaRead moreThe latest round of fighting was triggered by aclash on 7 Decemberthat wounded two Thai soldiers and appeared to violate an earlier ceasefire promoted by Trump that ended similar fighting in July. More thantwo dozen people have reportedly been killed over the past week while more than half a millionhave been displaced on both sides of the border.The Thai military said that 15 of its soldiers had died, and estimated that 165 Cambodian military personnel had been killed. Cambodia did not announce any military losses, but said at least 11 civilians had been killed and more than six dozen wounded.Trump’s ceasefire announcement on Friday was met with a tepid reaction by leaders from both countries.Thailand’s foreign minister, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, said Trump’s remarks did not reflect “an accurate understanding of the situation”.“We regret and we’re disappointed that some of the points made by President Trump have bearing upon the feeling of the Thai people, Thailand, because we consider ourselves – we are proud, in fact – to be the oldest treaty ally of the United States in the region,” he said.Cambodia has not commented on Trump’s announcement.Trump announced the agreement to restart the July ceasefire in a social media post after calls with Anutin and the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Manet.“They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me, and them, with the help of the Great Prime Minister ofMalaysia, Anwar Ibrahim,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday.But neither the Thai nor the Cambodian leaders referenced the agreement in statements issued after the call, and Anutin said there was no ceasefire and that peace would depend on Cambodia ending its attacks first. When asked about Trump’s claim, Thailand’s foreign ministry referred reporters to his statement.View image in fullscreenThe Thai prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, speaks during a press conference after his call with Donald Trump.Photograph: Chanakarn Laosarakham/AFP/Getty ImagesIn a statement on Saturday on Facebook, Manet did not mention the ceasefire, but instead referred to the call with Trump and said Cambodia continued to seek a peaceful resolution in line with an earlier agreement signed in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, in October.Manet also said he had advised the US and Malaysia to use their intelligence gathering capabilities to “verify which side fired first” in the latest round of fighting.Anutin said Thai forces had retaliated against Cambodian military targets.“Thailand will continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people,” he said in a Facebook post.What’s behind the Thailand-Cambodia clashes – explained in 30 secondsRead moreThe original ceasefire in July was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through after pressure from Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. It was formalised in more detail at the October regional meeting in Malaysia that Trump attended.The Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, urged both countries to once again cease hostilities on Saturday. Cambodia’s prime minister endorsed the Malaysian proposal, which included having Malaysia and the US monitor the ceasefire. Anutin, however, denied that Thailand had even entered into negotiations over the plan.Despite the deal, the two countries carried on a bitter propaganda war and minor cross-border violence continued.The roots of the Thai-Cambodian border conflictlie in a history of enmity over competing territorial claims. These claims largely stem from a 1907 map created while Cambodia was under French colonial rule, which Thailand maintains is inaccurate. Tensions were aggravated by a 1962 international court of justice ruling that awarded sovereignty to Cambodia, which still riles many Thais.Thailand has used jet fighters to carry out airstrikes on what it says are military targets. Cambodia has deployed BM-21 rocket launchers with a range of 30-40km (19-25 miles). The rockets are imprecise have a wide area of impact, with most landing in areas that have already been evacuated.According to data collected by public broadcaster ThaiPBS, at least six of the Thai soldiers killed were hit by rocket shrapnel.The Thai army’s north-eastern regional command said on Thursday that some residential areas and homes near the border had been damaged by BM-21 rockets.It also said it had destroyed a tall crane on a hilltop held by Cambodia where the ancient Preah Vihear temple is located, because it allegedly held electronic and optical devices used for military command and control purposes.A Thai warship also shelled the south-western Cambodian province of Koh Kong on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaAsia PacificDonald TrumpMalaysianewsShareReuse this content"

Haemorrhage is a known cause of birth-related trauma in women.Many women bleed after delivering their baby, usually without causing concern. But the possibility of a mother losing an unusually large amount of blood is a known risk of childbirth. It isthe leading causeof maternal death worldwide and causes one in 14 or 7% of maternal deaths in the UK.“The growing risk to mothers of suffering serious and potentially fatal bleeding following childbirth is terrifying”, said Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson.“We know that severe blood loss contributes to nearly one in 10 maternal deaths [in the UK]. Every birth involves risk, but rising rates of these incidents will be a source of real fear for women and families across the country.“It’s completely heartbreaking to see just how many families experience unacceptable injuries and trauma at a time that should be full of excitement and joy.”The findings are the latest evidence to suggest that the quality and safety of NHS maternity care are declining.Inthe initial reportof her government-commissioned investigation into maternity care, the inquiry chair, Valerie Amos, said last week that some mothers were receiving unacceptable care and that had led to “tragic consequences”.Morgan said: “We already have a situation where the Care Quality Commission says thattwo-thirds of maternity unitsare not safe enough. Maternitydeaths are up. The risk of women sufferinga serious tearhas risen.“And now we have this shocking news that there is a growing risk of postpartum haemorrhage.”Obstetricians and gynaecologists said the rise was the result of childbirth becoming more complicated in recent years. Experts have blamed that on obesity and more older women having babies, as both significantly increase the chances of complications and the need for medical intervention.“The reported increase in postpartum haemorrhage is concerning”, said Prof Asma Khalil, a consultant obstetrician and maternal-foetal specialist and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.“But it must be understood in the context of births becoming more clinically complex. More women are entering pregnancy and birth with factors that can raise the risk of heavy bleeding, for example high blood pressure and a higher body weight, though most will not experience a haemorrhage.”The Liberal Democrats are urging the health secretary, Wes Streeting, to draw up a “maternity rescue plan” to bring all units up to what the CQC judges to be a good standard.The failure to implement recommendations made by an array of previous maternity inquiries is an insult to families harmed by poor care, they say in a letter signed by 60 of the party’s MPs.Lady Amos said last week that it was “staggering” that many of the 750 recommendations made over the last decade had not been put into practice.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson declined to comment directly on the Lib Dems’ findings.They said only that:“As Baroness Amos set out this week, too many families have been let down by maternity and neonatal services, with devastating consequences.“That’s why the secretary of state has ordered a rapid review of maternity services and will chair a new national maternity and neonatal taskforce to address deep-rooted issues.”Explore more on these topicsHospitalsChildbirthNHSHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

There was no immediate confirmation fromHamasor medics that Saed was among the dead.“In response to the activation of a Hamas explosive device that wounded our forces today … prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahuand defence minister Israel Katz instructed the elimination of the terrorist Raed Saed, head of Hamas’ force buildup,” the prime minister and the defence minister said in a joint statement.The Israeli military described Saed as “one of the architects” of the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war inGaza. The military earlier on Saturday said two reserve soldiers were lightly injured after the device detonated “during an operation to clear the area” in southern Gaza.Saed’s death would be the most significant assassination of a senior Hamas figure since a ceasefire deal came into effect in October.More than 9,000 children in Gaza treated for acute malnutrition in October, UN saysRead moreAn Israeli defence official said Saed had been targeted in the attack, describing him as the head of Hamas’s weapons manufacturing force.Hamas sources have described him as the second-in-command of the group’s armed wing, after Izz eldeen al-Hadad.Saed used to head Hamas’s Gaza City battalion, one of the group’s largest and best equipped, those sources said.The war in Gaza began after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and seized 251 hostages in an attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 70,700 Palestinians, most of them civilians, health officials in Gaza said.The 10 October ceasefire has enabled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to Gaza City’s ruins. Israel has pulled troops back from city positions, and aid flows have increased.But violence has not completely halted. Palestinian health authorities say Israeli forces have killed at least 386 people in strikes in Gaza since the truce. Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire began, and it has attacked scores of fighters.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

But he also had a gentle side that most people never saw, and a heart as big as gold.”Edwards added: “He was a terrific guy. Truly one of the great actors of our generation. His heart was as big as there was. I’m going to miss him. He was a great friend.”Greene won the best actor prize at the 1994 Taormina film festival for his role in Lodge Kerrigan’s Clean, Shaven, in which he played a man with schizophrenia.He later parlayed his success into roles in numerous films including The Usual Suspects, Under Siege 2 and Training Day alongside Denzel Washington.Greene’s other credits include the action film Judgment Night, the Halle Berry thriller The Rich Man’s Wife, Blue Streak and the Jennifer Aniston action comedy The Bounty Hunter.The actor, who was born in Montclair, New Jersey, leaves behind a sister and a brother.In a rare interview in 2011, Greene admitted he initially turned down the role in Pulp Fiction due to its content.He told The Sissy Gamache Show: “When I got the script, I was thoroughly disappointed.“The way it was written wasn’t my cup of tea. If you ever saw Deliverance, you never saw the guy who took Ned Beatty and made him ‘squeal like a pig’ ever again, so I didn’t think it was a great career move.”However, Tarantino kept pursuing him to take the role and eventually allowed Greene to alter the scene to his preference.Explore more on these topicsFilmPulp FictionNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

To make up for the lack of published information, he included conference presentations and preliminary, unpublished findings in the review paper.Upon compiling available evidence, Van Ameringen and his team found “stronger signals” for the efficacy of psychedelics, specifically psilocybin (the psychoactive component of “magic mushrooms,”) than for cannabinoids like THC and CBD.Van Ameringen theorizes that the difference is related to how these substances interact with areas of the brain related to OCD. While cannabinoids activate the brain’s CB1 receptors, which regulate symptoms like compulsions and anxiety, available evidence shows they don’t offer lasting relief from OCD symptoms.Psilocybin, on the other hand,can reduce connectivityin the brain’s default mode network, which “essentially is involved in self referential thinking and rumination. The default mode network is really activated in OCD”, he says.A difference in the methodology of cannabis and psilocybin studies might also have contributed to the different results, says Dr Mohamed Sherif, a psychiatrist and computational neuroscientist at Brown University who will lead a future clinical trial on psilocybin for OCD. Psychedelic clinical trials, like the one Sherif is planning, tend to offer patients not only medication but also encouragement to frame their experience as a therapeutic “journey”.“This was not done in cannabinoids [studies,]” Sherif explained.Dr Terrence Ching, a clinical psychologist at the Yale School of Medicine, similarly wondered if the way people use cannabis versus psilocybin might explain the different outcomes. While people tend to use cannabis for temporary relief, psilocybin can help facilitate actual changes in the brain and in patients’ perception of their OCD.“One could use cannabis for the same therapeutic reason, of confronting something deeper about their OCD or their obsessive fears. But conventionally, people tend to use cannabis for an avoidance function,” Ching explained.Preliminary results from Ching’s clinical trial on a single dose of psilocybin for OCD were included in Van Ameringen’s review paper, and showed that psilocybin was effective for OCD symptoms compared to placebo. Ching is now preparing the results of the trial for publication, and planning a second clinical trial where OCD patients will receive two doses of psilocybin at different times.During the single dose trial, 11 patients each received psilocybin or niacin, a placebo intended to mimic some of psilocybin’s effects so that patients would be unsure which drug they’d received. During dosing sessions, patients would sit with two facilitators who would offer minimal guidance in the form of open ended questions.Ching said his protocol included strict rules about the type of touch that was allowed if patients requested it – only a hand on the shoulder or forearm – to create unambiguous ethical limits.Past psychedelic clinical trialshave generated controversy when facilitators initiated unwanted touch with participants who were under the influence.Ching said the trial was useful not only in showing that psychedelics can improve OCD symptoms, but also in revealing more about the nature of OCD, both for clinicians and for the participants themselves.Psilocybin is known for inducing “mystical experiences”, characterized by a specific type and intensity of psychedelic effects, according to Ching.“What we see in OCD is more often partial mystical experiences, people are kind of pumping the brakes when they have a sense that the psilocybin wants to take them into a deeper state of experiencing,” Ching said, adding that this highlights one of the core features of the disorder – the need to be in control.While clinicians in psychedelic trials might typically encourage patients to go deeper, Ching said that with OCD patients, it’s important to remain “non-directive and non-judgemental”.During the trial, Ching saw patients recognize their own resistance to the drug and gain deeper insight into their need for control, saying things like: “I really realize that this is how I’ve approached unknowable things in my life, but that’s what life is. Life is full of unknowable things.”Ching is hopeful about the future of psychedelic medications, but there are several obstacles that make researching them difficult. Psilocybin is still an illegal schedule I substance in the US, which means that researchers must take additional steps to study it, including working with a DEA liaison and using a DEA approved safe that “needs to be bolted down to the ground”, in a private windowless room.Researchers also must deal with the issue of “functional unblinding”, or the fact that psychedelic effects can mean trial participants are able to guess whether they received psilocybin or a placebo, which could alter their perception of their own symptoms. This is especially problematic given the hype around psychedelics, Ching said.Many participants will enter a trial expecting a “miracle cure” – a narrative Ching believes is actually harmful to psychedelic research: “What we need to do now is to seriously, to treat psychedelics seriously, as any other worthwhile medication, to investigate in a controlled, rigorous way, in a way that is ethical, that pays homage to traditional Indigenous users of psychedelics, because there are, there is great wisdom there too.”Explore more on these topicsObsessive-compulsive disorderHealthMental healthDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the successes go less remarked.Renewable energy smashed records last year, growing by 15% and accounting for more than 90% of all new power generation capacity.Investment in clean energy topped $2tn, outstripping that into fossil fuels by two to one.Electric vehicles now account for about a fifth of new cars sold around the world. Low-carbon power makes up more than half of the generation capacity of China andIndia, with China’s emissions now flattening, and most developed countries on a downward trend.For Laurence Tubiana, a former French diplomat who was one of the main architects of the Paris accord and is now chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, this is a remarkable achievement. “The Paris agreement has set in motion a shift towards clean energy that no country can now ignore,” she said.Would this have happened without the Paris agreement? Unlikely, according to Bill Hare, chief executive of the Climate Analytics thinktank. He said: “The 1.5C limit [for rising global temperatures] and the net zero goal have reshaped policy, finance, litigation and sectoral rules, helping to rewire how states, markets and institutions work.”Ed Miliband, the UK energy secretary, said look where temperatures were headed before Paris, if you want to judge the summit’s impact. The planet was on track for more than 4C of heating, a catastrophic increase.After Paris,that came down to 3C. Then, afterCop26 in Glasgow in 2021, which reaffirmed the 1.5C pledge, carbon-cutting commitments brought the projected temperature rise to about 2.8C. Today,the forecast stands at about 2.5C, if all existing promises are fulfilled.Graph showing projected global temperatures for 21st century under different emissions scenarios“We’ve made progress as a world, but we also know that is far short of what we agreed at Paris,” said Miliband. “You’re trying to get 193 countries to agree to these big fundamental questions about the trajectory of their economies, their societies, the way their energy systems work. No wonder it’s difficult.”Yet the shaky response to the Paris agreement from some key countries in its immediate aftermath has added significantly to the climate crisis we now face, and the failure of rich governments in more recent years to uphold their side of the bargain with the poorer world threatens to implode the global consensus.The question now is: can countries learn from the mistakes of the past decade, in order to keep the Paris agreement alive in the next?The history of the last 10 years in climate politics is one of glaring contradictions, forward leaps followed by backsliding, and cooperation attended by fracture. The first blow to the fledgling Paris agreement came within just a year, with the election ofDonald Trumpas US president in 2016. He vowed to withdraw from the pact, and began the process in 2017.This year, that pattern looked set to repeat: in January, on re-entry to the White House,Trump began the withdrawal process again, while kicking off damaging global trade turmoil through the imposition of swingeing tariffs.ThoughTrump’s first withdrawal did not create the “snowball” effect some had feared– no other functioning country has left since – he may also bear partial responsibility for another blow: after 2016, China vastly speeded up its rate of carbon dioxide output.When Xi Jinping travelled to Paris in November 2015, and for a short time after,emissions from the world’s second biggest economy looked to be peakingat just under 10bn tonnes per year.But in 2017, that dream was dashed. Coal-fired power took off again, and China’s carbon output resumed its upward march, at an accelerated pace, reaching 12.3bn tonnes last year.Graph showing China’s annual CO2 emissions between 2010 and 2025Beijing economic thinking is opaque and there are still differing conclusions about what caused the spike. Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, believes the government was seeking to shore up economic growth by traditional means: “It was the real estate market, it was buildings, steel, cement. It’s different now,” he said.But Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, warns of the damage China’s actions did to arguments for climate action in the US: “In the immediate aftermath of Paris, China began the biggest building spree of coal-fired power plants in history. They went on a coal binge, and the rest of us just had to hope it would subside. It made everyone cynical.”Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research onEnergyand Clean Air, discerns the hand of Trump in the rise in emissions from 2017. He argued it was “partially a reversal of [China’s] overall economic policy, then it was a response to Trump’s tariffs, then redoubling on using real estate as a growth driver”.Chart showing annual global levels of fossil CO2 emissions between 2010 and 2025Roughly 90% of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions since the Paris agreement has come from China. And yet those emissions tell only half the story. Last year, China added more renewable energy than the rest of the world combined, andclean energy made up 10% of the country’s GDP, with similar figures likely this year. China’s manufacturing strength has sent the price of solar panels plunging by about 90% in the last decade.It is true that China may yet return to coal, but Wang Yi, a senior adviser to the Chinese government, said at Cop30 last month thatXi Jinping was committed to clean energy for the long term. “The central government, including President Xi, is very clear to us that we must, in the next five years, speed up the new power system,” Wang said.If the world should manage to cling tothe 1.5C limit – which is still possible, according to Hare, if the current overshoot is swiftly remedied, then China will deserve a large slice of the credit.And where China leads, India has followed. The country’s carbon emissions outstrip Europe’s, and it could overtake the US in a decade to become the world’s second biggest emitter after China.But half of India’s installed power generation capacity is now low-carbon, andthe country met its target on renewable energy five years ahead of time. Wind and particularly solar are set to grow even faster this year, butcoal production has also surged.Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water thinktank, said the country is headed for a clean future: “India is now planning for a grid that can absorb much larger volumes of renewable energy. This is transformative. All the building blocks are there.”Graph showing atmospheric methane concentration by year between 2010 and 2025The Paris agreement, in which countries agreed to limit global temperature rises to “well below 2C” above preindustrial levels while “pursuing efforts” to stay within 1.5C, was possible only because of the determined efforts of a global alliance in which some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries made common cause with some of the richest and most polluting.TheHigh Ambition Coalition, spearheaded by the charismatic Marshall Islands diplomat Tony de Brum, brought more than 100 countries together and drove the final months of work.But many observers are worried about a fracture between developed and developing countries that has appeared to widen at recent Cop summits. Poorer countries were shocked by the global north’s tardiness in sharing vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, but they supported moves atCop26in Glasgow in 2021 to reinforce the 1.5C goal.They hoped the rich countries would reciprocate the next year with help for the loss and damage fund – money that goes to the rescue and rehabilitation of communities stricken by climate disaster – but only achieved that with a struggle.Then, last year, atCop29 in Azerbaijan, rich nations provoked fury from the global south when they refused until the final hours to put numbers on their contribution to the $1.3tn a year promised in climate finance by 2035, and tried to feint at first with a lower sum than the $300bn finally agreed.Evans Njewa, chair of the UN’s Least Developed Countries grouping, reminds rich countries that providing financial assistance is an obligation, rather than an option. “We expect that these commitments will set into real, sustained financial flows,” he said.“Climate finance to us is not charity. It is a legal obligation, so it must be mobilised and be provided to us. It is the only means of a global response to this global crisis.”At the most recent climate summit, poorer countries did achieve the tripling of finance for adaptation, to $120bn a year, though it will not be fully realised until 2035, rather than the 2030 deadline they preferred.That could go some way to rebuilding trust, but one participant in the talks told the Guardian that poor and vulnerable countries “do not want to be taken for granted”, and would need further evidence of rich countries’ solidarity.Chart showing mean global temperature difference between each year in 2000-2025 and the 1850-1900 averageIf Paris is to survive, the rich countries will need to do more to fulfil their promises and heal the rift. They will also need to lead on theroadmaps to phase out oil and gas stemming from a voluntary agreement made at Cop30.That is likely to mean working with petro states – such as the United Arab Emirates, under whose Cop28 presidency in 2023 the promise to “transition away from fossil fuels” was originally made – rather than shunning them.Meanwhile, the biggest developing economies must show that renewable energy can substitute for fossil fuels, rather than being additional to them, and can bring down carbon rapidly, rather than simply subduing its rate of increase.All of these efforts will face outright hostility and possibly attempted sabotage by the US.Though Trump sent no delegation to Cop30, his officials played an extraordinary role at theInternational Maritime Organisation negotiations on a potential carbon levyin October. Developing country delegates were plagued with intimidatory emails and phone calls from the US state department, threatening visa revocations and economic sanctions. Countries are now braced for what US tactics may come next.For Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, today’s changed geopolitics presents the biggest threat to the Paris consensus. “Climate change negotiations do not take place in a vacuum. They reflect the increasingly multipolar world we live in,” she said.“Unlike some other multilateral processes, though, we continue to make progress against all odds. That this progress is incremental and not in line with needs on the ground is obviously extremely frustrating. [But] we are prepared to continue to work with all partners to secure a viable future for our people.”For large as well as small countries, she adds, multilateral cooperation on the climate is the best hope, as “We do not have the option to go it alone.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsParis climate agreementRenewable energyEnergyEd MilibandChinafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Central Valley typically sees this type of fog during the colder months of the year, when the air near the ground is cold and moist, and the winds are calmer, allowing moisture in the air to transform into a thick layer of fog.As the cold blanket of fog forms, it becomes trapped in the bowl-like shape of the Central Valley. The warmer temperatures of the air above keep the fog stuck in the valley like a lid over a pot, also known as temperature inversion.As seen inNasa’s imagery, the tule fog remains steady over the Central Valley, moving through the Carquinez Strait in December, toward the San Francisco Bay.The tule fog crept in after a major storm hit California in late October, which caused “the worst severe thunderstorm outbreak over the central California interior in recent memory”, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in areport.View image in fullscreenCalifornia satellite imagery in late autumn of fog stretching about 400 miles.Photograph: NASAThe National Weather Service has issued several dense fog advisories in central California’s Foothill region over the past week due to the lingering tule fog, which impacted visibility on mountain roads, which could see “sudden drops in visibility to less than 1/4 mile” until Saturday at 11 am.The lingering tule fog has contributed to the chillier conditions locals report feeling in central California and the Bay Area. The Central Valley has experienced an average low temperature of 37F and average high of 63F so far this month, with the Bay Area at 43F and 65F, respectively.Drew Tuma, ABC 7 News meteorologist,writesthat as the fog tries to move out of the valley, it seeps out into the Carquinez Strait, moving the tule fog into the Bay Area and lowering temperatures there, too.Flooding remains threat in Pacific north-west as Washington declares emergencyRead moreWhile cool fog and tule fog are not uncommon in these regions at this time of year, climate scientist Daniel Swain of the California Institute for Water Resources says warmer overall conditions are making this persisting fog persist.In his climate blog, Weather West, Swainwritesthat the warm ocean water offshore and the lack of snowpack in the Sierra Nevadas has led to “relatively warmer surface temperatures”, which is causing the inversion and preventing the fog from lifting.Carlos Molina, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Hanford,told the Los Angeles Timesthat tule fog typically lasts about a week, putting this two-week-long blanket more “on the extreme side”.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS weatherNasaWest CoastShareReuse this content"

Obedience and being quieter to remain making Monkey Cage, or resign and have the freedom to speak out against what I believe are injustices. I chose the latter. It broke my heart.”He said that he had resigned in September, and on Friday recorded his final episode of the award-winning radio show, which he co-created.He said he saw his resignation as a “victory” for his critics, adding that he accepted he was not what “the current BBC” expected of their freelance presenters.The BBC has strict impartiality rules which state “the highest level of impartiality is required in news and journalism in all its forms” and require “any individual in a role requiring impartiality, who is intending to express opinions publicly on matters of current public policy, politics or any controversial issue … must inform their line manager in advance”.Claims of “serious and systemic problems” in the broadcaster’s coverage of issues including Trump, Gaza and trans issues led to theresignation of its director general, Tim Davie, last month.Speaking of Ince’s resignation, sources inside the broadcaster said they did not recognise his version of events.Ince said he had never previously thought about leaving the show. “I always imagined going on until I dropped dead under the studio lights due to a brain aneurysm caused by my final attempt to understand notions of quantum gravity or the shock of being told about fly maggot infestations in the sacs of macaque monkeys.“I love this show and I love the audience, and it is because of the audience in particular that this decision was so difficult to make. I kept thinking about all the extremist voices promoting hate and division.“They are being given so many platforms, while voices that represent kindness, open mindedness [and] empathy seem to be scarcer and scarcer. I felt I couldn’t pamper myself with the luxury of silence.”A BBC spokesperson said: “We would like to thank Robin Ince for everything he’s done for Infinite Monkey Cage over the past 16 years and wish him all the best for the future. We will announce more Monkey Cage news in due course.”Explore more on these topicsRadio 4BBCRadioRadio industryPodcastsnewsShareReuse this content"

Cass recommended a puberty blocker trial as part of a wider research programme and supported a more “holistic” approach to care.Badenoch and the shadow health secretary, Stuart Andrew, wrote to Streeting on 25 November, however, saying they were concernedNHSEngland was supporting a clinical trial involving drugs that halted natural puberty.Two UK clinical trials to assess impact of puberty blockers in young peopleRead moreCass found “remarkably weak” evidence the drugs were effective in treating gender-related distress, adding that there was no good evidence on long-term outcomes.She has said a trial is the only way forward in the attempt to understand if there are beneficial effects. The government has since banned the treatment for children outside clinical trials.The new trial will study the effects of puberty blockers on more than 200 children presenting with gender identity conditions as part of a wider research project on possible treatment pathways. The £10.7m study is being carried out by researchers at King’s College London.Streeting’s intervention came despite admittinghe is “deeply uncomfortable” about medicationwhich affects “a natural part of our human development”.Puberty blockers stop the body from producing certain hormones, including oestrogen and testosterone. They were traditionally prescribed to children who entered puberty too early, but were later given to young people diagnosed with gender dysphoria and incongruence.Badenoch and Andrew told Streeting the trial was based on the “discredited, yet still seemingly entrenched, belief in some quarters that a child can be ‘born in the wrong body’ or go through the ‘wrong’ puberty and a normal puberty can be ‘paused’ without causing irreparable harm to children”. They cited infertility and loss of sexual function as possible side effects.Streeting expressed his own doubts about the trial in an LBC interview on Friday. “There’s something about the opposition to this. Medication that delays or indeed stops a natural part of our human development, which is puberty, I am deeply uncomfortable with,” he said.He said, however, that he planned to follow clinical advice to go ahead with the trial. “It’s gone through rounds and rounds of ethical approvals to approve this kind of study. So that’s the basis on which we are proceeding,” he said.In responding to Badenoch and Andrew, Streeting said some children were going to great lengths to source puberty blockers despite the ban and that gender incongruence was a “real and internationally recognised disorder”, but that the condition was distinct from “girls and boys experimenting with gender norms, which for many children is a normal part of growing up”.“Only a clinical trial (and longer term follow up) can isolate which outcomes can be ascribed to these treatments, supporting evidence-based decisions for future care,” he said.He also said the cross-party consensus on the Cass review when it was published last year was “a key moment for taking some of the heat out of what is an extremely sensitive issue without stifling debate, where the wellbeing and safety of children must remain paramount”.“Dr Cass said, on publishing her review, that ‘toxic, ideological and polarised public debate has made the work of the review significantly harder’ and it will hamper the research that is essential to finding a way forward,” he said.“It is incumbent on us as public representatives to take the heat and the ideology out of this issue, and make sure that children’s health is always led by evidence and medical expertise.”Badenoch and Andrew said in their letter to Streeting that the trial would have no proper control group “creating obvious bias”.In his reply, Streeting said that was incorrect and that a group of young people not in receipt of puberty blockers would also be studied by researchers. He said these children would be “compared to trial participants with respect to outcomes”.Explore more on these topicsGenderNHSWes StreetingChildren's healthHealth policyChildrenConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

The second man, 23, has been released under investigation.Shotton Residents Association chair, Steve Maitland, told BBC Radio Tees on Friday that the tree had been put up to commemorate fallen soldiers from the first world war.View image in fullscreenSteve Maitland: ‘These people who did this – I don’t think they understand the history and the feeling of these things.’Photograph: Durham Police/PA“The Christmas tree’s lights were turned on at about 5pm and 80 to 100 people turned up to watch. Hours later, this has happened,” he said. “Whoever has done it feels they can get away with it, but hopefully they will be caught.”“These people who did this – I don’t think they understand the history and the feeling of these things,” he said, adding that some of the people involved in fundraising for the tree a decade ago had since died.He called the attack “mindless vandalism” but said he could not “turn the clock back” and said members of the public were making a sleeve for the tree’s base, so they could bolt back up as quickly as possible, “just to tide us over for Christmas”.Saint Saviour’s, a parish church in the village, posted on Facebook: “After all the people who gave their time and effort to raise funds to get a tree for the village. This morning a tree surgeon has looked at the damage and said it’s been done with a chainsaw. May the people who caused this be caught and punished by the authorities.”PC David Allan, from Peterlee neighbourhood police team, said: “This was a disgusting act of mindless vandalism, which has caused huge upset throughout the village at a time when our community should be coming together.“We are treating this incident extremely seriously, and we will deal with anyone responsible as robustly as the law allows. This behaviour has no place in our community.”The pair were arrested after police asked the public for any witnesses to the incident, or anyone who may have CCTV or doorbell footage of anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time, to contact the force.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But two days after its departure, it off-loaded an estimated 50,000 barrels to another ship, which then headed north towardCubawhile the Skipper headed east toward Asia.About 80% of Venezuela’s oil exports, or 663,000 to 746,000 barrels daily, goes to China,according to estimates. But Cuba has long relied on Venezuelan oil exports in return for medical expertise, sports instructors and security personnel who surround the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro – and are considered loyal and effective in providing personal protection.However, the vast majority of subsidized oil destined for Cuba has been resold to China for badly needed foreign currency, the Times assessed.The Venezuela-Cuba component of the Skipper’s seizure comes as Reuters reported that Venezuelan oil exports have reportedly fallen sharply since the tanker was seized. And it comes as the US treasury department imposed new sanctions on shipping companies and vessels doing business withVenezuela, as well as on members of Maduro’s family.It also comes as the US is reported to have moved more military assets to the Caribbean following deadly strikes on alleged drug boats and the seizure of Skipper.According to the War Zoneandother outlets, additional capabilities to Operation Southern Spear, a counter-narcotics effort that has evolved into a mission to topple Maduro, have arrived at US bases in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.They include search and rescue aircraft, rescue helicopters, refueling tankers and EA-18G Growler electronic attack jets – that could be used to jam Russian-supplied Venezuelan air defense systems – and additional F-35s.The new deployments add to significant combat equipment already in the region, including almost a dozen warships – including the USS Gerald R Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier – Reaper drones, Poseidon spy planes and F-35s.The US effort to interrupt Venezuela’s oil exports and increase pressure on Maduro, who is under indictment on US narco-terrorism charges, parallels efforts to disrupt the global “shadow fleet” of an estimated 1,000 oil tankers believed to be breaking international energy sanctions.Tracking data obtained by Reutersindicatesthat 30 of the 80 tankers waiting to load Venezuelan barrels are under sanctions, offering a target for the Trump administration’s “America first” policy that strives“to ensure that the Western Hemisphere remains reasonably stable and well-governed”.In addition to new sanctions on oil companies and vessels suspected of breaking sanctions as well as “propping up Maduro’s corrupt and illegitimate regime in Venezuela”, the US targeted three of Maduro’s nephews for what it says is involvement in drug trafficking connected to the foreign terrorist-designated Cartel de los Soles.The US treasury also announced sanctions on Panamanian businessman Ramón Carretero for “facilitating shipments of petroleum products on behalf of the Venezuelan government” – and he has beenidentifiedas an intermediary between Caracas and Havana.Venezuela hascondemnedthe US seizure of the Skipper as “blatant theft and an act of international piracy”.Freddy Ñáñez, Venezuela’s communications minister, accused Washington of “piracy, kidnapping, theft of private property”.Late Friday, the US attorney’s office for the District of Columbiaunsealed a warrant for the Skipper’s seizureafter previously identifying the vessel as part of an oil shipping network supporting terrorism-designated Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF).“As the premiere United States attorney’s office leading efforts to intercept ghost vessels as well as sanctioned products, we remain committed to legally supporting [Trump administration] efforts to make the world a safer place,” US attorney Jeanine Pirro said.The FBI director, Kash Patel, said: “The seizure of this vessel highlights our successful efforts to impose costs on the governments of Venezuela and Iran.” Patel added that FBI counterintelligence “will continue to enforce US sanctions and cut off our adversaries from financial markets and critical technology”.The warrant authorized the seizure of “all assets, foreign or domestic … of any individual, entity, or organization engaged in planning or perpetrating any federal crime of terrorism against the United States, citizens or residents of the United States, or their property, and all assets, foreign or domestic, affording any person a source of influence over any such entity or organization.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCubaVenezuelaInternational tradeUS militaryUS foreign policyOilShareReuse this content"

A close ally of Russia and its president,Vladimir Putin, Minsk is largely isolated from European and other western states due to its poor human rights record and brutal crackdown on popular protests.The gradual detente is part of what US officials told Reuters was an attempt to pull him from Putin’s sphere of influence, an initiative about which Belarusian opposition has expressed doubts.Who, If Not Us? The Fight for Democracy in Belarus review – activists display their defianceRead moreThe announcement of the release, which included top opposition figures and human rights campaigners, was met with fanfare. Bialiatski, who co-won the 2022 Nobel peace prize, is a human rights champion who advocated on behalf of political prisoners before being jailed himself in July 2021.Also released wereKalesnikava,one of a trio of women who led 2020 protestsagainst Lukashenko, as well as Viktar Babaryka, arrested in 2020 while trying to run in opposition to Lukashenko in a presidential election.The health of many of the prisoners has reportedly declined during their time in detention, as a result of what human rights groups say was mistreatment by the authorities.Kalesnikava’s sister, Tatsiana Khomich, said that her sister was grateful to the US for its role in facilitating her release.“She told me she is very happy to be freed, that she is thankful to the USA and Trump for their efforts in leading the process, and to all countries involved,” Khomich told Reuters.Relatives of the prisoners gathered outside the US embassy in Vilnius, Lithuania, where it is expected some of them will be taken from Belarus. Ukrainian authorities said that 114 civilians, including Ukrainian and Belarusian citizens, were transferred to Ukraine.Trump’s Belarus envoy, John Coale, told reporters in Minsk that the US would be lifting sanctions on potash, “as per the instructions of president Trump”.The US and EU placed sanctions on Belarus after thegovernment cracked down on popular protestsfollowing a contested election in 2020, which included the mass detention and torture of political opponents.More sanctions were imposed in 2022 after Belarus allowedRussiato use its territory for its invasion of Ukraine.Belarusian opposition figures thanked Trump for his efforts and said that the prisoner release was evidence of the effectiveness of the sanctions regime on the autocratic government. They called for EU sanctions to stay in place, which exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said were critical to “enabling democratic transition and ensuring accountability”.Lukashenko has denied holding political prisoners, instead saying the people in his prisons were “bandits” and opponents of the state. Belarusian human rights group Viasna, which is banned in the country, said 1,227 political prisoners remain in jail.Coale, in statements published by Belarus’s state media, said that Lukashenko could help assist in negotiations with Putin. The Trump administration has been engaged in mediation efforts between Russia and Ukraine in an effort to reach an end to the war in Ukraine.“Your president has a long history with president Putin and has the ability to advise him. This is very useful in this situation.

Additional injuries included bruises on his arms and abdomen, a broken nose and a fractured right thigh bone.The Orlando medical examiner had already determined Zavala’s death was the result of blunt-impact trauma. Investigators from the Orange county sheriff’s office found that Epic Universe employees followed all safety procedures and were not negligent in what was deemed an accident.Epic Universe is Universal Orlando Resort’s newest theme park.Security footage captured Zavala appearing “engaged and well” when the ride at the park began – but at its conclusion, he was slumped and unresponsive, the sheriff’s report said.View image in fullscreenKevin Rodriguez Zavala.Photograph: Twitter/XWitnesses described seeing Zavala bleeding from his face and leaning over in his seat once the coaster stopped. Anna Marshall, a physician waiting in line for the ride, told investigators that Zavala appeared “slouched over and surrounded by blood” as the coaster returned to the platform. She said one of his arms dangled over the side and that his thigh bone “was broken in half and resting on the back of the ride chair”.Marshall assisted Zavala, who used a wheelchair, after the incident. His girlfriend, Javiliz Cruz-Robles, who was seated next to him, said that Zavala had metal rods in his back from a prior spinal surgery.Family members told investigators that Zavala’s spinal cord atrophy, the condition behind his disability, had no role in his death on 17 September.When the ride halted, Zavala sustained extensive facial injuries and remained restrained by the lap bar, which could not be released for about ten minutes, according to Universal paramedic Sebastian Torres.Cruz-Robles told investigators that a ride operator had to push the lap bar down multiple times before it locked into place and that it seemed too tight across their laps. She said Zavala was thrown forward during the ride’s first descent, striking his head on the metal bar ahead of them. He hit his head several more times throughout the ride as she struggled unsuccessfully to hold him back.The sheriff’s office noted that warning signs at the ride entrance cautioned guests about sudden drops and accelerations. It also advised against riding with “back, neck or similar physical conditions”, or after recent surgeries or conditions that might be worsened by the ride.Zavala’s parents shared that he had fractured a thigh bone requiring surgery in 2020 and underwent hip surgery following a dislocation in 2010.The roller coaster, a dual-launch design reaching speeds of up to 62mph (100 km/ph), officially opened in May to visitors of Epic Universe.The ruling in Zavala’s death comes after a jurylast December awarded$310m to the family of a 14-year-old boy who was thrown to his death from a since-dismantled free-fall ride at Orlando’s Icon Park in March 2022. The episode prompted Florida legislators to pass the Tyre Sampson Act to bolster safety requirements for amusement park attractions.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsFloridaTheme parksUniversal PicturesnewsShareReuse this content"

The girls were ages six and seven at the time. Their adoptive mother, Leticia McCormack, and McCormack’s parents, Adella and Stanley Tom, are facing charges of murder, conspiracy, child abuse and torture. They pleaded not guilty to all charges, and their criminal case is ongoing.View image in fullscreenArabella McCormack.Photograph: San Diego county sheriff's officeThelawsuitalleged a systemic failure across the city and several agencies and organizations to not report Arabella McCormack’s abuse.The settlement includes $10m from the city ofSan Diego, $10m from San Diego county, $8.5m from the Pacific Coast Academy and $3m from the Rock church, the sisters’ attorney, Craig McClellan, said. The school oversaw Arabella McCormack’s home schooling, and her adoptive mother was an ordained elder at the church.“The amount is going to be enough to take care of the girls for the rest of the lives,” McClellan said. But it “isn’t going to be enough and never could be enough … to replace their sister, nor is it going to erase the memories of what they went through”.The lawsuit said county social workers did not properly investigate abuse claims and two teachers at the Pacific Coast Academy failed to report the girl’s condition. It also said a San Diego police officer, a friend of the girl’s adoptive mother, gave the family a wooden paddle that they could use to hit their children.San Diego sheriff’s deputies responded to a call of a child in distress at the McCormack home 30 August 2022. They found Arabella McCormack severely malnourished with bruises, authorities said. She was taken to a hospital, where she died.Her sisters are now nine and 11 and living with a foster mother. They are in good health and “doing pretty well considering all things”, McClellan said.Explore more on these topicsSan DiegoUS crimeChildrenCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The country’s enactment of the policy is being watched closely by politicians, safety campaigners and parents. A number of other countries are not far behind, with Europe in particular hoping to replicate Australia, while the UK is keeping more of a watchful interest.EuropeDenmarkhas saidit will bansocial media for under-15s, with the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, saying mobile phones and social media are “stealing our children’s childhood”. The policy could become law next year.Reddit launches high court challenge to Australia’s under-16s social media banRead moreNorwayisbringing in a minimum age limit of 15. The prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, has said the country must protect children from the “power of the algorithms”.Irelandis introducing a digital wallet to verify the age and identity of social media users. The media minister, Patrick O’Donovan, said this month an Australia-style ban was “one of the things that we are holding in reserve”.InSpain, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has called on parliament to pass a bill raising the minimum age for using social media to 16.InFrance, the president, Emmanuel Macron, has threatened to ban social media for under-15s and a parliamentary commission has also recommended such a move, including an overnight “digital curfew” for 15- to 18-year-olds.The government inthe Netherlands, meanwhile, has advised parents to block their children from social media until they are 15.Inthe EU, theEuropean parliament has passed a non-binding resolution, demanding under-16s be banned from using social media unless their parents decide otherwise. The resolution warned of the “addictive” nature of social media but is non-binding, meaning it will not become law. The EU already has legislation that enshrines digital safety in the form of theDigital Services Act, but an appetite remains to take oversight further.The Danish MEP behind the resolution, Christel Schaldemose, said she would continue to push for continent-wide regulation, although that ultimately requires a three-way cooperation between member states, the EU parliament and the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm.The MEP said she was “not giving up” until tougher regulations were in place. “A strong age limit is a good starting point,” she said.Ursula von der Leyen, the commission’s president, has promised to establish a panel of experts who will advise on the best approach for protecting children. Announcing the panel in September, she said parents were drowning in the “tsunami of big tech flooding their family homes”.UKInthe UKthe Labour government has not ruled out a ban, saying “nothing is off the table” but any ban must be “based on robust evidence”.Last yearmomentum gatheredbehind a private member’s bill (legislation proposed by an individual lawmaker, not the government), imposing restrictions on under-16s using social media. But the bill wasultimately watered down, albeit with a government commitment to research the issue further.The Molly Rose Foundation, a charityestablished by the family of Molly Russell, a teenager who killed herself after viewing harmful online content, is concerned that an age ban would do nothing to make social networks safer. It said this week that teenagers living under an under-16 ban could face a “cliff edge” of harm on unregulated platforms when they turn 16.View image in fullscreenMolly Russell died after viewing harmful material on social media.Photograph: Family handout/PABeeban Kidron, the crossbench peer andinfluential online safety campaigner, said a ban was not a “magic bullet” but could spur tech companies to do more to protect children.“The Australian ban is a response to the failure of the tech sector to design products and services that are safe and age appropriate for children. It represents a profound challenge to Silicon Valley – by insisting that they design their products for keeping our kids safe – or leave them the heck alone,” she said.Meanwhile, the UK government will monitor whether its new set of digital guardrails,under the Online Safety Act, have the desired impact on child safety.USInthe US, social media restrictions are being brought in at state level.Utahhas introduced legislation requiring under-18s to have parental consent to use social media, while also restricting social media use at night without similar permission.TheFloridagovernor, Ron DeSantis, has signed a bill banning under-14s from joining social media, although the legislation – as with other similar state laws around the US – is subject to legal wrangling over whether it breaches the first amendment right to free speech.Virginia, meanwhile, has passed a law limiting under-16s to one hour of social media access per day, with any further access requiring parental permission.Georgia,TennesseeandLouisianahave also passed bills requiring parental consent for under-16s to open social media accounts.Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff under Barack Obama, is considering a presidential run and has said the US should follow Australia’s lead. Right now, a US-wide ban seems unlikely amid a Washington gridlock. Ted Cruz, the Republican senator, has teamed up with Democrat peers in Washington to introduce a bill formally banning under-13s from social media and barring feeding “algorithmically targeted content” to under-17s. The bill has not become law.‘Already had a profound effect’: parents react to Australia’s social media banRead moreArturo Béjar, a former senior engineer and consultant at Meta, who blew the whistle on online safety at the Facebook and Instagram owner, told the Guardian that nationwide legislation was still some way off.He said: “It is not clear how legislation is going to move forward here. The US has many bereaved parents, and bipartisan support, but turning that into legislation is taking a long time.”ElsewhereMalaysiaplans to ban social media for under-16s starting from next year andBrazilhas raised the minimum age for Instagram to the same level.At theUnited Nations, the attitude is more cautious. Unicef, the UN agency for children,has warnedthat social media bans carry risks and “may even backfire”. It said internet platforms can be a lifeline for isolated or marginalised children and that regulation should not be a substitute for tech companies investing in safety.But as the actions of Australia and other governments show, states around the world are no longer willing to wait.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It already operates fleets in cities including Berlin, Paris, Rome and Washington DC.Enterprise Car Club, which already has some cars in London, said it “will continue to seek out opportunities to expand our network and provide people with alternative transport options by the hour or day”.What has gone wrong at Zipcar – and is UK car-sharing market dead?Read moreCo Wheels, which operates across the UK and with a handful of cars in the capital, said it was “actively discussing” options with several London boroughs in recent days.The peer-to-peer car-sharing companies Hiyacar and Turo also said they hoped to expand the number of car owners using their platforms in London.Zipcar last week announced a plan to close its UK operation at the end of the year, in a blow toadvocates of car sharingand to as many as half a million users.London is seen as one of the most promising cities in Europe for car sharing because it has a big population that largely relies on public transport rather than owning their own cars to get around.However, experts have said that thefragmented nature of licensing and parking pricesacross 33 London local authorities has been a huge barrier to car clubs. For instance, Zipcar’s floating cars, which have no fixed parking spot, were not allowed to park within the central borough of Camden and the City of London, among other areas.Free2Move suggested that its interest was not at a developed stage, but that it might consider the city. Free2Move operates fleets of floating vehicles, which are accessed via its app.It said: “London is among Europe’s most advanced cities when it comes to readiness for autonomous mobility, which makes it a particularly compelling market for us.“Free2move is taking a long-term view, focused on autonomous and fully digital mobility solutions, and we are actively assessing how our experience in car sharing and fleet operations could evolve to support a city like London in the future.”Launching a new car club fleet would entail significant investment in vehicles, and would probably take some time for Free2Move or a competitor. Any plans for Free2Move to launch in London could be complicated if Stellantis, the owner of car brands including Peugeot, Vauxhall and Fiat, decides to sell the business, as reported byBloombergin October.Peer-to-peer companies have a less financially onerous task, as they link existing owners of vehicles to potential renters, without having to spend heavily on fleets of cars. Hiyacar and Turo already operate in London, and both said they spied an opportunity to expand and persuade more owners to list their cars.The Hiyacar chief executive, Don Iro, said: “Our vision is to now take on the market. We’re in a unique position to scale.”He added that the company was “always going to do this irrespective of Zipcar”, but its abandonment of the market “gives us the ammunition to expand”.Richard Dilks, the chief executive of CoMoUK, a shared transport charity, said he had been involved in several discussions with London boroughs and Transport for London over what needed to happen to attract more players, including having a single process across boroughs and lower fees.“Almost certainly there’s going to be a big cliff-edge gap,” he said. “I can see some signs of progress, but hypothetical at the moment. It’s going to be a long haul, this.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryMotoringLondonRoad transportnewsShareReuse this content"

It feels like a family reunion – but one where everyone is hugely charmingRhik SamadderSat 13 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTSharePeep Show is not really a TV show. It’s closer to an identity now,embedded inthe collective British DNA. A decade after the show finished, many of us still call each other “Clean Shirt”, notice logos in foam or quip about crack being “very moreish”. The only show more emblematic of the UK’s national psyche isThe Great British Bake Off. Therefore rejoice, for the hottest collab of the holiday is here! I’m calling this the real reason for the season. The true raisin for the praisin’, perhaps.They’re so much part of our lives, it’s hard to see these bakers as actors. It feels more natural to say that this Christmas the Bake Off tent will host a reunion of Mark, Sophie, Big Suze, Super Hans and Dobby. Together again, like family, your family. It’s glorious to see them – older, some bearded, not one of them less charming. No proceeds from this are going to charity because there aren’t any. This is happening purely for joy.‘The scripts were the funniest things I’d ever read’: the stars of Peep Show look back, 20 years laterRead moreDavid Mitchell has been on Bake Off before. This may not give him an edge. As he points out, “I’ve made four cakes in my life, two of which have been televised.” You’d expect Big Suze, AKA Sophie Winkleman, half-sister of Claudia, and a member of the royal family, to have a certain level of competence. It could just be that her gentility gives her a Meghan Markle-esque poise. Matt King is the real surprise, having studied cookery and worked as a chef. He’s fascinatingly different to “terrible drug addict” Super Hans. So much so that watching him becomes, ironically, quite addictive.View image in fullscreenExtra sprinkles … Olivia Colman and Alison Hammond on The Great Christmas Bake Off.Photograph: Channel 4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PAThen there’s Olivia Colman, who played mild-mannered office worker Sophie. In real life, Colman has won a best actress Oscar, and elevated the most acclaimed TV of recent years, from Fleabag and The Night Manager to The Bear. It’s to her credit that you can still imagine her chit-chatting in the line at the supermarket, or eating a Jammie Dodger. She is in the pantheon of greats. This is like Daniel Day-Lewis going on Would I Lie to You? (he’d be phenomenal at that). Goes without saying, it would be hilarious if Colman won this too.Sadly, Robert Webb is absent. Presumably owing to a schedule clash, though it’s fun to imagine his character Jeremy’s opposition to appearing. “It’s Keep Calm and Carry On Opiating the masses, Mark!” etc.Judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith’s tasks are pure fan service. Challenging the contestants to make a turkey pie, the latter announces: “This is an homage to the classic scene where Jeremy forgets the turkey.” She sounds like a prime minister declaring their lifelong love for the Arsenal. In my heart, I do not believe Leith has watched a single second ofPeep Show. Imagine if she’d asked them to cook dog.View image in fullscreenSecond time’s the charm? … David Mitchell back in the tent on The Great Christmas Bake Off.Photograph: Channel 4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PASomeone else who has never seen an episode is King – and his signature bake is equally unexpected. “Forgotten Birds of Christmas” sees the comedian and actor baking thrush, blue tit and chaffinch biscuits, “because robins get all the attention”. He was a former member of the YOC, he explains. (He’s referring to a club for young ornithologists, rather than youth offenders I think.) Winkleman, meanwhile, possesses not just the poise of Markle but also the baking skills. The more her bakes deteriorate, the more honeyed her diction becomes. “Poor things,” she commiserates of her unsealed pies. She sounds like an M&S advert for a dropped dessert.Presenters Noel Fielding and Alison Hammond essentially get a day off, while their witty guests, particularly Mitchell, gift us zingers like currants in figgy pudding. The showstoppers are Easter eggs, too. The cast bake cakes to illustrate Peep Show deep cuts, including Dobby’s personal cheese, Super Hans running to Windsor and Mark burying an intoxicated Sophie in a ball pit. Like the show, it’s hard to explain, yet perfect.Don’t worry if you’re not a Peep Show diehard. There’s also a boys’ choir carolling celestially, and a thrilling moment when Leith accuses Hollywood of handing out handshakes on an arbitrary basis. Cooking, with stress baked in! Choirs of angels! Arguments between family members! Now that’s what I call Christmas!Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherPeep ShowThe Great British Bake OffTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And what a precocious performer he has proved, sustaining scrappy mischief through seven decades of mainstream entertainmentXan BrooksSat 13 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 01.01 ESTShareAll Hollywood stars grow old and die except perhaps one - Dick Van Dyke - who turns 100 today. The real world Peter Pan who used to trip over the ottoman on The Dick Van Dyke Show is still standing. The man who impersonated a wind-up toy in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang hasn’t wound down just yet. He has outlived mentors, co-stars, romantic partners and several studios. He’s even outlived the jokes about his performance in Mary Poppins. These days hismangled cockney accentis regarded with more fondness than contempt. It’s seen as one of the great charms of the 1964 classic, along with the carousel chase or the cartoon dancing penguins.View image in fullscreenAccent on the charm … Dick Van Dyke with Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins.Photograph: Donaldson Collection/Getty ImagesCharm is the magic ingredient of every popular entertainer and few have possessed it in such abundance as Van Dyke, the impoverished son of a travelling cookie salesman who dropped out of high school and educated himself at the movies. “His job in this life is to make a happier world,” his Broadway co-star Chita Rivera once said - and this may explain his stubborn refusal to quit, not while times are tough and he feels that audiences still need cheering up.Naturally his workrate has now slowed, but in the past few years he has competed on the TV showThe Masked Singer,starred in aColdplay videoand enthusiasticallystumped for Bernie Sanders. Van Dyke simply couldn’t understand why America’s older citizens were resistant to Sanders’ democratic socialist domestic policies. He said, “I want to urge my generation to get out and vote for him, please.”View image in fullscreenToo much energy … Dick Van Dyke in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.Photograph: Moviestore/REX/ShutterstockAs he nudges into triple figures, he has become a piece of living history: a walking, talking chronicle of US showbusiness itself. Van Dyke began his career performing for the troops in the second world war and proceeded to rub shoulders with the likes of Phil Silvers and Walt Disney. He had one foot in music-hall slapstick and the other in screwball comedy, and possibly splayed fingers in his midwestern hometown of Danville, Illinois.In bridging these worlds, he perfected an outward-facing public image that was one part Stan Laurel to two parts Jimmy Stewart: a pratfalling clown who was decent and honest and smarter than he first appeared. And while he was already nearing 40 when The Dick Van Dyke Show and Mary Poppins made him an international star, the actor remained irrepressibly boyish. In 1968’sChitty Chitty Bang Bang, he played Caractacus Potts, the madcap inventor who dreams up a flying car, while Lionel Jeffries - six months younger - played Potts’s addled and eccentric dad.Van Dyke, by and large, has steered clear of dark films. He famously turned down the lead role in The Omen and insists that he mostly played a version of himself. “Wholesome,” he says. “An all-round good boy.” That’s true so far as it goes, although it’s probably only half the story, because Van Dyke’s interpretation conveniently sidesteps a 25-year struggle with alcoholism that spanned his professional heyday. Possibly it also glosses over the air of dancing mischief – even wildness – that animates his most feted, family-friendly performances.View image in fullscreenSparring mutual respect … Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke in The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961).Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesOr to put it more bluntly, Van Dyke may have been mainstream but he never once felt conservative, nor even cosy, exactly. He brought too much energy to the room. It was as though he’d just blown in from outside and wasn’t entirely housetrained. TheDick Van DykeShow – an otherwise standard 60s family sitcom – is notable for the crackling sexual chemistry and sparring mutual respect which Van Dyke cooked up with his co-star, Mary Tyler Moore.Caractacus Potts, for his part, is the ultimate rackety dad: loving and exciting and liable to forget every birthday and dentist appointment. And then there is Bert, the sweep fromMary Poppinswho trips across London’s rooftops like an urbanised Puck of Pook’s Hill. The evidence suggests that Bert isn’t cockney at all. He’s a spooky nature spirit, antic and mercurial, who is gamely attempting to pass himself off as a local.View image in fullscreenCampaigning for Bernie Sanders, 2020.Photograph: Étienne Laurent/EPAVan Dyke is 100 and therefore no longer looks like Peter Pan. He looks, if anything, the platonic ideal of old age, with laughter lines and a thick white beard, the weathered embodiment of a life well lived. In his later years, he has grown used to people asking him for health advice, to the point where he even sat down and listed it all in a book (100 Rules for Living to 100).Porpoises rescue Dick Van DykeRead moreThe man is too self-aware to present himself as a paragon of good living. Instead he credits his longevity to a sprinkle of everyday magic – a combination of good genes, solid friendships and a positive mental outlook. “My life has been a magnificent indulgence,” he says. “I’ve been able to do what I love and share it with the world.”It’s an arrangement that has sustained him for a full century on the planet. It’s fuelled a career so rewarding and fun that it barely felt like work at all. Van Dyke started out as showbusiness’s gawky gatecrasher, a controlled explosion of elastic limbs and rubber-faced double-takes, before maturing by degrees into Hollywood’s twinkling Father Time. He is ancient but evergreen, feted and cherished. And he’s altogether as lucky as lucky can be.Explore more on these topicsDick Van DykeMary PoppinsChitty Chitty Bang BangTelevisionJulie AndrewsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But why is Vecna so wary of the cave in which Max is hiding?

The story, which takes in racist neo-Nazis and systemic corruption, is dark and conspiratorial, but Hawke’s performance invests Raybon with a quirky charm and adds nuance and heart.Disney+, from Boxing DayFalloutView image in fullscreenApocalyptic … Lucy MacLean as Ella Purnell in Fallout.Photograph: Lorenzo Sisti/PrimeFor a show with such an apocalyptic premise,Falloutteems with new life. It’s just that the life in question is generally grotesque, vicious and corrupt. The second season of this video game adaptation continues to transcend its origins but fans of the original will find themselves on familiar (if terrifying) ground as the action heads to New Vegas. Much pivots on the love/hate relationship between Ella Purnell’s Lucy and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins) as Lucy searches for her nefarious father. The world-building is immaculate, the writing is witty and it never hesitates to get properly nasty.Prime Video, from Wednesday 17DecemberEmily in ParisView image in fullscreenRoman holiday … Lily Collins and Eugenio Franceschini in Emily in Paris.Photograph: Giulia Parmigiani/NetflixThe increasingly misleadingly namedromcomreturns as Emily’s Roman holiday continues. While the show is still bewilderingly poor, it has become more likable as it leans into its own cartoonish absurdity. Emily is struggling in Rome: Marcello has taken her for an afternoon truffle-hunting even though she’s turned up to their date wearing heels. Professionally, things aren’t brilliant either – though to be fair, Emily has always been terrible at her job with no ill-effects on her lifestyle. Besides, as she quips inevitably, “Rome wasn’t built in a day”.Netflix, from Thursday 18DecemberBorn to Be WildView image in fullscreenMeet-cute … Born to be Wild.Photograph: AppleWhereas the BBC’s Natural History Unit will show the animal world red in tooth and claw, that generally isn’t Apple’s approach. And this six-part series, narrated by Hugh Bonneville, shamelessly leans into the cuteness factor. The animals it follows are orphans, raised by humans from an early age but being prepared to return to the wild. As this parade of interactions between humans and baby elephants, lemurs, lynx, bears, penguins and cheetahs suggests, some of them have become worryingly (albeit delightfully and photogenically) attached to their rescuers.Apple TV, from Friday 19DecemberStrandedView image in fullscreenLife-threatening … Stranded.Photograph: Channel 4For many people, being stranded by snow in a ski resort over Christmas would be a dream come true.

But things can always get worse – and when the hotel’s electricity is cut off, the situation becomes life-threatening and the guests can only survive by trusting each other. Which is a big problem.

However, as this fascinating documentary shows, at least plenty of great cinema emerged from the turbulence. In fact, directorMorgan Nevillesuggests that films such as Taxi Driver and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest were, thanks to their sense of disillusionment, a window into America’s soul.

She didn’t ask him about thesettlementhe paid a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her. Nor did she ask about allegations of alcohol abuse, or the accusation that he had madehis ex-wife so terrifiedthat she hid in a closet.Instead, when Hegseth and his wife, Jennifer Rauchet, appeared on the Katie Miller Podcast, the titular host asked questions like: “If you could write one Hegseth family rule on that whiteboard, what is that?”“Obey God,” Rauchet said. Hegseth agreed: “Try to honor God with your conduct each day.” (A US Navy admiral has deniedaWashington Post reportregarding the Caribbean boat strike that Hegseth gave an order to a “kill them all”. Hegseth has denied allegations ofsexual assaultandabuse. He also promised tostop drinking in office.)There is perhaps no media property better positioned to rose-tint the Trump administration’s “family values” agenda than the Katie Miller Podcast – effectively the White House’s unofficial podcast, thanks to the Millers’ extraordinary Rolodex. In interviews with top Republican figures like Vice-President JD Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi and House Speaker Mike Johnson, Miller serves softball questions that emphasize her guests’ devotion to God, their families and Trump. Not necessarily in that order.So far, so propaganda. But Miller has a more ambitious objective. “For Maga and President Trump’s legacy to grow long-term, we must talk to conservative women,”Miller told Axios.She appears to be betting that the best way to do that is through instruction on becoming a Maga-sanctioned wife and mother.While women can work, the podcast suggests, they need to be obsessive about protecting their families from outside forces – including seed oils, anti-Trump protesters and “transgender ideology”.“For a while, there was an increasing prevalence among kids who became transgender and entered into a phase of what I will call mental illness,” Miller told Johnson and his wife Kelly Johnson. “How did you raise children that I will say are successful, well-adjusted, share your morals and values?”In another episode, she bonded with Cheryl Hines, the wife of health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, over their skepticism aboutvaccinating all newborns for hepatitis Band their fears of contaminated baby formula. “That’s what radicalized me, is baby formula,” Miller confessed.Now comes the ‘womanosphere’: the anti-feminist media telling women to be thin, fertile and RepublicanRead moreAnd in another, she echoed Maga talking points against hormonal birth control, claiming that it’s overprescribed. “It was when I was growing up. For anything, for acne, for hormone imbalance – ‘just get on birth control’,” she told wellness advocate Kellyann Petrucci. “And that’s why our birth rate is so low today.”But if Miller wants to convince women that Maga is offering them a good deal, she’s going to have to work on her sales pitch.Maga, but make it softKatie Miller has been a bit player in Trumpworld since its first administration, when she – then known as Katie Waldman – worked for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Vice-President Mike Pence. In 2020, shemarried Stephen Miller, thearchitect of Trump’s extremist immigration policy. But Katie Miller is still probably best known for aninfamous brag to a reporter: “DHS sent me to the border to see the separations for myself, to try to make me more compassionate, but it didn’t work.”When Trump returned to the White House, Stephen became his deputy chief of staff for policy – a title that, insiders say, downplays how“untouchable”he is within the White House, where he hasreportedly spearheadedthe Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdowns. Katie took a job as Elon Musk’s aide, where shegained a reputationfor tenaciously promoting his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). When the relationship between Musk and Trump imploded, Katie left Musk’s side to launch the Katie Miller Podcast.In her podcast’s first video, Miller said she wanted to start the podcast because “there isn’t a place for conservative women to gather online”. But there is.The last year has seen a burgeoning “womanosphere”, the universe of rightwing podcasts, YouTube channels and magazines that lace their coverage of lifestyle, beauty and wellness with antifeminist rhetoric. These media properties tend toframe traditional gender roles as natural and beneficial, casting a salvific glow on Trump administration policies that drive women out of the workplace and into the maternity ward.Miller’s podcast relies on many of the womanosphere’s most common tropes, including a commitment to the Make America Health Again (Maha) movement, an interest in religion and a tendency to foreground motherhood. (Many of the show’s religious discussions have a Christian bent, given the guests’ backgrounds; the Millers are Jewish.) When Miller interviewed Bondi, the attorney general suggested her journey to becoming the country’s top law enforcement officer was an accident: “I’ve always wanted to be a stay-at-home mom with five kids and have a basketball team of my own, but life doesn’t work out that way.”View image in fullscreenKatie Miller speaks to Pam Bondi about the death of Charlie Kirk.Photograph: Katie Miller PodMiller doesn’t apologize for her career; many of her interviewees are successful businesswomen. “For my own self, it’s very important to work and have something outside of just my children, for my own mental health,” she told Kellyanne Conway, a staple official from Trump’s first administration. But in an era when many of the men in Maga’s top echelons – including some of Miller’s interviewees – appear tolook down on working women, she seems to need to explain it: “I think it’s a good example for children,” she said.An empty missionUnfortunately for Miller’s grand ambitions, her podcast has a fatal flaw.Interview shows run on chemistry, charisma and the sense that the listener has been transported to a Room Where It Happens. The Katie Miller Podcast, by contrast, is aggressively vibeless.Its project is fundamentally tedious: she can’t ask too much about the unique elements of her powerful interviewees’ lives – the backroom negotiations, the moments of doubt and revelation – because her questions seem designed to make them appear generic. When Miller interviewed Vance, a man who is a heartbeat away from the presidency, she asked questions like, “What’s your superpower as a dad?” and, “What age would you let your kids watch Lord of the Rings?” Watching his answers was about as interesting as watching a stranger describe last night’s dreams.Ronnee Schreiber, a San Diego State University political science professor who studies conservative women, sees the Trump administration’s use of women as spokespeople as an attempt to undercut accusations of misogyny.“We have this entire Trump administration that is callous,” Schreiber said. “It is helpful for members of the Trump administration, particularly women, to try to soften the callous nature of what the policies are and who the men are.”The podcast’s banality is exacerbated by Miller’s highly staged, pristinely neutral outfits and studio. They look straight out of aChristian Girl Autumnmeme – an aesthetic that is years past its-sell by date. Since the pandemic and the outbreak of TikTok, the internet has trended towards idolizing figures who project a more laissez-faire, personalized look. Sure, the couches onCall Her Daddyare millennial pink. But host Alex Cooper undercuts the professionalism of her own set by dressing in sweats and instructing guests like Hailey Bieber: “Walk me through, step by step, your sex with Justin Bieber.”In comparison, when Hines seemed like she might, possibly, be on the verge of making a distant allusion to sex, Miller veered away from the topic by asking her aboutwhat kind of chips she eats.(“Potato chips with ridges,” in case you’re curious, which you’re not.)In her book The Women of the Far Right: Social Media Influencers and Online Radicalization, researcher Eviane Leidig suggests that the performance of authenticity is particularly essential for far-right influencers’ success, because it normalizes them. “What makes these women so appealing is how they present as relatable to viewers,” she writes. “They may be energetic, charming and self-confident, but they are also remarkably down to earth and empathetic.” When they broadcast from their bedrooms, the line between the ordinary and the extreme vanishes.Top womanosphere influencer Brett Cooper likes to film from her house, use erratic graphics and sing Sabrina Carpenter songs (as she defends ICE). She is acting, in a word, cute. Her recent videos have garnered hundreds of thousands of views; Miller is lucky if hers crack 20,000. (Her recent interview with Musk is an exception. As of this writing, it has been viewed more than 400,000 times.)That Katie Miller can’t project that kind of rambunctious appeal is not necessarily a surprise. But it is a growing issue for the Maga movement, which has yet to find a leader who can replicate Trump’s viral charm – or even lay out its principles beyond whatever policy Trump is promoting that day.In its attempt to entice conservative women into Maga, Miller’s podcast runs up against the same problem: it’s hard to convince people to circle the wagons when there’s nothing in the center.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsPodcastsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But she is previewing a revival of his Indian Ink, so he shimmers through the conversation. The way Kendal refers to Stoppard in the present tense tells its own poignant story.Settling into a squishy brown sofa atHampstead theatre, Kendal describes revisiting the 1995 work, developed from a 1991 radio play. “It’s a play that I always thought I’d like to go back to.”Previously starring as Flora Crewe, a provocative British poet visiting 1930s India, she now plays Eleanor Swan, Flora’s sister. We meet Eleanor in the 1980s, fending off an intrusive biographer but uncovering her sister’s rapt and nuanced relationships in India.Kendal claims to have only hazy memories of when she was in the original production: “You wipe a play, you shed things as you go along.” Eleanor was first played by Peggy Ashcroft (in her final radio performance) and Margaret Tyzack. The redoubtable sisters are both “bluestockings”, considers Kendal. “They have very much the same beginning politically – they’re edgy, and they break the rules.” Young Eleanor was a communist, involved with a married politician – but the stern older woman, always with “two kinds of cake on the go”, has become, Kendal suggests, “a little more conservative. Mrs Swan is mourning what has gone. Because she’s lived much longer, there’s a sadness for the past.”View image in fullscreen‘Endlessly ballsy’ … Ruby Ashbourne Serkis (Flora Crewe) and Gavi Singh Chera (Nirad Das) in Indian Ink at Hampstead theatre.Photograph: Johan Persson/The role of Flora passes toRuby Ashbourne Serkis, who sits beside Kendal and describes the character as “endlessly ballsy. She’s an adventurer.” The play, she thinks, is about “saying yes to life, taking chances when you get them, and not letting cloudy days get in the way”. Flora has “learned to not take notice of what people think of her – it’s what I want for myself”.Stoppard is caustic about Britain’s imperial past – “It beats me how we’re getting away with it, darling,” scoffs Flora, “I wouldn’t trust some of them to run theHackneyEmpire.” It’s heady material, lightly worn, though the current cast haven’t dug into the background. “It’s all in the play,” Kendal exclaims. “He [Stoppard] has done the digging, don’t mess yourself up with any more.” Even though the play chimes with her own childhood, she brushes aside any personal resonance. “Don’t do all that therapy about it because you’ll fuck up the text,” she declares. “You don’t need it.”Indian Ink bounces off the page – but is it easy to play? “At first glance, it is effortless but it’s actually super complex,” says Ashbourne Serkis. “A lot of our rehearsal process has been digging to lay those foundations, and then bringing it back to what is there on the surface. It’s such a gift.” For Kendal, the first voice of so many Stoppard roles, you need to “find the style and rhythm. It doesn’t come just by reading it, you’ve got to work out what that music is. Once you get it, you know you’ve got it.”View image in fullscreen‘You’ve got to work out what that music is’ … Felicity Kendal (Flora Crewe) and Art Malik (Nirad Das) in Indian Ink at the Aldwych theatre, London, in 1995.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn other Stoppard plays, Kendal has been an academic (in Arcadia), a spy (Hapgood) and an actor (both The Real Thing and Jumpers). Is there a common thread? She thoughtfully fingers the star of David around her neck. “There are always three or four different things going on at the same time,” she says. “He loves complications.” She mentions the 18th-century watchmaker Jean-Marc Vacheron, hailed as “a master of complications” for his intricate timepieces. “That’s what he [Stoppard] is,” she continues, “a master of complications. There’s no story. It’s an idea, so one of your jobs is to translate his ideas through that person.” The writer had, she says, “a genius brain. It’s heavy stuff, but he lightens it with incredible wit.”Stoppard spent several formative years in India, but insisted: “There’s almost nothing of my experience in [the play], not even indirectly.” Kendal too grew up in India, touring with her parents’ theatre troupe (semi-fictionalised in the film Shakespeare Wallah). Indian Ink is dedicated to her mother, Laura. Her co-star also has actor parents – Lorraine Ashbourne starred in Sally Wainwright’s recent Riot Women and Andy Serkis is famed as Gollum and King Kong. “It was gorgeous being in their dressing rooms, desperately wanting my hair to be done and to be put into big old costumes,” she remembers. “Were they pleased that you were going into the business?” asks Kendal. “It was a bit of an inevitability,” replies the younger actor. And do they often share advice? “The one thing mum says every day is: ‘Just enjoy it, Rubes.’”This production is directed by Jonathan Kent: “He’s got the romance and passion of it,” Kendal says approvingly. Despite his illness, Stoppard revised the text and was “involved in the production as much as he could be”, says Hampstead theatre. During their relationship, did he ever ask Kendal to test out work-in-progress? “Absolutely not,” she says. “Never.” Although a perfect voice (husky, teasing) for his writing, she refutes the idea that she might have been an inspiration. “I don’t think that’s how it works. He wrote what he wanted.”View image in fullscreenFelicity Kendal and Nigel Hawthorne in Hapgood  at the Aldwych theatre, London, in 1988.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAs well as Stoppard, Kendal’s career encompasses new plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Michael Frayn and Simon Gray. Now 79, she has rehearsed with the best. “They’re always very easy,” she says. “They like to be there.” Ashbourne Serkis, who recently premiered David Hare’sGrace Pervadesin Bath, says Hare was “like a little boy, because he was so excited. It’s one of my favourite things, watching him laugh at his own lines.” Kendal agrees that playwrights are the best audience for their own jokes – “they love it!”Shakespeare Wallah: Merchant Ivory’s bittersweet tale of Bollywood and the BardRead moreHare’s previews were a blizzard of rewrites, says Ashbourne Serkis. Was Stoppard similar? “Tom certainly rewrites as he goes along,” says Kendal. “There would be scenes taken out. Endings would be redone.” This was nothing compared with the premiere of Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus,in which she played Constanze Mozart. “Papers were flying everywhere, until eventually Paul Scofield didthis” – a wagging finger, forbidding further tinkering.Death inevitably shadows our conversation, as it does Indian Ink. “It’s one of his more emotional plays,” says Kendal. She enjoys the way it reminds us of Stoppard’s Indian connection. “He was thought of as an English writer but he wasn’t in any manner or form. The artist isn’t owned by anybody. Flora dies, but goes on because of her writing. It’s a lovely play to be doing now – because the artist goes on.”Indian Ink is atHampstead theatre, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreTom StoppardFelicity KendalHampstead theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A 23-minute rollercoaster, it pits a blackguardly timpanist and his stick-wielding allies against a devil-may-care hornist and his brassy backup band. The horn player enters from off stage, the timpanist stalks off in a huff, and somewhere in the middle, for no immediately discernible reason, a phoenix soars aloft in an iridescent haze of tuned percussion. Pappano and the London Symphony Orchestra gave it a thorough workout with marimba, vibraphone, glockenspiel, xylophone and tubular bells creating a magical aura. The musicians certainly revelled in its prickly harmonies, though the theatrical elements might have been pushed further.Walton’s Viola Concerto was premiered in 1929 by Hindemith, no less, and something of the German composer-violist’s taste for brittle counterpoint and sardonic humour lurks beneath its lyrical charm.Antoine Tamestitwas the instinctual soloist here, his limber tone and expressive finger work casting a soulful spell over the pensive opening movement with its dramatic orchestral outbursts. The syncopated scherzo encouraged him to release his inner Puck, but it was the finale – romantic, bracing and tender by turns – that found the sensitive Frenchman at his richest and most expressive.A London Symphony, as Vaughan Williams called his second essay in symphonic form, is an affectionate portrait of the city he knew and loved: a teeming metropolis glimpsed through the mists and fogs that regularly enveloped it. While never short on drama, it was that impressionistic quality that Pappano regularly brought to the fore, drawing parallels throughout with Debussy and, perhaps more surprisingly, Respighi. The breathtaking weightlessness of the opening strings, the haunting street cries, and the bustle of the Embankment at night led inexorably to the vast, aching finale with its palpable aura of fading empire. Superbly played and incisively conducted, this was music at its most soul stirring.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Symphony OrchestraAntonio PappanoBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Seven things you need to know about the music mogul’s new directionThe former X Factor judge is back, auditioning boyband wannabes for his latest talent show – but gen Z doesn’t seem to care very much, or even know who he isElle HuntSat 13 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 00.01 ESTShareHave we gone back in time to 2010? If only! No, Simon Cowell is just back in the headlines, reasserting his svengali status for his new Netflix show. Reviews suggest that Cowell’s attempted comeback, 15 years since his celebrity peak, highlights less his particular star power than how totallythe world has moved on. But is there anything to learn from SyCo now, and will his new boyband work? Let’s see!1. Cowell is chasing anewdirectionSimon Cowell: The Next Act, which hit Netflix on Wednesday, follows Cowell in his bid to put together “the next One Direction”, and do his bit to reassert western dominance in the only sphere that matters: the pop charts! “There hasn’t been a boyband from the UK or America who I think is as exciting as these K-pop artists,” Cowell declares.But while he’s convinced of the “ginormous” opportunity for a “male version of the Spice Girls”, the six-part docuserieshas been widely panned, with reviews describing it as anachronistic and even bleak.Searching for future stars, Cowell labours the importance of open-call auditions, billboard marketing and regional radio promotion. At one point he even slaps wheat paste on a poster himself, hoping for “some media attention” – though he has “always believed radio is the best tool”.View image in fullscreenCowell and his fiancee Lauren Silverman with contestants from Simon Cowell: The Next Act.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Simon Cowell: The Next Act2. Radio may not be the best toolThough physically incapable of furrowing his brow, Cowell has obvious disdain for YouTube, TikTok and the routes devised by young people to get around industry gatekeepers like him. “You’ve got to get out of your bedroom and come along and audition!” he barks during an interview.He is forced to confront his hubris when, one week away from auditions, Cowell learns his campaign has drummed up 160 applications, only 93 of whom are within the eligible age range.After a meeting with a team of digital strategists – who blame everything from the wordy website to teenagers’ short attention spans and Cowell’s lack of name recognition with gen Z (the last revelation meeting with some froideur) – he eventually agrees to engage with new media. “I have met 40 TikTok influencers,” he says later, resignedly.3. Maybe future pop starsshouldbe AICowell kicks off auditions in Liverpool, because of the Beatles (heard of them?) and the city’s “really fun people”. Bright-eyed hopefuls being paraded before a stony-faced Cowell is familiar from decades of The X Factor, American Idol and all the other talent shows that have churned out pop stars.Now, of course, we know the toll taken behind the scenes, and how many of those contestants struggled with the sudden exposure. But The Next Act is about as eager to engage with the costs of fame as Cowell is with the concept of Snapchat.If anything, he ramps up the stakes, promising a more “messy, raw” approach to the talent-show model. The series, cast in a warmNetflixglow, fails to deliver on this – but the open-call auditions retain some of the ritual humiliation of its predecessors.Cowell deems a 20-year-old “a little bit over the line”. Another aspirant is dismissed with: “You just didn’t feel special.” Cowell eventually strides out to instruct the horde of teenagers that he is not interested in “safe and nice”, and they should instead endeavour to be “people with personality”.View image in fullscreenWith One Direction (from left) Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Zayn Malik, in 2013.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic4. Cowell is less interested in self-reflection than successOne talent Cowell famously plucked from obscurity was Liam Payne, who shot to fame in One Direction and later struggled with mental health and substance abuse. The timing of this series, a year after Payne’s death at 31,has beencriticised; though filming began before the tragedy, in October 2024, the glancing tribute featured in the show does not lessen the bad taste.Cowell is clearly emotional, describing his call to Payne’s parents and the “normal and down-to-earth” teenager to whom he gave a standing ovation on The X Factor. The footage of a floppy-haired, 16-year-old Payne – who auditioned twice, after Cowell told him to try again when he was older – is horrible to revisit.Cowell recently toldthe New York Timeshe knew “a little bit” about Payne’s difficulties post-1D and tried to give him advice. But the series shows Cowell’s reckoning with the part he or the industry may have played in Payne’s troubled final years to be fleeting.After weighing up the “gigantic” pressure and stress of being in a boyband, and how he would feel about his 11-year-old son doing the same, Cowell recommits to his new venture, and resumes training a new crop of teenagers for stardom, some as young as 16. “I know how much they want this … I can’t take this opportunity away from them.”5. He’s perhaps not the easiest person to live with …Meanwhile, Cowell is shown to be just as exacting at home in LA with his fiancee (since 2021) Lauren Silverman as in his pursuit of pop greatness. He grumbles at receiving flowers, being “someone who doesn’t like flowers”, and hates all birthdays – “not just his birthday”, Silverman confirms.View image in fullscreenExacting … Cowell with Silverman in episode six of the show.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixSilverman seems to have adapted, however: scrambling to hide paper towels (Simon doesn’t like to see them blighting the kitchen counter) and humouring him as he sits down to half a crumpet for lunch. “I have to save the other half for dinner,” he declares, wearing sunglasses at the table, a yorkshire terrier on his lap.Later, Cowell complains about having to pause his heart-throb hunt to attend his stepson’s end-of-year school prizegiving. “I don’t have to be there for the whole graduation, do I?” he says wearily, while hooked into an IV drip, still wearing sunglasses.Indeed, rather than trusting her fiance will find the time to get married, Silverman changed her name to “Cowell” by deed poll. After all,Cowell reportedly planned four weddingsin 2010 (all to his then-fiancee, the makeup artist Mezhgan Hussainy) – none went ahead.6. … but he plans to stick aroundCowellrecently reassured the Sunthat he has never used weight-loss jabs, instead crediting his physique to good old-fashioned calorie restriction and “between 300 and 600” push-ups a day (sometimes 1,000, if he’s “really going for it”).His unlined face reflects 10 hours’ sleep, the “amazing blue-light glasses” he wears through the night – as well as “thousands” of units of Botox. (He has stopped getting fillers, having realised they made him look “like a real weirdo”.)Cowell also wears brand-new underpants daily and gains an extra inch from a Cuban heel. But his commitment to ageing backwards – he’s 66, but considers himself 64 – is not just skin-deep. Cowell told the Sun he intends to live to 100: “You know, we’re discovering new stuff all the time.”In the meantime, he uses Boots Dual Defence nasal spray daily, and prays each night. “I’m definitely going to heaven.”View image in fullscreenFading svengali? … Cowell with contestants in episode five.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix7. Even Cowell can’t turn back timeEarly in episode one, to impress ignorant gen Z with his credentials, Cowell says he was told (“and I think it’s true”) that he has had more No 1 records than anyone in the music business. The UK Official Charts did not respond to the Guardian’s request for clarification; a spokesperson for the Billboard charts said: “Unfortunately, that is too broad of a question” for them to answer.But the questionable stat foreshadows the series’ real reason for being – not minting the next great boyband, but bolstering Cowell’s fading svengali status. Rather than confront the new cultural landscape, the show presents Cowell’s obstacles as a shortage of appropriately charismatic adolescents, and his own team of yes-men when they say anything other than “yes”.Why is Timothée Chalamet suddenly everywhere? Seven things you need to know – from Oscars to puppiesRead moreSilverman, meanwhile, seems adept at active listening, even as her attempt to engage Cowell in her passion for crystals (which she has hand-delivered to their mansion) is once again derailed by hissingle-minded ambition to get back on top.“If I was making a crystal band …” Cowell says, assessing the crop on display for a “special one”. “I believe you,” Silverman says of his eventual pick. “I believe myself,” Cowell responds.The rest of us might not have returned to 2010, but Cowell seems determined to keep trying. His fiancee, at least, understands. “He just wants to prove to himself and the world that he’s still got it,” Silverman says. “It makes him feel good to know that he is still relevant.”Explore more on these topicsSimon CowellCelebrity crib sheetPop and rockReality TVNetflixTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had night blindness and blind spots in my field of view. At 44, I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic eye condition that causes the retina cells to die. I had always been a very visually oriented person: I was a practising architect, and someone who loved to read, draw, go to the cinema and visit art exhibitions. So when black text disappeared on a glaring white page, films became impossible to follow and artworks only took shape once explained to me, I questioned who I would be without my vision.Around the age of 50, I had a particularly stressful year: I got divorced; dissolved my business; started a new job; moved house; and my dad died. As my life fell off a cliff, so did my eyesight, so that by 2015 my field of vision had decreased to only 5-10 degrees (a healthy average person’s is about 200 degrees). I was registered blind, but for a long time I lived in denial, not telling anyone how much vision I had lost. At work, feeling vulnerable and like I could lose my job, I presented as fully sighted, a daily performance that became exhausting. I was in survival mode, focusing on putting one foot in front of the other, hoping I wouldn’t get found out. I refused to see myself as disabled, and resisted using a white stick, but once I eventually did, I found people saw my disability before they saw me. I felt a total loss of identity. And I stopped doing the cultural things that once brought me joy.As the curtain went up and the three characters appeared on stage, I felt as if I’d got my vision backThree years after that terrible year, I went to the theatre for the first time since losing most of my sight. It wasThe Lehman Trilogyat the National Theatre in London, a play about the Lehman Brothers and the 2008 financial crash. I assumed it would be another frustrating exercise of trying to piece together fragments and failing to follow the action that I’d come to expect whenever I went to the cinema or watched TV. But from the darkness of the circle, as the curtain went up and the three characters appeared on stage, I felt as if I’d got my vision back.The simplicity of Es Devlin’s high-contrast set design, the lighting, the three-man cast, the actors’ silhouettes, the minimal props and the rotating set was a kind of conjuring trick that meant, for the first time in years, I could actually follow what was happening. The cage-like structure on the rotating set was literally pivotal: thanks to the play’s focusing of all the action within this framing device, I didn’t have to consciously think about where to look, and worry about whether I was missing parts of the narrative. The stripped-back staging laid bare the words, the action, the story, the theatre of it.It was total immersion with no barriers, which felt freeing. The feeling was so visceral I didn’t even realise it at the time. I was simply back to being me as I used to be. It was only afterwards that I realised how completely absorbed I had been. I’ve now seen The Lehman Trilogy three times, and at each viewing, I have been able to forget that I am partially sighted. For those three hours and 20 minutes, I was myself again.That first viewing of The Lehman Trilogy was an epiphany, a revelation that the immediacy of live performance gave me the control – I could lock on to the action and follow it in a way that I couldn’t with other visual culture. Not every theatre production manages such complete alchemy as this, but now, pretty much every time I see a play, I become totally connected to the world created on stage. I’ve been given back not just a sense of sight but a sense of self.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

I tend usually not to recommend no-churn ice-creams unless there is booze involved, so this sherry and raisin one is a great candidate (the alcohol stops the ice-cream from becoming too hard and crystallised). And keep the leftover egg whites from the mince pies to make the chestnut and pear meringue, an alternative for theChristmaspudding haters at your table – there is always one. I think it’s important to have at least two puddings at Christmas.Chestnut and pear meringues (pictured top)This is a great make-ahead pudding, because the meringues can be made up to a month in advance and the pears and chocolate sauce five days before. Once assembled, you can keep it in the fridge for a few hours before serving.Prep10 minCoolOvernightCook1 hr 15 minServes8For the meringues100gegg whites(from about 3 eggs)100gsoft light brownsugar100gcastersugarFor the pears4 pears125glight brown soft sugar2tbsp brandy½tsp ground ginger1 cinnamon stick4 strips of lemon zest2tsp vanilla bean pasteFor the chocolate sauce45gcastersugar5gcocoapowder100gchocolate of your choice(54% cocoa solids or above if you prefer it darker), choppedTo serve250g doublecream1tsp vanilla bean paste240g sweetened chestnut purée from a tin(Clément Faugier is my favourite)50gcooked chestnuts, crumbledEdible gold leaf(optional, but recommended)Start by making the meringues (you will need to do this at least the day before you want to serve them). Heat the oven to 120C (110C fan)/250F/gas low and line a large oven tray with baking paper.Whisk the egg whites on high in the bowl of a stand mixer to stiff peaks. Mix the sugars in a second bowl, then, with the mixer running, spoon into the egg whites a dessertspoonful at a time, making sure each one is fully incorporated before adding the next. Once the meringue is nice and glossy, check that the sugar has fully dissolved by rubbing a bit of the meringue between two fingers: if it feels grainy, continue mixing. If not, it’s ready to go.Spoon the meringue into eight mounds on the lined tray, use the back of the spoon to flatten them a little into rounds, then make a swirl on the top. Bake for 30–35 minutes, then turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside overnight. You can then store them in an airtight container for up to a month.Next, poach the pears. Peel and halve each pear, then use a teaspoon to remove the cores and any stringy stems. Put the pears in a saucepan for which you have a lid and that’s large enough so they fit snugly inside. Add water (about 500g) just to cover, then add all the remaining pear ingredients and put the pan on a low heat. Simmer for 20–25 minutes, until the fruit is soft but still holding its shape, then take off the heat and leave to cool in the syrup. The pears can then be decanted into an airtight container and stored in the fridge for up to five days.For the chocolate sauce, mix 100g water, sugar and cocoa in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Simmer for a few minutes, until the sugar dissolves, then take off the heat and stir in the chocolate until it melts and you have a smooth, glossy sauce. This sauce can now be stored in the fridge for up to five days.To assemble, bring the chocolate sauce up to room temperature. Whip the cream and vanilla bean paste to soft peaks. Spoon 30g of the chestnut puree over each meringue and spread it out to the edges. Spoon on a tablespoon of the chocolate sauce and let it drip down the sides a little. Dollop a generous tablespoon of whipped cream on top of the chocolate.Put half a poached pear on top of the cream and press it down gently. Finish with a crumble of cooked chestnuts and a little gold leaf, if using, then store in the fridge for up to three hours before serving.Sherry and raisin ice-creamView image in fullscreenFlora Shedden’s sherry and raisin ice-cream.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian. Food and prop styling: Florence Blair. Food styling assistant: Emma Cantlay.Mum made a very decadent version of this last Hogmanay, and it was so perfect I vowed to recreate it. The recipe was taken out of a magazine and I think the cutting was soon lost in the new year, so I have had to improvise. When testing, my dad, a keen rum-and-raisin fan, declared that this was actually very good. Which, if you know my dad, is the highest of praise.Prep15 minSoak2 hr+Freeze6 hr+Makes2 litres225graisins150g sherry(I like to use a fino or very dry one), plus extra to serveFinely grated zest of ½ orange½ nutmeg,finely grated600gdoublecream397gtincondensed milk2tsp vanilla bean pasteAmaretti, to serveA few hours before making the ice-cream, and ideally the night before, soak the raisins. Put them in a small airtight container, cover with the sherry and add the orange zest and nutmeg. Stir to combine, then seal and leave the raisins to absorb the sherry; don’t worry, there will still be some liquid left.To make the ice-cream, mix the cream, condensed milk and vanilla bean paste in a large bowl. Whisk with a hand mixer until the mix thickens to soft peaks, then fold in the soaked raisins and any remaining sherry, and mix until well combined. Spoon into a 2kg airtight container, seal and freeze for at least six hours.Serve with amaretti biscuits crushed on top and/or a drizzle more sherry, if you fancy.Fig and hazelnut crumble mince piesView image in fullscreenFlora Shedden’s fig and hazelnut crumble mince pies.This makes 12 mince pies, but I always recommend doubling this up as 12 never seem to last long enough in our house.Prep10 minChill30 minCook50 min, plus coolingMakes12For the pastry125gbutter100gicingsugar, plus extra to serve250gplainflour, plus extra for dusting2 egg yolksFor the filling110gdried figs, stalks removed, flesh chopped400gmincemeat30gbrandyFor the crumble75ghazelnuts, roughly chopped50goats25gsoft light brownsugar25gbutterTo serveBrown sugar brandy butter, or clotted creamFirst, make the pastry. Put all the ingredients apart from the egg yolks in a food processor and blitz on high speed until the mixture hasa crumble-like consistency (alternatively, do this by hand, working the butter into the flour and sugar until you have a sand-like texture). Stop the machine, scrape down the sides and blitz again, stopping when the mixture just starts to come together into a dough.Add the egg yolks, then work gently to bring the dough together.Flatten the dough into a rough circle about 2cm thick. This helps chill the dough faster and makes it easier to roll out. Wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (and for up to three days).For the filling, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.When you’re ready to bake, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Take the pastry out of the fridge and leave tit o come to room temperature for 15 minutes.Lightly dust a work surface with flour, then roll out the dough to 2–3mm thick. Use a 10cm pastry cutter to cut out 12 discs, re-rolling any scraps as needed. Lightly flour a 12-hole muffin tin and press a disc into each hole, using your fingers to get it into the corners. Trim off any excess pastry and put in a bowl with any pastry offcuts you have from rolling.To make the crumble, add the chopped hazelnuts, oats, sugar and butter to the pastry offcuts, then mix with your hands until you have a chunky crumble.Divide the mincemeat filling between the tart cases, then spoon the crumble on top. Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the crumble is golden brown and the pastry is cooked through. Remove and leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then lift out gently with a fine knife and transfer to a rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, generously dusted with icing sugar and a good dollop of brandy butter or clotted cream. The pies will keep in an airtight container for up to two weeks.These recipes are edited extracts from Winter in the Highlands, by Flora Shedden, published by Quadrille at £26.

It might be too lofty to say that this semifreddo is divine, but the combination of Hobnobs, ricotta, chocolate and amaretto really does it for me. That said, there are many alliances that can be formed in theChristmasstore-cupboard, so use this as a base for any biscuits, dried fruit and chocolate to which you feel most spiritually aligned.Christmas ricotta semifreddoYou’ll need a large loaf tin, baking tin or tub with an approximately 1.8 litre capacity that’s suitable for the freezer (or two smaller tins). Semifreddo melts quicker than ice-cream, so be sure not to leave it out for too long before or after serving (if there’s any left, that is).Prep10 minCook30 minFreeze6 hr+Soften15 minServes83 medium eggs75g runny honey, plus extra to drizzle75g caster sugar250g ricotta400ml double cream2 tsp ground cardamom75ml amaretto(5 tbsp)¼ tsp fine sea salt60g stem ginger in syrup, cut into irregular 2mm-thick slices60g dark chocolate, very finely chopped, plus extra to decorate100g Hobnobs, or ginger snap biscuits, finely chopped, plus extra to decorate30g mixed chopped candied citrus peelLine your tin or tub with baking paper. Separate the egg yolks and whites into two large bowls, then whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks. Shake off the beaters (but don’t wash them).Put the honey and sugar in the egg yolk bowl, whisk until pale and creamy, then add the ricotta and whisk to combine. Again, shake off the beaters but don’t rinse them.Fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture a bit at a time – and gently, so as not to whack out any air. Rinse out the egg white bowl, add the double cream and whip to soft peaks.Add the cardamom, amaretto and salt to the whipped cream, then whisk to soft peaks. Fold the cream into the egg and ricotta mixture, then gently fold in the chopped ginger, chocolate, biscuits and mixed peel.Transfer the mixture to the lined tub or tin, smooth out the top with the back of a spoon, then cover the top with a sheet of baking paper. Freeze for at least six hours, until solid.Take the semifreddo out of the freezer 15 minutes before serving. Put a couple of biscuits in a mortar, then crush to a fine-ish crumb (or bash with a rolling pin on a board). Peel the top layer of baking paper off the semifreddo, then invert it on to a platter. Carefully peel off the second sheet of paper, then evenly sprinkle the crushed biscuits over the semifreddo. Grate on the extra chocolate, drizzle with more honey, then cut into slices and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodMeera Sodha recipesDessertIce-cream and sorbetChristmas food and drinkChristmasCheeseItalian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

The couple handed over the keys at the drop-off site and were driven to the terminal – and that was the last they saw of their car. On their return they were informed by the company it had been stolen.Their case comes as airports and police forces are warning travellers to be wary of “unofficial” operators advertising cheap long-stay parking after a rise in complaints.Returning holidaymakers have been reporting vehicles that have been damaged, burgled or stolen while in the care of meet-and-greet companies.Some have received penalty charge notices (PCNs) for parking breaches while their cars were in supposedly secure compounds, while others were left stranded at the arrivals terminal when their meet-and-greet service failed to materialise.Anyone can set up as a parking operator and trade legally, provided they are not in breach of airline bylaws. The unscrupulous companies usually do not have contracts with landowners. Some operators “moonlight” from the car parks of airport hotels – where customers are directed to drop off their cars – and then dump the vehicles on land outside the airport perimeter, including on construction sites and in fields.View image in fullscreenSome motorists received PCNs for parking breaches while their cars were in supposedly secure compounds.Photograph: Alan Novelli/AlamyBaxter used a comparison website, Compare Your Parking, to find a long-stay deal. He clicked a recommended option, Heathrow Park & Ride, and paid £109 for three weeks’ parking at a secure site. Almost a month later he was informed that his booking had been amended, and the service provider would now be a company called Park At Airport Ltd. The drop-off location was the car park of the Heathrow Holiday Inn, where he was met by an agent in a car. The paperwork was completed in the boot.On the couple’s return to the UK, they called the number provided and were promised they would be met in the arrivals hall and taken to their car.“They didn’t come,” Baxter says. “I had to phone them again five times. Eventually, they called to inform me that my car had been stolen, along with seven others.”Baxter is now pursuing a claim through his insurer that has been classed as “at fault”. He says: “I feel that I am being made to feel like the guilty party, while the car park company seems as if it can walk away and carry on trading with no consequences.”Customer reviews of Park At Airport onTrustpilotsuggest similar experiences. Some report the theft of their vehicle, lost keys or receiving PCNs for parking breaches or unpaid ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ) charges.Park At Airport blamed vehicle and key thefts on organised criminal gangs and said it was cooperating with a police investigation. It said that the matter of PCNs being issued to customers was being resolved. “We make it clear that vehicles may be moved between compounds,” a spokesperson said. “Unfortunately, there was a recent security breach that affected a relatively small number of customers. Since then, we have implemented enhanced security measures across all our compounds.”Sussex police told the Guardian it had closed the investigation because of a lack of evidence. “Officers remain aware of ongoing concerns in the local area about the practices of some parking providers,” a spokesperson said. “They continue to work closely with the relevant authorities, including trading standards, to address these issues.”Aninvestigation last year into airport meet-and-greet companiesby the consumer group Which? found that some comparison websites operate in cahoots with unscrupulous parking firms.“Rogue operators are often prominently listed in search engine results and on some comparison sites. With generic names that change as soon as they attract poor reviews, consumers can easily be caught out,” says the Which? travel expert Guy Hobbs. “In some cases we believe the comparison site and provider to be one and the same.”Which? recently publisheda useful guideto the best, and cheapest, on-site and off-site parking options at UK airports.A dummy booking on Compare Your Parking, the typo-laden comparison site used by Baxter, produced quotes from a range of providers with official-sounding names such as Heathrow Park & Ride and unattributed four- or five-star reviews. In some cases, when we looked, customers had to click through to the small print to discover that the contract was with a differently named company. The companies checked out by the Guardian had one-star reviews on Trustpilot, with customers reporting unsafe storage compounds, theft and damage.Compare Your Parking is the trading name of Compare Travel Services Ltd, whose director was previously linked to a meet-and-greet service called Wizpark, which attracted some critical reviews from customers on social media. The company did not respond to our requests for a comment.Heathrow airport this year signed up to a new quality-control initiative designed to vet member parking operators after scores of complaints from scam victims. Theapproved meet and greet parking operator scheme”(AM-GO), launched by the British Parking Association, is supported by Police Crime Prevention Initiatives and requires member companies to uphold a code of practice. Birmingham airport has also joined the scheme.Most airports do not yet have a list of approved parking operators. Travellers should read reviews of providers before booking and check they bear thePark Marklogo, which shows that their facilities have passed police safety checks. And if a deal is significantly cheaper than average, beware, as there is probably a catch.* Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMotoringTravel & leisureCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

This does not bode wellTim DowlingSat 13 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 12.33 ESTShareOn Wednesday afternoon I receive a text that seems to suggest the band I’m in has been invited to play live on national radio. Twenty minutes later, the guitarist rings me.“Did you get my text?” he says.“I’m still staring at it,” I say. “Saturday as in this Saturday?”“Yeah,” he says. “Are you up for it?”“My heart is pounding just from the text,” I say.Within a few hours the thing is confirmed – at such short notice only four of us are available, which is coincidentally the maximum number of musicians the studio can accommodate. I am one of them.We're on a slot where musicians interpret football chants – or, in our case, cricket chants. But the opportunity to rehearse is limited, and the risk of disaster is highWe’ve played live on the radio before, under many different and challenging circumstances. But we were always playing one of our own songs – a song we knew and had played correctly many times before.On this occasion, however, we are to appear on a regular slot where musicians interpret football chants – or, in our case, cricket chants. Even that should be easy: after all, drunk cricket fans manage to sing them without difficulty. But the opportunity to rehearse is limited, and the risk of disaster seems high.“That’s why we do these things,” says the guitarist when three of us meet on Thursday afternoon, at the fiddle player’s house.“Is it?” I say.We sit and listen to the original song on which the first chant is based: Sloop John B, by the Beach Boys. We have a protracted argument about how our version should start. There follows an inaugural run-through, and a short silence.“Jesus Christ,” says the fiddle player.“My part is very high for me,” I say.“It’ll be fine,” says the guitarist.We have another run-through, followed by an argument about how it should end. We resolve a couple of clashing notes in the harmony, and I am told where not to play the banjo. We change the beginning, and then change it back again. We use a phone to record a version to send to the drummer – the fourth member of the quartet – but make so many mistakes it takes us six attempts.There’s something I occasionally tell audiences when things go wrong on stage. “This is all part of it,” I say, trying to convince them that this bum note, or that broken string, or my decision to play the first four bars of a song in a different key to everyone else – all of that is intentional. We do it this way in every show. But what I’m really saying is: these mistakes, that’s part of what makes it live. In a way, the mistakes are what we’re all here for.I look down at my fingers on the strings, wondering if I can reasonably expect them to act when the time comesI do not think this will work on the radio.“Should we try the next song?” says the fiddle player. Once again, we argue about how it should start. I make a particular fuss about the guitar intro.“No,” I say. “It’s three climbing notes on the A-string, then the chord.”“Like this?” said the guitarist, playing.“Not quite,” I say. “It’s more like …”“I have an idea,” says the guitar player, holding out his instrument. “You play the guitar.”“Wait,” I say, “I don’t …”“That way I can concentrate on singing,” he says.I look at the guitar, thinking: this is even more of a high-wire act now, and it’s all your fault.Tim Dowling: disaster strikes at a gig – they laugh at my jokesRead moreOn Saturday morning we meet in the reception of Broadcasting House to have our instruments X-rayed. A few minutes later we’re escorted to a green room, and then to a studio: four stools before four microphones. The presenter of the programme, Patrick Kielty, is in Belfast, but we can hear him in our headphones, interviewing his previous guests. My heart is pounding, as it has been for the past 72 hours.A light in the studio comes on. My mouth goes dry, and my vision becomes tunnel-like. As I hear the drummer count off the first number, I look down at my fingers on the strings, wondering if I can reasonably expect them to act when the time comes.When I next look up at the big clock, 10 minutes have passed. Someone in my headphones is reading the news.“How was that for you?” says the guitarist.“I think it was all right,” I say. “Did I say anything?”“Yeah, you talked,” he says.“I already don’t remember most of it,” I say.“You can listen back to the whole thing when you get home,” he says.“No I can’t,” I say. A door opens, and a producer steps in.“That was great, guys!” he says. “I’ll email you a link to the video when we put it up.”“There’s a video?” I say.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We embedded with Lancashire county council to find out what happens when rhetoric meets realityHelen PiddSat 13 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShare22 May 2025: a new dawn for Lancashire. Outside Preston’s grand old county hall, 53 brand new Reform UK councillors in turquoise ties – and one petite woman with an enormous turquoise hair bow – are hot-footing it past a gaggle of protesters for their first full council meeting. Most keep their heads down and get into the building as quickly as possible. But Joel Tetlow, a first-time politician who has made a few unfortunate headlines before even taking his seat, is intrigued. He stands in the doorway, vaping, as a demonstrator bellows: “Reform is a far right party andNigel Farageis a racist and a fascist!”Tetlow – late 40s with a full head of vertiginous hair, wearing a powder-blue three-piece suit – insists he isn’t bothered. “They don’t know us as people,” he shrugs. “It’s a word that’s slung around now so much, to be a racist. You know, what is it to be a racist? All we want to do is stand for our country, look after the people within it. So we’re not racist. None of us are racist.” (Farage, too, has denied accusations of racism, and Reform dispute that they are a far right party.)The protesters are entitled to their opinions, he concedes. “But one thing they don’t understand is that all this is bringing the profile of Reform higher every day.” Voters realise that Reform’s opponents are “just loony left”, he says. “There’s no such thing as bad publicity, as they say.”It’s an interesting take from a chap whose first taste of the limelight after the local election washaving to explain a Hitler memehe’d posted on Facebook. It featured a picture of the Führer looking at a map, with the caption: “Why don’t we invade them slowly? A few men at a time in small boats.” The accompanying text then read: “Let’s be grateful this idea was never put to him ... or the world as we know it would be a whole lot different.” He took the post down but defended its meaning. Daily boats showed “no signs of abating”, he noted, adding: “We do not know who these people are, and I was likening it to an invasion. Just as in Greece they used a wooden horse to sneak into Troy during the Trojan war, disguising their soldiers inside.”Tetlow is perhaps exactly the sort of person Reform’s opponents might expect to find in Nigel Farage’s turquoise army: a keyboard warrior witha Millwall vibe(“No one likes us, we don’t care”). But after spending seven months monitoring Reform’s Lancastrian takeover I’ve learned to put preconceptions to one side. The party is full of surprises. Take Tetlow’s day job: he’s a renewable energy consultant. Among his colleagues in Lancashire there is a neuroscientist, a radiographer, a truck driver, a barber, an accountant, two nurses, a criminal law barrister and a milkman.View image in fullscreenReform’s Joel Tetlow.Photograph: Duncan Elliott/The GuardianWith dozens of polls now suggesting Farage is heading for Downing Street, it’s important to know what happens when Reform UK takes power. In May’s local elections in England, the party won10 of the 23 councils up for grabsand 41% of all contested seats. Lancashire was as good a place as any to see how this would play out: as an exiled Lancastrian, living just over the border in Greater Manchester, I retain a special interest in the red rose county.Lancashire has a bit of everything. There are deprived seaside resorts such as Blackpool and Morecambe, where I grew up – northern versions of Farage’s Clacton seat. But also multicultural towns such as Blackburn and Burnley; swathes of farmland, plus the natural beauty of the Lune and Ribble Valleys and the Forest of Bowland. Rural and urban, rich and poor, it is the perfect location to put Reform’s offer to the test. Will their anti-woke agenda melt into insignificance once they are in charge of a £2bn budget and responsible for the safety of the most vulnerable children in society as well as caring for a rapidly ageing population – not to mention libraries, schools and roads? Will they crash and burn when exposed to the harsh realities of local government? Or prove more competent than anyone expected?Reform won Lancashire on a remarkably flimsy policy platform. Though many candidates spent much of their time posting anti-immigration rhetoric on social media, they were vague about what they would actually change as councillors, perhaps because many of them didn’t understand what a county council can and can’t do.They promised to “cut bloated salaries” – notably the £236,960 paid to the council’s chief executive – as well as “woke spending”. They pledged to freeze council tax and fix “all” potholes. They said no to four-day weeks – “Public servants should work full-time for full pay, like you do” – and vowed to reintroduce weekly bin collections, something out of the council’s control.Some of the new councillors seem to have totally different priorities from the party’s leadership. I get chatting to Ellie Close, councillor for Leyland South. She says that more than anything else, she wants to speed up diagnoses for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). “If we can fix that, and that’s the only thing we manage to fix in the next four years, I would still say that’s a success,” she says. I say that’s interesting,given Farage’s views on the “overdiagnoses” of Sendwhich he said was “creating a class of victims”. She looks shocked and asks me to repeat it. “I’m not really sure what to say to that,” she says, “because I’ve got personal experience with it. I think it’s something that we need to currently look at.”It’s clear that following Reform in Lancashire is going to be an interesting ride.In his opening speech to the chamber in May, the new council leader, Stephen Atkinson, saysReform UKhave “been given the mandate for change”. Which is a bit rum considering he was a Tory until March, having previously led the lower tier Ribble Valley district council, where he was, in fact, in charge of bins, as well as running a business selling furniture to schools. He promises “the highest levels of professionalism and courtesy”. Balancing the budget will be tricky, he warns, saying the council is £1.2bn in debt and must find £100m of savings in the next two years.View image in fullscreenCounty council leader Stephen Atkinson.Photograph: Duncan Elliott/The GuardianView image in fullscreenAtkinson welcomes Nigel Farage to county hall in Preston in June this year.Photograph: National World/SWNSIn addition to Atkinson, just three of Reform’s Lancashire councillors have done the job before, also for the Conservatives. But Atkinson insists that real-world experience is more important than local authority service, as he unveils his all-male cabinet (none of Reform’s nine female councillors make the top table). He puts a former executive at the motoring organisation the AA in charge of transport, gives a mental health nurse the health brief, and – in a decision that has subsequently been questioned – makes the owner of a private care company the cabinet member for adult social care.For the first few months, Reform say a lot but do little. They remove the word “climate change” from one of the council departments, freeze their own salaries and quietly accept that they can’t actually force the chief executive to take a pay cut. One afternoon they passa free speech motionthat seems to be an excuse to bring up grooming gangs made up of predominantly Asian men, saying: “Baroness Casey’s recent audit on group-based child sexual exploitation and abuse highlighted denial and avoidance of ethnicity issues, supporting the need to encourage a speak-up culture.” On another, they vote toplay the national anthemat the start of each full council meeting.In June, Farage arrives for a visit and says the “first saving” should be the scrapping of a £520,000 contract to provide “ergonomic chairs” for Lancashire county council staff, most of whom, he claims, work from home (local reporterslater reveal that just £20,000 has so far been spent on fancy chairs). He says Reform’s unit of cost-cutters modelled on Donald Trump’s “Doge” initiative will arrive at county hall the following week. They never even cross the threshold after a row over data protection regulations.In July, Reform introduce anew flags policy, declaring that the council will now prioritise “only the union flag, the flag of England, the Lancashire flag, royal flags, and military flags and ensigns”. In other words: no pride flag, no rainbow flag. One Lib Dem councillor suggests Reform are “dishonouring” the lives of trans people like the murdered teenager, Brianna Ghey, but Atkinson gives him short shrift. “This country is more fragmented than it’s ever been, and we need to come together as a country,” he says. “Free speech is an individual situation that should be defended absolutely. So if you want to wear a pride lanyard, so be it. That is your choice. This is a civic institution that should be concentrating on providing public services, not being overly political for frustrated people who couldn’t become MPs.”They regard us as a kind of model council in Reform central officeReform talk a lot about free speech but have remarkably thin skins. One day, I arrive at a cabinet meeting to find a furious Ged Mirfin, lead member for resources, HR and property – a boring job title that disguises the fact that as far as I can tell, he is in charge of trying to cut jobs, sell off buildings and lead the war on woke. He is fuming because the Lancashire Evening Post has done some Photoshopping on its front page to make it look like Atkinson is wielding a chainsaw, Elon Musk-style. The editor “really ought to apologise, it’s disgraceful”, fumes Mirfin. (The editor declines to apologise).Mirfin has a striking appearance, with longish grey hair slicked back like Nick Cave. He wears a ring on every finger – a nod to his days as a heavy metal roadie for a band he has forbidden me from naming “because they’d hate to be associated with Reform”. He likes to present himself as a bit of a rogue. One day I compliment him on his tartan scarf and he says it was “a present from one of my lady friends”. Plural. Sometimes I wonder if he is trolling me. We have a pub lunch and he orders a pint and a pie and chips “with none of that extra stuff”. He means vegetables.View image in fullscreenGed Mirfin, lead member for resources, HR and property.Photograph: Duncan Elliott/The GuardianHe is deliberately provocative, once standing up in a debate about local government reorganisation to pay homage to Enoch Powell, whom he calls “a very prescient individual”. Mirfin does not like government plans to simplify Lancashire’s muddle of district, unitary and county councils by replacing them with two or three single-tier authorities. It would be the same mistake as the UK joining the EU, he suggests, something Powell opposed, back in the 70s.“I agree with Enoch,” he tells the council chamber. “Enoch said that local identity and national identity were much more important than economic efficiency, and that’s the concern that I have. In future years, when residents get asked to pay more and more council tax going forward they’ll get more and more disenchanted. If you think the Reform revolution was strong now, you just wait for a couple of years’ time – it’s going to be even stronger.”After leaving the rock’n’roll lifestyle behind, Mirfin was an academic and then chief data officer for the North West Development Agency, before sitting as a Tory councillor in Ribble Valley for 15 years. He loves data and is an AI evangelist, telling me in great detail about special “AI camera technology” that Reform has installed on Lancashire’s bin lorries to work out exactly how many potholes the county has. He is very excited about two new pothole-filling machines the council is leasing from a Blackburn firm called Multevo “which can do a day’s work in two hours”.He claims to be working 18-hour days, rising at six to pore over spreadsheets and working straight through until 1am. I go to his office and on the white board he is keeping a running tally of how many HMOs (houses of multiple occupancy) each area of Lancashire has. HMOs are a Reform obsession, along with asylum hotels. They are powerless to stop the latter, as they find out within a few weeks of taking power when a local hotel,the Tickled Trout, closes to paying customers and Afghan refugees move in. So they’re now more focused on HMOs, which they claim are hotbeds of crime and illegality, saying that “family homes” are being stuffed full of undocumented “fighting-age males” who terrorise communities and frighten women.While other Reform councils have made unhelpful headlines by, for example, appointinga teenage leader(Warwickshire) or someone who thinks you get your backbenchers on side by telling them to“fucking suck it up” (Kent), Mirfin says Farage and his lieutenants see Lancashire as a beacon. “They regard us as a kind of model council in Reform central office,” he claims, particularly when it comes to cost-cutting and restructuring. Now he’s looked at the books, things are even worse than Reform thought when they took the reins, he says: they need to find £75m of savings in the next year, £95m the year after and £133m the year after that: a whopping £303m package of cuts by 2029. The full impact of this will only be revealed in their budget next year, but in late November Reform identify£21.9m of initial savings, over a three-year period. Most come from not filling vacancies, reducing reliance on agency workers and streamlining procurement, as well as cutting council grants. But they also plan to go big on AI, claiming it offers “productivity gains of nearly 100,000 hours”. In the council’s two most expensive departments, adult and children’s social services, they think they can make big savings by using AI prompts to speed up assessments for children applying for EHCPs (education and health care plans) and adults needing care.View image in fullscreenThe Reform contingent vote during a meeting last month.Photograph: Duncan Elliott/The GuardianI ask Mirfin if they will have to raise council tax to balance the books, and he refuses to answer. “I’m not going to deliver the budget here. You’ll have to wait for that, but I think you can probably guess.”I guess that they will raise it by the maximum 4.99%. He doesn’t deny it. “Reform’s challenge at a local level in Lancashire is to show competency and to show that we can actually manage a big council with a budget of over £2bn a year,” he says. What they’re doing in Lancashire, he says, is “localising Reform’s policy agenda … It’s about forensically saving money, it’s about challenging orthodoxy, it’s challenging the whole DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] regime, it’s civic pride.”At a meeting in October, he announces that the cabinetwill be rewritingthe council’s inclusion and fairness policy, “so that DEI doesn’t spread to any further within the organisation”, he says. He claims “there are 18 substantive DEI posts within LCC costing the organisation £1m, more or less. There are also 2,219 roles whereby a significant minority of the job function of LCC employees are related to DEI activities.” Never mind that those roles include things like social workers and youth workers (basically anyone whose job description includes any reference to diversity). All in all, it is costing LCC £37.5m, he claims: money that could be better spent elsewhere.Samara Barnes, one of the Labour councillors and a persistent thorn in Reform’s side, stands up. She is wearing a Choose Love T-shirt supporting a refugee charity, exposing tattoo-covered arms. “I don’t think it is at all appropriate for a cabinet of all white men to be making decisions about inclusion,” she says. “That is not what inclusion is.” She is heckled by several Reform councillors who call her a racist.View image in fullscreenLabour’s Samara Barnes.Photograph: Duncan Elliott/The GuardianAfter the meeting, a young guy called Tom Pickup edits a clip of Barnes’s intervention to make it sound as if she doesn’t think white men should be allowed to make decisions full stop – it goes viral. “And the comments below it were awful. Very much, ‘She’s racist, she is sexist. She needs stringing up’,” says Barnes.Pickup says he edited the video “for brevity” and that he removed it on learning that Barnes was upset.Tetlow posts a message on Barnes’s Facebook page telling her: “We enjoyed putting you in your place. Point of order!! You are racist. If we singled out a panel of men or women that was all coloured, would we be racist? Because you call us racist and you are the biggest of them all. People get roles on merit. Not colour, not gender … It’s our house and you playing our game now. You’re just along for the ride.”A few days later, Tetlow appears in Preston crown court, summoned by a judge to explain why he failed to turn up for jury duty, having previously deferred it three times because he was too busy being a councillor. His latest excuse is an unusual one, but washes with the judge.He sayshe missed his last jury service on doctor’s orders: he was recuperating after a trip to Turkey for an eyelid lift to correct “overlapping hooded eyes”, which would “cause sweat to run into his eyes when he was reading, and sting”,according to the court reportin the local paper.Pickup, meanwhile,is suspended from Reformafter it emerges he’s been a member of a WhatsApp group where one member allegedly called for a “mass Islam genocide”, encouraging others to stockpile weapons to attack “lefties” and “migrants”. Confronted, he admits to being in the group but says “99% of what occurs in groups, I don’t see.”Things start to get crunchy for Reform in Lancashire when they launch a consultation on closing five local authority old people’s homes and day centres and moving residents into the private sector. The buildings are dilapidated, they’re not fit for purpose and they’ll cost millions to fix, is essentially the argument. And they reckon they can make £4m “selling off the family silver”, as one Labour councillor puts it. The idea immediately provokes controversy and a flurry of bad press, largely thanks to a 92-year-old resident of one of the homes earmarked for closure, who becomes the face and voice of the campaign to keep them open.View image in fullscreenProtesters attend a county council meeting last month. They are angry about the future of Favordale care home in Colne – one of five threatened with closure.Photograph: Duncan Elliott/The GuardianI visit Dorothy Devereux at Woodlands in Clayton-le-Moor near Accrington, where she has lived for 12 years in a cosy room surrounded by family photographs. The former nurse is “devastated, angry, frustrated” at the thought of being evicted, and cries as she says: “I’ve always said I’m staying here till I’m either dead or forcibly removed, and that’s how I feel.” Woodlands is not just a building, she says:“This is my home. I sold my home to pay to live here..” She is doubtful that any money will be saved by shunting her and other residents into the private sector, and is worried about the fate of the 70 staff, whom she describes as “angels”.We meet just after Farage announces plans for government that include abolishing indefinite leave to remain and deporting hundreds of thousands of people, maybe more. She’s worried that Reform’s proposals could see many of her “angels” deported: “They want to send all the people that have worked here back where they came from. If no people from abroad worked here, it couldn’t run.” Her daughter, Frances Duxbury, writes to Jordan Fox, the local Reform councillor, and receives an unexpected reply. It turns out his grandmother is also a resident. “Having visited Woodlands multiple times, I believe it is an excellent facility,” he writes, before explaining that he “has no choice but to personally distance myself from the decision-making process. As a county councillor, I am expected to act impartially and without bias.”Fox excuses himself from the relevant scrutiny committee. In his place he sends … Joel Tetlow, who tries and fails to stop opposition councillors from asking questions, by saying, “If these were normal councillors that would be fine, but these are the councillors who have whipped up a lot of this issue throughout the county.”View image in fullscreenLabour’s Kim Snape.Photograph: Duncan Elliott/The GuardianAmong them is Kim Snape, a Labour councillor whose patch includes Grove House, another of the homes earmarked for closure. She had been asking questions on Facebook about a potential conflict of interest involving the cabinet member in charge of adult social care – former church minister Rev Graham Dalton, who runs a private care company with his wife. Dalton “didn’t like it”, Snape tells me, and threatened her with legal action. She accuses Dalton of behaving in a very un-Christian way, liking posts on Facebook that mock her appearance, including one that said “Just look at the state of it!” with lots of poo emojis. Snape’s hands aren’t entirely clean, with one of her posts about Dalton containing a montage of images including that of a placard depicting him with devil’s horns.Dalton says he has been advised that his company ownership amounts to neither a pecuniary (financial) or non-pecuniary interest, but Snape believes questions remain. For example: “If [a resident’s] family members had to take their loved one out of Grove House and needed to fund private home care provision, if they phoned up his company, would that business be turned down?” A spokesperson for LCC says the services provided by Dalton’s company fall under healthcare – such as clinical nursing support – which is distinct from the social care services commissioned by the county council.For all their talk about fighting the “woke blob” and bringing common sense back to British politics, it is how Reform handle these human battles that will ultimately decide whether voters judge Farage fit to move into Downing Street. They can mess about with flags and play the national anthem and rail against DEI all they like. But if they shut down your mum’s nursing home, will you vote for them?Sitting at the back of the meeting with a big St George’s flag is Phil Price, whose 93-year-old mother lives in Grove House. He believes Dalton does stand to benefit from the care home closures. “I’ll be honest with you,” he tells me. “I’m a paid-up member of Reform and I’m disgusted with him. I wrote to him [Dalton], I wrote to Nigel Farage, because I thought they were going to come and change everything. And all they’re doing is coming in and tearing people’s lives apart.”I put it to him that Reform did make clear they were going to make cuts in Lancashire, to save money and eliminate “waste”: “If there are parents who have paid into the system all their lives, worked hard for this country, if they’re waste, then we might as well just give up,” he says. I ask him why he voted Reform. “I thought it was going to change Great Britain for the good. You know, to stop all the boats and everything coming in, and to be fair to the people who’ve paid into the system, who’ve lived here all their lives. All politicians, they’re all in it for themselves, I think. I was really excited about them and now I’m disillusioned.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageLocal elections 2025LincolnshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

All the victims are Bangladeshi nationals, serving in the UN interim security force for Abyei (Unisfa).“Attacks targetingUnited Nationspeacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law,” said Guterres, who called for those responsible for the “unjustifiable” attack to be held accountable.The Sudanese military blamed the attack on the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a notorious paramilitary group that has been at war with the army for control of the country for more than two years. There was no immediate comment from the RSF.The attack “clearly reveals the subversive approach of the rebel militia and those behind it”, the military said. It posted a video on social media showing plumes of dense black smoke over what it said was the UN facility.UK imposes sanctions on four RSF officers for ‘heinous’ mass killings in SudanRead moreThe oil-rich Abyei is a disputed region between Sudan andSouth Sudan, and the UN mission has been deployed there since 2011, when South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan.Guterres also called for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan to allow “a comprehensive, inclusive and Sudanese-owned political process” to settle the conflict in the north-east African country.Sudan was plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country. The conflict has killed more than 40,000 people – a figure rights groups consider a significant undercount.The fighting has recently centred on Kordofan, particularly since theRSF took control of El Fasher, the military’s last stronghold in the western region of Darfur.The war has wrecked urban areas and has beenmarked by atrocities, including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings which the UN and rights groups have said amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur.The war has also created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and pushed parts of the country into famine.Explore more on these topicsSudanSouth SudanAfricaUnited NationsAntónio GuterresMiddle East and north AfricaDarfurnewsShareReuse this content"

He also said the US was engaging with all sides “to urge restraint and to avoid further escalation”.The rebels’ latest offensive comes despite a US-mediatedpeace agreement signed last weekby the Congolese and Rwandan presidents in Washington.The accord didn’t include the rebel group, which is negotiating separately with Congo and agreed earlier this year to a ceasefire that both sides accuse the other of violating. However, it obliges Rwanda to halt support for armed groups such as M23 and work to end hostilities.The rebels’ advance pushed the conflict to the doorstep of neighbouringBurundi, which has maintained troops in eastern Congo for years, heightening fears of a broader regional spillover.Congo’s ministry of communication confirmed in a statement on Friday that M23 had seized the strategic port city of Uvira in eastern Congo, on the northern tip of Lake Tanganyika and directly across from Burundi’s largest city, Bujumbura.Uvira was Congo’s government’s last major foothold in South Kivu after the provincial capital, Bukavu, fell to the rebels in February. Its capture allows the rebels to consolidate a broad corridor of influence across the east.M23 said it had taken control of Uvira on Wednesday afternoon, after a rapid offensive since the start of the month. Along with the more than 400 killed, about200,000 have been displaced, regional officials say.Civilians fleeing eastern Congo have also crossed into Burundi, and there have been reports of shells falling in the town of Rugombo, on the Burundian side of the border, raising concerns about the conflict spilling over into Burundian territory.More than 100 armed groups are vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo, near the border with Rwanda, most prominently M23. The conflict has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises, with more than 7 million people displaced, according to the UN agency for refugees.Congo, the US and UN experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which has grown from hundreds of members in 2021 to about 6,500 fighters, according to the UN.Waltz said Rwandan forces had provided “logistics and training support to M23” and were fighting alongside the rebels in eastern Congo, with “roughly 5,000 to 7,000 troops as of early December”.Congo’s foreign minister, Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, accused Rwanda of trampling on the peace agreement, which she described as bringing “hope of a historic turning point”.She urged the security council to impose sanctions against military and political leaders responsible for the attacks, ban mineral exports from Rwanda and prohibit it from contributing troops to UN peacekeeping missions.Rwanda is one of the largest contributors of UN peacekeepers, with nearly 6,000 Rwandan troops.Eastern Congo, rich in critical minerals, has been of interest to Trump as Washington looks forways to circumvent China to acquire rare earths, essential to manufacturing fighter jets, mobile phones and more.Explore more on these topicsRwandaDemocratic Republic of the CongoBurundiAfricaUnited NationsCritical mineralsnewsShareReuse this content"

Chevron has US government authorisation to operate through joint ventures in the country and export its oil to the US.Other tankers that have loaded about 11m barrels of oil and fuel are stuck in Venezuelan waters, according to the sources and data seen by Reuters.The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said this week the Skipperwas intercepted and retained under a seizure warrant, while Guyana’s maritime authority said it was falsely flying the country’s flag.The tanker is now reportedly heading to Houston, where it will offload its cargo on to smaller ships. Washington is preparing to intercept more ships transporting Venezuelan oil, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday, according to Reuters.1:08Footage shows US forces taking control of oil tanker off Venezuelan coast – videoVenezuela has condemned the tanker seizure as “blatant theft” and “international piracy”, saying it would file complaints with international bodies. At the same time, Venezuelan lawmakers took a step to withdraw the country from the international criminal court, which is currently investigating alleged human rights abuses in the South American country.After more than 20 US military strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific against alleged drug vessels this year, and a large-scale US military buildup in the southern Caribbean, relations between the US and Venezuela are at their most volatile point in years.Nearly 90 people have been killed in the US strikes on suspected drug boats, alarming human rights advocates and stirring debate among US lawmakers as to the legality of the actions.Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, spoke by phone with Maduro about “peace” in South America, the Brazilian presidency said on Friday.Lula, one of Latin America’s most influential leaders, had not spoken to Maduro since Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election, the results of which Brazil – along with much of the international community – did not recognise.The Trump administration does not recognise Maduro, in power since 2013, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Washington has signalled more seizures are planned as part of efforts to choke off sanctioned oil flows, and subsequentlyimposed new sanctionson three nephews of Maduro’s wife and six tankers linked to them.Trump has also repeatedly floated the possibility of a US military intervention in Venezuela.Maduro says the US is bent on regime change and wants to seize Venezuela’s oil reserves.After slipping out of the country in secret to collect the Nobel peace prize, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on Friday promisedMaduro would leave power“whether there is a negotiated changeover or not”. However,she vowed she was focused on a peaceful transition, and thanked Trump for his “decisive support.“Machado defied a decade-long travel ban and a period in hiding to travel to Oslo on Thursday, noting that she would soon bring the Nobel peace prize back home to Venezuela.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaTrump administrationUS foreign policyNicolás MaduroAmericasOilInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Cambodia announced it had suspended all border crossings with Thailand.Thai forces carried out strikes, including with fighter jets, while Cambodia fired rocket barrages along the border area on Saturday. The Thai army announced that at least two civilians had been seriously injured by Cambodian fire while running to a bunker.‘It’s not going to end’: Thai evacuees fear for future after fresh clashes with CambodiaRead moreThe latest round of fighting was triggered by aclash on 7 Decemberthat wounded two Thai soldiers and appeared to violate an earlier ceasefire promoted by Trump that ended similar fighting in July. More thantwo dozen people have reportedly been killed over the past week while more than half a millionhave been displaced on both sides of the border.The Thai military said that 15 of its soldiers had died, and estimated that 165 Cambodian military personnel had been killed. Cambodia did not announce any military losses, but said at least 11 civilians had been killed and more than six dozen wounded.Trump’s ceasefire announcement on Friday was met with a tepid reaction by leaders from both countries.Thailand’s foreign minister, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, said Trump’s remarks did not reflect “an accurate understanding of the situation”.“We regret and we’re disappointed that some of the points made by President Trump have bearing upon the feeling of the Thai people, Thailand, because we consider ourselves – we are proud, in fact – to be the oldest treaty ally of the United States in the region,” he said.Cambodia has not commented on Trump’s announcement.Trump announced the agreement to restart the July ceasefire in a social media post after calls with Anutin and the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Manet.“They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me, and them, with the help of the Great Prime Minister ofMalaysia, Anwar Ibrahim,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday.But neither the Thai nor the Cambodian leaders referenced the agreement in statements issued after the call, and Anutin said there was no ceasefire and that peace would depend on Cambodia ending its attacks first. When asked about Trump’s claim, Thailand’s foreign ministry referred reporters to his statement.View image in fullscreenThe Thai prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, speaks during a press conference after his call with Donald Trump.Photograph: Chanakarn Laosarakham/AFP/Getty ImagesIn a statement on Saturday on Facebook, Manet did not mention the ceasefire, but instead referred to the call with Trump and said Cambodia continued to seek a peaceful resolution in line with an earlier agreement signed in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, in October.Manet also said he had advised the US and Malaysia to use their intelligence gathering capabilities to “verify which side fired first” in the latest round of fighting.Anutin said Thai forces had retaliated against Cambodian military targets.“Thailand will continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people,” he said in a Facebook post.What’s behind the Thailand-Cambodia clashes – explained in 30 secondsRead moreThe original ceasefire in July was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through after pressure from Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. It was formalised in more detail at the October regional meeting in Malaysia that Trump attended.The Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, urged both countries to once again cease hostilities on Saturday. Cambodia’s prime minister endorsed the Malaysian proposal, which included having Malaysia and the US monitor the ceasefire. Anutin, however, denied that Thailand had even entered into negotiations over the plan.Despite the deal, the two countries carried on a bitter propaganda war and minor cross-border violence continued.The roots of the Thai-Cambodian border conflictlie in a history of enmity over competing territorial claims. These claims largely stem from a 1907 map created while Cambodia was under French colonial rule, which Thailand maintains is inaccurate. Tensions were aggravated by a 1962 international court of justice ruling that awarded sovereignty to Cambodia, which still riles many Thais.Thailand has used jet fighters to carry out airstrikes on what it says are military targets. Cambodia has deployed BM-21 rocket launchers with a range of 30-40km (19-25 miles). The rockets are imprecise have a wide area of impact, with most landing in areas that have already been evacuated.According to data collected by public broadcaster ThaiPBS, at least six of the Thai soldiers killed were hit by rocket shrapnel.The Thai army’s north-eastern regional command said on Thursday that some residential areas and homes near the border had been damaged by BM-21 rockets.It also said it had destroyed a tall crane on a hilltop held by Cambodia where the ancient Preah Vihear temple is located, because it allegedly held electronic and optical devices used for military command and control purposes.A Thai warship also shelled the south-western Cambodian province of Koh Kong on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaAsia PacificDonald TrumpMalaysianewsShareReuse this content"

The country’s enactment of the policy is being watched closely by politicians, safety campaigners and parents. A number of other countries are not far behind, with Europe in particular hoping to replicate Australia, while the UK is keeping more of a watchful interest.EuropeDenmarkhas saidit will bansocial media for under-15s, with the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, saying mobile phones and social media are “stealing our children’s childhood”. The policy could become law next year.Reddit launches high court challenge to Australia’s under-16s social media banRead moreNorwayisbringing in a minimum age limit of 15. The prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, has said the country must protect children from the “power of the algorithms”.Irelandis introducing a digital wallet to verify the age and identity of social media users. The media minister, Patrick O’Donovan, said this month an Australia-style ban was “one of the things that we are holding in reserve”.InSpain, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has called on parliament to pass a bill raising the minimum age for using social media to 16.InFrance, the president, Emmanuel Macron, has threatened to ban social media for under-15s and a parliamentary commission has also recommended such a move, including an overnight “digital curfew” for 15- to 18-year-olds.The government inthe Netherlands, meanwhile, has advised parents to block their children from social media until they are 15.Inthe EU, theEuropean parliament has passed a non-binding resolution, demanding under-16s be banned from using social media unless their parents decide otherwise. The resolution warned of the “addictive” nature of social media but is non-binding, meaning it will not become law. The EU already has legislation that enshrines digital safety in the form of theDigital Services Act, but an appetite remains to take oversight further.The Danish MEP behind the resolution, Christel Schaldemose, said she would continue to push for continent-wide regulation, although that ultimately requires a three-way cooperation between member states, the EU parliament and the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm.The MEP said she was “not giving up” until tougher regulations were in place. “A strong age limit is a good starting point,” she said.Ursula von der Leyen, the commission’s president, has promised to establish a panel of experts who will advise on the best approach for protecting children. Announcing the panel in September, she said parents were drowning in the “tsunami of big tech flooding their family homes”.UKInthe UKthe Labour government has not ruled out a ban, saying “nothing is off the table” but any ban must be “based on robust evidence”.Last yearmomentum gatheredbehind a private member’s bill (legislation proposed by an individual lawmaker, not the government), imposing restrictions on under-16s using social media. But the bill wasultimately watered down, albeit with a government commitment to research the issue further.The Molly Rose Foundation, a charityestablished by the family of Molly Russell, a teenager who killed herself after viewing harmful online content, is concerned that an age ban would do nothing to make social networks safer. It said this week that teenagers living under an under-16 ban could face a “cliff edge” of harm on unregulated platforms when they turn 16.View image in fullscreenMolly Russell died after viewing harmful material on social media.Photograph: Family handout/PABeeban Kidron, the crossbench peer andinfluential online safety campaigner, said a ban was not a “magic bullet” but could spur tech companies to do more to protect children.“The Australian ban is a response to the failure of the tech sector to design products and services that are safe and age appropriate for children. It represents a profound challenge to Silicon Valley – by insisting that they design their products for keeping our kids safe – or leave them the heck alone,” she said.Meanwhile, the UK government will monitor whether its new set of digital guardrails,under the Online Safety Act, have the desired impact on child safety.USInthe US, social media restrictions are being brought in at state level.Utahhas introduced legislation requiring under-18s to have parental consent to use social media, while also restricting social media use at night without similar permission.TheFloridagovernor, Ron DeSantis, has signed a bill banning under-14s from joining social media, although the legislation – as with other similar state laws around the US – is subject to legal wrangling over whether it breaches the first amendment right to free speech.Virginia, meanwhile, has passed a law limiting under-16s to one hour of social media access per day, with any further access requiring parental permission.Georgia,TennesseeandLouisianahave also passed bills requiring parental consent for under-16s to open social media accounts.Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff under Barack Obama, is considering a presidential run and has said the US should follow Australia’s lead. Right now, a US-wide ban seems unlikely amid a Washington gridlock. Ted Cruz, the Republican senator, has teamed up with Democrat peers in Washington to introduce a bill formally banning under-13s from social media and barring feeding “algorithmically targeted content” to under-17s. The bill has not become law.‘Already had a profound effect’: parents react to Australia’s social media banRead moreArturo Béjar, a former senior engineer and consultant at Meta, who blew the whistle on online safety at the Facebook and Instagram owner, told the Guardian that nationwide legislation was still some way off.He said: “It is not clear how legislation is going to move forward here. The US has many bereaved parents, and bipartisan support, but turning that into legislation is taking a long time.”ElsewhereMalaysiaplans to ban social media for under-16s starting from next year andBrazilhas raised the minimum age for Instagram to the same level.At theUnited Nations, the attitude is more cautious. Unicef, the UN agency for children,has warnedthat social media bans carry risks and “may even backfire”. It said internet platforms can be a lifeline for isolated or marginalised children and that regulation should not be a substitute for tech companies investing in safety.But as the actions of Australia and other governments show, states around the world are no longer willing to wait.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

But if we want women in parliament it needs to be more family-friendly | Sarah MartinRead moreThe emails were referred by Wells’ office to the Australian federal police’s national security investigations team.AFP investigators linked the emails to the man, and he was arrested on Friday after a raid on a Bankstown home. His electronic devices were seized in the execution of a search warrant.The man has been charged with one count of using a carriage service to threaten to kill, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment. He faced Bankstown court on Friday and was bailed to reappear on 23 December.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe AFP’s Det Supt Jeremy Staunton said the police had zero tolerance for threats and menacing behaviour towards elected officials.“Freedom of speech and political expression are keys to a healthy democracy, however threats towards politicians, and particularly their families, are taken extremely seriously,” Staunton said.“Police have the tools and resources to identify individuals or groups who seek to promote hate and fear within our community, even if they are hiding behind the anonymity of a keyboard or email account.”The national security investigations team is a new taskforce within the AFP, set up in September to “target groups and individuals causing high levels of harm to Australia’s social cohesion”, including the targeting of federal parliamentarians.The court did not hear details about the nature of, or motive behind, the threat against Wells.Wells, the communications minister, is battling anexpenses scandal over travelfor her, her staff and family, including nearly $100,000 for flights to New York for a ministerial trip, and $1,389 for her husband and two young children to join her at Thredbo ski fields while she was there for a work event. She has been defended by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who said all of Wells’ spending was within the rules, which allow for family reunion around ministerial duties.The prime minister, however, has since sought advice from the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority over a review of travel allowances for parliamentarians.However, the emails allegedly sent to threaten Wells predate the expenses scandal breaking publicly.As communications minister, Wells has had responsibility for Australia’s world-leading, but controversial,social media ban, which came into force on 10 December.The ban prohibits anyone under 16 in Australia from having an account on major social media platforms, including TikTok, X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat.Wells’ communications portfolio also has responsibility for recent triple-zero call failures. In September, an Optus network failure meant emergency calls wereoffline for nearly 14 hours, during which time four people – including an eight-week-old baby – died. Subsequent failures, of old mobile phones beingunable to make emergency calls, have been linked to two deaths.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsAustralian politicians' expensesLabor partySydneynewsShareReuse this content"

I think the prime minister has done the right thing to get that advice on family expenses.“I understand why the rules say that with members of parliament travelling long distances and a long time away from their families, some form of family reunion support is appropriate.”After days of incorrectly suggestingthe Independent Parliamentary Expenses Agency set the rules, the prime minister confirmed this week that he had asked the watchdog toprovide adviceon overhauling travel perks for MPs, opening the door to changes.The government and the parliament are responsible for the laws and regulations which set the allowances, not the independent agency.Farrell has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicians' expensesChris BowenAustralian politicsLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

A close ally of Russia and its president,Vladimir Putin, Minsk is largely isolated from European and other western states due to its poor human rights record and brutal crackdown on popular protests.The gradual detente is part of what US officials told Reuters was an attempt to pull him from Putin’s sphere of influence, an initiative about which Belarusian opposition has expressed doubts.Who, If Not Us? The Fight for Democracy in Belarus review – activists display their defianceRead moreThe announcement of the release, which included top opposition figures and human rights campaigners, was met with fanfare. Bialiatski, who co-won the 2022 Nobel peace prize, is a human rights champion who advocated on behalf of political prisoners before being jailed himself in July 2021.Also released wereKalesnikava,one of a trio of women who led 2020 protestsagainst Lukashenko, as well as Viktar Babaryka, arrested in 2020 while trying to run in opposition to Lukashenko in a presidential election.The health of many of the prisoners has reportedly declined during their time in detention, as a result of what human rights groups say was mistreatment by the authorities.Kalesnikava’s sister, Tatsiana Khomich, said that her sister was grateful to the US for its role in facilitating her release.“She told me she is very happy to be freed, that she is thankful to the USA and Trump for their efforts in leading the process, and to all countries involved,” Khomich told Reuters.Relatives of the prisoners gathered outside the US embassy in Vilnius, Lithuania, where it is expected some of them will be taken from Belarus. Ukrainian authorities said that 114 civilians, including Ukrainian and Belarusian citizens, were transferred to Ukraine.Trump’s Belarus envoy, John Coale, told reporters in Minsk that the US would be lifting sanctions on potash, “as per the instructions of president Trump”.The US and EU placed sanctions on Belarus after thegovernment cracked down on popular protestsfollowing a contested election in 2020, which included the mass detention and torture of political opponents.More sanctions were imposed in 2022 after Belarus allowedRussiato use its territory for its invasion of Ukraine.Belarusian opposition figures thanked Trump for his efforts and said that the prisoner release was evidence of the effectiveness of the sanctions regime on the autocratic government. They called for EU sanctions to stay in place, which exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said were critical to “enabling democratic transition and ensuring accountability”.Lukashenko has denied holding political prisoners, instead saying the people in his prisons were “bandits” and opponents of the state. Belarusian human rights group Viasna, which is banned in the country, said 1,227 political prisoners remain in jail.Coale, in statements published by Belarus’s state media, said that Lukashenko could help assist in negotiations with Putin. The Trump administration has been engaged in mediation efforts between Russia and Ukraine in an effort to reach an end to the war in Ukraine.“Your president has a long history with president Putin and has the ability to advise him. This is very useful in this situation. They are longtime friends and have the necessary level of relationship to discuss such issues,” Coale said, according to state news agency Belta.Explore more on these topicsBelarusAlexander LukashenkoTrump administrationRussiaVladimir PutinEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The ethical Paris trainer worn by A-listers and royaltyVeja doesn’t do surveys or freebies, hates greenwashing and Black Friday, and as demand for trainers wanes, it continues to go its own wayMorwenna FerrierSat 13 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareIn the grand hierarchy ofParisfashion, it’s tricky for a brand to stand out. Especially one whosecoup de maîtreis a goes-with-everything white sneaker. Yet 20 years after Veja first began selling sustainable footwear, it has become the ultimate affordable It brand for scooter-wielding mums, sustainably minded millennials and A-list bigwigs who want to wear their values on their ethical leather-clad feet.Veja’s co-founder Sébastien Kopp says he doesn’t know if people buy his trainers because of how they are made or because of how they look. The company is fastidious about social and fairtrade practices, “but because we don’t do surveys, we don’t do marketing, we simply don’t know this information”, he says, speaking from Veja’s Paris headquarters.It also doesn’t do freebies. When the actor Emma Watson wanted a pair, she did what no celebrity has ever done, “and she bought”. So did Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. “I received an email from the [palace] asking about them, but I thought it was fake so I didn’t reply.”View image in fullscreenReese Witherspoon wearing a pair of white Veja trainers in 2020.Photograph: Broadimage/ShutterstockThe actorMarion Cotillardonce listedit as a favourite brand alongside Valentino and Alexander McQueen, and it’s been reported that the company even received a request from the maximalist costume department ofEmily in Paris(on this, Veja prefers not to comment).What Veja does know is that it has sold almost 15m pairs worldwide. Its success hinges on several factors. Like aDaunts tote bag, or even aLabubu, branded accessories have become material signals of taste or interest, a way of wearing your values.“The Veja V tells the world this trainer is responsibly designed and produced, and that you care about that,” says Ima Shah, the director at the trend forecasting site Stylus. Fashion helped, too. Oversized clothing is popular right now, but inherently casual. “Big trousers and big shoes don’t work. A sharper shoe formalises that look – it smartens it,” she says.Veja makes sports shoes, but the earlier models, which are most popular, are in effect trainers for people who don’t want to wear trainers.View image in fullscreenMeghan, Duchess of Sussex, wearing Vejas in Sydney with Prince Harry.Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty for the Invictus Games FoundationStill, these are strange times for shoes. Of the 23bn shoes produced each year, about 60% are trainers. But according to Katy Lubin, the vice-president of brand and communications at the fashion marketplace Lyst, “demand for sneakers is currently down around 30% year on year”. The trend forecasting agency WGSN said sneakers were projected to decline next year, too. People wants boots and loafers, says Lubin.It doesn’t help that right now, no sneaker style dominates. Earlier this year, the New York Times declared the end of the dad trainer, but according to Lyst, the paternally shapedNew Balance 204Lis one of the hottest trainers of the year.Gen Z are wearing slimline shoes such as Puma Speedcats, whereas millennials, such as Chanel’s creative director, Matthieu Blazy, are still wearing Nikes (Blazy wore his for his debut Chanel bow).View image in fullscreen‘Trainers for people who don’t want to wear trainers.’Photograph: VejaOn the catwalk you’ll see Asics at Cecilie Bahnsen, and Prada went so far as to design its own. And despiteRishi Sunak’s best efforts, even the Adidas Samba is back from the dead.Step up: what to wear to a ‘no-shoes’ houseRead moreYet the white sneaker prevails. The most popular Veja sneaker, according to Lyst, is the Campo. As spare and elegant as its noughties predecessor, the Stan Smith, much like the “quiet luxury” trend and no-makeup makeup, its blankness is also its appeal. The main difference is its customer.“Stan Smiths are comparable, yes, but have always skewed younger,” says Shah. While Stan Smith had cultural cache – Jay-Z once rapped about them – “Veja’s values are more linked to responsible purchasing rather than trends.” It helps, too, that they’re French, which grants them a certain chicness.Until 1980, Veja’s Paris headquarters were the French Communist party’s printing building. Updated with a poured concrete floor and a Bauhaus-esque staircase, it has a vegetarian canteen, although like some of its shoes, even that used to be vegan.View image in fullscreenThe Princess of Wales wearing Vejas.Photograph: Arthur Edwards/WPA Pool/ShutterstockVeja began phasing out vegan sneakers because “the more we looked at leather, the more we realised natural materials have better traceability”, Kopp says. Vegan leather is often just polyester or plastic. “I know Stella McCartney is an icon [in the UK] but the vegan PVC shoes. For me?Non.” As for the canteen, it stopped being vegan because the staff supposedly missed cheese.Kopp launched the brand with his childhood friend François-Ghislain Morillion – they both worked in finance – after noticing a lack of shoes that advocated ethical practice and traceability in their production process. The company now employs 500 people and has produced 14m pairs of sneakers, reaching the commerciality and ubiquity it once arguably resisted.The sticking point with the ideal sustainability model – which advocates a “don’t make, don’t buy, don’t throw anything away approach” – is that there are also jobs at stake. For this reason, Kopp thinks the issue is consumer moments such as Black Friday. “It creates an economy and a mindset that is not good.” Veja does not participate. The company’s website discloses the contracts of its producers and wages of the factory workers.Greenwashing is also a problem, says Kopp. “The word recycling has been co-opted,” he says. This is particularly true in footwear where a single pair of sneakers can contain up to 40 different materials.View image in fullscreenTrainers from Veja’s autumn-winter 2025 collection.Photograph: VEJA“This is not just hard to recycle, it’s virtually impossible,” says Daniel Schmitt, Veja’s head of repair operations. For this reason, it now runs several cobblers, the idea being that one pair can be recycled – “or reborn”, says Schmitt – up to five times.As the global capital of swank, recycling is not something you associate with Paris fashion. But nor is fast fashion and yet last month, Shein opened a shop in the French capital. “It’s not crazy at all,” Kopp says. There is Primark, there is Zara. Nobody can stop or is really trying to stop consumption.”That its practices “show what’s fine with our supply chain and what’s wrong with the supply chains of others” is just how it goes. “We are the grandfathers of this industry, we are from another era,” Kopp says.Explore more on these topicsFashionWomen's shoesMen's shoesParisFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this week it came to a head in a flurry of meetings, calls and one heady statement. Twenty-seven European countries urged a rethink of the human rights laws forged after the second world war, describing them asan impediment when it came to addressing migration.Amnesty International has called it “a moral retreat”. Europe’s most senior human rights officialsaidthe approach risked creating a “hierarchy of people” where some are seen as more deserving of protection than others.The roots of the clash can be traced back to May, when nine EU states, including Denmark, Italy and Poland,published a letterarguing that the European convention on human rights was hindering their ability to exert sovereignty over their states and deport people who committed crimes. “We have to restore the right balance,”the letter noted.“What was once right might not be the answer of tomorrow.”Starmer and hardline governments risk creating ‘hierarchy of people’ by constraining human rightsRead moreThis week27 countriessharedthese grievances, though several, including France, Spain and Germany, declined to sign the letter, hinting at a divide in how states view the convention.Speaking to the Guardian this week, Europe’s top human rights official hit out at politicians’ “lazy language”, laced with assumptions and inaccuracies, which led countries to erroneously target human rights legislation.One example was the “lazy correlation” of migration and crime, said Michael O’Flaherty, the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights. “This doesn’t correspond with reality,” he said.Even so, this distorted perception had been widely peddled. “What’s at issue is this feeding into the misunderstanding in society that we’re opening the door to criminals to run amok in our societies doing untold damage,” he said. “No wonder people get frightened, no wonder people are demanding limits on migration.”11:40Why does Starmer want to weaken human rights? | The LatestPoliticians from across the spectrum were to blame, he said. “What happens is middle-of-the-road politicians use this lazy language, but then it’s instrumentalised by those who would actively promote disinformation.”He pointed to theUK, where tremendous attention had been given to court cases where the convention on human rights had stymied the expulsion of criminals. “And again here, the figures simply don’t correspond with that,” said O’Flaherty. “The figure is tiny, and it’s completely manageable in any modern rule of law state. And very few of these cases ever reach the European court of human rights because there are all those checks and balances at the national level that kick in first.”His view was backed by a report,published this weekby the University of Oxford, which found that media reporting in the UK was “dominated by often inaccurate or misleading reports” when it came to the impact of the convention on immigration control.The report also highlighted the many ways in which the convention, whosefirst signatorywas the UK when it launched 75 years ago, safeguards people in workplaces, hospitals and care homes and protects victims of domestic violence and modern slavery.The history of the convention traces back to the aftermath of the second world war when countries came together to launch the Council of Europe,envisioning itas a guardian of fundamental rights across the continent. These rights were enshrined in the European convention on human rights, a document that has since been signed by 46 countries.O’Flaherty said he saw no need for the convention to now be modernised, warning that the call by politicians risked creating a “false expectation” among voters. “Is that really going to change migratory flows?” he asked. “Is that going to stop people from crossing the Channel? Is that going to ruin the business model of the migrant smugglers? I don’t think so.”He also pushed back against the assertion that the convention impeded on states’ sovereignty. Individuals and countries could only make an application to the European court after they had exhausted domestic options, he noted, while the European court of human rightsis made up of judgesrepresenting every member state. “This is not a bunch of foreign judges imposing something on us,” he said.Writing in the Guardian this week, the UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, and his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen,argued thatan update of the convention on human rights was needed to help see off the rise of the populist right.O’Flaherty rejected the link. “For every inch yielded, there’s going to be another inch demanded,” he said. “Where does it stop? For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around? What happens when another small vulnerable, weak, marginalised group catches the eye of some populist schemers?”Yielding ground on human rights would ultimately serve the interest of these populists by weakening the rule of law, he said, and risk creating a “hierarchy of people”, a notion he described as “very, very worrying” given the convention’s roots in the horrors of the second world war.He said: “The convention and the whole human rights system emerged out of the most barbarous hierarchisation of rights holders that you could imagine, where you had not only some humans more worthy than others, but certain humans, because of their origin, as having no value whatsoever.“A universal system of human rights was built, strategically built, to make sure that we could never end up in that nightmare scenario again,” O’Flaherty added. “We’re not there now, of course we’re not. But we have to be very cautious and careful about the ultimate consequences, albeit unintended, of the paths we might embark on.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean court of human rightsHuman rightsMigrationRefugeesImmigration and asylumEuropeEuropean UnionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was no immediate confirmation fromHamasor medics that Saed was among the dead.“In response to the activation of a Hamas explosive device that wounded our forces today … prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahuand defence minister Israel Katz instructed the elimination of the terrorist Raed Saed, head of Hamas’ force buildup,” the prime minister and the defence minister said in a joint statement.The Israeli military described Saed as “one of the architects” of the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war inGaza. The military earlier on Saturday said two reserve soldiers were lightly injured after the device detonated “during an operation to clear the area” in southern Gaza.Saed’s death would be the most significant assassination of a senior Hamas figure since a ceasefire deal came into effect in October.More than 9,000 children in Gaza treated for acute malnutrition in October, UN saysRead moreAn Israeli defence official said Saed had been targeted in the attack, describing him as the head of Hamas’s weapons manufacturing force.Hamas sources have described him as the second-in-command of the group’s armed wing, after Izz eldeen al-Hadad.Saed used to head Hamas’s Gaza City battalion, one of the group’s largest and best equipped, those sources said.The war in Gaza began after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and seized 251 hostages in an attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 70,700 Palestinians, most of them civilians, health officials in Gaza said.The 10 October ceasefire has enabled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to Gaza City’s ruins. Israel has pulled troops back from city positions, and aid flows have increased.But violence has not completely halted. Palestinian health authorities say Israeli forces have killed at least 386 people in strikes in Gaza since the truce. Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire began, and it has attacked scores of fighters.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

A military road and accompanying barrier was to be built byIsraelright through the area.Lawyers for the Atouf village council have lodged an appeal, but long and bitter experience has taught Palestinians here to have low expectations of Israeli courts.“The Israeli military can do anything they like. They don’t care about the law or anything else,” said Ismael Bsharat, a local farmer.Similar eviction notices had been delivered on the same day all along an almost 14-mile (22km) strip of Palestinian farmland running north to south through Atouf, tracing out the route of the planned road and fence. And this week it became clear that this abrupt gash across Palestinian land was the first section of a new line of division that would redraw the map of theWest Bank.This week, Israel’s defence ministry made clear that this would mark only the first section of a new 5.5bn-shekel (£1.3bn) barrier that will eventually run 300 miles, from the Golan Heights on the Syrian border to the north all the way down to the Red Sea near Eilat. Labelled “Crimson Thread” by the Israeli military, the barrier will split countless Palestinian communities along its route.Map showing location of Jordan valley barrier and new military road in West BankThe army says the barrier is being built for security reasons, but human rights activists say there has been only one lethal incident anywhere near Atouf in recent years in which an Israeli was killed. They argue the real motive is land seizure and the further strangling of Palestine’s prospects as a viable state.“It is happening all through the Jordan valley, especially in the north. Israel is pushing forward, and accelerating the ethnic cleansing of this area,” said Dror Etkes, an Israeli activist who is the founder of theKerem Navotorganisation, which monitors Israeli land policy in occupied Palestine.View image in fullscreenThe fertile land around the village of Atouf in the West Bank.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianIsrael has consistently rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing from Israeli and international human rights organisations, including UN rapporteurs, dismissing them as fabricated propaganda. It also denies the colonisation of occupied territory by settlers is illegal under international law.Etkes said almost all (85%) of the 1,000 dunams (100 hectares) subjected to the initial round of eviction orders around Atouf were privately owned. These fields are among the most fertile in the West Bank, their rich dark-brown soil built up over millennia by tributaries flowing east to the River Jordan. The area has long been one of Palestine’s breadbaskets.Most of the affected families had farmed the land for generations, and some had bought new parcels at high prices in recent years. All held title deeds, but none of that is likely to alter the outcome of the looming land grab.Lawyers for the local Palestinian municipality lodged an appeal against the eviction in an Israeli court but had received no response by the end of this week. The expectation is that Israeli settlers will take over the excised land. A new settlement is planned just west of the new military road.View image in fullscreenAbdullah Bsharat, the head of Atouf’s village council, leaves the council building. Several farmers have received an Israeli military order to confiscate part of their lands.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianAcross the West Bank, settlements are being planned and built at an unprecedented rate. According to the Peace Now advocacy group,tenders have been publishedfor more than 5,600 housing units so far this year – an all-time record and 50% more than the previous peak in 2018.Those are only the officially endorsed settlements. New settler outposts (often just a small cluster of huts or portable buildings) are springing up along the valley at an accelerating pace. Though officially unauthorised, they are enabled in practice by the army and police, backed by far-right members of the governing coalition.At least one Palestinian farmer in Atouf has already begun moving his livestock in anticipation of eviction, but Bsharat said he would stay put and see what happens. He has little choice. On a winter evening this week, he was going to market with boxes of fresh green peppers grown in his plastic-sheet greenhouses. All his 12 dunams (1.2 hectares) of land lie east of the proposed military road and barrier, and are fed by water pipes running from the hilltops to the west. Those will all be severed when the army arrives to build the road and the barrier.“What can I do? I can’t farm without water,” Bsharat said.View image in fullscreenArafat Bsharat will lose most of his farming land.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianAbdullah Bsharat, the village council leader (who is from the same extended family as Ismael) predicted that up to 40 families from Atouf would be cut off from the village and their water supply.“All these families have title deeds,” he said. “They grow grapes, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, bananas, za’atar and olives. This land is very rich and that is the reason it is being taken. The whole aim is to take it over for settlers to use it.”The council leader said he had been told by Israeli officers that the road and barrier would together be 50 metres wide, but Palestinian buildings or farmwork would not be allowed along a 200-metre cordon on either side. There was no official confirmation from the army of such a wide exclusion zone, but if true it would greatly increase the economic damage inflicted on Atouf.View image in fullscreenAbdullah Bsharat points towards some of the lands that will be taken by Israel.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianAt one point along its course the planned barrier will loop around and completely enclose a Palestinian sheep herding community at Khirbet Yarza, who have so far resisted increasing pressure from settlers and the army to move off their 400 dunams of land,. It is not clear if they will be left any means to get in and out of the fence that will be built around them.The “Crimson Thread” plan put forward this week byIsrael’s defence ministrypresented the current barrier as just the first part of a vast undertaking, walling off the Jordan valley from the rest of the West Bank, to “strengthen national security and strategic control of the eastern border”.Maj Gen Eran Ofir, the senior defence ministry official responsible for building walls and barriers, said: “The security barrier whose construction we began today will extend over approximately 500km along the entire eastern border of the state of Israel.”He added: “It will be a smart border, which will include a physical fence and a collection tool with intelligence sensors, radars, cameras, and advanced technologies.” Ofir said work had begun on two sections of the overall scheme, without giving details. The other section could be a military road started last year further north along the Jordan valley, around the villages of Bardala and Kardala.Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said: “The new barrier will strengthen settlement along the border, significantly reduce arms smuggling into the hands of terrorists in Judea and Samaria, and will deal a severe blow to the efforts of Iran and its proxies to establish an eastern front against the state of Israel.”According to theTimes of Israel, citing Israel Defense Forces sources, the initial project around Atouf was conceived after a single security incident: the killing in August 2024 of a 23-year-old Israeli, Yonatan Deutsch, in a drive-by shooting by Palestinian militants along Route 90, which runs along the Jordan valley floor.Etkes said there had been more Palestinian militant attacks in other areas of the West Bank. What distinguished the area around Atouf was not the security risk but the quality of its farmland, he added.He said: “They are using this incident as a pretext in order to take over tens of thousands of dunams of land, and to push Palestinian communities further out of the Jordan valley.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Those who breach the orders could be jailed for up to five years, the government said.Government’s process behind tackling violence against women ‘worse than under the Tories’Read moreIt also announced it would invest almost £2m in “crack police squads” made up of “covert online investigators” to target internet abusers.“This government has declared violence against women and girls a national emergency,” Mahmood said. “For too long, these crimes have been considered a fact of life. That’s not good enough. We will halve it in a decade.“Today we announce a range of measures to bear down on abusers, stopping them in their tracks. Rapists, sex offenders and abusers will have nowhere to hide.”The government said that the plans for the new rape and sexual offences teams would be headed by “specialist investigators” trained to understand offender behaviour.The plans are in part a response toOperation Soteria, a Home Office project commissioned under the Conservatives in 2021 in response to concerns about how reports of sexual violence were investigated and low charge rates. Early data from the project suggested half the rape investigation teams were not fully qualified.Sources have indicated training will have a particular focus on “rape mythology” and “problematic cultural issues”, which lead to some victims being dismissed or blamed. They added that some officers would be trained as sexual violence “first responders” in an attempt to ensure initial contact with victims is handled appropriately.The Guardian understands there will be no additional funding for these units, so forces will have to absorb the costs from existing budgets. The speed at which they are set up is also expected to vary between forces and will depend on the existing level of expertise in each area.However, the teams are expected to be supported by theNational Centre for VAWG and Public Protection, a £13m project unveiled this year to improve the response to this type of offending.Domestic abuse protection orders were introduced under a pilot scheme in November last year, operating initially in Greater Manchester and parts of London before being extended to north Wales and Cleveland.The orders are expected to target those who perpetrate all types of domestic abuse. The government said this would include “economic abuse, coercive and controlling behaviour, stalking and ‘honour’-based abuse”. It added there would be no maximum time limits placed on the orders.In this age of authoritarians, online abuse of women is soaring – and it’s leading to ‘real-world’ violence  | Julie PosettiRead moreHalving gender-based violence in a decade was one of Labour’s key manifesto pledges but ministers have faced criticism for delays and an apparent lack of engagement with experts in the sector.Karen Bradley, chair of the home affairs select committee, wrote to ministers this week to express concerns about how long it has taken to publish the strategy, originally expected in spring this year.She said: “The delay is creating significant uncertainty across the VAWG sector, leaving stakeholders unclear about the guiding principles that should shape their work. Repeated delays in publication sends the message that tackling VAWG is not a government priority, despite the ambition to halve VAWG within the next decade.”In her letter, Bradley added the committee understood there had been “poor engagement and transparency with VAWG stakeholders” throughout the development of the strategy.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Mountbatten-Windsor’s ties to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein led to thestripping of his royal status.His alleged victim, Virginia Giuffre, claimed in a 2021 US lawsuit that Andrew had sex with her after she had been trafficked by Epstein at a home in Belgravia, London, in 2001 when she was 17.In a US lawsuit she said she was “lent out for sexual purposes” to the then Duke of York in London, and on two other occasions outside the United Kingdom.Mountbatten-Windsor, 65, has always denied that claim and any other wrongdoing, and maintained his position when he paid money tosettle the lawsuit in 2022.The family of Giuffre said they were “deeply disappointed” by the force’s decision to drop the investigation “without explanation” and that they were not told this announcement was coming.They said in a statement: “We emailed with a detective from theMetropolitan policeyesterday, Friday, Dec 12th, who gave us no indication that this announcement was imminent.“Indeed, he asked us if we had any evidence we would like to present; we had not yet replied.“With the Epstein files about to be released by [the US] Congress since the passage ofthe Epstein Transparency Act, we are surprised that the Metropolitan police didn’t wait to see what further evidence might appear.“While we have hailed the UK’s overall handling of the case of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor previously, today we feel justice has not been served.“We continue to challenge the system that protects abusers, especially as more evidence comes to light that can hold people accountable. Our sister Virginia, and all survivors, are owed this much.”It is understood that on some of the former prince’s meetings with Epstein, a Met protection officer accompanied him, as he was entitled to police protection given his royal status.On Saturday, the Met said no allegation against Mountbatten-Windsor would be the subject of any formal criminal investigation in the UK. That includes claims he asked his Met police protection officer to investigate Giuffre in 2011, after she had gone public with her claims against him.Any criminal investigation would have involved the king’s brother being interviewed under criminal caution, if not arrested. The Met’s decision was reached without speaking to the former prince.In a new statement, the Met commander Ella Marriott said the force had decided to stand by its previous decision. Marriott said: “In 2015, the Metropolitan police service received allegations relating to non-recent trafficking for sexual exploitation involvingJeffrey Epsteinand Ghislaine Maxwell.“These allegations primarily concerned events outside the United Kingdom, with one allegation of trafficking to central London in March 2001.“Officers assessed all available evidence at the time, interviewed the complainant, Ms Virginia Giuffre as well as contacting several other potential victims. This did not result in any allegation of criminal conduct against any UK-based nationals.“The MPS sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service and liaised with US authorities, who were leading investigations into related matters involving US nationals. Following this legal advice, it was clear that any investigation into human trafficking would be largely focused on activities outside the UK and perpetrators based overseas.“Officers therefore concluded, in consultation with the CPS, that other international authorities were best placed to progress these allegations. Officers maintained close liaison with the US and other relevant authorities throughout their investigation to ensure any UK matters could be identified and to consider any support requested.“A decision was made in November 2016 not to proceed to a full criminal investigation. That decision was reviewed in August 2019 and again in 2021 and 2022; in each instance, the position remained unchanged, and Ms Giuffre and her legal representative were informed.”The Met said there would be no criminal investigation into claims Mountbatten-Windsor tried to get his police protection officers to smear his accuser.It is understood none of the protection officers at that time, who have been spoken to by Met investigators, supported claims that Mountbatten-Windsor asked them to find material that might undermine Giuffre.Detectives examined the Met’s records dating back more than a decade to see if any officer searched for material on Giuffre. Some records no longer existed.In October, the Mail on Sunday claimed an email showed Mountbatten-Windsor passed Giuffre’s date of birth and social security number to his bodyguard in 2011 and asked him to dig up dirt to smear his accuser.On Saturday Marriott said: “This assessment has not revealed any additional evidence of criminal acts or misconduct.“In the absence of any further information, we will be taking no further action. As with any other matter, should new and relevant information be brought to our attention, including in any information resulting from the release of material in the US, we will assess it.”A former senior prosecutor said there could be enough reason to criminally investigate Mountbatten-Windsor for his alleged sexual attack on Giuffre.Nick Vamos, the former head of special crime at the CPS, said: “If Ms Giuffre did not consent to sex, and Andrew did not reasonably believe that she consented to sex, then it would be rape. If it could be proved that Andrew knew that Giuffre had been trafficked then that would be compelling evidence that he could not have reasonably believed that Giuffre had the freedom to choose whether to consent.”Giuffre is now dead, but her New York lawsuit said the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her for Epstein’s sex trafficking enterprise. Maxwell is in a US prison.In her 2021 civil lawsuit brought against the former prince in the southern district of New York, Giuffre said: “Prince Andrew committed sexual assault and battery upon plaintiff when she was 17 years old. As such, Prince Andrew is responsible for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress pursuant to New York common law. The damage to plaintiff has been severe and lasting.“Prince Andrew abused plaintiff on separate occasions when she was under the age of 18 years old. On one occasion, Prince Andrew sexually abused plaintiff in London at Maxwell’s home. During this encounter, Epstein, Maxwell, and Prince Andrew forced plaintiff, a child, to have sexual intercourse with Prince Andrew against her will.”Giuffre also alleged the former prince had sex with her on two other occasions outside the UK. Giuffre’s sworn statement said: “During each of the aforementioned incidents, plaintiff was compelled by express or implied threats by Epstein, Maxwell, and/or Prince Andrew to engage in sexual acts with Prince Andrew, and feared death or physical injury to herself or another and other repercussions for disobeying Epstein, Maxwell, and Prince Andrew due to their powerful connections, wealth, and authority.“Prince Andrew engaged in each of the aforementioned sexual acts with plaintiff at Epstein and Maxwell’s invitation, knowing that she was a sex-trafficking victim being forced to engage in sexual acts with him.“During each of the aforementioned incidents, plaintiff did not consent to engaging in sexual acts with Prince Andrew. During each of the aforementioned incidents, Prince Andrew sexually abused plaintiff for the purpose of gratifying his sexual desires.”Vamos said Giuffre’s book published posthumously this year could not be used as evidence, but her testimony for the New York lawsuit could be: “A sworn statement she had made in the past could be admissible such as her statement in the New York lawsuit. The book would probably not be.“You would have to prove that she did not consent, had been trafficked, and Andrew knew that and thus could not reasonably believe she had freely consented.”Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied Giuffre’s claim and any other wrongdoing.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorMetropolitan policePoliceJeffrey EpsteinLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

While there is absolutely no room for complacency, it shows that #TommyRobinson’s momentum can be broken.“Now let’s go all out to build a massive #Together against the far right demo on Saturday 28 March.”Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, told the crowd he used to “hate the church” but met a pastor in prison who taught him about the Bible.Hymn sheets were handed out to the crowd and a woman walked around selling St George’s flags and Santa hats.C of E responds to Tommy Robinson’s carols event with ‘Christmas is for all’ messageRead moreBefore the event, the Church of Englandreleased a video on its YouTube channelin which people ranging from the archbishop of York to schoolchildren spoke about the “joy, love and hope” of Christmas.The message is “a simple reminder thatChristmasbelongs to all of us, and everyone is welcome to celebrate”, the Church of England said.Several leaders spoke out against the dangers of Christian nationalism and the appropriation of Christian symbols to bolster the anti-migrant views of Robinson and his supporters.Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, warned of the potential “weaponisation” of events, and said the Church of England must be “absolutely clear” that the true Christian message was one of compassion and welcome to all.Adam Slonecki, the Met commander who was in charge of the policing operation, said: “Every weekend in London is busy but that is especially the case at this time of year when the transport network, shops and public spaces will see much higher footfall.“In that context, it is particularly important that we ensure that where groups are exercising their lawful right to protest, we use the powers available to us to ensure those protests don’t cause serious disruption to the many other people – Londoners and visitors alike – going about their lives.”Explore more on these topicsTommy RobinsonFar rightMetropolitan policeLondonChristmasAnglicanismChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

The 81-year-old had been admitted to hospital after one leg swelled up and turned black. “Going to lose the leg today,” he wrote.The message was not sent to his son, Thomas, who lives with him in Cebu in the Philippines, nor to his older daughter, Samantha, who is based in Florida. Instead, Markle contacted Caroline Graham, the US editor of the Mail on Sunday, who is based in Los Angeles. It was she who called Markle’s two older children to let them know the news. Shewrote laterthat they were “flabbergasted”.“He had chosen to break the news of the amputation to me before his own family.”Markle’s youngest child,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, would learn of her father’s health crisis “through news coverage”, Graham reported coyly several days after the operation, after she had flown to the Philippines to be by his bedside. “However, Mr Markle last night said he has not heard from Meghan ‘but would love to speak to her’.”Few dysfunctional families would find harmony under the close scrutiny of the tabloid press, as British royals have known for half a century and more. For the past eight years, since Meghan’s relationship with Prince Harry became public, that has been the story of the Markles, in which the toxic swirl of the past week is merely the latest unedifying chapter.View image in fullscreenThomas Markle appears on Good Morning Britain in 2018.Photograph: ReutersMeghan, having heard of his ill health last week, had been trying to reach her father, herspokesperson said, but “given that a Daily Mail reporter has remained at her father’s bedside throughout, broadcasting each interaction and breaching clear ethical boundaries, it has been exceedingly difficult for the duchess to contact her father privately, despite her efforts over the past several days”.If Meghan had emailed, her father had not received it, wrote Graham. Eventually, the duchess’s spokesperson said she had written him a letter and “with the support of reliable and trusted contacts, her correspondence is now safely in his hands”.Before Meghan married Prince Harry in 2018, the former actor and her father, a retired lighting director in the TV industry, were reportedly on reasonable, if distant terms. Meghan’s father, then living in Mexico, was in effect a “recluse”, his sontold the Mailin late 2017. “I haven’t seen him in years. He hates the attention Meghan’s romance has brought on to him. He loves her but hates the idea of being in the spotlight.”Thanks to the charms of sections of the press, he appears to have come round to the idea. Thomas, who separated from Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, when the future duchess was two, had initially been due to walk his daughter down the aisle ather wedding, but at the last minute she announced he would no longer be attending, amid reports of a heart attack – and after he had posed for staged paparazzi photos.A five-page letter written by Meghan to her father after the wedding was leaked by her father to the Mail on Sunday the following year. “I have to defend myself,” he told Graham.

In 2020, Thomas filmed a documentary in whichhe said: “The royals owe me, Harry owes me, Meghan owes me. What I have been through, I should be rewarded for.”Meghan accuses Daily Mail of ethics breach over reporting from father’s bedsideRead moreHaving lost touch with one daughter, he appears to have acquired another, of sorts. Having “met through work”, Graham wrote that she and Thomas had been “rock solid friends” since 2018. “We speak most days and I consider him a father figure.” DMG Media, the parent company of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, has denied Meghan’s accusation that the relationship breaches journalistic ethics.“As well as being a journalist, Caroline has been friends with Mr Markle since 2018. She has been with Mr Markle in hospital every day, providing him with care and support … The suggestion that Caroline has breached ethical boundaries is demonstrably false and vehemently denied,” said a spokesperson.The publisher willface a lawsuitfrom Prince Harry and others in the new year over allegations of illegal information gathering, which it denies.For now, the family agrees. Meghan’s half-brother, Thomas Jr, said this week that Grahamwould remain the trusted conduitfor his father’s health updates: “I trust her, she’s doing a great job, she’s never thrown anybody in the family under the bus … That is where your news is going to come from.”Explore more on these topicsMeghan, the Duchess of SussexMonarchyNewspapers & magazinesPrivacy & the mediaPress intrusionFamilyNewspapersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The suspect is believed to have exited the Barus and Holley building where the shooting took place on Hope Street. O’Hara said officials were “utilizing every resource possible to find this suspect.”The university said in a message to the students and staff just after 6.30pm local time: “There are eight additional victims in critical, but stable condition at the hospital. There remains a shelter in place order. The shooter or shooters still are not in custody at this time. Law enforcement is active in the area.”View image in fullscreenAmbulances line Hope Street at Brown University.Photograph: Mark Stockwell/AP“The situation is ongoing, and all members of the community should continue to shelter in place,” the school addedon its website.A few minutes earlier, the school said that an “earlier report of a secondary shooting incident near Governor Street is unfounded”.Officials initially said a suspect was in custody, before saying that was not in fact the case and police were still searching for a suspect or suspects.Mayor Smiley told CNN that the doors of the engineering and physics building were unlocked because many final exams were under way there. “Based on what we heard from officials at Brown, anybody could have accessed the building at that time,” he said.Students were urged to shelter in place as police responded to the scene, and people were told to avoid the area. Officials cautioned that information remained preliminary as investigators worked to determine what had occurred.Police were actively investigating and still gathering information from the scene, said Kristy DosReis, the chief public information officer for the city of Providence.Christina Paxson, Brown’s president, said in a message to students that it was a “deeply tragic day”.“We know our community wants answers, and we will provide them as soon as we can.

We met with legal counsel immediately, and the process is still under way,” he said.‘The holy family is in hiding’: nativity scenes at US churches push back on ICERead more“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centers,” Rupnick added. “So we must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and trauma once done to our people.”The statement came after the 4,500-member tribe said it had fired the economic development leaders who brokered the deal. “We are known across the nation now as traitors and treasonous to another race of people,” Ray Rice, a 74-year-old who said he and other tribal members were blindsided by the deal,told the Associated Press.Carole Cadue-Blackwood, who has Prairie Band Potawatomi ancestry and is an enrolled member of the Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas, hopes the contract dies. She has been part of the fight against an ICE detention center opening in Leavenworth, Kansas, and works for a social service agency forNative Americans.“I’m in just utter disbelief that this has happened,” she said.In a statement on Tuesday, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation and Prairie Band LLC had acknowledged that the DHS contract “does not align” with its principles and they would “ensure all future engagements align clearly with our values and mission”.Questions are also being raised about why the Potawatomi’s development subsidy was selected for a sizable government contract without having to compete for the work. Sole-source contracts above $30m require additional justification under federal contracting rules.KPB Services was registered in April by Prairie Band LLC executive vice-president Ernest Woodward, a former naval officer and member of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma who describes himself as the “go-to” adviser for tribes and affiliated companies seeking to land federal contracts.The company has reportedly positioned itself to pursue government contracts,Native News Online reported. Other tribal groups, including Alaska Native corporations, have also held contracts worth millions, including detention facility operations, guard services and border patrol support.Earlier this year,the Guardian reportedthat the NanaRegional Corporation, one of 13 regional Alaskan Native corporations, had been contracted through a subsidiary to run detention facilities at theGuantánamo Baynaval base in Cuba.Native American corporations also staff or support ICE detention facilities near Miami, in upstate New York, in El Paso, Texas, and in San Pedro, California,according the website Turtle Talk. An LLC owned by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama also has a multimillion-dollar contract with ICE to provide support to a detention facility in Alabama.ATribal Resources Guidepublished by the DHS describes tribal nations as “critical partners in our homeland security efforts, and DHS’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs promotes an integrated national approach to homeland security by coordinating and advancing federal interaction with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments”.The arrangements bring important revenue to Native American tribes that are under increased economic pressure because of decreased federal funding, reduced reservation visitors, high inflation and competition from online gambling.But the economic opportunities presented to tribes don’t always align with cultural values. Native Americans have also been detained by ICE during immigration sweeps, including last month when actor Elaine Miles said she was stopped by ICE agents who alleged her ID from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon “looked fake”.In January, the Navajo Nation president, Buu Nygren, said his office had received reports that tribal members had had “negative, and sometimes traumatizing, experiences with federal agents targeting undocumented immigrants in the south-west”.Nygren advisedNavajo people to carry state-issued identification, such as a driver’s license, other picture identification or a so-called certificate of Indian blood (CIB). “It’s best to be prepared,” he said. “Having your state ID is crucial, and if you possess a CIB, it can provide an additional layer of reassurance.”In his statement, Rupnick said the Prairie Band Potawatomi’s development company risked losing future government contracts by withdrawing from the agreement with the DHS, but it was a necessary measure.“Those who are veterans, like myself, understand that working with the government sometimes puts you in positions that go against your values,” Rupnick said. “Our LLC works with the government too, but unlike the military, we can say no. Saying no comes with consequences, including the potential for fewer future contracts, but our values must guide us first and foremost.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsKansasNative AmericansICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Indigenous peoplesUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Additional injuries included bruises on his arms and abdomen, a broken nose and a fractured right thigh bone.The Orlando medical examiner had already determined Zavala’s death was the result of blunt-impact trauma. Investigators from the Orange county sheriff’s office found that Epic Universe employees followed all safety procedures and were not negligent in what was deemed an accident.Epic Universe is Universal Orlando Resort’s newest theme park.Security footage captured Zavala appearing “engaged and well” when the ride at the park began – but at its conclusion, he was slumped and unresponsive, the sheriff’s report said.View image in fullscreenKevin Rodriguez Zavala.Photograph: Twitter/XWitnesses described seeing Zavala bleeding from his face and leaning over in his seat once the coaster stopped. Anna Marshall, a physician waiting in line for the ride, told investigators that Zavala appeared “slouched over and surrounded by blood” as the coaster returned to the platform. She said one of his arms dangled over the side and that his thigh bone “was broken in half and resting on the back of the ride chair”.Marshall assisted Zavala, who used a wheelchair, after the incident. His girlfriend, Javiliz Cruz-Robles, who was seated next to him, said that Zavala had metal rods in his back from a prior spinal surgery.Family members told investigators that Zavala’s spinal cord atrophy, the condition behind his disability, had no role in his death on 17 September.When the ride halted, Zavala sustained extensive facial injuries and remained restrained by the lap bar, which could not be released for about ten minutes, according to Universal paramedic Sebastian Torres.Cruz-Robles told investigators that a ride operator had to push the lap bar down multiple times before it locked into place and that it seemed too tight across their laps. She said Zavala was thrown forward during the ride’s first descent, striking his head on the metal bar ahead of them. He hit his head several more times throughout the ride as she struggled unsuccessfully to hold him back.The sheriff’s office noted that warning signs at the ride entrance cautioned guests about sudden drops and accelerations. It also advised against riding with “back, neck or similar physical conditions”, or after recent surgeries or conditions that might be worsened by the ride.Zavala’s parents shared that he had fractured a thigh bone requiring surgery in 2020 and underwent hip surgery following a dislocation in 2010.The roller coaster, a dual-launch design reaching speeds of up to 62mph (100 km/ph), officially opened in May to visitors of Epic Universe.The ruling in Zavala’s death comes after a jurylast December awarded$310m to the family of a 14-year-old boy who was thrown to his death from a since-dismantled free-fall ride at Orlando’s Icon Park in March 2022.

But he also had a gentle side that most people never saw, and a heart as big as gold.”Edwards added: “He was a terrific guy. Truly one of the great actors of our generation. His heart was as big as there was. I’m going to miss him. He was a great friend.”Greene won the best actor prize at the 1994 Taormina film festival for his role in Lodge Kerrigan’s Clean, Shaven, in which he played a man with schizophrenia.He later parlayed his success into roles in numerous films including The Usual Suspects, Under Siege 2 and Training Day alongside Denzel Washington.Greene’s other credits include the action film Judgment Night, the Halle Berry thriller The Rich Man’s Wife, Blue Streak and the Jennifer Aniston action comedy The Bounty Hunter.The actor, who was born in Montclair, New Jersey, leaves behind a sister and a brother.In a rare interview in 2011, Greene admitted he initially turned down the role in Pulp Fiction due to its content.He told The Sissy Gamache Show: “When I got the script, I was thoroughly disappointed.“The way it was written wasn’t my cup of tea. If you ever saw Deliverance, you never saw the guy who took Ned Beatty and made him ‘squeal like a pig’ ever again, so I didn’t think it was a great career move.”However, Tarantino kept pursuing him to take the role and eventually allowed Greene to alter the scene to his preference.Explore more on these topicsFilmPulp FictionNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

Surely this one would be forArsenal. Never before in English football history had a team endured a worse league record after 15 matches than Wolves. In any of the professional divisions. Their haul of two points gave an outline of the grimness, although by no means all of the detail.Before kick-off, the bookmakers had Wolves at 28-1 to win; it was 8-1 for the draw. You just had to hand it to the club’s 3,000 travelling fans who took up their full ticket allocation. There were no trains back to Wolverhampton after the game, obviously. It was a weekend. Mission impossible? This felt like the definition of it.Yet Wolves would scrap and they would confound. For most of the occasion, it felt as if we were watching the shock result of the season play out. Arsenal were horribly off their game. ThePremier Leagueleaders might have cited fatigue as an excuse. It was also possible to wonder whether complacency was at work – in the Emirates Stadium stands, as well, where it was strangely flat and subdued, particularly in the first half.View image in fullscreenSam Johnstone scores an own goal as Bukayo Saka’s corner bounces back off a post.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesMikel Arteta’s team played their trump card on 70 minutes; from a corner, naturally. Little had gone for them in open play. It was Bukayo Saka who sent over the inswinger from the right and it was when Sam Johnstone’s world fell in. The Wolves goalkeeper misread the flight and, scrambling back, he seemed to brush the ball against the far post. Whereupon it bounced back, hit him and went in.The crazy thing was that Rob Edwards’ visitors rebelled. Arsenal tried to protect what they had towards the end and they dropped deep, almost inviting their opponents on. Arteta would be furious about this afterwards.Wolves pushed in the 89th minute, the Arsenal substitute Myles Lewis-Skelly needing to make an important tackle on Tolu Arokodare, who had also come off the bench. Then it happened. When another substitute, Mateus Mané, crossed from the left, Arokodare got in front of Piero Hincapié to flash a header past David Raya. The Emirates announcer gave the goal to Mané. But if he was scrambled, so was everybody.Arsenal found the answer deep into stoppage time; a goal to avert disaster, to paper over the cracks. Just about. Arteta had sent on Gabriel Jesus and he challenged in front of goal when Saka crossed from the right. The ball, though, flew in off the head of Yerson Mosquera. Another own goal; devastation for him and Wolves. The defender lay supine for what felt like an age.View image in fullscreenWolves players celebrate after the late equaliser that seemed to have earned them an unlikely point.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesThe relief for Arsenal was palpable. Arteta had seen his team’s lead at the top cut to two points after the 2-1 loss at Aston Villa the previous Saturday. He could not countenance another slip. He needed to apply the pressure on Manchester City before their visit to Crystal Palace on Sunday. The positive reading was that winning ugly is the hallmark of champions. It was certainly ugly.“We had a period of two or three minutes [being] deep, totally passive, with horrible defensive habits,” Arteta said of that spell near the end. “That is nowhere near the level that is required. We are relieved because we managed to score a goal at the end and go on winning but we need to improve in that sense, for sure. We made it even harder with what we did in the manner that we conceded the goal. That’s unacceptable.”Wolves had set an extraordinarily low bar with their performance in the 4-1 home defeat against Manchester United last Monday but even so, this was much better from them from the first whistle. The commitment was there, especially in the duels. Emmanuel Agbadou was a symbol of it at the back, slamming the door on Viktor Gyökeres. Toti was good alongside him and so was João Gomes in midfield.Arsenal were terrible in the first half. So slow, so predictable. Pretty much everything in open play went through Saka on the right but try as he did and slippery as he was, he could not make it happen. Arteta’s team had only one big chance before the interval which, inevitably, came from an inswinging Declan Rice corner. Gabriel Martinelli was unmarked beyond the far post but he directed his header across goal and wide. Martinelli had two other flickers only to lack conviction.Quick GuideMatch factsShow• Yerson Mosquera putting through his own net was the 18th 90th-minute winning own goal in Premier League history. 33% of these have been for an Arsenal win (6/18), with two now against Wolves at the Emirates Stadium (also José Sá in February 2022).• Wolves have now scored two own goals in a single Premier League game on three occasions, with two of those coming against Arsenal (also at Molineux in the hosts' 4-1 defeat November 2009). No side has conceded multiple own goals in more different games.• This was the seventh time a team have scored twice in a Premier League match with both goals being own goals, and the first since Leicester lost 2-1 at Liverpool in December 2022.OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The moment to quicken the pulses in the first half came at the other end, when Wolves broke after repelling a 27th minute corner. Hwang Hee-chan ran from his own half with nobody bar Raya in front of him and a posse of chasing red behind him; a cat among the pigeons. He kept running and unloaded the shot, Raya getting down to save. Hincapié did well to block from Jørgen Strand Larsen on 45 minutes after initially slipping over.View image in fullscreenHwang Hee-chan clatters in to Myles Lewis-Skelly to earn himself a yellow card.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesArteta had gone as strong as possible with his lineup – no rest for many of his overexerted players – and the task was to plot a route through Edwards’s 5-3-2 system. William Saliba and Rice were back after absences and Arteta was forced into a reshuffle when Ben White, on a rare start at right-back, was forced off on the half-hour with a hamstring problem.With almost an hour on the clock, it was impossible to ignore the anxiety in the home seats. Was it going to be one of those nights? The sluggishness of their team was hard to explain. Arteta made a triple change, introducing Mikel Merino, Martin Ødegaard and Leandro Trossard. Off went the ineffective Martín Zubimendi, Eberechi Eze and Martinelli, the last of whom had just curled a shot past the far post.Arteta raged when Hwang slid into Lewis-Skelly and was booked – the manager wanted a red card, although there was not enough in it for that. Arteta watched Rice go close with a free-kick and then force a fine low save out of Johnstone. The goalkeeper’s descent from potential hero to villain was stunning, the first own goal of the night a real howler. The second brought Wolves to their knees.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

One day after becomingthe oldest woman to win a World Cup race, the American came within a quarter-second of doing it again, finishing second in Saturday’s downhill at St Moritz behind Germany’s Emma Aicher.Less than 24 hours after rewriting the World Cup age record, Vonn briefly looked on course for another victory as she surged ahead of Italy’s Sofia Goggia on the sunlit Corviglia course. But Aicher, skiing immediately after her, attacked the increasingly rutted track and edged Vonn by 0.24 seconds to deny her a rare opening-weekend double.Goggia, the2018 Olympic downhill champion, finished third, 0.29 seconds behind Aicher, while American world champion Breezy Johnson placed fourth, 0.40 back.The difference for Vonn came midway down the course, where she landed awkwardly off a jump and was forced into a sharp correction after losing her balance. The mistake disrupted her rhythm and cost speed on the lower section, where she had been dominant a day earlier.View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn competes in the women's downhill race on Saturday in St Moritz.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images“I skied pretty well, but I was a little bit out of balance today,” Vonn said. “Yesterday was so emotional it took a lot of energy, and I didn’t sleep that great. I know I can be better.”Even so, the result reinforced the scale of Vonn’s resurgencesince returning to the World Cup last seasonafter nearly six years away from the sport and a partial knee replacement that left her racing with titanium implants in her right leg. She once again posted some of the fastest speeds in the field and remains atop the downhill standings after two races.For Aicher, the victory was her third World Cup win and second in downhill, further establishing the 22-year-old as one of the tour’s most versatile skiers. She has already reached the podium in slalom this season, underscoring her all-around credentials.The St Moritz weekend concludes with a super-G on Sunday, where Vonn is expected to line up alongside teammate Mikaela Shiffrin, who surpassed heras the most successful women’s World Cup skier of all timein 2023. With the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics on the horizon, Vonn’s back-to-back podiums have quickly transformed her comeback from curiosity into genuine medal contention.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingMikaela ShiffrinUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But voters still said no to Bonds and ClemensHoward BryantWith Trump championing Pete Rose and pressuring MLB’s commissioner, the Hall of Fame vote became a referendum on power, memory and whether integrity still mattersSat 13 Dec 2025 04.30 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 16.26 ESTShareSince mid-May, when Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred announced Pete Rosewould be eligible for Hall of Fame considerationandexplained his specious reasonings behind it, last week’s Hall of Fame vote by the 16-member Classic Era committee carried with it a certain air of inevitability for Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds, the two greatest players currently not enshrined in Cooperstown.Rose was championed by Donald Trump, who used his populism to demand the Hit King finally be allowed into the Hall, an honor denied Rose since 1989 when baseball placed him on the permanently ineligible list for betting on games when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. After Rosedied in September 2024, Trump then won the presidency five weeks later and immediately increased the pressure on Manfred to end Rose’s 36-year banishment – despite the absence of any evidence suggesting Rose was any less guilty in death of gambling on the sport than he had been alive. Nevertheless, Manfred acquiesced to Trump, and in 2027, for the first time, Pete Rose will be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame.Pete Rose returns to the Hall conversation as baseball embraces his original sinRead moreThat specter of that capitulation, the brutish application of power has defined both the current political and cultural moment. Integrity has been as much under assault as democracy – it’s a word for wimps and hand-wringers. Accountability is for suckers – the ones too weak to get their own way, not man enough to take what they want. People feel numb, and with numbness comes surrender. Relentlessly battered by wanton presidential pardons, indifference to the deconstruction of stabilizing norms, all amid rampant oligarchal pillage – and it becomes seductive to embrace the warm cocoon of nihilism. Nobody cares. The President of the United States is after all, not anecdotally but legally, a convicted felon, but not only has this fact not been disqualifying, it is barely mentioned.Whether its betting or NIL, the latest college scandal or labor, sports has been enveloped in its own waves of destabilization and numbness, fatigue and cynicism, and in the weeks leading up to the vote, Bonds and Clemens were expected to benefit from these sentiments. Beyond Trump’s America, the height of the PED scandal occurred nearly a quarter century ago, and the reflex that enough time has passed, each has paid a cost, and its time to close the chapter on the Steroid Era is a powerful and common one. Both Clemens and Bonds retired in 2007. Both fell off of theBaseballWriters Association of America’s writer’s ballot after a 10-year odyssey of discomfort. (Needing 75% of the votes for induction Bonds topped out at 66%, Clemens as 65.2%.) Both have been denied for nearly a decade and a half, and the sudden creation of a pathway for Rose seemed to provide sunlight for the simultaneously disgraced and legendary players of the Steroid Era – Alex Rodriguez, Gary Sheffield, and possibly Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, too – to one day receive a reappraisal.They did not. Neither was inducted. Both were rebuked, receiving less than the five votes required to be reconsidered in two years. Incidentally the one player elected, Jeff Kent, was a teammate of both Bonds (San Francisco, 1997-2002), and Clemens, (Houston, 2004). Many of the voters were former players, and the while they did not and have never doubted the greatness of Bonds, Clemens or the numbers they produced, they did, however, decide not to succumb to the creeping nihilism of today. It has its limits.Ironically, the price of upholding the game’s integrity has been a week’s worth of ridicule. Kent has not been warmly embraced as the newest member of the immortal club, but proof that without Bonds and Clemens, the Hall of Fame is now a lesser place, less relevant, less legitimate place as long as Bonds and Clemens remain uninvited. He hit more home runs than any second baseman in history but must spend the next seven and a half months until the July induction ceremonies creating a protective scaffolding around his enshrinement, for the moment his guard drops, the conversation will shift away from him and back to Clemens, back to Bonds.View image in fullscreenPete Rose’s controversial candidacy for the Hall of Fame was championed by Donald Trump, who used his populism to demand the Hit King finally be allowed in.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesNone of which is to suggest that the people who run baseball heroically protected the sport’s interest during a cynical time – that distinction belonged to the collection of 16 former players, executive and media, who have not forgiven the era – especially the former players, who may be accused of settling old scores, but also were brought up in the game with a hardline attitude toward gambling – its prohibition is the first sign on every clubhouse door – and steroids. Ex-players, especially at Hall of Fame level from the pre-1994 strike years, have been threatening to boycott induction ceremonies of known steroid users for two decades, and counting.Manfred, meanwhile, is perfectly willing to embrace the times. In reversing the game’s prohibition on Rose, the commissioner reasoned that posthumously, Rose no longer posed any threat to the integrity of the sport. Under the same reasoning, Manfred also returned the Joe Jackson ofthe infamous 1919 Chicago White Soxto the ballot, one of the game’s original casualties of betting on baseball. As part of the Black Sox, Jackson has been banned since 1920, and dead since 1951 – clearly posing no threat to the integrity of the game. Manfred has been commissioner for the past decade, but it was only when Trump pressured him on Rose did Manfred apply the same logic to Shoeless Joe.Black players are disappearing from the sport. There was a higher percentage of African Americans in baseball in 1965 than there was in 2025, yet in currying favor to Trump and his attack on so-called “DEI”, the commissioner eliminated programs designed to improve those numbers it once said it was committed to – and profits from every 15 April, when it celebrates Jackie Robinson even as Black players are actively erased from the sport.And there is no greater example of cynicism and greed in baseball than its top-rope leap headfirst into gambling – just like the other sports. The consequences are already emerging. The game’s greatest player,Shohei Ohtani, was involved in (and ultimately found to be the victim of) a gambling scandal, and one of the game’s best closers Cleveland’s Emmanuel Clase, is currently under investigation and may never pitch in the major leagues again.Their baseball community peers choosing not to elect Bonds and Clemens is not a victory – if keeping them out is necessary, it is done so uncomfortably for no positive can be taken from the greatest pitcher and greatest hitter of their times never having their moment at the podium. Everyone has lost, and continues to do so – just as they have with Rose and do with Alex Rodriguez and his 3,115 hits and 696 home runs on the outside of enshrinement. The victory lies not in their banishment but – despite the eyerolls – in the brief rejection of cynicism, the rejection of the idea that history does not matter, that rules and standards do not matter, accountability is a nuisance, that nothing matters. The notion itself has always been something of an ahistorical misdirection designed to opiate dissidence, because neither Bonds nor Clemens, nor inclusion to Cooperstown has ever produced indifference. It’salwaysmattered. Last week’s vote was just the latest reminder.Howard Bryant is the author of 11 books, including Kings and Pawns: Jackie Robinson and Paul Robeson in America, to be published by Mariner Books in January 2026.Explore more on these topicsMLBBaseballUS sportsShohei OhtaniDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Minnesota sent center Marco Rossi, defenseman Zeev Buium, winger Liam Ohgren and a first-round pick in the 2026 draft to suddenly rebuilding Vancouver to complete the deal.The trade was the second major swap of the day, after two-time Stanley Cup final runner-up Edmonton finally made a move for a goaltender, acquiring Tristan Jarry from Pittsburgh.Rossi (24), Ohgren (21) and Buium (20) fit the mold of the young talent the Canucks were speculated to be targeting if they were going to trade Hughes. Rossi (2020), Ohgren (2022) and Buium (2024) were all recent first-round draft picks by the Wild.“Quinn played hard, led by example and did a lot of very good things for the Canucks,” Vancouver general manager Patrik Allvin said. “Trading away a player of this caliber is never an easy decision to make, but it was one we had to do to make our team better. We are so excited to add a solid centre in Marco, a good young blueliner in Zeev and a versatile forward in Liam. This year’s draft is a strong one, so acquiring a first-round pick was also a big part of this deal.”Hughes had no trade-blocking protection in his current deal that pays him an average of $7.85m annually. Hughes, who is 26 and widely considered the best at player on the blue line behind only Colorado’s Cale Makar, is signed through the 2026-27 season before he can become an unrestricted free agent.View image in fullscreenQuinn Hughes won the 2024 Norris Trophy winner as the league’s top defenseman.Photograph: Derek Cain/Getty ImagesThe Wild will not be allowed to extend Hughes until 1 July, and it’s unclear if he would consider signing a new contract with them. There has been plenty of buzz around the league that Quinn wants to play with his brothers, Jack and Luke, with the New Jersey Devils.They could potentially be teammates on the US Olympic team, either in February in Milan or in 2030. Wild general manager Bill Guerin runs USA Hockey’s management team.The long-term outlook for Hughes can wait until next summer, though. The Wild are focused on challenging the two top teams ahead of them in the loaded Central Division, rivals that happen to also have the top two records in the NHL: Colorado and Dallas.The season-long celebration of the franchise’s 25th anniversary would be a lot more meaningful if the Wild can finally advance in the playoffs, having lost nine straight series after a first-round victory over St Louis in 2015. The Wild have passed the second round just once in their entire existence, when they were swept in the Western Conference finals by Anaheim in 2003.Hughes is a significant upgrade to Minnesota’s blue line, anchored by captain and 16-year veteran Jared Spurgeon, smooth-skating 14-year veteran Jonas Brodin and young stalwart Brock Faber. The emergence of rookie goalie Jesper Wallstedt this season has given the Wild a reliable tandem with Filip Gustavsson in the net, with star winger Kirill Kaprizov leading the attack after recently signing the richest contract in hockey history to stay in the “State of Hockey” through 2034.After a rough start, the Wild are 14-3-2 since 1 November. They host Ottawa on Saturday and Boston on Sunday night, with the latter game likely the more realistic one for Hughes to debut.Hughes had two goals, 21 assists and 32 blocked shots in 23 games this season with the last-in-the-NHL Canucks. When he won the Norris Trophy two seasons ago, Hughes had 17 goals and 75 assists, both single-season franchise records for defensemen and the most among all blue liners in the league. Drafted seventh overall in 2018 out of Michigan, the native of Orlando, Florida, spent time growing up in the Boston and Toronto areas while his father, a hockey coach, moved around.This was Hughes’ third season as Vancouver’s captain, and his abrupt exit paves the way for more change 11 months since the trade of JT Miller to the New York Rangers and in the aftermath of coach Rick Tocchet’s departure.“With the circumstances surrounding JT and now Quinn, we are fortunate to acquire these very good young players from Minnesota,” Canucks president of hockey operations Jim Rutherford said. “They will be a key part of the rebuild that we are currently in, giving us a bright future moving forward. The hockey club will continue to build with talented young players using that as a blueprint to become a contender sooner rather than later.”Explore more on these topicsNHLMinnesota WildVancouver CanucksIce hockeyUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But, even when reminiscing, The Preacher can’t escape the fact that, this weekend, it will be exactly three months since his lost friend is thought to have taken his own life at the age of 46. On 14 September, Hatton’s body was found at home, in Hyde, six miles from where we sit now in Mossley, on the outskirts of Manchester.View image in fullscreenBilly Graham and Ricky Hatton after victory over Freddie Pendleton in 2001.Photograph: Andy Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersFor weeks there was anoutpouring of grief and lovefor Hatton in Manchester and boxing. The pain continues, privately, among thefighter’s familyand friends. But a national story brought a sobering acceptance that such glory and fervour will not return soon to boxing in this country. It is hard to imagine a fighter today being able toconjure up the magicwhich Hatton once created. Tens of thousands of fans, most of whom considered themselves personal friends of The Hitman, followed the wise-cracking, ferocious urchin-faced boxer from Manchester to Las Vegas with roaring joy.Before then, in mid-December 1999, two years into his pro career, Hatton’s record was a pristine 16‑0. But, rather than thinking about endorsement deals or pay-per-view sales, the boxer and his trainer had history in mind. “We sat on the steps all the time,” Graham says. “All the other fighters had gone and we’d talk about what we were going to do. I told him how good he was and that he’d definitely get in the Hall of Fame.”Last year, 15 months before his death, Hatton was inducted into the InternationalBoxingHall of Fame in Canastota, upstate New York. It completed a 25-year odyssey to reach the pantheon. “You can’t get better than that,” Graham says. “There’ve been loads of great fighters who can’t make the Hall of Fame. You can be a ‘world’ champion or even the undisputed but the Hall of Fame is the ultimate, innit?”The Preacher covers his eyes as tears slip through his fingers. “Can you get me some tissues?” he mumbles. “I’m not a soft fucker. When I get angry, I don’t cry. But I am now …”In 2010 Grahamtook legal actionagainst Hatton and his father, Ray, in a dispute over money owed to the trainer. The Hattons settled out of court. Ricky and his parents, meanwhile,became bitterly estrangedand did not speak to each other for years.View image in fullscreenBilly Graham at his home in Manchester.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianGraham still feels bereft. But he wipes his eyes after I mention a specific bout, in June 2000, when Hatton fought Gilbert Quiros in Detroit. Against Quiros, who was nicknamed The Animal, Hatton was tested like never before. “That fight was the most important fight of Ricky’s life,” Graham says.“Ricky handled nerves better than any fighter I ever had. But he was agitated because he’d found out his girlfriend was pregnant [with his now 24-year-old son Campbell] and he was cutting weight. We went down to the Kronk [the famous Detroit gym] as I wanted to see Quiros. He looked so dangerous on the bag, like Thomas Hearns. Tall, skinny and every shot he landed was really hard.“Nobody else wore body belts [the protector which Graham used to absorb Hatton’s blows in training] then. I was also wearing ridiculous shorts because I’d forgotten to wash my kit. So everyone was laughing at us. We were the only white guys – and Ricky was the whitest kid they’d ever seen. I didn’t want to exhaust Ricky but I said: ‘I want one fantastic round where you show everything and back me up against the ropes.’ They were taking the piss out of us but then, when Ricky started throwing punches, they were whooping:‘Wow! Whoa!’They all fell in love with him.”Graham shudders. “The fight was horrendous. Quiros was scary, landing jabs, uppercuts, body shots. But Ricky never panicked, even after a huge cut above his eye. He came back to the corner after the first round and went: ‘I’ve got double vision and he winded me.’ I said: ‘You’ve got to back him up because this is drastic.’”Hatton tore into Quiros and stopped him with a deadly body shot after a blistering series of combinations. Graham says: “The natural reaction of any young fighter when cut like that is to back off. It’s not normal to walk straight into the tornado. That’s when I really knew how special Ricky was because he came through a terrible situation. The last doubts were gone.”Five years later, in June 2005, Hatton reached the summit of his career when he faced theformidable Kostya Tszyuat the MEN Arena in Manchester. Hatton had won all 38 of his previous contests but the IBF junior-welterweight title showdown between two driven men was framed by a darkness.View image in fullscreenRicky Hatton fights Kostya Tszyu in Manchester in 2005. ‘A lot of people didn’t want that fight because Tszyu was so dangerous’.Photograph: John Gichigi/Getty Images“A lot of people didn’t want that fight because Tszyu was so dangerous,” Graham recalls. “But Ricky was mad for it because he wanted the glory. That was our dream – to be the best in the world. We knew how good Tszyu was and that his style was really dodgy for Ricky. I was confident but I knew Tszyu could knock him out. I went to his house the day before and said: ‘Listen Ricky, you’re going to try to break each other, and it’s going to be really hard.’”When Graham was picked up by a car the following night, he was “absolutely shitting myself. But by the time I got to the dressing room I was completely different. As I walked in, Ricky was shadow boxing in front of the mirror. I started shadow boxing in front of him. Ricky held his nerve like Clint Eastwood in a gunfight.”View image in fullscreenBilly and Ricky celebrate in the ring after the victory over Kostya Tszyu, which was a fight that changed both of their lives.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyGraham adds: “When I was a boxer people used to ask: ‘Are you looking forward to the fight?’ I’d go: ‘No, I’m looking forward to getting it over with.’ When it’s over you think: ‘That was fucking fantastic!’ But it’s horrible until then.”The intensity, he confirms, was “unbelievable. We all have dreams but it’s very rare they come true. Ours did that night.”Tszyu was rescued by his corner before the last round. “I turned around and saw what had happened,” Graham says. “I told Ricky: ‘It’s over. It’s over.’ Oh, the relief on his face. I went: ‘You fucking did it.’ And Ricky said: ‘No,wedid it.’”Graham cries silently, his chest heaving. I try to comfort him, telling him that tears are understandable. “No, they’re not,” the 70-year-old says gruffly. “I’m sick of crying.”The Preacher believes “the lunatics took over the asylum” after their momentous victory. Money and fame rolled in and Hatton, needing to feel loved, revelled in the adoration. But he also drank too much and, as his searing focus diluted, the demons gnawed at him. Hatton had eight more fights in four years but they included two cataclysmic knockout defeats byFloyd Mayweather JrandManny Pacquiao.He slipped into a deep depression, fuelled by alcohol. In 2012,Hatton told me: “It got to a point where I didn’t care if I lived or died. I’d been this working-class hero, this down-to-earth Manchester lad, who people liked so much that 25,000 of them flew to Vegas to watch me fight, singing: ‘There’s only one Ricky Hatton …’ They ended up with another Ricky Hatton altogether – a drunk, crying in the corner of a pub. They used to say: ‘What a fighter! What a cracking lad!’ and then they saw this weeping wreck.”View image in fullscreenManny Pacquiao delivers a devastating second round knockout defeat to Ricky Hatton in 2009.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesHatton’s comeback that same year ended in another stoppage defeat toVyacheslav Senchenko, an unheralded Ukrainian. The next dozen years were difficult but his greatest achievements in the ring meant the Hall of Fame came calling in 2024.Jane Couch, who had defeated the British Boxing of Control in court in 1998 when they refused to grant a professional licence to her or any female fighter, became a hall of famer that same summer. She was a courageous pioneer whosuffered enormously from cruel prejudice. Hatton was one of her staunchest supporters and they shared their personal struggles.It was a beautiful ending in boxing for both of them when theytravelled to Canastota to be honoured. Couch says: “When I got the call from the Hall of Fame I was in shock. I sent Rick a message: ‘We made it.’ Ricky rang me and he went: ‘I can’t fucking believe it.’ We met at Manchester airport and had a Guinness before we got on the plane to New York. We then had to get a car to Canastota and we had a natter for the next seven hours – but I’m good at reading people and I knew he wasn’t right.“A few days later we went for a wander round the grounds of Canastota and he told me the story of him and Billy sitting on the steps of the gym and dreaming of being in the Hall of Fame. I knew they hadn’t spoken much for years but I said: ‘Should I ring Billy now?’ Ricky was like: ‘Er … yeah. Go on.’ I tried but we couldn’t get hold of Billy.View image in fullscreenBilly Graham with the retired boxer and close friend of Ricky Hatton, Jane Couch.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I could tell Ricky was agitated and not well. When he had to go on stage in Canastota he turned it into a comedy show because he liked to make everybody laugh.”A few weeks later Hatton said he had spoken to his old trainer.“That never happened,” Graham tells Couch and me.“Ricky was struggling,” the 57-year-old Couch reminds him.“Of course,” Graham stresses. “I should have been the bigger man. But I couldn’t understand how he was fearless in the ring but would let people manipulate him outside. He couldn’t stand up for himself.”Hatton tried previously to speak to him and Graham looks mortified. Even when we urge him to think of all he did for Hatton over the years, rather than torturing himself for not calling the fighter in the last few months, he is adamant: “There’s no way I can stop feeling guilty.”The day after Hatton died, Graham left a bunch of flowers outside the fighter’s house, with a simple note: “Sorry I wasn’t there for you. Love Billy (The Preacher) x.”View image in fullscreenBilly Graham’s note and flowers laid outside of Ricky Hatton’s home.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAEarlier that devastating Sunday, Matthew Hatton, Ricky’s brother, was at home when the police arrived.“I immediately knew something was wrong and I think I was the first person they told,” Matthew says at his brother’s old gym in Hyde. “My wife, Jenna, was out and [their children] Jack and Lola were still in bed. Jenna and I agreed we’d tell them together but Jack came downstairs. I couldn’t talk and so Jack just asked me: ‘What’s wrong?’ I told him.”Seventeen-year-old Jack and 13-year-old Lola are both boxers. They were close to their uncle and Matthew says: “We went on family holidays together to Tenerife. Ricky wanted to be with us and he felt wanted and needed by Jack so they had a great relationship. Ricky was a coach so he also saw that Jack had plenty of boxing ability.”Reflecting on how his family has coped these past three months, Matthew believes “the boxing has been a distraction because, after a break, Jack and Lola have done so well. We speak about him every day and, while it’s easy to get down, people’s stories about Richard have helped us so much.“But it’s still like a bad dream – even though he’s so well thought of round here you see pictures of him wherever you go. For two weeks I didn’t leave the house much or answer my phone. I only went to see Mum and Dad, Campbell and the family. But I started drifting back into the gym because people depend on me. My own kids need me and they’ve kept me busy.”Matthew, who is 44, was good enough toface Canelo Álvarezin a WBC world title fight in 2011. But he was different to his big brother. “Rick liked being in the spotlight but, as we get older, we fade away and he’d have hated that. He had a big soul and his problems with alcohol – but Ricky crammed more into his life than some people would cram into three lives.”Hope surges through the gym where Jack and Lola are as thoughtful as they are confident. When I ask them to describe Ricky, Lola says, “I never saw him as a legend like the world did. He was just our uncle and we’d go around for tea and on holidays together. I’d describe him as loving and funny.”Jack nods. “You wouldn’t think he was thisbig, famous personfrom the way he acted. He were just funny, down‑to-earth and caring.”Ricky loved the fact that Jack and Lola were boxers. “Definitely,” Jack says. “He was my uncle but on other days he’d be my coach. We miss him a lot.”View image in fullscreenMatthew Hatton with his teenage children Lola and Jack, who are both boxers following in the footsteps of their father and their uncle.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianDo they watch his fights? “Yes,” Lola exclaims. “I remember watching the Kostya Tszyu fight and he was such an entertaining fighter. He was on the front foot constantly.”Lola has won eight out of 10 bouts and her two narrow losses came against a girl on the England team. “She was good,” Matthew says, “but we thought Lola possibly won the last one.”“Next time,” a determined Lola says. Her immediate aim is to box for England while Jack dreams of fighting professionally. He has won three national titles, the most recent beinglast month, and 43 of 48 fights.“Jack asked me to do the amateur badges so I could go in his corner and it’s gone extremely well,” Matthew says. “He’s had 18 fights and won them all since I’ve started working his corner. But I’d be a liar if I said I didn’t get nervous.”How does Lola feel when watching her brother? “If he’s fighting someone good, I’m a bit nervous. But I don’t doubt him. He always wins.”“I like that answer,” Jack says with a grin.“We were on holiday in Tenerife,” their father remembers, “and someone wanted a picture of Jack as he’s quite well-known already. I started laughing when Lola said: ‘I want some of this.’ We’ve never really encouraged the boxing. But we’re a sporting family, with my boxing background and their mum swam for Great Britain. Jack used to tell me he hated boxing. I thought: ‘Yeah!’ But we started doing a little in lockdown to keep fit. He got into it and then joined an amateur gym. Lola’s interest started when she saw how well Jack was doing.”Asked if they feel the weight of the Hatton name, Jack and Lola answer sensibly by stressing that they can just do their best. “Ricky was such a fantastic fighter and character that I suffered criticism in my career,” Matthew says. “You get great opportunities but with it comes pressure. At first I didn’t want them to box because of that pressure but, now they’re doing it, they’re going to do it properly. I’m quite tough because people always perform better against them. They want that Hatton name on their record. That’s got to push these two on in difficult moments. But they really embrace it.“When Jack won his latest national title we took a coach [of supporters] and everyone enjoyed it. People are itching to get behind Jack. It will be the same with Lola. I think there are going to be some really good nights ahead.”View image in fullscreenRicky Hatton at the Mottram and Hattersley ABC boxing gym in 1999.Photograph: John Gichigi/Getty ImagesThere was a special night last month as, on his way to that title as National Boys club champion in the 57kg division, Jack won two fights in Fleetwood, Couch’s home town. Couch, who organised the show, says: “It seemed fitting for Ricky that we were all together – Matthew, Jack, Lola, me and Billy.”Graham trained Matthew for a considerable period. And Couch, who headed Hatton Promotions for a spell, helped promote Matthew to the European welterweight title in 2010. “I love Matthew,” she says. “He’s such a good guy and went straight over to Billy. They shook hands, hugged and had a good conversation. Then Jack and Lola met Billy. It was beautiful and Billy told Jack his body shots reminded him of [the light-heavyweight] Callum Smith. I loved seeing Billy look happy again.”The Preacher smiles. “It was great. Jack and Lola were fantastic and I was proud they wanted photographs with me.”As the sadness ebbs a little I ask Couch how she will remember Ricky. “As my friend,” she says.Couch plays me the last voicemail he sent her. The boxer’s familiar voice echoes from her phone and, after a rambling but grateful message to his old pal,Ricky Hattonsays a last few words: “Hope you’re all right, sweetheart.

It ended with the Egyptian doing a one-man lap of honour at Anfield, an attempt to rebuild trust with the supporters after creating a ceasefire, if not a complete truce, with Arne Slot.Over the past seven days a lot has changed, but one thing remained the same, Salah started a Premier League game on the bench, not that he needed to wait long for a chance to do his talking on the pitch. He would finish with an assist after playing 75 minutes against Brighton in a game in which he desperately wanted to score. Maybe his parade was the beginning of the end, but it felt more like the start of the apology that should continue after the Africa Cup of Nations, giving both parties space to breathe.Mohamed Salah returns and sets up Ekitiké to help Liverpool beat BrightonRead moreDropped for the trip to Inter after his combustion at Elland Road, having sat idle whileLiverpool drew at Leeds, Salah had been recalled to the squad. Criticism has been thrown at him from all angles and Liverpool supporters will have wondered if this was their last chance to see him in the flesh.“Salah has been part of a group that has provided me with unrivalled joy as a football fan, which will be the overwhelming memory, but there will be that little asterisk now,” said Navneet Singh, aLiverpoolseason-ticket holder. “There’s a difference between the best and your favourite players. Robbie Fowler and John Barnes are my favourite Liverpool players. But part of the reason they’re my favourites is because they didn’t have incidents like this.”Some supporters would have been happy if Salah had not played for the club again. At times that felt a real possibility, but he was still in red after the air was somewhat cleared on Friday by talks between Salah and Slot.Salah’s face is at the forefront of Anfield, featuring on banners and murals, one with a crown atop his head. In a region where royalty is often dismissed, only footballing heroes deserve to be crowned, but supporters do not like it when someone thinks they are more important than the collective. Many stopped to take selfies in front of Salah’s image, possibly worried that if things deteriorated it would only take a few spray paint cans for a new hero to emerge.View image in fullscreenLiverpool fans show their support for Mohamed Salah at Anfield.Photograph: Jon Super/APThe mascots were pleased to see Salah, exchanging high fives in the tunnel. He walked on to the pitch with Dominik Szoboszlai’s arm around his shoulder, before taking in the surroundings of his second home by standing alone on the edge of the penalty area. His family was in the stands.View image in fullscreenArne Slot allowed his set-piece coach Aaron Briggs to give Mohamed Salah instructions when he came on.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAWith the expectation of a watching brief, Salah got to enjoy an intense conversation with Andy Robertson, before turning to jokes. Salah’s face was stern, and an opener after 46 seconds from Hugo Ekitiké must have made him question if he would be required. He did not need to wait long.The sparsity of experienced substitutes brought Salah into the game in the 26th minute, replacing the injured Joe Gomez as part of a tactical rejig. The coaching instructions did not come directly from Slot, instead set-piece coach Aaron Briggs informed Salah what was required. It was not a raucous introduction, but he was more than warmly applauded when his name was announced, followed by a chorus of ‘Mo Salah running down the wing’. That song immediately came to life and Salah could have had an assist within seconds.He brought his own high-tempo brand of energy, desperate to prove a point to his manager and using his anger to fuel his performance. Having not started the past four games, and not featured at all in the previous two, there was plenty of pent up rage Salah wanted to channel into goals, but fell short.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Federico Chiesa lined up an easy chance for Salah in injury time, only to watch his teammate fire over from close range. Salah was left on the ground, exhausted from a week that will provide a lengthy chapter in his Liverpool career.Being at the centre of a storm is draining and Salah has felt the full effect. Using his time to praise the fans gave the impression of an admission of guilt that he committed the cardinal sin of putting himself above the team. “He will always be a legendary player here, but he might have cost himself a statue outside the ground,” Singh said.Earning trust back from those who have idolised him will be important because even if the relationship is strained, when the Egyptian does leave, he will be desperate for it to be on better terms.Salah was the last man to leave the pitch, but he has come back in from the cold. His comments in the mixed zone were cool, too, saying “two weeks in a row?” and smartly walking on.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolanalysisShareReuse this content"

His death comes 50 years to the day since he made his Sunderland debut and just a day before the Black Cats host the Magpies in the first Premier League derby between the clubs since March 2016, at which the hosts will mark Rowell’s death.A club statement said: “We are truly devastated to announce the death of the legendary Gary Rowell, who has passed away at the age of 68 after a long battle with leukaemia.“Gary passed away on Saturday afternoon – 50 years to the very day he made his Sunderland debut – surrounded by his sons Chris and Peter, who accompanied him when he was inducted into the SAFC Hall of Fame in 2020.”Rowell made 297 appearances for the club of which he was a lifelong supporter and scored 103 goals during a 12-year stay at Roker Park.

It was far from obvious. There was a clear sense Maresca was directing a message to somebody: he made the statement in response to a question about Malo Gusto’s form and repeated it before clarifying: “I love the fans and we are very happy with the fans.” Nor did it seem that he meant the media; he has never previously given any indication he cares what journalists and pundits say, there was no sense of hostility and he had appeared in perfectly good spirits at his pre-match press conference.Mohamed Salah returns and sets up Ekitiké to help Liverpool beat BrightonRead moreGiven he accepted the blame – again, without being pressed on the issue – for thedefeat at Leeds, saying he had got the team selection wrong, the implication was that somebody within the club has challenged or in some other way annoyed Maresca sincethe Atalanta defeat. The issue, though, is far from clear; asked if he was talking about some “internal” problem, Maresca replied “in general”.After three games without a win, this was a much-needed victory but it was one that highlighted the oddity of Maresca’s side. They have a squad packed with extraordinary talent, and are capable of passages of exceptional football, but they are also wildly inconsistent, even within individual games.They won easily, could have won more easily, and yet also had spells in which the game threatened to slip from their grasp. Every time it looks like everything might be coalescing into something coherent, perhaps even title-challenging, they stumble, and every time it looks like a blip might become a crisis, they embark on a run of positive form.WhenChelsea drew against Arsenaltwo weeks ago, despite being reduced to 10 men before half-time, it meant they had lost just one in 12 in all competitions and it was possible to see them taking advantage if Arsenal faltered. Since then, though, they have lost to Leeds and Atalanta and beenheld to a draw at Bournemouth. They began the weekend fifth, eight points off the top, and are 13th in the Champions League table. Perhaps that level of inconsistency is inevitable with a squad so young; which is where it’s worth remembering that their youth is a policy based not in economic necessity but through a conscious policy of regarding players as assets to be spun and sold at profit.View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca was all smiles at the final whistle, but his later comments were puzzling.Photograph: Robin Jones/Getty ImagesThe loss of Moisés Caicedo, suspended for three league games after that red card against Arsenal, obviously has not helped, but he was available against Atalanta and couldn’t maintain second-half control.Injuries at the back have not helped, with Levi Colwill suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury in August. Although Wesley Fofana is back after missing four games through concussion, Maresca is reluctant to risk playing him more than once a week. The difference when he plays is stark: one defeat in 10 when Fofana has started this season, five defeats in 14 when he has not. Chelsea have not conceded more than once with him on the pitch in any game this season. It is not that Trevoh Chalobah, Tosin Adarabioyo or Josh Acheampong aren’t up to it; more that they benefit from having an experienced head alongside them. Thiago Silva, arguably, has never properly been replaced.Cole Palmer, making his first appearance at Stamford Bridge since the opening weekend of the season, got his first goal in almost three months as he latched on to Gusto’s through-ball to put Chelsea ahead in the 21st minute. Gusto added a second, turning in a cut-back from Pedro Neto, just before half-time.View image in fullscreenMalo Gusto leaves Everton on the floor after putting Chelsea two goals up.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesWithout ever really looking like they would get back into the game,Evertonhad their chances, and Iliman Ndiaye rolled an effort against the post late on.“I’m disappointed because we didn’t win, and disappointed because we got a couple of injuries but not disappointed with how we played,” said David Moyes. “Maybe we just ran short of the quality needed when we got the chances.”If one chance had been taken, the mood might have changed and it might have been a different story. But that’s the nature of this Chelsea: for all their glitter, for all they are capable of challenging the very best, there is a brittleness to them. And that, ultimately, will probably prevent them winning the very biggest titles.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That tournament can be seen in hindsight as a watershed for the English game, the first indication that the elite player performance plan (EPPP) and the England DNA project – taking youth football seriously – might be beginning to pay off.Youth football is notoriously unpredictable and England’s record in the Under-17 World Cup since shows a failure to qualify and a pair of last-16 exits, but following that 2017 success, England’s senior side have reached two European Championship finals and a World Cup semi-final, while the under-21s have won two European titles. Two previous Golden Ball winners from Under-17 World Cups – Cesc Fàbregas and Toni Kroos – have gone on to win the senior World Cup. Some, such as Landon Donovan, Anderson and Kelechi Iheanacho have had perfectly decent careers. And others have vanished almost entirely: Sani Emmanuel of Nigeria, for instance, won in 2009 then made just 16 senior appearances, 10 of them in the Swiss second tier with Biel-Bienne; while another Nigerian, Kelechi Nwakali, winner in 2015, joined Arsenal but, after a series of loan moves and stints in the lower reaches of the Spanish and Portuguese systems, was kicked out of Barnsley this past summer after returning late for pre-season.View image in fullscreenPhil Foden arrives at Heathrow after being part of England’s Under-17 World Cup triumph in 2017.Photograph: Anthony Upton for FA/ShutterstockThe road from prodigy to glory is a rocky one. Foden has been an England regular since 2020, but there was a point earlier this year when it seemed he might not even make the squad for next summer’s World Cup. He asked to be left out of the squad in June as he dealt with personal issues, and then was not selected for the September internationals when England suddenly clicked, hammering Serbia in Belgrade, for the first time under Thomas Tuchel looking as though they might be capable of winning the World Cup. Theomission of Jude Bellinghamdrew the headlines in October but Foden was also missing. He did return in November, coming on in the second half in both games.It says much about the success of the EPPP that England find themselves in a position in which Foden’s place in the team is not guaranteed. A couple of decades ago, any world-class creator would have been regarded like a minor deity without whom success was impossible. No matter how bad their form, how recent a fractured metatarsal, how many games they would miss through suspension, the great creator would be included.It also says a lot about Tuchel and his focus on balance over individuals that he could state that Foden, Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham cannot play together, or at least not in the structure he prefers. It’s not, he said, “because they don’t individually deserve it” but because “we will always do what’s best for balance and we will try to keep the clarity, even if it means that we have to take tough decisions”.The idea that a player “deserves” a call-up because of their club form has been an irritating constant in English football discourse for years, but a cap is not some sort of merit award. As Alf Ramsey said when he picked Jack Charlton for the first time, what is important is not to call up the best players but the right players.Tuchel has been adamant that he will pick specialist wide players for those roles, players who will drive beyond Kane into the space vacated when he drops deep, rather than taking “five No 10s” to the United States. England experienced the logjam that sort of approach can lead to at the last Euros when Gareth Southgate, for the first time as England manager, seemed to be selecting on ability and status rather than utility.Which leaves Foden in a slightly strange position. When he has been used by England it has tended to be in a wide role, but that has rarely got the best out of him. AtManchester City, the inter-movement was sophisticated enough that he could come infield without creating an imbalance. Like Trent Alexander-Arnold, the unusual collection of attributes that made him such an effective player at a club, where systems could be developed to accentuate his strengths and cover for his deficiencies, counted against him an international level. He is sui generis, perfect for City, but not the sort of plug-in-and-play model that is easier to accommodate with a national team.View image in fullscreenPhil Foden started every game for England at Euro 2024.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianFoden, having just been named Premier League player of the season, started every game for England at the Euros in 2024, four times on the left and three times in more central roles as Southgate scrabbled for a workable system. He was not alone in struggling on his return to the club game and last term probably had his poorest season since becoming a City regular.Once he had recovered from an ankle injury, Foden has played much of this season on the right, although with a clear remit to move into the centre. There have been games, such as the last two, against Sunderland and Real Madrid, when he has been part of a central midfield three with Rayan Cherki as the right-sided player.Football Daily | A £3,120 ‘value’ ticket and other bleak news for fans heading to World CupRead moreAt least from an attacking point of view, he has thrived in both positions, scoring five goals in his last three league fixtures, although the fact City conceded two against Leeds and four against Fulham in two of those games suggests perhaps some issue with balance remains. It was notable against Madrid, though, how much more open City looked after Foden went off as part of a triple substitution with 20 minutes to go. His link-up with Erling Haaland is becoming better and better. There’s a sense of him taking on at least some of the responsibilities of Kevin De Bruyne.Not that long ago, that would have been more than enough to guarantee Foden privileged status in the England team. Now he’s not even guaranteed a place in the squad, a remarkable turn of events for the poster boy of England’s great reset. He’s certainly not an Emmanuel, but England’s strength in depth and Tuchel’s single-mindedness mean Foden might not get the chance to be a Kroos.Explore more on these topicsPhil FodenInside footballEnglandManchester CitycommentShareReuse this content"

It was Fulham’s first win at Turf Moor in 30 attempts dating back to April 1951 and extended Burnley’s longest losing run in the league since they experienced eight straight defeats during the 1994-95 season, when they were relegated to the third tier.There is once again a sinking feeling at Turf Moor, where Burnley have not wonsince beating Leeds 2-0in October. Fulham fans, who remember twice being relegated under Parker in his first managerial job, sang “you’re getting sacked in the morning” to the former England midfielder as they celebrated only a second away win of the season in the league; one that moves them seven points clear of the bottom three.Fulham’s opening goal is not one that the Burnley left-back Quilindschy Hartman will want to see again. Wilson’s low, bouncing corner should have been a routine clearance but Hartman inexplicably failed to make contact at the near post and a grateful Smith Rowe prodded in one of the easier goals he might ever score.Ugochukwu, already denied once by Bernd Leno, dragged the hosts level in the 21st minute when he was played in by Josh Cullen before poking home a shot that went in off the post. It was Burnley’s first goal in open play sincethe 3-2 loss to West Hamlast month.View image in fullscreenEmile Smith Rowe points to the sky after opening the scoring from a corner.Photograph: Sean Chandler/SPP/ShutterstockBut Fulham soon regained the lead courtesy of more poor play at the back from a Burnley side whose record-breaking defence in the Championship last season is an increasingly distant memory.The hosts failed to fully clear a corner and Antonee Robinson, making his first league start of the season after a knee injury, easily found Wilson in space on the touchline. Unchallenged, he dinked in a cross for Bassey to nod home his first of the season from point-blank range. Burnley had to rally again but Leno denied Armando Broja and then, as half-time loomed, pushed Ugochukwu’s corner around the post.View image in fullscreenOliver Sonne is congratulated by Josh Cullen after pulling one back for Burnley, but in vain.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersSmith Rowe almost gifted Burnley an equaliser early in the second half with a short back pass, but Jacob Bruun Larsen could not capitalise as Leno smothered the shot.Fulham were suddenly in a mess. After Joachim Andersen scuffed a clearance, Bassey flattened Broja as he stepped in to prevent a shot, with the incident cleared by a VAR check.But, having survived, Fulham snatched a third two minutes short of the hour mark, a swift counterattack ending when Samuel Chukwueze found Wilson in space just inside the box and he picked his spot with a low shot, making it three goals and three assists in his last four games. “In my opinion he’s in the best moment of his career,” Marco Silva, the Fulham manager, said afterwards. “I believe this season is going to be his best in terms of numbers.”With five minutes left, Bassey could not prevent Hartman’s cross from finding Sonne who side-footed in his first Burnley goal, but it was too late for the home side as boos greeted the final whistle.“That makes me sad, obviously,” Parker said of the home fans’ reaction to the defeat. “It was only four months ago that I was standing on the balcony in the town centre and all of us were celebrating and the fans were right with us, and within four months that quickly changes.“I understand their frustration. This is the world we’re in currently. I get it. How the world of football is, the instant reaction is to boo. I don’t think you can question the commitment of this team. This team are foot to the floor and hugely committed and nothing’s changed. The level of hard work, the commitment we put in to be successful last season is exactly the same now. It breaks my heart at the end of the game because we came here today wanting to please our fans and wanting them to support us.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBurnleyFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Hansi Flick’s men now sit on 43 points, comfortably clear of second-placedReal Madrid, who have a game in hand and play atAlavéson Sunday.Despite their control of the game, Barcelona struggled to break down Osasuna’s deep defensive block until the 70th minute when Pedri’s incisive pass cut through the visitors’ defence, finding Raphinha in his stride. The Brazilian forward took a controlled touch before unleashing a thunderous strike from the edge of the area, the ball arrowing inside the left post to finally break the deadlock. Raphinha sealed the win in the 86th minute. A deflected cross from Jules Koundé on the right found the Brazilian unmarked at the far post, and he calmly volleyed the ball into an empty net, giving the scoreline a more comfortable look.Atlético Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann came off the bench to guide them to a 2-1 victory over strugglingValencia, helping snap their losing run in La Liga. Koke opened the scoring in the 17th minute, his first league goal in nearly two years, but Lucas Beltrán provided the equaliser for the visitors in the 63rd minute with a stunning strike from the edge of the box. The goal seemed to unsettle Atlético, but Griezmann restored order 12 minutes later, the 34-year-old expertly controlling a long pass from Marc Pubill before hammering a thunderous half-volley into the top corner from close range.View image in fullscreenAntoine Griezmann nets the winner for Atlético Madrid.Photograph: Florencia Tan Jun/Getty ImagesGriezmann told Dazn: “The team was coming off a tough win at PSV in the Champions League midweek.

I’m going to make the most of every minute I get.”Atlético remain fourth and are one point behind third-place Villarreal, who visit Levante on Sunday. Atlético are nine adrift of Barcelona.In the Bundesliga, theBayer Leverkusensubstitute Martin Terrier staked a claim for goal of the season when he scored with a remarkable mid-air back-heeled volley to help his team to a 2-0 victory overColognein the Rhine derby. The 28-year-old broke the deadlock in the 66th minute, connecting with Arthur’s cross, which was behind his back, to score with a back-heeled scorpion kick.

PSG are on 36 points, two ahead of Lens, who host Nice on Sunday while Metz remain bottom of the standings with 11 points.Meanwhile,Juventus’s owners have rejected a bid for their majority stake in the Serie A club. The Agnelli family’s holding company, Exor, decided not to accept an all-cash offer from crypto firm Tether to buy its entire stake in Italy’s most successful club. “Juve has been part of my family for 102 years,” Exor’s chief executive, John Elkann, said in a video on Juventus’ website on Saturday.“Juve is part of a much, much larger family, theBianconerifamily, made up of millions of fans in Italy and around the world who love Juve the way you love the people closest to you.

Arsenal scored two of them and climbed to second in the table as half-volleys from Katie McCabe and Olivia Smith helped them on their way to a valuable victory.It will have felt all the more satisfying for Arsenal afterChelsea dropped points against Everton last Sunday. They were momentarily given a scare when Honoka Hayashi levelled the scores in a frenetic first-half spell, but that proved to be a rare Everton attack in a contest that was otherwise managed well by Arsenal’s midfield.Everton v Arsenal: Women’s Super League – liveRead moreAfter McCabe’s opener and Hayashi’s equaliser, Alessia Russo quickly restored Arsenal’s lead with a scrappy effort and Everton were fortunate not to be further behind. Arsenal’s display of inventive movement led to some relentless first-half pressure. Although Everton stemmed the tide a little in the second half, a shock result rarely looked on the cards and Smith’s instinctive strike into the far corner made it 3-1 to secure the win.Brian Sørensen, Everton’s manager, accepted the visitors were too strong. “In that first 20 minutes, they were really suffocating us,” he said. “When I see Arsenal at their best, it’s the best team in the league by a mile, in the way that they move together defensively and the way they move the ball.”Further cause for the visitors’ joy came with a late substitute appearance for Leah Williamson. It was the England captain’s first appearance sinceJuly’s European Championship final in Basel, after a knee injury.“I thought she was ready for more game states because of how good she has looked in training,” said Renée Slegers, the Arsenal head coach. “We were comfortable bringing her on. It is still about finding the right moments, because even though she is a very experienced player she’s been away for four months so you want that comeback to be good. But it worked really well.”In Williamson’s absence, Arsenal’s mid-November hada loss at Bayern Munichsandwiched betweendraws with ChelseaandTottenham, which had added some pressure after October’slosses to Manchester CityandOL Lyonnes, but that blip now appears to be behind them.This was their fourth victory in a row in all competitions and they will be confident of extending that run to six before Christmas, with trips to Leuven and the WSL2 club Crystal Palace, in the League Cup quarter-finals, next week.View image in fullscreenKatie McCabe lets fly to open the scoring for Arsenal in the 11th minute.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters“There have been wins with one-goal difference so we have been working hard for the wins, even though we have been dominating a lot,” said Slegers. “Especially [in the] first half, we played really good football. We’re on a good run, in a good place. The last block [of matches] was challenging with really top opposition. But we are right on track with what we want to do.”This win will be remembered for two spectacular Arsenal goals. McCabe’s delightful strike in the 11th minute came as a half-cleared ball reached her outside the Everton area. She lined up a dipping half-volley that flew diagonally into the corner. Smith’s effort, three minutes from time, was equally impressive, struck with a lethal bounce and beating Courtney Brosnan at a similar angle.Earlier, Beth Mead had a far-post header saved, Mariona Caldentey’s low shot was blocked, a Kyra Cooney-Cross strike was deflected inches wide of the post by Hikaru Kitagawa and Russo’s header hit the side-netting, as Everton had to hold on. They stay ninth.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueEverton WomenArsenal WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He’s definitely a force to be reckoned with and is one of the best players in the world.“Moments like this have kept me going all these years.

Slot refused to divulge details of the conversation that led to Salah beingrestored to the squad on Fridaybut insisted that, as far as he was concerned, the matter was resolved. Talks are expected, however, between the Liverpool hierarchy and Salah’s representative while the forward is away on Afcon duty.Was Salah‘s return the beginning of the end at Liverpool or start of an apology? | Will UnwinRead more“For me there’s no issues to resolve,” said theLiverpoolhead coach. “He is the same as any other player. You talk to your players if you are happy or unhappy with things. There is nothing for me to talk about after what happened against Leeds after the game.”Salah played well as Liverpool beat Brighton courtesy of two goals from Hugo Ekitiké, the second arriving from a Salah corner. Asked whether he expected to see the Egyptian in January after his involvement at Afcon, Slot replied: “Yes. He is a Liverpool player and when he is here I like to use him when we need him. Today he didn’t start as he did for a few games before but in the one-and-a-half seasons before that he started almost every game. He had the performance like you would want him to give.“He was close to another assist, he was shocked to see Virgil [van Dijk] next to him in that long sprint at the end, he was close to scoring when Fede [Federico Chiesa] assisted him. He was a threat which is very important.”Slot was pressed on how his conversation with Salah unfolded at Liverpool’s training ground on Friday. He said: “The reason he wasn’t in Milan was his interview and the question after that – and everybody has a different opinion – is should he be [out] once, twice, three times, four times, four months or 12 years? Every manager makes different decisions on that.“He wasn’t involved in the game against Milan, I spoke to him the day before the game. I never speak about what I talk about with players and I am not going to make an exception now but actions speak louder than words and he was in the squad again today. When I had to make my first substitution I brought him in and he performed as every fan wanted him to, including me, would like him to perform.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Salah appeared emotional as he applauded the Liverpool fans after the final whistle. “He wasn’t the only player who walked around the pitch thanking the fans,” said Slot. “Our fans deserved that. Our players worked incredibly hard to keep a clean sheet and for the first time in months we had a bit of luck with that as well. We have had games where we have not conceded a chance but conceded three goals. Today we conceded chances but they didn’t go in.“Mo is going to go to the Afcon now, I hope he is going to do very well and in the meantime we have to do without him without that many players available but the good thing is we play Saturday and again Saturday.”Slot was again asked to clarify whether he wanted Salah to remain at Liverpool. “I think you already know the answer to that,” he replied. “What has been said between us stays between us. He was in the squad and my first substitution today. I never speak about what we say when I speak to Virgil or Mo or any other player.”Explore more on these topicsArne SlotMohamed SalahLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Now that South Africa has been incorporated into theChampions Cup, these long trips are part and parcel. It meant Saracens changing 10 of their starting lineup. It meant Sharks changing 14 – and a head coach to boot.JP Pietersen, the former Springbok, stepped up to fill his new role this week when John Plumtree resigned after the Sharks’ heavy defeat in Toulouse on Sunday. One match, one win, his record now reads. ForSharksthis was only a second win of the season. They were just about worth it, but still they must despair at finding any rhythm among a squad packed with Springboks.Parling frustrated as Leicester blow half-time lead against Leinster to lose againRead moreFour tries againstSaracensis not to be sniffed at, even if the visitors travelled short of a few stars themselves, but only a stolen lineout at the death denied the visitors a fourth try of their own and the win. Andy Onyeama-Christie could not quite gather James Hadfield’s throw-in at a five-metre lineout, the clock in the red. In the slippery chaos that followed, Ethan Hooker belted the ball into the stand in relief.Those high, steepling banks of seats (mostly empty) at Kings Park rattled throughout, as the wind whipped in from the Indian Ocean. Handling was a skill at a premium. As was kicking. Charlie Bracken and Fergus Burke harnessed the conditions well to bombard the Sharks’ back three, against whom Angus Hall wreaked havoc in pursuit.But the Sharks forwards had the edge in the tight. In the first few minutes, in particular, their scrum was destructive. In only the fourth, their lineout was pretty unanswerable too, Bongi Mbonambi finishing one devastating drive after a penalty to the corner.Quick GuideChampions Cup roundup: Glasgow stun Toulouse with comeback winShowGlasgowproduced one of the greatest wins in their history by recovering from a 21-point deficit to topple the Champions Cup heavyweightsToulouse28-21 at Scotstoun. Toulouse, six-time European champions, celebrated Antoine Dupont's first start since sustaining a serious knee injury in March by running in three tries, with the France captain crossing once and Kalvin Gourgues adding two more.Dupont was pulling the stings brilliantly, but the game was turned on its head in the 58th minute when the full-back Josh McKay galloped over to ignite a stunning comeback. Gregor Brown and Sione Tuipulotu crashed over from close range before the hooker Gregor Hiddleston propelled Glasgow in front for the first time when he was at the end of a lineout drive in the 70th minute (pictured). Adam Hastings, the man of the match, nailed all four conversions on a momentous night for the indomitable Warriors.Salefinished strongly to give their campaign liftoff with a 35-14 victory overClermontat the Stade Marcel-Michelin. Responding to their home defeat by Glasgow on the opening night of the competition, the Sharks built a 20-7 half-time lead through tries by Tom O’Flaherty, Marius Louw and Arron Reed. They were then forced to weather a Clermont storm when Lucas Zamoa crossed in the 47th minute and at 23-14 down the fallen European heavyweights were pressing hard to add another score.However, a spirited Sale showed their hunger by scrambling a try through Joe Bedlow and when Alex Wills went over in the 73rd minute it was all over.Craig Casey starred asMunsterswept aside an inexperiencedGloucesterside 31-3 after bursting into life in the second half in Cork. An ugly first half that was full of errors ended with the hosts holding a 7-3 lead after Dan Kelly had crossed in the 21st minute. But with scrum-half Casey acting as the catalyst, they found their rhythm to conjure further tries for Mike Haley, Ruadhan Quinn, Tom Farrell and Tadhg Beirne. Munster finished with a bang and benefited from yellow cards shown to Gloucester’s Jamal Ford-Robinson and Caio James in each half.Bordeaux, the holders, overpoweredScarlets50-21 as they scored five first-half tries at the Stade Chaban-Delmas. The Welsh side had taken an early lead from Fletcher Anderson’s try before Bordeaux hit back through Matthieu Jalibert. Bordeaux then took control with tries from Jefferson Poirot, Gaetan Barlot and a second for Jalibert on the counterattack to secure a bonus point. Although Henry Thomas barged over for Scarlets after 29 minutes, Bordeaux extended their lead to 31-14 when South Africa’s Tiaan Jacobs touched down. In the second half Pablo Uberti touched down in the corner for a sixth try just ahead of the hour. Anderson then scored his second try before Xan Mousques powered over and Louis Bielle-Biarrey touched down too.PA MediaPhotograph: Stuart Wallace/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Saracens rode the early storm. Theo Dan replied in kind 10 minutes later to open their account and Sam Spink claimed a second. Eliot Daly played a wicked chip behind, which Aphele Fassi, making his first start since he injured his ankle inthe Springboks’ famous victory in Wellingtonin September, completely missed. Spink fell gratefully on the loose ball.Suddenly Saracens reversed their fortunes at the scrum. With a penalty at that set piece, Burke put them more than a score ahead with 10 minutes until the break. That ought to have been enough, but Sharks scored twice in the last three minutes of the half.The seesaw contest at the scrum continued. The Sharks won another penalty at the next, sending it to the corner. Andre Esthuizen, captain on his 100th appearance, carried hard off the lineout and George Whitehead found Fassi in plenty of space.Still Saracens held the lead and had seemingly lasted to the break, but Onyeama-Christie tackled Grant Williams late, allowing the Sharks one last tilt. A brilliant pass from Williams was taken by Hooker, who engineered a brilliant pass of his own to send Edwill van der Merwe to the line. The Sharks went in 21-15 ahead.Quick GuideSharks v Saracens teamsShowSharks:Fassi (Jordan Hendrikse 50), van der Merwe, Hooker, Esterhuizen, Mapimpi, Whitehead, G.

Another accidental collision involving the head meant a yellow card for Dan, who caught Makazole Mapimpi high as Theo McFarland tackled the latter. Sharks scored from the next play, Williams sent to the post by Hooker, who had split the Saracens defence.That opened up a 10-point lead, but the visitors would not go away. They sent a series of penalties to the corner and finally forced their way over, the tireless Tom Willis finishing the lineout and drive. Bonus point secured, but Saracens could not repeat the feat in the dying seconds.The result keeps Pool 1 tight. Saracens host Toulouse in the next round, in January, while the Sharks make an even longer journey to Manchester to take on their namesakes from Sale, who won with a bonus point in Clermont Auvergne and sit level on six points with Saracens. Every point is likely to prove valuable. Saracens will settle for theirs in Durban.Explore more on these topicsChampions CupSharksSaracensRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The network of anonymous channels includes alarmist rhetoric, AI scripts and British narrators to attract hits.Starmer is personally targeted. The prime minister was either named in the video title or description 15,600 times.Reset Tech, the non-profit group that produced the research, said the channels were part of a global trend to produce synthetic propaganda on the platform. It pointed to the proliferation of cheap AI tools that could be deployed to make a quick profit from divisive topics.One channel called Britain News-night talked about Starmer and Reeves facing arrest. Another, TheUKPoliticalBrief, touted videos on the “explosive truth” about immigrant crime and marches on Westminster.The UK NewsCore channel focused on how Nigel Farage was ousting Starmer, and claimed the prime minister was “sacked live” and thrown out of parliament.Other videos featured bizarre, fabricated stories about a row between the royal family and the government. One channel, Gold Up!, said the dispute had left Starmer “melting down on live TV”.Some of the videos and channels were removed by YouTube’s checks. However, all 150 were taken down when the platform was approached by the Guardian. Reset Tech said some channels had created tens or hundreds of similar videos without being deplatformed.The research found similar channels operating in German, French, Spanish and Polish, targeting other politicians or political issues. In total, it mapped 420 problematic channels operating in Europe. Reset Tech said Russian-speaking creators operate some of the channels.It is believed channels aimed at the UK were being driven by opportunistic creators trying to monetise political division over issues like immigration, rather than overseas political actors. However, it said their presence still posed a risk to public trust.The content has caused concern insideLabour. “The rise of fake news online is a serious threat to our democracy,” a spokesperson said. “The public will be rightly alarmed that democratically elected leaders and institutions are being undermined by bad faith foreign state actors and those seeking to profit from misinformation.“We’ve already seen attempts from overseas to influence fair elections and manipulate public opinion both here and abroad.“The government is stepping up its efforts to work with online platforms to tackle this scourge on free and fair democracy. But it’s important that tech bosses take this threat seriously and live up to their obligations to remove this type of content wherever it’s found.”Dylan Sparks, UK director of Reset Tech, called for YouTube to take swifter action. “Malicious actors are permitted by YouTube to spread synthetic ‘news’ that disrupts political debate in the UK, while also earning revenue from it,” he said. “This AI-generated, low cost content spreads across the platform undetected, revealing clear weaknesses in YouTube’s monetisation and content moderation systems.“This specific network focuses on the prime minister and Labour government, but the same loopholes could be exploited by any hostile actor to push an agenda. Because social media platforms profit from engagement, their business model creates an in-built tension between enforcing their own policies and reducing the spread of malicious content that drives revenue.“The rapid spread of AI has also introduced new risks to the online environment, and platforms need to move faster and invest more to address them.”A YouTube spokesperson said: “Spam and deceptive practices that try to take advantage of the YouTube community are not allowed on the platform, which is why the channels flagged by the Guardian have all been removed.“We enforce our policies consistently, regardless of political viewpoint expressed, or how the content is generated. Our teams work around the clock to monitor for harmful content, taking swift action as needed.”YouTube is now working with Reset Tech over its findings. The platform said its systems prominently feature authoritative news content on the YouTube homepage, in search results, and through recommendations. It has removed more than 2.1m channels for violating its community guidelines.Ministers have already formed an online advertising taskforce to see what action can be taken to address the advertising-based monetisation of harmful and misleading content.Explore more on these topicsYouTubeArtificial intelligence (AI)LabourKeir StarmerDeepfakeShareReuse this content"

Just hours after the order went public Thursday evening, the California governor issued a statement saying the presidential dictum, which seeks to block states from regulating AI of their own accord, advances “grift and corruption” instead of innovation.“President Trump and David Sacks aren’t making policy – they’re running a con,” Newsom said, referencingTrump’s AI adviser and crypto “czar”. “Every day, they push the limits to see how far they can take it.”Trump’s executive order is a major victory for tech companies that havecampaigned against legislative barriersto developing and deploying their AI products. It also sets up a clash between state governments and the White House over the future of AI regulation. The immediate backlash from groups including child safety organizations, unions and state officials has highlighted the deeply contentious nature of the order and diverse range of interests it affects.Several officials and organizations have already questioned the legality of the executive order, stating that Trump does not have the power to undermine state legislation on AI and denouncing the decree as the result of tech industry lobbying.California, home to some of the world’s most prominent AI companies and one of the most active states legislating AI, has been a locus for pushback against the order.Trump signs executive order aimed at preventing states from regulating AIRead more“This executive order is deeply misguided, wildly corrupt, and will actually hinder innovation and weaken public trust in the long run,” California Democratic representative Sara Jacobs said in a statement. “We will explore all avenues – from the courts to Congress – to reverse this decision.”After a draft version of Trump’s order leaked in November, state attorney general Rob Bontasaidthat his office would “take steps to examine the legality or potential illegality of such an executive order”, teeing up a precedent-setting duel between California and the White House.Legislative loggerheadsIn September, Newsomsigned a landmark AI lawthat would compel developers of large, powerful AI models known as “frontier models” to provide transparency reports and promptly report safety incidents or face fines up to $1m. The governor touted the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence act as an example for how to regulate AI companies nationwide.“Our state’s status as a global leader in technology allows us a unique opportunity to provide a blueprint for well-balanced AI policies beyond our borders,” Newsom said in an address to the California state senate. “Especially in the absence of a comprehensive federal AI policy framework and national AI safety standards.”The September bill and more California legislation could be in Trump’s crosshairs. Thursday’s executive order calls for an AI litigation taskforce that would review state laws that do not “enhance the United States’ global AI dominance” and then pursue legal action or potentially withhold federal broadband funding. The taskforce will also consult with the administration’s AI and crypto “czar” to determine which laws to target.Although Trump has framed the executive order as a means of streamlining legislation and removing onerously patchwork regulation, critics have alleged that the government has never provided any comprehensive federal framework for regulating AI to replace state laws. The order follows attempts to include similar AI moratoriumsin bills earlier this year, which failed due to bipartisan backlash. Instead, opponents view the order as a gift to major tech companies that have cozied up to the administration over the course of the year.“President Trump’s unlawful executive order is nothing more than a brazen effort to upend AI safety and give tech billionaires unchecked power over working people’s jobs, rights and freedoms,” AFL-CIO president, Liz Shuler, said in a statement.Nationwide backlashWithin hours of Trump signing the order, opposition loudened among lawmakers, labor leaders, children’s advocacy groups and civil liberties organizations that decried the policy. Other California Democratic leaders said the executive order was an assault on state rights and the administration should instead focus on federal agencies and academic research to boost innovation.“No place in America knows the promise of artificial intelligence technologies better than California,” said Alex Padilla, a senator for California. “But with today’s executive order, theTrump administrationis attacking state leadership and basic safeguards in one fell swoop.”Similarly, Adam Schiff, another California senator, emphasized: “Trump is seeking to preempt state laws that are establishing meaningful safeguards around AI and replace them with … nothing.”Lawmakers from Colorado to Virginia to New York also took issue with the order. Don Beyer, a Virginia congressmember called it a “terrible idea” and said that it would “create a lawless Wild West environment for AI companies”. Likewise, Alex Bores, a New York state assemblymember, called the order a “massive windfall” for AI companies, adding that “a handful of AI oligarchs bribedDonald Trumpinto selling out America’s future”.Lies, damned lies and AI: the newest way to influence elections may be here to stayRead moreEven Steve Bannon, Trump loyalist and former adviser, criticized the policy. In atext message to Axios, Bannon said Sacks had “completely misled the President on preemption”. Mike Kubzansky, the CEO of Omidyar Network, a philanthropic tech investment firm that funds AI companies, similarly said “the solution is not to preempt state and local laws” and that ignoring AI’s impact on the country “through a blanket moratorium is an abdication of what elected officials owe their constituents”.Blowback against the order has also included child protection organizations that have long expressed concerns over the effects of AI on children. The debate over child safety has intensified this year in the wake of multiple lawsuits against AI companies overchildren who died by suicideafter interacting with popular chatbots.“The AI industry’s relentless race for engagement already has a body count, and, in issuing this order, the administration has made clear it is content to let it grow,” said James Steyer, the CEO of child advocacy group Common Sense Media. “Americans deserve better than tech industry handouts at the expense of their wellbeing.”A group of bereaved parents and child advocacy organizations have also spoken out. They have been working to pass legislation to better protect children from harmful social media and AI chatbots andreleased a national public service announcementon Thursday opposing the AI preemption policy. Separately, Sarah Gardner, the CEO of Heat Initiative, one of the groups in the coalition, called the order “unacceptable”.“Parents will not roll over and allow our children to remain lab rats in big tech’s deadly AI experiment that puts profits over the safety of our kids,” Gardner said. “We need strong protections at the federal and state level, not amnesty for big tech billionaires.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyCaliforniaWest CoastArtificial intelligence (AI)Donald TrumpTrump administrationGavin NewsomnewsShareReuse this content"

Is it really his best child-rearing hack?Sat 13 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 09.01 ESTShareFather’s little helperJust how does he do it all? Every time I look at the news, Sam Altman’s face seems to be staring back at me. The CEO of OpenAI,a well-known workaholic, is constantly in the public eye explaining how AI will probablycure cancerand transform thesocial contractand generally change the world. While doing all that he’s reportedly gearing up for OpenAI to file for a stock market listingvaluingthe company at $1tn, as soon as next year. And he’s also a new dad: Altman and his husband, Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their first child into the world in February. So he’s got a lot on his plate.The billionaire does have a little bit of help though, and he’s not afraid to admit it. On Monday Altman made hislate-night debuton Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show, where he waxed lyrical about how helpful ChatGPT has been in helping him raise his son.“I cannot imagine having gone through figuring out how to raise a newborn withoutChatGPT,” Altman gushed to Fallon. Perhaps a little self-awareness crept in at that moment because he added: “Clearly, people did it for a long time – no problem ... but I have relied on it so much.”How exactly does Altman use ChatGPT to help him figure out “how to raise a newborn?” Well, he told Fallon, once heaskedthe large language model: “Why does my kid stop dropping his pizza on the floor and laughing? [sic]” Altman didn’t explain what ChatGPT answered, but I imagine it was along the lines of: because he is a kid and that’s what kids do.Another moment when ChatGPT helped Altman along his parenting journey, we learned, was when he felt a little insecure after another parent boasted about their six-month-old crawling. Altman told Fallon that he then ran to the bathroom and asked AI if it was “okay” that his son wasn’t crawling yet; ChatGPT offered some soothing words of wisdom.Fallon is not a journalist. His job isn’t to ask tough questions, it’s to cackle every few minutes and slap his hands on his desk. Still, it would have been nice if the late night host had spent just a couple of minutes asking one of the most powerful men in the world a few tough questions instead of just lettingAltman do PRfor himself and OpenAI.He could have asked Altman, for example, about his appearance on theOpenAI podcastearlier this year, when the CEO noted that people have a “very high degree of trust in ChatGPT, which is interesting because, like, AI hallucinates. It should be the tech that you don’t trust that much”.And if Fallon didn’t want to go deep into the thorny issues of AI hallucinations andAI psychosis, he could have at least investigated Altman’s child-rearing arrangements a little more. Fallon could have asked Altman, for example, if his husband did all the caregiving, or if he happened to have a nanny.Altman and his husband have never made any public comments about having a nanny, to be clear. And they are, of course, entitled to keep their private life private. However, considering the fact that Altman hasgushedabout how “kid-pilled” he is and how “everybody should have a lot of kids”, I think it might be helpful for him to also point out the ways in which his particular experience of child-rearing might be different to that of the hoi polloi.Altman and his husband had their child via surrogate, for example. It’s easy to be gung ho about how everyone should be having lots of kids when you don’t have to do any of the carrying and delivering. It’s easy to be breezy about pumping out children when you’re not the one taking on any of the risks that pregnancy and childbirth involve. And while pregnancy alwayscomes with risks, research has found surrogates have a greater chance of bothphysicalandmental complicationsthan women who carry their own offspring.While Altman may not be able to imagine figuring out how to raise a newborn without ChatGPT, I’m fairly confident he would be able to find a way to manage. What I have a harder time imagining, however, is a world in which high-powered executives (including female executives) would be able to do their jobs and have children without a lot of hired domestic help. There’s nothing wrong with hiring help, of course. What’s problematic is pretending that all this labour – which tends to beunderpaid, underappreciated, and disproportionately performed by women – doesn’t exist.Gaza newborn mortality rates up 75% compare with pre-war levelsThat’saccording to figures releasedon Wednesday by Unicef, which looked at the number of babies dying on the day they were born in Gaza during the three months before the “ceasefire”. Meanwhile, Israel is still restricting essential items from entering Gaza and there have been reports that at least one child has died because of theextreme coldin the last few days.Gwen Stefani receives backlash for promoting ‘anti-abortion’ prayer appThe pop star recently shared a collaborative post on social media for Hallow, a Catholic prayer subscription service which has receivedfundingand support from the likes ofJD Vanceand Peter Thiel. This hasn’t gone down well. The influencer Matt Bernstein, for example, called out Stefani in a videowhich notedthat there are numerous anti-abortion prayers on the app, including one that asked to bless women “pregnant from acts of rape and incest” who are considering abortion.Democrats publish more photos from Jeffrey Epstein estateThe latestphoto dumpincludes new pictures of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.Eleven women jailed in Texas allege rampant sexual abuseThe Guardianspoke with six of the womenalleging abuse at FMC Carswell in Texas, who said sexual assault is common and ignored by staff. “Coming into the system, whether you’re guilty or not, it’s like you’re punished over and over again,” said one incarcerated woman. “It’s like human trafficking behind prison walls.”Bestselling author Sophie Kinsella dies of a brain tumour age 55Kinsella’s “deceptively light” books cheered up millions of people.

Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few? … From Denmark. Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people. But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”Referring to the US representative Ilhan Omar’s hijab as a “little turban”, Trump continued: “She should get the hell out. Throw her the hell out.” His supporters erupted in chants of: “Send her back.”The rant is abhorrent and factually incorrect, but it does hold one truth – the Trump administration’s vision for the United States is one of a white Christian nation. And the path to accomplish it is through the exclusion and removal of all who do not fit that vision – in other words, throughethnic cleansing.To that end, Trump and his acolytes haveincreasinglybeen using the term “reverse migration” and even proposed an “office of remigration”. The idea, borrowed from white supremacists in Europe, understands immigrants as an inherent threat to the identity of what they imagine to be “white” nations. Immigrants’ forcible and systematic removal – remigration – is envisioned as a way to “restore” that whiteness.This vision of an ethnically cleansed, white US is being enacted in policy.Contrary to Trump’s ranting, the United Statesdidin fact restrictadmission to only include white, European immigrants by law through much of the past century. Racial quotas were only abolished through Black activism and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s.Whether immigrants are welcome or not has always been an issue of racial inclusion in this settler colonial state – it is the mechanism by which we decide who belongs in this nation.Today, the Trump administration is closing immigration pathways by which people enter the US, and gain status when here. Asylumis dead. Resettlement is cancelled except, tellingly, forwhite Afrikaners. Temporary protective status, which protects people from deportation due to turbulence in their nations of origin, has been or will be cancelled for Haitians, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Syrians and others, leavinghundreds of thousandsof people deportable to countries the US recognizes as unsafe. Fees for all immigration processes havesharply increased.Meanwhile, the Trump administration is exploring how to block pathways to citizenship for people who qualify. Citizenship ceremonies are beingcancelledas people are being pulled out of line while waiting to take their oaths. Mohsen Mahdawi was detained on 14 April at hiscitizenship appointmentfor his participation in a civil pro-Palestinian protest at his university.Trump issued an executive order tocancel birthright citizenship– the mechanism by which formerly enslaved Black Americans became citizens – that has made its way to thesupreme court. And he has said he would “absolutely”denaturalizeAmerican citizens if he could.While this commentary seems bombastic, it isnot without precedentin United States history, where in the first half of the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of people weredenaturalizeddue to politicized accusations of fraud, lacking “good moral character” or having “racial ineligibility” (ie not being white).These current policies sit against the backdrop of the grotesque expansion of the mass deportation system. In September, two months after the so-called Big Beautiful Bill was passed – adding $75bn to ICE’s budget, giving it a bigger budget than all butseven of the world’s militaries, and making it thehighest-fundedlaw enforcement agency in the federal government – the supreme court authorized ICE officers toracially profilepeople.This makes every person of color, regardless of status, a potential target. And, in a nation that remainssegregated by race, where people of color often live apart from white people, ICE is terrorizing communities of color.US citizens have also been caught up in ICE raids: members of theNavajo and Mescaleronations; a Black man in Chicago with hisbirth certificate in his backpack; a20-year-old in Minnesotaof Somali origin who kept trying to show ICE officers his passport, only to be forced by officers to undergo a facial scan to prove his citizenship. The investment of millions of dollars in cybersurveillance technology – which can hack phones in a certain radius and uses AI to recognize faces and places – presents a violation of privacy for every single person in this country regardless of race or status.Meanwhile, the rhetoric that once justified deportations has been revealed as a lie. Data shows that the vast majority of immigrants detained haveno criminal record. Concerns of the fiscal burden that immigrants pose (never actuallyborne out in data) are shown for their absurdity when Trump says there is “no price tag” on his mass deportation agenda. Somalisadded $8bnto Minnesota’s economy, though their contributions should have no bearing on their humanity.There seems to be joy in the cruelty, when Trump trolls “I love the smell of deportations in the morning” as we watch men and women dragged from the arms of their children, sobbing. Many of them are sent to privatized detention centers rife withhuman rights violationsthat turn a profit on human lives –incentivizedto limit healthcare, food and comfort to detainees to maximize shareholder profit.But it is not just through the physical brutalization that this ethnic cleansing is being executed. There is also violence in systematic disinvestment that disproportionately cuts essential lifelines for Black and brown people. The Big Beautiful Bill rolls back social spending, denying millions of peoplehealthcare coverage, food benefits and welfare benefits. It enacts policies that exacerbate burdens of student debt. It raises the budgets of police and carceral facilities.The idea that those who cannot be removed should be subjugated is alive in our academic institutions, through attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion, on students’ right to dissent, on affirmative action.The strength of this imperfect nation, which has never repaired for its original sins of genocide and enslavement, is in the incredible diversity of people who make it great, in the freedoms it claims to uphold – of life, liberty and justice. This ethnic cleansing can only be accomplished through the destruction of all of the above, in ways that touch the lives of each and every person within the nation, American or not.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionTrump administrationUS constitution and civil libertiesDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The state-employed memelord posted a video depicting Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials arresting people in what appeared to be Chicago, celebrating the humiliation and incarceration of undocumented immigrants as some sort of patriotic achievement. The vile video borrowed, as they often do, from mainstream pop culture; in this case, a viral lyric from Sabrina Carpenter’s song Juno – “Have you ever tried this one?”, referring to sex positions – overlaid on clips of agents chasing, tackling and handcuffing people, cheekily nodding to all the methods in ICE’s terror toolbox.Carpenter, as a pre-eminent pop star, was caught in an impossible position. Say nothing, as her friend and collaborator Taylor Swift did weeks earlier when the White House used her music in a Trump hype video, and riskappearing as if you condonethe administration’s use of your art for a domestic terror campaign (the administration hasn’t yet used Swift for an ICE video, but I’m sure it’s coming); or engage, even if to honestly express your utter disgust, and risk bringing more attention to objectionable propaganda designed to provoke a response.Sabrina Carpenter condemns ‘evil and disgusting’ ICE video that uses her songRead moreCarpenter chose the latter – “this video is evil and disgusting,” the singerrepliedto the video on X. “Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda” – which, as sincere as I believe that sentiment is, and as refreshing as it is to see a celebrity bluntly call out fascism, played right into the administration’s hands. News articles, including onewritten by me, brought more viewers to the original video, more attention to the ICE propaganda efforts, more fuel to their fire. Right on cue, the White House followed up with an official statement disparaging Carpenter’s response and continuing to peddle their lies about ICE deportations while still referencing her witty, popular lyrics: “Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?” (Presumably you already know this, but themajority of peoplearrested by ICE have never been charged with a crime.)View image in fullscreenSZA.Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/APThis pop music rage-bait cycle has been happening a lot lately, at increasingly dizzying speeds. Under the reality-TV president, the job of an administration social media manager seems to be posting poisonous agitprop, and the employed memelords have been busy churning out videos soundtracked to internet-popular music, much to the chagrin of many artists. Just in the past few months, artists such asOlivia Rodrigo, Jess Glynne, Kenny Loggins, MGMT and Carpenter have vocally objected to the administration’s use of their music. It’s an easily identified, absolutely deadening pattern, best summed up by SZA, whose music was also used, on X: “White House rage baiting artists for free promo is PEAK DARK ..inhumanity +shock and aw tactics ..Evil n Boring.”Evil, boring and obvious, though it’s still worth pointing out what exactly is going on here. This is the shitposter’s administration, built by and for influencers, governed by the posting logic of lowest-common-denominator engagement – a former gameshow host and self-styled heckler comedian as president, a former Fox News morning show host as secretary of defense, podcasters for head of the FBI and deputy attorney general. The administration isn’t even pretending otherwise; in response to Variety’s request for comment over the Swift-soundtracked TikTok video, a White House officialreplied: “We made this video because we knew fake news media brands likeVariety would breathlessly amplify them. Congrats, you got played.”How do musicians handle this? It’s a no-win situation, though I don’t think it’s futile for younger artists, particularly those with very online fanbases like Carpenter, to speak directly to the fear, racism, xenophobia and general delight of violence the administration seeks to normalize. I’d love to see more follow the lead of singers like Zach Bryan, whose anti-ICE lyricsprovokedthe White House, rather than being stuck in a loop of reactive engagement. Perhaps the answer isn’t full disengagement or disassociation but rather a clear-eyed assessment of what this is: a game to them, one that they will keep trying to play with whatever artist of the moment they can find. As Kaelan Dorr, a member of the White House communications team, said in response to outrage over a horrifically offensive, demeaning AI Ghibli-fied photo of an ICE detention: “The arrests will continue. The memes will continue.” Our disgust will, too, but our attention does not have to.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationSabrina CarpenterICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationSZADonald TrumpOlivia RodrigocommentShareReuse this content"

But voters still said no to Bonds and ClemensHoward BryantWith Trump championing Pete Rose and pressuring MLB’s commissioner, the Hall of Fame vote became a referendum on power, memory and whether integrity still mattersSat 13 Dec 2025 04.30 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 16.26 ESTShareSince mid-May, when Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred announced Pete Rosewould be eligible for Hall of Fame considerationandexplained his specious reasonings behind it, last week’s Hall of Fame vote by the 16-member Classic Era committee carried with it a certain air of inevitability for Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds, the two greatest players currently not enshrined in Cooperstown.Rose was championed by Donald Trump, who used his populism to demand the Hit King finally be allowed into the Hall, an honor denied Rose since 1989 when baseball placed him on the permanently ineligible list for betting on games when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. After Rosedied in September 2024, Trump then won the presidency five weeks later and immediately increased the pressure on Manfred to end Rose’s 36-year banishment – despite the absence of any evidence suggesting Rose was any less guilty in death of gambling on the sport than he had been alive. Nevertheless, Manfred acquiesced to Trump, and in 2027, for the first time, Pete Rose will be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame.Pete Rose returns to the Hall conversation as baseball embraces his original sinRead moreThat specter of that capitulation, the brutish application of power has defined both the current political and cultural moment. Integrity has been as much under assault as democracy – it’s a word for wimps and hand-wringers. Accountability is for suckers – the ones too weak to get their own way, not man enough to take what they want. People feel numb, and with numbness comes surrender. Relentlessly battered by wanton presidential pardons, indifference to the deconstruction of stabilizing norms, all amid rampant oligarchal pillage – and it becomes seductive to embrace the warm cocoon of nihilism. Nobody cares. The President of the United States is after all, not anecdotally but legally, a convicted felon, but not only has this fact not been disqualifying, it is barely mentioned.Whether its betting or NIL, the latest college scandal or labor, sports has been enveloped in its own waves of destabilization and numbness, fatigue and cynicism, and in the weeks leading up to the vote, Bonds and Clemens were expected to benefit from these sentiments. Beyond Trump’s America, the height of the PED scandal occurred nearly a quarter century ago, and the reflex that enough time has passed, each has paid a cost, and its time to close the chapter on the Steroid Era is a powerful and common one. Both Clemens and Bonds retired in 2007. Both fell off of theBaseballWriters Association of America’s writer’s ballot after a 10-year odyssey of discomfort. (Needing 75% of the votes for induction Bonds topped out at 66%, Clemens as 65.2%.) Both have been denied for nearly a decade and a half, and the sudden creation of a pathway for Rose seemed to provide sunlight for the simultaneously disgraced and legendary players of the Steroid Era – Alex Rodriguez, Gary Sheffield, and possibly Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, too – to one day receive a reappraisal.They did not. Neither was inducted. Both were rebuked, receiving less than the five votes required to be reconsidered in two years. Incidentally the one player elected, Jeff Kent, was a teammate of both Bonds (San Francisco, 1997-2002), and Clemens, (Houston, 2004). Many of the voters were former players, and the while they did not and have never doubted the greatness of Bonds, Clemens or the numbers they produced, they did, however, decide not to succumb to the creeping nihilism of today. It has its limits.Ironically, the price of upholding the game’s integrity has been a week’s worth of ridicule. Kent has not been warmly embraced as the newest member of the immortal club, but proof that without Bonds and Clemens, the Hall of Fame is now a lesser place, less relevant, less legitimate place as long as Bonds and Clemens remain uninvited. He hit more home runs than any second baseman in history but must spend the next seven and a half months until the July induction ceremonies creating a protective scaffolding around his enshrinement, for the moment his guard drops, the conversation will shift away from him and back to Clemens, back to Bonds.View image in fullscreenPete Rose’s controversial candidacy for the Hall of Fame was championed by Donald Trump, who used his populism to demand the Hit King finally be allowed in.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesNone of which is to suggest that the people who run baseball heroically protected the sport’s interest during a cynical time – that distinction belonged to the collection of 16 former players, executive and media, who have not forgiven the era – especially the former players, who may be accused of settling old scores, but also were brought up in the game with a hardline attitude toward gambling – its prohibition is the first sign on every clubhouse door – and steroids. Ex-players, especially at Hall of Fame level from the pre-1994 strike years, have been threatening to boycott induction ceremonies of known steroid users for two decades, and counting.Manfred, meanwhile, is perfectly willing to embrace the times. In reversing the game’s prohibition on Rose, the commissioner reasoned that posthumously, Rose no longer posed any threat to the integrity of the sport. Under the same reasoning, Manfred also returned the Joe Jackson ofthe infamous 1919 Chicago White Soxto the ballot, one of the game’s original casualties of betting on baseball. As part of the Black Sox, Jackson has been banned since 1920, and dead since 1951 – clearly posing no threat to the integrity of the game. Manfred has been commissioner for the past decade, but it was only when Trump pressured him on Rose did Manfred apply the same logic to Shoeless Joe.Black players are disappearing from the sport. There was a higher percentage of African Americans in baseball in 1965 than there was in 2025, yet in currying favor to Trump and his attack on so-called “DEI”, the commissioner eliminated programs designed to improve those numbers it once said it was committed to – and profits from every 15 April, when it celebrates Jackie Robinson even as Black players are actively erased from the sport.And there is no greater example of cynicism and greed in baseball than its top-rope leap headfirst into gambling – just like the other sports. The consequences are already emerging. The game’s greatest player,Shohei Ohtani, was involved in (and ultimately found to be the victim of) a gambling scandal, and one of the game’s best closers Cleveland’s Emmanuel Clase, is currently under investigation and may never pitch in the major leagues again.Their baseball community peers choosing not to elect Bonds and Clemens is not a victory – if keeping them out is necessary, it is done so uncomfortably for no positive can be taken from the greatest pitcher and greatest hitter of their times never having their moment at the podium. Everyone has lost, and continues to do so – just as they have with Rose and do with Alex Rodriguez and his 3,115 hits and 696 home runs on the outside of enshrinement. The victory lies not in their banishment but – despite the eyerolls – in the brief rejection of cynicism, the rejection of the idea that history does not matter, that rules and standards do not matter, accountability is a nuisance, that nothing matters. The notion itself has always been something of an ahistorical misdirection designed to opiate dissidence, because neither Bonds nor Clemens, nor inclusion to Cooperstown has ever produced indifference. It’salwaysmattered.

The under-16s ban does nothing to achieve thatFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastSat 13 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 19.49 ESTShareSoon after the 2022 election a woman came into my electorate office to tell me about her teenage daughter.She spoke about her family’s journey through anorexia, the lack of effective and available medical support and treatment, about her child being held down by security guards for forced refeeding in hospital, the compounding mental health issues for the whole family, the financial and marital pressure as she tried to keep her child alive.It soon became very clear that hers wasn’t the only story.One of the most deadlymental illnesses, eating disorders among those aged 10 to 19have risen by 86% since 2012, roughly coinciding with the rise of social media and, in the latter period, Covid.In 2020, for example, the number of admissions to the ED unit at Monash Children’s hospital in Melbourne were more than double mean annual admissions in 2016-2019.The age of onset is also falling; some of the families that I have worked with have been managing anorexia in children as young as 11.‘Already had a profound effect’: parents react to Australia’s social media banRead moreDuring the last parliament I commissioned research and brought together experts, peak and advocacy groups, parents and those with lived experience of eating disorders. Among them was Katya, then 15, who told her own story directly to executives from Meta.“If there was a way I could just turn off seeing eating-disorder-related content, I would feel much safer going on social media,” she said at a roundtable I hosted at Parliament House.I met Katya after her friend Olivia had taken her own life due to anorexia. Katya wrote to me, saying: “The fact that the system is so bad that it caused a once-young passionate girl full of life to commit suicide is so sickening. I can’t even express my words for how disgusted I am.”I put Katya’s words to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in question time and he and the then opposition leader Peter Dutton agreed to release funding from the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) for eating disorders.Meanwhile I ran roundtables and working groups, which came up with a series of recommendations that I presented to government.The social media ban for children under 16 is, in part, the result of this work.According to Butterfly Foundation surveys, almost two thirds of respondents say social media makes them feel worse about their body.And like delivering gambling ads to gamblers, the algorithms feed those with a propensity for eating disorders. On TikTok, University of Melbourneresearch showsthat people with eating disorders are almost 400% more likely to receive diet content and almost 4,000% more likely to receive eating disorder content.And those with eating disorders are adept at getting around fragile safety nets, using coded hashtags to subvert AI moderation systems.It’s insidious.Albanese says “Australian families are taking back power from these big tech companies” under his government’s under-16 social media ban.I understand the sentiment and the intention, but are we?Eight in 10 young people think social media platforms should do more to help young people have a positive body image. Yet this ban does nothing to achieve that.Will Australia’s social media ban survive a high court challenge from two teenagers? Most likely – here’s why | Luke BeckRead moreA blanket minimum age prohibition leaves responsibility for online safety with users, their parents and the community. Meanwhile, it allows misaligned algorithms and systems to continue “business as usual” for big tech.I heartily support reining in the social media giants, but I voted against the age ban in the last parliament because it fails to make the companies accountable. Also, young people,statistics show, lean on social media for both mental health support and social networks. Taking that away will be both difficult to enforce and may have unintended consequences.The popular idea of an under-16 ban was the obvious thing to cherry pick but the eating disorder working groups that I initiated made several other recommendations to government to tackle the broad range of social media harms.Among them was an overarching duty of care for social media companies, the ability to turn off or reset the algorithm, transparency in the way their systems operate, risk mitigation and enforceable penalties for non-compliance.In other words, forcing the social media platforms to take responsibility for the spaces that they have built, and to keep users safe.I tabled a bill to this effect in the last parliament, based on world’s best practice. The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education, the Foundation for SocialHealth, the Human Rights Law Centre, Reset Tech Australia, the Butterfly Foundation and the Black Dog Institute all backed these changes.At the time, the former communications minister Michelle Rowland was promising a (weaker version of) a duty of care.What happened to it?I hope the age ban helps protect young people better than we protected Liv, but the work is incomplete.Continuing to put the responsibility on the user is not enough.It’s time we showed some real strength and made the social media companies make their spaces safe, by law.In Australia, theButterfly Foundationis at 1800 33 4673.

He has good reason to believe it won’tSamuel EarleThe Reform leader bit back over allegations of racial abuse and revealed his strategy: the best form of defence is dragging everyone else into the mireSat 13 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 12.46 ESTShareAs the allegations of Nigel Farage’s racist and antisemitic school bullying multiplied, it was hard to keep up with his shifting array of responses. At times, in his evasiveness and discomfort, he has looked like that most un-Farage of things: a nervous politician, anxious not to say the wrong word.Last week, however, he angrily returned to his preferred posture: brimming with indignation at the moral hypocrisy of elites. He lashed out at the BBC’s “double standards” for indulging the allegations, when the broadcaster itself showed racist jokes and skits back in those days. Farage announced it was not he who should apologise, but apparently the BBC that should say sorry “for virtually everything you did throughout the 1970s and 1980s”.This was undoubtedly Farage’s most Trumpian moment yet, and the reaction from many commentators on the left and centre was shock and ridicule. His dismissal of the many credible allegations was unsettling; his reference to a “lower grade” BBC journalist was nasty; he appeared thin-skinned, incoherent, almost deranged; everyone seemed to agree that Farage should have simply said sorry and sought to move on. But in this understandable distaste, it was also possible to detect a certain complacency: a belief that Farage had overstepped the mark and would suffer the consequences, that any behaviour deemed “Trumpian” was a losing strategy. Farage has every reason to believe that such assumptions are false.Despite (or because of) the blowback, Farage probably considers his rant a success. It put him back on the attack, transgressing social norms and setting the news agenda. The rightwing media sphere, which Farage knows he can rely on, lapped it up. The Daily Mail splashed the story on Friday’s front page with the words: “Reform UK leader turns tables on broadcaster”. Isabel Oakeshott, TalkTV’s international editor (whose partner is Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader),saluted Farage’s righteous grievancewith the BBC’s “outrageous” bias. Meanwhile GB News, Farage’s personal national broadcaster,shared his ranton social media with the tagline: “Nigel Farage destroys the BBC”.Farage chose his target well: even putting aside the BBC’s crisis-afflicted state, the broadcaster has been a bugbear among conservatives since its inception. But the form of his attack was even more revealing than the target. While he did briefly deny making any offensive statements at school “in any malicious or nasty way” –he also producedan anonymous letter from a Jewish Dulwich classmate who said that despite the “macho tongue-in-cheek schoolboy banter”, he had never heard Farage racially abuse anyone – the main purpose of the tirade was to imply that everyone was as bad as each other. So even if he did say things like “Gas the Jews” or “That’s the way back to Africa” – which he didn’t, or at least not with malice, not that he can remember or that it matters – why are his accusers pretending that they are any better than him?3:51Nigel Farage demands apology from BBC over racism allegations – videoThey are either complicit in the allegations, like the BBC, or – in another of Farage’s favoured rebuttals – “politically motivated”, like his former classmates who have spoken out. In the same vein, the Spectatorfollowed up this weekwith a defence of Farage that stated “all schoolboys were once obsessed with Hitler” and “so even if the teenage Farage made the sort of remarks attributed to him – and he has denied doing so – he would be entirely typical of his class and generation.”This strikes at the essence of Farage’s political style, and why he is unlikely to ever apologise. He would rather a country where every accusation of prejudice seems fraudulent. To apologise would be to seek forgiveness, and thus to acknowledge a higher moral authority – whereas his liberating promise to his supporters is that no one has the right to look down on them. Farage knows that it is cynicism and contempt – contempt for the major parties, contempt for the mainstream media and for metropolitan elites – that fuels his rise.Farage’s degradations of the public sphere are akin to Trump’s, but they follow older precedents, too. Hannah Arendtonce arguedthat totalitarianism thrives not through cunning lies and gullible masses, but by making cynicism pervasive – by cultivating “the essential conviction” that “politics is a game of cheating”. Once this conviction spreads, brazen lies and immorality could be cast as brave and virtuous, because they exposed “the duplicity upon which the existing society seemed to rest”. Arendt noted how the leaders of these movements revelled in allegations of hypocrisy: it was part of “the old game ofépater les bourgeois”, shocking the middle classes, what we might refer to now as “owning the libs”.A braver Tory leader than Badenoch would dare to call out Farage’s bogus patriotism | Rafael BehrRead moreApplied to Farage’s politics, this insight suggests that he does not want to be innocent: he wants everyone to look guilty. He does not need to be believable; he needs no one to be credible. He does not need to provide hope, only to sow cynicism and contempt. No wonder that Reform, despite its small size, seems to attract so many unseemly characters and allegations. Hardly a fortnight had passed since the news of its former deputy leader in Wales being sentenced to jail foraccepting Russian bribeswhen a former Reform councillor told the police theparty spent beyond legal limitsin its campaign to win Farage’s seat in Clacton (an allegation that the party denies). If politics is a game of cheating, why play by the rules?Farage knows anything that deepens thefeelings of contempt and nihilism in Britain helps his cause. His questions right now won’t be whether voters care about the school allegations or alleged electoral impropriety, but whether he at least appears distinct from the major political parties that they disdain. The task for Farage’s opponents is not only to sustain scrutiny on his character – the nature of which we have long known – but, more importantly, to find a vision of the country that challenges the nihilism on which Farage feeds.Samuel Earle is a writer based in London and the author ofTory Nation: The Dark Legacy of the World’s Most Successful Political PartyExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionReform UKBBCcommentShareReuse this content"

I was curious about what was sparking his renewed interest in an activity he hadn’t thought about since he was 12. His response: “The ban.”I was thrilled. As far as I was concerned, Australia’sworld-first social media lawaimed at preventing children under 16 from accessing social media apps was already a success. But this week, as the ban took effect, my son wasn’t so sure. Access to his accounts remained largely unchanged. Many of his friends were in the same position. Across the country, the rollout has been uneven, as social media companies try to work out how to verify kids’ ages.When the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, spoke about the ban this week, he warned there would be teething issues. However,Albanese’s main message was to kids.He encouraged them to spend the school holidays outside or reading, instead of scrolling on their phones. The comments were popular with parents but the PM’s TikTok account was spammed by younger people letting him know they werestill online. Teenage content creators on social media platforms wasted no time making parody videos about older people’s earnest hopes that the ban would make kidsgo outsideandtouch grass.The jokes tapped into one of my core concerns. I am a gen X parent whose children have come of age in the era of the smartphone. My partner and I monitored screentime with our kids, but we were totally unprepared for the effects technology would have on them. Like many parents, we resent the time and attention big tech companies have stolen from our family and we see the government’s move as an opportunity to wrest control back from big, powerful companies.But in the days since the ban took effect, I have noticed that protecting our kids is not the only agenda we are pursuing. Many of my generation seem to want to go back to the good old days when childhood in Australia was dominated by sun, surf and backyard cricket. I sympathise with the sentiment, but I am also mindful that this idyllic vision of childhood only existed for some.The majority of Australians are first- and second-generation migrants. Many of us live far from the sandy beaches and tree-lined avenues of the country’s cities, in places where green space is shrinking even as temperatures rise, and where traffic congestion poses a risk to children on the street. In the country Australia is today, scrolling is not the only obstacle to children’s capacity to play.Despite these wider social challenges, there is broad agreement that children need protection, and that social media and tech companies must be more robustly regulated. Many parents are relieved the government is tackling the problem.Australia’s willingness to take on some of the largest tech companies on the planet isn’t surprising. There is a strong culture here tied to taking precautions to reduce risk. This includes well-funded public health campaigns on everything from sunscreen to cycle helmets to learning how to swim. In 2012, the government defeated numerous legal challenges by big tobacco companies to pass aworld-first lawmandating the removal of branding colours and designs from cigarette packets. During the Covid pandemic, the country adopted some of the mostrestrictive and successful measuresin the world.In times of crisis, trust in government is high. Support soars when Australians perceive an external threat and the fight against big tech companies is seen in this light. It is no surprise then that77% of Australians support the ban.And as a country we can afford the fight. Despite the nation’s small population, it operates with the kind of swagger that comes with wealth. Until the pandemic in 2020, Australia had experienced29 consecutive yearsof economic growth. And while wages have stagnated and the cost of living is on the rise, it is still a wealthy place that can afford to pick fights it thinks it can win.While there is strong support, the law has vocal critics who have called for tighter regulation of social media companies, rather than prohibitions on individuals. Advocacy groups working with children were dismayed that onlyone daywas set aside for public consultations on the law, leaving no time for real consideration of how the ban might affect children’s ability to connect with each other. In the broader child rights sector, there have been pointed critiques about the hypocrisy of protecting children under 16 from online harms while doing nothing to address the fact that Australia has one of the lowest ages of criminal responsibility in the world. Children as young as10 years oldcan be charged with crimes and sent to prison, andIndigenous childrenare over-imprisoned in this group, making up 70% of those in youth facilities.Despite these criticisms, Australians have decided to make a start, in large part because as Australia’s esafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, has argued, there is no“fair fight”between children and social media algorithms. The country recognises that the playing field is stacked egregiously against kids. The ban – as imperfect as it is – gives parents and communities a starting point for limiting the reach and power of social media giants.It’s already playing out in interesting ways. After school on the first day of the ban I told my son that even though his accounts hadn’t been deactivated, using them was now considered illegal. He smiled, put the phone down and went for a bike ride. When he got back he told me he knew the law was aimed at the companies, not the kids, and that no one was going to check. I looked at him sheepishly. “It’s OK,” he said. “I felt like a ride anyway.” I took the win.Sisonke Msimang is the author of Always Another Country: A Memoir of Exile and Home (2017) and The Resurrection of Winnie Mandela (2018)Explore more on these topicsSocial media banOpinionSocial mediaChildrenDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

What’s yours?Jonathan Nunn is the author of London Feeds ItselfSat 13 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 14.01 ESTShareAlmost 24 years ago, a small British food magazine called Restaurantassembled an all-star panel– made up of Gordon Ramsay, John Torode, Aldo Zilli and 65 other food guys – to adjudicate on the world’s most stupid question: what is the best restaurant on the planet? It didn’t matter that no judge had been to all the restaurants on the shortlist, or that two of the judges happened to be Jeremy Clarkson and Roger Moore – what the editors of Restaurant understood is that peoplelovea list, and if you order a group of restaurants from 50-1 and throw a party, people might take it seriously.“This could run and run,” the editors wrote in their intro, half hoping. They were right. Within two decades, The World’s 50 Best Restaurants had gone from what critic Jay Rayner described as a “terribly successful marketing exercise” to an insurgent alternative to the ossified Michelin Guide, solidifying the reputations of El Bulli, the Fat Duck and then Noma as the “world’s best restaurant”.Since then, we – by which I mean food writers, journalists and general punters – have become obsessed with restaurant lists. On the premium end of things, you have institutions like The World’s 50 Best and Michelin itself, which will announce the starred restaurants for its Saudi Arabia guide next week. On the other, there is – well, everything else: The Best 22 Date Night Restaurants in London Right Now, The Hot 50: the most popular Mancheseter restaurants and bars, The 17 best restaurants in Glasgow you simply have to try andits sequel, The 18 best restaurants in Glasgow you simply have to try.During the 2010s, the list overtook the review as the main form of restaurant writing, taking advantage of internet search-engine optimisation, publications’ smaller budgets, and the alliance of journalism with PR, which allowed writers to list restaurants they hadn’t paid for, or necessarily been to. The success of the list, and the decline in criticality, has precipitated restaurant writing’s downfall. Today, one of the most powerful forces for restaurant recommendations is the Instagram duoTopjaw, whose questions to chefs – “best restaurant in London?”, “best curry in Manchester?, “most underrated restaurant in New York?’ – are nothing more than the list cleverly updated for short-form video.If it sounds as if I consider myself above all this then I can reassure you: I absolutely do not. I started out writing restaurant lists myself for the now-defunct site Eater London, mainly concentrating on London’s outer boroughs, where restaurants tend to serve their own neighbourhoods and not get included on lists. This week, for my own publication Vittles, I published a larger, even more ridiculouslist of 99 restaurantsthat took me two years to eat through, write and whittle down from about 3,000 meals eaten out over the last seven years. I could tell you that it’s an attempt to connect this vital part of the London hospitality industry with its more central scene of restaurants – the ones with Michelin stars, private dining rooms and, in one case, its own private island – and accurately reflect the bewildering diversity of London’s food culture. But really, I just like writing lists and people love reading them – and especially, arguing about them.The central argument of a “best of” list contains a problem, one that I kept running into while writing my own list: what do we really mean by “best”? At some point, the World’s 50 Best moved away from its eclectic first list, which included shepherd’s pie and ketchup at the Ivy alongside a restaurant inside a giant fish tank in Dubai, and started to laud the same type of restaurant. In the end, it was itself accused of becoming a homogenising andunrepresentativeforce for bad. But when we talk about “best”, why can’t we meaningfully compare, say, the Ritz to a fish and chip shop? Whose idea of what “quality” means do we deem to be important? Is it possible to acknowledge that while the work that goes into the creation of a tasting menu and the work that goes into nourishing a community may not be the same, they do have an equivalent importance and require a similar level of skill?A new start after 60: I moved on to a boat, fell in love – then opened my own restaurantRead moreI’ve loved discussing these questions with people. Recently, I have been asking everyone I know what they consider to be the five best restaurants where they live without worrying about what a “best restaurant” looks like. The answers have never been the same, or given for the same reasons. It might be the restaurant they take a loved one to on a special occasion, or the restaurant that they eat at so often they don’t need to order. It might be a place that has the capacity to transform an ingredient into something completely new, or a place that makes the same thing over and over again, aiming for perfection. When I asked my dad for his list, he pointed to Ognisko, the Polish restaurant he had his birthday at, Survivor, his go-to Jamaican takeaway, and a pie and mash shop which reminds him of his childhood. Each one, I think, is an equally valid interpretation of “best”. Each one reflects an important experience ofLondon.This is why my favourite restaurant lists tend not to be the ones like Michelin or World’s 50 Best that have been written by committee, but the personal ones. A personal list shows up the inherent ridiculousness of the enterprise – it can no longer even fake a veneer of objectivity. There is the late Richard Collin’s New Orleans Underground Gourmet, which wrote about French fine dining next to po’ boys and eventually got embroiled in a city-wide scandal over Collin’s evaluation of a spaghetti sauce. There are Jonathan Gold’s lists, which, for a whole generation, via Gold’s opinions, defined the contours of Los Angeles dining. These lists tend to be passionate, strongly argued and completely unreasonable – they are there, hopefully, not there to cement a fake consensus, but to sharpen our own sense of what we believe quality means. Ultimately, the best thing a list can do is to force us to make lists of our own.Jonathan Nunn is a food and city writer based in London who co-edits the magazine Vittles.

And what a precocious performer he has proved, sustaining scrappy mischief through seven decades of mainstream entertainmentXan BrooksSat 13 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 01.01 ESTShareAll Hollywood stars grow old and die except perhaps one - Dick Van Dyke - who turns 100 today. The real world Peter Pan who used to trip over the ottoman on The Dick Van Dyke Show is still standing. The man who impersonated a wind-up toy in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang hasn’t wound down just yet. He has outlived mentors, co-stars, romantic partners and several studios. He’s even outlived the jokes about his performance in Mary Poppins. These days hismangled cockney accentis regarded with more fondness than contempt. It’s seen as one of the great charms of the 1964 classic, along with the carousel chase or the cartoon dancing penguins.View image in fullscreenAccent on the charm … Dick Van Dyke with Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins.Photograph: Donaldson Collection/Getty ImagesCharm is the magic ingredient of every popular entertainer and few have possessed it in such abundance as Van Dyke, the impoverished son of a travelling cookie salesman who dropped out of high school and educated himself at the movies. “His job in this life is to make a happier world,” his Broadway co-star Chita Rivera once said - and this may explain his stubborn refusal to quit, not while times are tough and he feels that audiences still need cheering up.Naturally his workrate has now slowed, but in the past few years he has competed on the TV showThe Masked Singer,starred in aColdplay videoand enthusiasticallystumped for Bernie Sanders. Van Dyke simply couldn’t understand why America’s older citizens were resistant to Sanders’ democratic socialist domestic policies. He said, “I want to urge my generation to get out and vote for him, please.”View image in fullscreenToo much energy … Dick Van Dyke in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.Photograph: Moviestore/REX/ShutterstockAs he nudges into triple figures, he has become a piece of living history: a walking, talking chronicle of US showbusiness itself. Van Dyke began his career performing for the troops in the second world war and proceeded to rub shoulders with the likes of Phil Silvers and Walt Disney. He had one foot in music-hall slapstick and the other in screwball comedy, and possibly splayed fingers in his midwestern hometown of Danville, Illinois.In bridging these worlds, he perfected an outward-facing public image that was one part Stan Laurel to two parts Jimmy Stewart: a pratfalling clown who was decent and honest and smarter than he first appeared. And while he was already nearing 40 when The Dick Van Dyke Show and Mary Poppins made him an international star, the actor remained irrepressibly boyish. In 1968’sChitty Chitty Bang Bang, he played Caractacus Potts, the madcap inventor who dreams up a flying car, while Lionel Jeffries - six months younger - played Potts’s addled and eccentric dad.Van Dyke, by and large, has steered clear of dark films. He famously turned down the lead role in The Omen and insists that he mostly played a version of himself. “Wholesome,” he says. “An all-round good boy.” That’s true so far as it goes, although it’s probably only half the story, because Van Dyke’s interpretation conveniently sidesteps a 25-year struggle with alcoholism that spanned his professional heyday. Possibly it also glosses over the air of dancing mischief – even wildness – that animates his most feted, family-friendly performances.View image in fullscreenSparring mutual respect … Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke in The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961).Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesOr to put it more bluntly, Van Dyke may have been mainstream but he never once felt conservative, nor even cosy, exactly. He brought too much energy to the room. It was as though he’d just blown in from outside and wasn’t entirely housetrained. TheDick Van DykeShow – an otherwise standard 60s family sitcom – is notable for the crackling sexual chemistry and sparring mutual respect which Van Dyke cooked up with his co-star, Mary Tyler Moore.Caractacus Potts, for his part, is the ultimate rackety dad: loving and exciting and liable to forget every birthday and dentist appointment. And then there is Bert, the sweep fromMary Poppinswho trips across London’s rooftops like an urbanised Puck of Pook’s Hill. The evidence suggests that Bert isn’t cockney at all. He’s a spooky nature spirit, antic and mercurial, who is gamely attempting to pass himself off as a local.View image in fullscreenCampaigning for Bernie Sanders, 2020.Photograph: Étienne Laurent/EPAVan Dyke is 100 and therefore no longer looks like Peter Pan. He looks, if anything, the platonic ideal of old age, with laughter lines and a thick white beard, the weathered embodiment of a life well lived. In his later years, he has grown used to people asking him for health advice, to the point where he even sat down and listed it all in a book (100 Rules for Living to 100).Porpoises rescue Dick Van DykeRead moreThe man is too self-aware to present himself as a paragon of good living. Instead he credits his longevity to a sprinkle of everyday magic – a combination of good genes, solid friendships and a positive mental outlook. “My life has been a magnificent indulgence,” he says. “I’ve been able to do what I love and share it with the world.”It’s an arrangement that has sustained him for a full century on the planet. It’s fuelled a career so rewarding and fun that it barely felt like work at all. Van Dyke started out as showbusiness’s gawky gatecrasher, a controlled explosion of elastic limbs and rubber-faced double-takes, before maturing by degrees into Hollywood’s twinkling Father Time. He is ancient but evergreen, feted and cherished. And he’s altogether as lucky as lucky can be.Explore more on these topicsDick Van DykeMary PoppinsChitty Chitty Bang BangTelevisionJulie AndrewsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Devotees will be up bright and early on Boxing Day for episodes five to seven (the finale airs on New Year’s Day). Events are dominated by Will’s new powers, which present a massive threat to Vecna. But why is Vecna so wary of the cave in which Max is hiding? As the finale looms, the past and present are set to fall into place – and the now visibly twentysomething cast will be able to move on with their lives.Netflix, from Boxing DayThe LowdownView image in fullscreenAll heart … Ethan Hawke and Ryan Kiera Armstrong in The Lowdown.Photograph: Shane Brown/FXLee Raybon (Ethan Hawke) keeps a lot of plates spinning. He also watches plenty of plates crash to the ground. His family life is a mess. His business is failing. In his self-styled role as a “truthstorian” (a dirt-digging, investigative journalist), he has a knack for upsetting Tulsa’s most dangerous people.This dramafrom Sterlin Harjo lands somewhere between noirish crime thriller and stoner caper. The story, which takes in racist neo-Nazis and systemic corruption, is dark and conspiratorial, but Hawke’s performance invests Raybon with a quirky charm and adds nuance and heart.Disney+, from Boxing DayFalloutView image in fullscreenApocalyptic … Lucy MacLean as Ella Purnell in Fallout.Photograph: Lorenzo Sisti/PrimeFor a show with such an apocalyptic premise,Falloutteems with new life. It’s just that the life in question is generally grotesque, vicious and corrupt. The second season of this video game adaptation continues to transcend its origins but fans of the original will find themselves on familiar (if terrifying) ground as the action heads to New Vegas. Much pivots on the love/hate relationship between Ella Purnell’s Lucy and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins) as Lucy searches for her nefarious father. The world-building is immaculate, the writing is witty and it never hesitates to get properly nasty.Prime Video, from Wednesday 17DecemberEmily in ParisView image in fullscreenRoman holiday … Lily Collins and Eugenio Franceschini in Emily in Paris.Photograph: Giulia Parmigiani/NetflixThe increasingly misleadingly namedromcomreturns as Emily’s Roman holiday continues. While the show is still bewilderingly poor, it has become more likable as it leans into its own cartoonish absurdity. Emily is struggling in Rome: Marcello has taken her for an afternoon truffle-hunting even though she’s turned up to their date wearing heels. Professionally, things aren’t brilliant either – though to be fair, Emily has always been terrible at her job with no ill-effects on her lifestyle. Besides, as she quips inevitably, “Rome wasn’t built in a day”.Netflix, from Thursday 18DecemberBorn to Be WildView image in fullscreenMeet-cute … Born to be Wild.Photograph: AppleWhereas the BBC’s Natural History Unit will show the animal world red in tooth and claw, that generally isn’t Apple’s approach. And this six-part series, narrated by Hugh Bonneville, shamelessly leans into the cuteness factor. The animals it follows are orphans, raised by humans from an early age but being prepared to return to the wild. As this parade of interactions between humans and baby elephants, lemurs, lynx, bears, penguins and cheetahs suggests, some of them have become worryingly (albeit delightfully and photogenically) attached to their rescuers.Apple TV, from Friday 19DecemberStrandedView image in fullscreenLife-threatening … Stranded.Photograph: Channel 4For many people, being stranded by snow in a ski resort over Christmas would be a dream come true. But this Italian thriller, via Walter Presents, takes a different tack. Banker Giovanni Lo Bianco is on holiday with his children and soon discovers that one of his fellow guests is a figure from his past with the potential to expose his double life. But things can always get worse – and when the hotel’s electricity is cut off, the situation becomes life-threatening and the guests can only survive by trusting each other. Which is a big problem. Contrived but fun.Channel 4, from Friday 19DecemberBreakdown: 1975View image in fullscreenA window into America’s soul … Breakdown: 1975.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix © 2025The mid-1970s was a difficult time for the United States: the country faced humiliation in Vietnam, the aftermath of Nixon’s presidency and a series of social and financial crises. However, as this fascinating documentary shows, at least plenty of great cinema emerged from the turbulence. In fact, directorMorgan Nevillesuggests that films such as Taxi Driver and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest were, thanks to their sense of disillusionment, a window into America’s soul. Martin Scorsese and Ellen Burstyn contribute, while Taxi Driver star Jodie Foster narrates.Netflix, from Friday 19DecemberExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best shows to stream this weekTV streamingEmily in ParisStranger ThingsEthan HawkefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had night blindness and blind spots in my field of view. At 44, I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic eye condition that causes the retina cells to die. I had always been a very visually oriented person: I was a practising architect, and someone who loved to read, draw, go to the cinema and visit art exhibitions. So when black text disappeared on a glaring white page, films became impossible to follow and artworks only took shape once explained to me, I questioned who I would be without my vision.Around the age of 50, I had a particularly stressful year: I got divorced; dissolved my business; started a new job; moved house; and my dad died. As my life fell off a cliff, so did my eyesight, so that by 2015 my field of vision had decreased to only 5-10 degrees (a healthy average person’s is about 200 degrees). I was registered blind, but for a long time I lived in denial, not telling anyone how much vision I had lost. At work, feeling vulnerable and like I could lose my job, I presented as fully sighted, a daily performance that became exhausting. I was in survival mode, focusing on putting one foot in front of the other, hoping I wouldn’t get found out. I refused to see myself as disabled, and resisted using a white stick, but once I eventually did, I found people saw my disability before they saw me. I felt a total loss of identity. And I stopped doing the cultural things that once brought me joy.As the curtain went up and the three characters appeared on stage, I felt as if I’d got my vision backThree years after that terrible year, I went to the theatre for the first time since losing most of my sight. It wasThe Lehman Trilogyat the National Theatre in London, a play about the Lehman Brothers and the 2008 financial crash. I assumed it would be another frustrating exercise of trying to piece together fragments and failing to follow the action that I’d come to expect whenever I went to the cinema or watched TV. But from the darkness of the circle, as the curtain went up and the three characters appeared on stage, I felt as if I’d got my vision back.The simplicity of Es Devlin’s high-contrast set design, the lighting, the three-man cast, the actors’ silhouettes, the minimal props and the rotating set was a kind of conjuring trick that meant, for the first time in years, I could actually follow what was happening. The cage-like structure on the rotating set was literally pivotal: thanks to the play’s focusing of all the action within this framing device, I didn’t have to consciously think about where to look, and worry about whether I was missing parts of the narrative. The stripped-back staging laid bare the words, the action, the story, the theatre of it.It was total immersion with no barriers, which felt freeing. The feeling was so visceral I didn’t even realise it at the time. I was simply back to being me as I used to be. It was only afterwards that I realised how completely absorbed I had been. I’ve now seen The Lehman Trilogy three times, and at each viewing, I have been able to forget that I am partially sighted. For those three hours and 20 minutes, I was myself again.That first viewing of The Lehman Trilogy was an epiphany, a revelation that the immediacy of live performance gave me the control – I could lock on to the action and follow it in a way that I couldn’t with other visual culture. Not every theatre production manages such complete alchemy as this, but now, pretty much every time I see a play, I become totally connected to the world created on stage. I’ve been given back not just a sense of sight but a sense of self.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

I rarely give anything else. I strongly approve of the Icelandic tradition of theJólabókaflóðið(Yule book flood), whereby books are given (and, crucially, read) on Christmas Eve. Nan Shepherd’sThe Living Mountainis the one I’ve given more often than any other; so much so that I keep a stack of four or five to hand, ready to give at Christmas or any other time of the year. It’s a slender masterpiece – a meditation on Shepherd’s lifelong relationship with the Cairngorm mountains, which was written in the 1940s but not published until 1977. It’s “about the Cairngorms” in the sense that Mrs Dalloway is “about London”; which is to say, it is both intensely engaged with its specific setting, and gyring outwards to vaster questions of knowledge, existence and – a word Shepherd uses sparingly but tellingly – love.View image in fullscreenElif ShafakMost years, I like to give novels as holiday gifts, but this year I am thinking of sharing either Marcus Aurelius’sMeditationsor one of Byung-Chul Han’s books, particularlyThe Burnout SocietyorThe Spirit of Hope. The South Korean-German philosopher describes himself as an “optimistic refugee”, and his style is quite distinctive, blending various disciplines and philosophical traditions from east and west. These short but dense books may not exactly be cheerful, Christmassy reads, but they make excellent companions for anyone interested in “thinking about thinking” in a digital world of noise and distraction; for anyone concerned about the future of humanity.View image in fullscreenColm TóibínThere is a book I buy as a present that never goes out of fashion. It isThe Good Soldierby Ford Madox Ford. It is hardly about a soldier at all, but the title is good because it distracts people and thus the extraordinary plot creeps up and bites you before you know where you are. The narrative curls and twists; the narrator knows too much or too little. But at some point the appalling and ingenious nature of the treachery – what is called “cheating” nowadays – becomes apparent and you feel that you have been let in on some intriguing and explosive secret. It is perfect, thus, for Christmas.Jeanette WintersonTo the young people in my life I give Italo Calvino’sInvisible Cities. It’s a series of perfect micro-fictions that both stand alone and build towards a deepening message on the nature of reality. It’s also an optimistic text that locates power in the individual. We can change things – if we know where to put our energy.To my contemporaries, I give out whatever I think will do them good! Books are more than entertainment. We shouldn’t be shy about wanting to provoke or challenge our friends – or ourselves. This year it’s Robert Macfarlane’sIs a River Alive?View image in fullscreenFlorence KnappI’ve given copies of Claire Keegan’sFosterto so many friends, I worry about unwittingly doubling up. At just 88 pages, it makes a slender gift, but one that won’t sit onerously on a bedside table and whose concision hints at its specialness. Set over one Irish summer, the story is told through a child’s eyes, as she is sent to live with relatives during the final weeks of her mother’s pregnancy. Coming from a household of neglect into one of warmth, the girl’s observations about people reveal both a guilelessness and devastating insight.Nussaibah YounisView image in fullscreenMother Mary Comes to Meby Arundhati Roy is a gorgeous, brave and nuanced account of the novelist’s life – anchored in an astonishingly truthful exploration of her relationship with her mother, Mary. She describes her as “my shelter and my storm”, and in the book’s pages we meet Mary the celebrated feminist campaigner and Mary the volatile, threatening mother. Without ever flattening or reducing this formidable and complicated woman, Roy parses the ways her own life has developed – both as a rejection and as homage to her mother. The work is also unapologetically political, and after the horrors in Gaza, I appreciate an author who can speak to the world we are in. The book is beautifully bound and makes for a lovely gift, and I haven’t stopped buying it for people since the day it was published.Frank Cottrell-BoyceWhen The Wind in the Willows first came out, the reviews were mixed. “As a contribution to natural history,” said one, “it is negligible.” AA Milne set out to proclaim its genius. He used to give copies to people “as a test of character”. I feel the same about Terry Pratchett’sTruckers. It’s the story of a group of Nomes who have come to believe that the department store in which they live is the entire universe (its slogan is “everything under one roof”). A satire on consumerism, sexism, dogmatism and … you name it, it is above all warm, hilarious and wise.View image in fullscreenMichael RosenSarah Crossan’sWhere the Heart Should Beis a gripping and moving free verse novel set in the time of the famine in Ireland. It brings you face to face with the tragedy and solidarity of those times. So-called YA, but a great read for anyone.Katherine RundellI have two books I keep stocks of to give as gifts. One, for book-hungry older children, isThe Count of Monte Cristoby Alexandre Dumas: it’s dauntingly huge, yes, but also one of the most perfect adventure stories ever written, and I have found that the children it does catch hold of become dizzy with the pleasure of it. The other, to lure in children who have not yet become eager readers, is Sharna Jackson’s superbly wittyHigh RiseMysteryseries; I’ve not yet met a child who doesn’t adore it.Max PorterThe book I have most often given, for over 20 years now, is Alice Oswald’sDart, her miraculous translation of a river into polyphonic poetry. Ecologically and philosophically it is profoundly (and increasingly!) radical, and line by line it is a pure enlivening delight to read. I give it to people who never read poetry, as well as poetry experts. I give it to visitors, friends, newlyweds, students, grievers, swimmers; and I hope they pass it on to others, because nobody owns a river.View image in fullscreenKamila ShamsieSince 2010, all five stories shortlisted for theBBCNational short storyawardhave been published in book form by the wonderful Comma Press. It’s always a stellar shortlist, varied in all ways other than quality. As gifts go, the anthology is perfect: first-rate fiction, the stories as compact as the physical book itself (you can carry it in the deep pocket of a winter coat). And, best of all, next Christmas you can give it to the discerning reader all over again.Derek OwusuView image in fullscreenAs I’ve got older, it’s become harder for me to engage with books on that magical level that feels as if the whole world were concentrated in the palms of your hands. So when it does happen, the impulse is to share it.Kingfisherby Rozie Kelly is a gentle and compassionate novel that explores the nuances of queer love and friendship, the moral dilemmas of sharing someone else’s life through life writing, and the choices we make for our chosen family and those bound to us by blood. I’ve given it to many people so far, but the most significant was to the Casual Readers book club, where, uncommonly, there was unanimous love for the book.Ali SmithOver the years the books I’ve tended to give most?Wise Childrenby Angela Carter andWhen Will There Be Good Newsby Kate Atkinson. Carter’s final novel is infused with such a high-kicking joyousness that it’s a pleasure to hand it to anyone. Atkinson is always good news, and this work of humane detective fiction is so satisfying that I can give it to folk who don’t know her work, trusting they’ll love it. But this past year the book I’ve found myself giving to most people isMichael Kohlhaas, a slim novella from 1810 by Heinrich von Kleist, translated by Michael Hofmann. Why is the world in such conflagration again? Kleist’s tale about the consequences of injustice will never not be relevant and is so thrilling that once I started reading it I couldn’t stop for anything. Stunning.Diana EvansI’m a lover of short stories and one of my favourite collections is Sarah Hall’sSudden Traveller. The stories are simply stunning in their emotional and imaginative leap; her use of language is beautiful and glittering. As far as gifts are concerned, this is one you could give to someone who likes a quick yet wholly transporting read.Catherine Newman“Amos, a mouse, lived by the ocean.” Everybody in my family – maybe in my life – knows the opening line of the picture bookAmos& BorisbyWilliam Steig. It’s the story of an unlikely friendship between a shipwrecked rodent and a kind-hearted whale, and it’s a combination of plainspoken and magical and deeply, even existentially, philosophical. There’s nobody in my life I wouldn’t give this book to – especially children and friends, and children who are friends – except there’s nobody I can give it to, since I have already given it to everybody.View image in fullscreenJoe DunthorneI can tell which books I really love because I never have copies on my bookshelf. These are the ones I repeatedly give away, so that my shelves have become a repository for all the books that are not my actual favourites. Sam Lipsyte’sThe Askis a novel I have bought on many occasions. For anyone who needs reminding how straight-up fun reading can be, it’s a great reviver: funny, sharp, alive – and with a wonderfully dark undertow. I haven’t kept hold of a copy in years.View image in fullscreenTessa HadleyI giveRumer Godden’s novelsto people –Kingfishers Catch Fire,perhaps, orThe River– because a lot of readers don’t know her work.She’s such a warm and entrancing storyteller, but with a steely eye too, and ruthless truthfulness. She’s the best kind of comfort read.Nina StibbeI love to giveRestorationby Rose Tremain at Christmas. I’ve never known anyone able to resist protagonist Robert Merivel – a young medical student who lands in the court of Charles II, rises quickly in the king’s favour, then suffers a catastrophic fall from grace. Honest, mischievous, spiritual and self-indulgent, Merivel is above all lovable. Tremain’s depiction of 17th-century life – contrasting the opulence of court with the brutality of the time – is gloriously bawdy one moment, and stop-in-your-tracks profound the next. And as an added bonus, the book’s cover, over the years, has always been Christmassy. Note: the sequel,Merivel: A Man of His Time,is just as wonderful – if not more so.View image in fullscreenSarah MossI often give Tove Jansson’sThe Summer Book. Best known for the Moomins, Jansson was also a mistress of the short story, and The Summer Book shows both the gift for parable that underlies the best children’s picture books and the literary economy of short fiction. The central characters are a little girl and her grandmother, and the story turns around the missing mother without ever mentioning her. There’s lots of beautifully observed play and adventure and attention to the natural world. It’s set on a small Finnish island in midsummer, among people who know very well how to appreciate sunlight, so good midwinter reading.View image in fullscreenEsther FreudAt Christmas I often give the gift of Tove Jansson’sA Winter Book– a collection of short stories selected by Ali Smith, and an exquisite companion to The Summer Book. These stories reflect Jansson’s core passions: small boats, islands, and the vital need for art and inspiration. They’re about land and sea, youth and age; my favourite is a description of two elderly women locking up their home for the last time – a house on a remote rock in the Pellinge archipelago I was lucky enough to visit – leaving the key and some purposefully muddled instructions for anyone who may be passing by.Megan NolanThe book I’ve given most often – by a large margin – is a collection of poetry calledFearof Descriptionby my friend Daniel Poppick. I bought it before I’d ever met Dan, and it had been a long time since I’d got anything out of poetry. I was relieved and amazed to find myself laughing aloud, and then winded with emotion by the final line. I’ve given it since to friends, lovers, at least one parent – partly because it’s a pleasure to share work by someone I’m proud to be friends with and partly because it’s a low-stakes burden gift-wise, something you can dip in and out of with ease and pleasure.View image in fullscreenNikesh ShuklaThe newUltimate Spider-Manseries deserves everyone’s attention. Written by the legend that is Jonathan Hickman, alongside artist Marco Checchetto, it’s the Spidey reboot we’ve all been waiting for. There have been many reinventions of everyone’s favourite webslinger, but nothing meets the moment like this does, and with Hickman’s incredible attention to character, it’s the best Spidey’s been in years.View image in fullscreenSaba SamsI am not sure if it’s wrong to suggest you give the same book to all the vegans in your life, as if suggesting that all vegans are the same, but I do think Olga Tokarczuk’sDrive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Deadfits this bill. I love to imagine people I know reading it, even people who eat meat, who would probably like it too. It’s kooky and fun and strange; it’s important without being depressing. I think a lot about the scene at the annual Mushroom Picker’s Ball, which Janina, the main character, attends dressed up as a wolf. Actually, this book is rather festive.Andrew Michael HurleyI was given a copy of JL Carr’s novellaA Month in the Countrymany years ago by a work colleague and it’s a book I’ve gifted ever since, so that others can have the joy of reading it for the first time too. It’s a profound, funny, elegiac meditation on lost youth and unrequited love, so sharply observed and economically written that it can be devoured in one sitting. For me, that makes it the perfect present: immediately pleasurable and something that stays with you for life.Jonathan CoeI occasionally giveThe Echoing GrovebyRosamond Lehmann, in the (so far unfulfilled) hope that one day somebody else will agree with me that for narrative complexity and jagged emotional impact there is almost nothing that comes close to it.Nicola DinanRecently, I’ve been givingFree Food for MillionairesbyMin Jin Lee. Published a decade beforePachinko, it follows a Korean community in 00s Manhattan. I’m currently crawling through Middlemarch, and the influence of Eliot’s writing on Lee’s work, and Free Food for Millionaires in particular, is clear. If you’re looking for a sprawling contemporary novel with intersecting and heartfelt narratives, this is for you.William BoydI am a great reader and buyer of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, but many of my cultured and sophisticated friends think modern poetry is “difficult” or “obscure”, not to say “incomprehensible”, and consequently don’t read it. So, deciding to proselytise, I give the recalcitrant friend a copy of Philip Larkin’sThe Whitsun Weddings, with certain key poems marked. Namely, the title poem, Broadcast, MCMXIV, Sunny Prestatyn, Afternoons, and An Arundel Tomb. More often than not, they’re hooked. Larkin, at his best and most inimitable, speaks to – and for – everyone.View image in fullscreenYomi AdegokeThe last book I gave someone was a birthday present that went down so well, I intend to fill a stocking or two with it at Christmas. It was Elizabeth Day’sOne of Us, a dark comedy that slickly satirises the lives of a British establishment family. It’s brimming with sharp commentary on class in modern Britain and paints an intimate portrait of the super-privileged’s messy family dynamics. But most importantly, it’s a lot of fun.Philippe SandsOn the theory that a gift should raise spirits, I opt forThe Man Who Planted Treesby Jean Giono – a naturalist’s quest to improve a strip of land. First published in 1953, it’s a reminder in these torrid times of what really matters in life, and how to make a difference. It can be read in an hour, and few books offer more joy or warmth for your buck.Curtis SittenfeldErin O White’s debut novel,Like Family, was published in the US last month, and I’ve already given it to two friends and my two sisters. I’m still planning to give it to my neighbour, my oldest friend and my sister-in-law. It’s about three intertwined families in upstate New York, and it’s smart and warm and queer (as in mostly about lesbians) and middle-aged and funny. Admittedly, I’m friends with the author in real life, but writer friendship obligates you to buy just one book; this for me is a case of true literary love. And the beauty of Like Family is that reading it will make you feel like you’re friends with the author, too.To browse all books mentioned in this article, visitguardianbookshop.com.

It feels like a family reunion – but one where everyone is hugely charmingRhik SamadderSat 13 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTSharePeep Show is not really a TV show. It’s closer to an identity now,embedded inthe collective British DNA. A decade after the show finished, many of us still call each other “Clean Shirt”, notice logos in foam or quip about crack being “very moreish”. The only show more emblematic of the UK’s national psyche isThe Great British Bake Off. Therefore rejoice, for the hottest collab of the holiday is here! I’m calling this the real reason for the season. The true raisin for the praisin’, perhaps.They’re so much part of our lives, it’s hard to see these bakers as actors. It feels more natural to say that this Christmas the Bake Off tent will host a reunion of Mark, Sophie, Big Suze, Super Hans and Dobby. Together again, like family, your family. It’s glorious to see them – older, some bearded, not one of them less charming. No proceeds from this are going to charity because there aren’t any. This is happening purely for joy.‘The scripts were the funniest things I’d ever read’: the stars of Peep Show look back, 20 years laterRead moreDavid Mitchell has been on Bake Off before. This may not give him an edge. As he points out, “I’ve made four cakes in my life, two of which have been televised.” You’d expect Big Suze, AKA Sophie Winkleman, half-sister of Claudia, and a member of the royal family, to have a certain level of competence. It could just be that her gentility gives her a Meghan Markle-esque poise. Matt King is the real surprise, having studied cookery and worked as a chef. He’s fascinatingly different to “terrible drug addict” Super Hans. So much so that watching him becomes, ironically, quite addictive.View image in fullscreenExtra sprinkles … Olivia Colman and Alison Hammond on The Great Christmas Bake Off.Photograph: Channel 4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PAThen there’s Olivia Colman, who played mild-mannered office worker Sophie. In real life, Colman has won a best actress Oscar, and elevated the most acclaimed TV of recent years, from Fleabag and The Night Manager to The Bear. It’s to her credit that you can still imagine her chit-chatting in the line at the supermarket, or eating a Jammie Dodger. She is in the pantheon of greats. This is like Daniel Day-Lewis going on Would I Lie to You? (he’d be phenomenal at that). Goes without saying, it would be hilarious if Colman won this too.Sadly, Robert Webb is absent. Presumably owing to a schedule clash, though it’s fun to imagine his character Jeremy’s opposition to appearing. “It’s Keep Calm and Carry On Opiating the masses, Mark!” etc.Judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith’s tasks are pure fan service. Challenging the contestants to make a turkey pie, the latter announces: “This is an homage to the classic scene where Jeremy forgets the turkey.” She sounds like a prime minister declaring their lifelong love for the Arsenal. In my heart, I do not believe Leith has watched a single second ofPeep Show. Imagine if she’d asked them to cook dog.View image in fullscreenSecond time’s the charm? … David Mitchell back in the tent on The Great Christmas Bake Off.Photograph: Channel 4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PASomeone else who has never seen an episode is King – and his signature bake is equally unexpected. “Forgotten Birds of Christmas” sees the comedian and actor baking thrush, blue tit and chaffinch biscuits, “because robins get all the attention”. He was a former member of the YOC, he explains. (He’s referring to a club for young ornithologists, rather than youth offenders I think.) Winkleman, meanwhile, possesses not just the poise of Markle but also the baking skills. The more her bakes deteriorate, the more honeyed her diction becomes. “Poor things,” she commiserates of her unsealed pies. She sounds like an M&S advert for a dropped dessert.Presenters Noel Fielding and Alison Hammond essentially get a day off, while their witty guests, particularly Mitchell, gift us zingers like currants in figgy pudding. The showstoppers are Easter eggs, too. The cast bake cakes to illustrate Peep Show deep cuts, including Dobby’s personal cheese, Super Hans running to Windsor and Mark burying an intoxicated Sophie in a ball pit. Like the show, it’s hard to explain, yet perfect.Don’t worry if you’re not a Peep Show diehard. There’s also a boys’ choir carolling celestially, and a thrilling moment when Leith accuses Hollywood of handing out handshakes on an arbitrary basis. Cooking, with stress baked in! Choirs of angels! Arguments between family members! Now that’s what I call Christmas!Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherPeep ShowThe Great British Bake OffTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But she is previewing a revival of his Indian Ink, so he shimmers through the conversation. The way Kendal refers to Stoppard in the present tense tells its own poignant story.Settling into a squishy brown sofa atHampstead theatre, Kendal describes revisiting the 1995 work, developed from a 1991 radio play. “It’s a play that I always thought I’d like to go back to.”Previously starring as Flora Crewe, a provocative British poet visiting 1930s India, she now plays Eleanor Swan, Flora’s sister. We meet Eleanor in the 1980s, fending off an intrusive biographer but uncovering her sister’s rapt and nuanced relationships in India.Kendal claims to have only hazy memories of when she was in the original production: “You wipe a play, you shed things as you go along.” Eleanor was first played by Peggy Ashcroft (in her final radio performance) and Margaret Tyzack. The redoubtable sisters are both “bluestockings”, considers Kendal. “They have very much the same beginning politically – they’re edgy, and they break the rules.” Young Eleanor was a communist, involved with a married politician – but the stern older woman, always with “two kinds of cake on the go”, has become, Kendal suggests, “a little more conservative. Mrs Swan is mourning what has gone. Because she’s lived much longer, there’s a sadness for the past.”View image in fullscreen‘Endlessly ballsy’ … Ruby Ashbourne Serkis (Flora Crewe) and Gavi Singh Chera (Nirad Das) in Indian Ink at Hampstead theatre.Photograph: Johan Persson/The role of Flora passes toRuby Ashbourne Serkis, who sits beside Kendal and describes the character as “endlessly ballsy. She’s an adventurer.” The play, she thinks, is about “saying yes to life, taking chances when you get them, and not letting cloudy days get in the way”. Flora has “learned to not take notice of what people think of her – it’s what I want for myself”.Stoppard is caustic about Britain’s imperial past – “It beats me how we’re getting away with it, darling,” scoffs Flora, “I wouldn’t trust some of them to run theHackneyEmpire.” It’s heady material, lightly worn, though the current cast haven’t dug into the background. “It’s all in the play,” Kendal exclaims. “He [Stoppard] has done the digging, don’t mess yourself up with any more.” Even though the play chimes with her own childhood, she brushes aside any personal resonance. “Don’t do all that therapy about it because you’ll fuck up the text,” she declares. “You don’t need it.”Indian Ink bounces off the page – but is it easy to play? “At first glance, it is effortless but it’s actually super complex,” says Ashbourne Serkis. “A lot of our rehearsal process has been digging to lay those foundations, and then bringing it back to what is there on the surface. It’s such a gift.” For Kendal, the first voice of so many Stoppard roles, you need to “find the style and rhythm. It doesn’t come just by reading it, you’ve got to work out what that music is. Once you get it, you know you’ve got it.”View image in fullscreen‘You’ve got to work out what that music is’ … Felicity Kendal (Flora Crewe) and Art Malik (Nirad Das) in Indian Ink at the Aldwych theatre, London, in 1995.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn other Stoppard plays, Kendal has been an academic (in Arcadia), a spy (Hapgood) and an actor (both The Real Thing and Jumpers). Is there a common thread? She thoughtfully fingers the star of David around her neck. “There are always three or four different things going on at the same time,” she says. “He loves complications.” She mentions the 18th-century watchmaker Jean-Marc Vacheron, hailed as “a master of complications” for his intricate timepieces. “That’s what he [Stoppard] is,” she continues, “a master of complications. There’s no story. It’s an idea, so one of your jobs is to translate his ideas through that person.” The writer had, she says, “a genius brain. It’s heavy stuff, but he lightens it with incredible wit.”Stoppard spent several formative years in India, but insisted: “There’s almost nothing of my experience in [the play], not even indirectly.” Kendal too grew up in India, touring with her parents’ theatre troupe (semi-fictionalised in the film Shakespeare Wallah). Indian Ink is dedicated to her mother, Laura. Her co-star also has actor parents – Lorraine Ashbourne starred in Sally Wainwright’s recent Riot Women and Andy Serkis is famed as Gollum and King Kong. “It was gorgeous being in their dressing rooms, desperately wanting my hair to be done and to be put into big old costumes,” she remembers. “Were they pleased that you were going into the business?” asks Kendal. “It was a bit of an inevitability,” replies the younger actor. And do they often share advice? “The one thing mum says every day is: ‘Just enjoy it, Rubes.’”This production is directed by Jonathan Kent: “He’s got the romance and passion of it,” Kendal says approvingly. Despite his illness, Stoppard revised the text and was “involved in the production as much as he could be”, says Hampstead theatre. During their relationship, did he ever ask Kendal to test out work-in-progress? “Absolutely not,” she says. “Never.” Although a perfect voice (husky, teasing) for his writing, she refutes the idea that she might have been an inspiration. “I don’t think that’s how it works. He wrote what he wanted.”View image in fullscreenFelicity Kendal and Nigel Hawthorne in Hapgood  at the Aldwych theatre, London, in 1988.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAs well as Stoppard, Kendal’s career encompasses new plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Michael Frayn and Simon Gray. Now 79, she has rehearsed with the best. “They’re always very easy,” she says. “They like to be there.” Ashbourne Serkis, who recently premiered David Hare’sGrace Pervadesin Bath, says Hare was “like a little boy, because he was so excited. It’s one of my favourite things, watching him laugh at his own lines.” Kendal agrees that playwrights are the best audience for their own jokes – “they love it!”Shakespeare Wallah: Merchant Ivory’s bittersweet tale of Bollywood and the BardRead moreHare’s previews were a blizzard of rewrites, says Ashbourne Serkis. Was Stoppard similar? “Tom certainly rewrites as he goes along,” says Kendal. “There would be scenes taken out. Endings would be redone.” This was nothing compared with the premiere of Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus,in which she played Constanze Mozart. “Papers were flying everywhere, until eventually Paul Scofield didthis” – a wagging finger, forbidding further tinkering.Death inevitably shadows our conversation, as it does Indian Ink. “It’s one of his more emotional plays,” says Kendal. She enjoys the way it reminds us of Stoppard’s Indian connection. “He was thought of as an English writer but he wasn’t in any manner or form. The artist isn’t owned by anybody. Flora dies, but goes on because of her writing. It’s a lovely play to be doing now – because the artist goes on.”Indian Ink is atHampstead theatre, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreTom StoppardFelicity KendalHampstead theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A 23-minute rollercoaster, it pits a blackguardly timpanist and his stick-wielding allies against a devil-may-care hornist and his brassy backup band. The horn player enters from off stage, the timpanist stalks off in a huff, and somewhere in the middle, for no immediately discernible reason, a phoenix soars aloft in an iridescent haze of tuned percussion. Pappano and the London Symphony Orchestra gave it a thorough workout with marimba, vibraphone, glockenspiel, xylophone and tubular bells creating a magical aura. The musicians certainly revelled in its prickly harmonies, though the theatrical elements might have been pushed further.Walton’s Viola Concerto was premiered in 1929 by Hindemith, no less, and something of the German composer-violist’s taste for brittle counterpoint and sardonic humour lurks beneath its lyrical charm.Antoine Tamestitwas the instinctual soloist here, his limber tone and expressive finger work casting a soulful spell over the pensive opening movement with its dramatic orchestral outbursts. The syncopated scherzo encouraged him to release his inner Puck, but it was the finale – romantic, bracing and tender by turns – that found the sensitive Frenchman at his richest and most expressive.A London Symphony, as Vaughan Williams called his second essay in symphonic form, is an affectionate portrait of the city he knew and loved: a teeming metropolis glimpsed through the mists and fogs that regularly enveloped it. While never short on drama, it was that impressionistic quality that Pappano regularly brought to the fore, drawing parallels throughout with Debussy and, perhaps more surprisingly, Respighi. The breathtaking weightlessness of the opening strings, the haunting street cries, and the bustle of the Embankment at night led inexorably to the vast, aching finale with its palpable aura of fading empire. Superbly played and incisively conducted, this was music at its most soul stirring.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Symphony OrchestraAntonio PappanoBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

The half-hourtrain journey to Cobh(“cove”), through Cork’s island-studded harbour, was especially lovely. As the railway crossed Lough Mahon, home to thousands of seabirds, there was water on both sides of the train. I watched oystercatchers, egrets, godwits and common terns, which nest on floating pontoons. Curlews foraged in the mudflats, and an old Martello tower stood on a wooded promontory.Spanning one of the world’s largest natural harbours, Cork’s bridge-linked archipelago includes 20-sq-mile Great Island at the seaward end. Here you’ll find Cobh, with its colourful terrace houses, prom-side palm trees and smell of toasting soda bread. The town was theTitanic’s last port of call before its doomed voyage. Today’s Cork is a sustainable-transport trailblazer:cycle greenwaysrun through huge reedbeds across Ballyvergan marsh and eight new railway stations are coming soon.Phoebe TaplinAffordableskiing inBulgariaView image in fullscreenBorovets was Bulgaria’s first ski resort.Photograph: Roy Conchie/Alamy“I don’t smile, I’m Bulgarian,” Yuri my ski instructor told me, “but I can make you a better skier.” By day three I had earned a “not too bad”, and my grin stretched from ear to ear.There’s plenty to smile about in Borovets, droll instructors aside: the price for a start. A half-term ski break here is far kinder on the wallet than heading to the Alps. Borovets, in the Rila mountains, was Bulgaria’s first ski resort and has 58km of well-maintained slopes bordered by forests. To keep our energy up, we ate hot flakybanitsa(stuffed pastries), sausages cooked over an open fire, and hearty bean stews.My teenage sons and I stayed at the no-frills Soviet-styleSamokov Hotel, where I loved using the 25m pool after a day on the slopes, and they loved pushing the limits of the hearty buffet evening meals.Ailsa SheldonA lakes escapein SwitzerlandView image in fullscreenLake Neuchâtel.Photograph: Imagebroker/AlamyFor a landlocked country, Switzerland is surprisingly obsessed with messing about in boats. Paddle steamers and scenic ferries are common currency on lakes Constance, Léman and Lucerne, but sailing across the unfathomably blue surfaces of lakes Biel, Neuchâtel and Murten (in theThree Lakes region,about 90 minutes by train from Geneva) this summer was a first for me. The temperatures, with the sun splitting the waters, felt Mediterranean. The late evening swims and paddleboarding did the trick too.I hopped between Neuchâtel and Le Landeron on Lake Biel, slipping through time-warp villages on the slopes of the Jura mountains. I swam in the Zihl Canal with only kingfishers and herons for company. I drank too many glasses of chasselas white wine in Ligerz, where a wonderfully pretty church sits amid the grapevines. I discovered forgotten St Peter’s Island, home to a 12th-centurymonastery hoteland where Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau once turned his back on the world. As I explored, I thought I’d like to do the same.Mike MacEacheranWatching a‘skydance’overLancashire’s wetlands, UKView image in fullscreenMartin Mere Nature Reserve.Photograph: Media World Images/AlamyMartin Mereon the west Lancashire plain, once the largest lake in England, was drained by arable-avaricious lords. Mercifully, they didn’t empty it completely and the wetlands, managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, is now a precious habitat for waders and reed-loving birds. In autumn, more than 45,000 pink-footed geese roost here.Like many who grew up in the north-west, I bypassed Martin Mere every summer, bound for Southport. Leisure time meant beach, fairs and shopping. Perhaps the area’s industrial heritage encouraged the notion that land was for turning into houses, roads and workplaces. It’s only since returning to live in the county five years ago that I have re-educated myself about its natural assets.Earlier this year, I was lucky enough to see ring ouzels, peregrines, a merlin and, greatest prize of all, hen harriers – famed for their “skydancing” and victimisation by grouse rearers – in theForest of Bowland national landscape.Season by season, Lancashire becomes something other than a place framed by the past. Growing up, I wondered at all the contrails; I’ll grow old gazing at the kinder, quieter patterns of nature’s aviators.Chris MossA country house in the middle of MilanView image in fullscreenVilla Necchi Campiglio.Photograph: Stefanos Kyriazis/AlamySummers in Milan are, inevitably, very often hot, humid affairs. Like many Italian cities, its residents are likely to head for the sea and countryside as the temperatures rise. However, the Necchi Campiglios, a wealthy family who made their fortune manufacturing sewing machines, chose to build their perfect country house in the middle of the city.Designed in the 1930s by Piero Portaluppi,Villa Necchi Campigliostill stands like a mirage in Italy’s second largest city, set in lush gardens with a swimming pool – a perfect little oasis to escape the heat yet on a very ordinary street. There’s much to admire inside, with chic furniture and fittings, wood panelling and marble floors, and an impressive art collection. It’s hard to imagine a nicer place to cool off as the heat of the city intensifies than the veranda overlooking the garden.Max BenatoWalking in Kosovo’s mountainsView image in fullscreenThe Accursed Mountains.Photograph: Gryf/AlamyHistory books provide crucial context for hiking in Kosovo, but don’t prepare you for the beauty of the mountains. Ispent a weekon the recently remappedVia Dinarica Kosovoin the summer. We hiked past edelweiss flowers on the border ridge with Montenegro; craggy and sheer on one side and vibrant green on the other, sloping down to pink and yellow wildflower meadows.Choughs flew around high rocky outcrops, while brightly coloured bee-eaters perched on branches lower down. Wildlife lost to much of Europe still thrives here (bears, wolves, lynx) in a mosaic of oak and beech trees, blueberries and shrubs, deep valleys and high plateaux. Mountain lakes make for dreamy swim spots beneath the high peaks near Albania.We stayed in secluded huts with mountain backdrops, wherebörek(savoury pastries) were devoured in the evenings and washed down withrakia– a homemade fruity spirit varying wildly in quality and strength.Stuart KennyA peaceful villagein ProvenceView image in fullscreenSouth Park Lodges in Cotignac.Wiggling across France in a car groaning with kids and camping gear has become a summer tradition. This year, on our way to the Gorges du Verdon, we detoured via Cotignac and landed upon the very specialSouth Park Lodges. Owners Stan and Wendy Kluba have spent five years restoring three wild hectares just outside the village, which are now home to two bell tents on hillside terraces among the pines (sleeps four, from £160 a night).Everything has been so thoughtfully put together: a handbuilt kitchen under the shade of a canvas sail, an outdoor shower soundtracked by cicadas. Days were slow: walking to buy pastries atLou Gourmandises, long lunches atLe Bistrot de Lou Calen, climbing the steep steps to explore old cave houses in the limestone cliffs above the village. But mostly the kids loved the pool and the Shetland ponies (Scotchy and Whisky), and I fell for the deep sense of peace.Fiona KerrGoing off the beaten track inAlbaniaView image in fullscreenA swimming spot in Albania.Photograph: Holly TuppenThe first stop on afamily hiking holiday in Albaniathis summer made a lasting impression and proved that stepping off the beaten track often brings the greatest rewards. We spent two nights inBujtina Lëpushë, a guesthouse surrounded by orchards, beehives and small farms that peter out towards the Accursed Mountains – a towering amphitheatre. Arriving at dusk, the kids (10 and 12) played with kittens on our cabin’s porch while we chatted to the owner about life in Lëpushë. Migration abroad or to cities is a problem (the local school has only one pupil), and tourism is a lifeline for anyone left behind.Luckily, Lëpushë has a lot going for it. On the first day, we jumped off rocks into a brilliant-blue swimming spot and gorged on homemade cheese and bread at a shepherd’sstan(summer encampment). On the second, we hiked to the top of Maja e Nagvacit (2,412m) on near-deserted trails, scoffing wild blueberries along the way. Despite all this, Lëpushë receives a fraction of the visitors that nearby Theth and Vusanje welcome, because it isn’t on the popularPeaks of the Balkans hiking route.Holly TuppenAluckydiscovery onSpain’s Costa TropicalView image in fullscreenCalahonda in Andalucía.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenA long smile of a beach braced with blocky hotels at the edge of a snowdrift of white plastic-covered greenhouses – we had no expectations of Calahonda, in Andalucía. We stopped in this former fishing village near Motril, not to be confused with the much bigger Sitio de Calahonda further west, for no other reason than it seemed the least built-up place to break a journey along Spain’s Costa Tropical.Finding a room at theHotel Embarcadero, we photographed the shoal of tiny boats bobbing beneath the town’s headland, swam in leagues of deep, Kool-Aid-blue water, ate fatboquerones(fried anchovies) at a simplechiringuito(beach bar), and watched elderly Spanish couples stroll languidly to dinners that were just starting as we went to bed. Back on the road the next morning, our swimsuits drying on the back seat, we agreed that sometimes the best travel plan is to have none.Rhiannon BattenUntouched islands in FinlandView image in fullscreenLake Saimaa.Photograph: ShinyHappy74/Getty ImagesThe most spectacular sunset I’ve seen this year? Whizzing back across the iridescent waters of Finland’s Lake Saimaa on a chilly afternoon in late September, as the liquefying sun and white feathers of wispy cloud interrupted vivid blue skies.We’d gone out from our base, the Järvisydän resort, to see the most endangered seal in the world – just 530 ringed seals are estimated to live in the lake. They were shy on the afternoon we were out, their basking rocks empty, but it couldn’t have mattered less; we stopped at one island to pick chanterelle mushrooms and blueberries, and at another to follow a hiking path up to a viewpoint that looked out over dozens of untouched islets, thick with pine forest and fringed with silver-grey rocks. In winter, when the lake freezes, there are 38 miles of ice-skating trails. I can’t wait to go back.Annabelle ThorpeA night in Italy’s smallest townView image in fullscreenAtrani on the Amalfi Coast.Photograph: Veronika Pfeiffer/AlamyWe took each bend carefully as we descended Monte Aureo. On the final turn, Atrani appeared through a tunnel in the rock, its bridge lit up against an October night sky and its houses cascading down the cliffs towards the Tyrrhenian Sea. Roberto, our driver, said we were entering the smallest town in Italy – and the most beautiful.The entrance to our hotel lay hidden beneath the bridge, a narrow opening leading to a maze of whitewashed steps twisting between old walls. We awoke to the sound of bells from Santa Maria Maddalena and stepped on to the balcony, where tiled roofs tapered up the cliffside and, below, the sea moved softly against the beach. A cock crowed and a single car crossed the bridge.After breakfast, we took another tunnel, this one longer. On the far side was Amalfi, its port lively and bright, as if we had slipped through a portal and returned to another age entirely.Vic O’SullivanTasty fish in Tynemouth, UKView image in fullscreenSeafood from Riley’s Fish Shack.A handful of surfers rode the waves of the North Sea beneath a brilliant blue sky. But instead of swimsuits we were wrapped in wool jackets on this brisk January day.Three generations of my family had come to the one-of-a-kindRiley’s Fish Shackset beneath Tynemouth’s green cliffs and the ruins of apriory and castle. We were lured by the shipping container’s chimney – a lighthouse-like beacon of smoke. Brave diners sat on the patio and on deck chairs in the sand, bundled up in blankets. We had reserved a wooden table in the cosy interior, warmed by the wood-fired grill.I had expected fish and chips. Instead, we devoured enormous fish empanadas loaded with salsa verde; squid ragu topped with parsley mayo; roast turbot chop bathed in ancho-chilli butter, with caperberry and cucumber salad; and irresistible fresh sourdough – all sustainably served in wooden boxes with disposable wooden cutlery.I dream of returning despite living about 1,000 miles away in Marseille. Thankfully, my cousin lives in nearby Newcastle, so I have an excuse to return.Alexis SteinmanAn unsung Northern Irish cityView image in fullscreenNewry town hall straddles a river.Photograph: Stephen Barnes/AlamyMy latest book,Sh*tty Breaks, champions unfashionable cities and makes the case that anywhere can be enjoyable if given half the chance. The Northern Irish city of Newry is known for its shopping, being in the thick of the Troubles and former goalkeeper Pat Jennings. It’s not known for the quality of itsmuseum, the friendliness of its people, or the staggering beauty of its countryside – but it should be.Thetown hall straddles a riverand is a sight for sore eyes; a bakery calledThe Cake Grannysits alongside a number of excellent cafes –Measured,Finegan & Son,Nine Squared. TheBridge Barwill see you through to midnight. TheCanal Court hotelis a decent accommodation option in the centre, whileBalance Treehouseis a rural alternative with a stargazing hammock and a hot tub.Ben AitkenThe perfect Parisian bistroView image in fullscreenBistro des LivresI’m perpetually on the hunt for the best bistro in Paris and, on a spring trip this year, I think I found it. Following a cobbled backstreet en route to the inimitableShakespeare and Companybookshop, I came upon the blue awning of a cosy restaurant namedBistro des Livres. It resembled a sunlit wine cellar, with pale stone walls, black marble-topped tables and books everywhere: patterned, leatherbound books with yellow pages piled in the window.The menu featuredvin à la ficelle– wine “by the string”, measured and charged by what you drink – along with a concise and no-nonsense list of five mains, plus a tomahawk steak, aubrac rib and veal chop for the carnivorous. Grilled bone marrow was sizzling on arrival, rock salt sparkling on its surface like diamond dust. My confit de canard was a crisp leg which fell apart into dark gleaming chunks, steam piping off the bone. But it was the chocolate pudding that brought me back for my second and third visits. Arriving at my side – lugging a casserole dish of whipped dark mousse – the waiter ladled a mountain in to my bowl; rich, smooth, and enough for four diners. When the bill came, the waiter gave my well-consumed Côtes du Rhône a cursory glance and barely charged me €10 for drinks. The meal itself came to €35. Oddly, it was quiet, so I still like to think I’ve stumbled upon a spot of magic on the Left Bank.Monisha RajeshA memorable meal off MullView image in fullscreenThe Boathouse restaurant on Ulva off Mull.Photograph: Matt Limb/AlamyTo summon the ferry for Ulva – a small, community-owned island off Mull – you flick the wooden board above the slipway from white to red and Rhuri, the boatman, will chug across the narrow strait to fetch you. Unless it’s a Saturday, his day off. It was a sunny Sunday in summer when I headed over for lunch at theBoathouse, the waterfront restaurant everyone was talking about after its takeover by Banjo Beale ofDesigning the Hebrides, his husband and cheesemaker Ro, and farmer, baker and charcuterie-maker Sam this year.I was early, so followed one of the island’s impossibly pretty walking trails, skirting round the coast, through ancient woodland, past a cluster of old stone barns and the Thomas Telford-designed church, before circling back for a pile of langoustines, apple-sour salad and warm brioche at a picnic table beside the sea, dogs splashing in the shallows, children skimming stones, families chatting on the rocks – wonderfully old-school and unspoilt.Lucy GillmoreTreasurehuntingin Prague’sflea marketA waiter, recalling his grandmother’s dumplings and her kitchen’s “terrible” decor, alerted me to the existence of theu Elektryflea market. “She had the kind of stuff everyone throws out at u Elektry; nobody wants reminders of being poor under communism,” he said with a shrug.It’s located in Prague 9, and getting there requires a lengthy-ish tram ride. The market is open 6am-2pm every Saturday and Sunday, and when I arrived mid-morning, people were already leaving, laden with items I was certain I wanted. A fee of 30 koruna (about £1) is payable at the entrance, where there are also food stalls and – because you never know – an ATM.Hundreds of vendors had their wares – ceramics, linens, brass and mirrors, signed and framed oil paintings, nude photographs, you name it – set out over a seemingly interminable area. I had to squat, sift and search, but my heart and hands were full by the end – and low prices and cheerfully haggling locals meant my wallet wasn’t much depleted, either.Sarah RodriguesDramatic scenery and saunason the Fife coastal path, ScotlandView image in fullscreenOne of the saunas on the Fife coastal path.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyIt’s always good to meet an old friend, even better when unexpected. There I was, strolling through the Scottish coastal village of Lower Largo, when I spottedRobinson Crusoe. I hadn’t thought about him for a while, but there he was, or at least his real-life inspiration,Alexander Selkirk. A statue of the man stands on the site of the cottage where he was born in 1676.The joy of theFife coastal pathis like that. Unexpected pleasures abound amid picturesque villages, dramatic scenery and beaches. The 117-mile route starts in Kincardine with a few miles of post-industrial landscape that soon gives way to a more bucolic coast. Villages such as Anstruther, Crail and St Monans hold plenty of historical interest, fine old harbours, plus a few great food outlets (try theBowhouseand theCocoa Tree). TheElie chain walkat Kincraig Point is a particularly good section if you enjoy scrambling.North of Cellardyke, watch forTide Line, an art installation byJulie Brook. Apart from Crusoe, however, the real discovery was thesaunasthat are being installed along Fife’s many beaches.Kevin RushbyAn art trail in a picture-perfecttown in Puglia, ItalyView image in fullscreenMonopolio in Puglia.Photograph: AGF/AlamyIt’s less than half an hour by train along the Adriatic coast from Bari to Monopoli, a historic town with a pretty harbour, winding alleys, a 16th-century castle and an impressive cathedral. While nearbyPolignano a Mare– Insta-famous for its dramatic cliffs – felt busy, Monopoli had a laid-back vibe and a string of uncrowded beaches where local families were picnicking.It’s worth a visit any time of year, but mine coincided with thePhEST international festival of photography and art, which uses the town and its buildings as a backdrop. Every year it runs for four months, from August to November, with a packed programme of photography, screenings, music, guided tours and talks.We followed an artwork trail around town, some outdoors, some inside churches and the castle. We loved theMartin Parrworks – some seen by looking through telescopes out to sea – and Gregg Segal’s thought-provokingimageshighlighting over-consumption, with people photographed lying in the rubbish they generated in a single week.Jane DunfordFinally finding paradise–in PembrokeshireView image in fullscreenThe cathedral in Saint Davids.Photograph: Sonja Ooms/Getty Images/iStockphotoGrowing up, we always went south for holidays – to Dorset, or Brittany, or as far as my dad could put up with driving three children in summer without aircon. Wales never even made the shortlist. When I finally discoveredPembrokeshirein June this year, and saw how incredibly beautiful it was, I felt irrationally cross that its charms had been kept from me for so long. “Oh yes,” my parents said airily when I complained, “St Davids is lovely, isn’t it? Great cathedral.”Not only was the cathedral indeed stunning, with an excellent, dog-friendly cafe to boot, but the countryside around it was even better, and the coastline … well, the coastline took my breath away, literally, when I tried to run it one morning after overindulging in fish, chips and gelato. Rocky cliffs, green water, wide sandy beaches and little whitewashed pubs where the locals have their own tables – why had no one told me paradise lies at the end of the A40?Felicity CloakeCroatia without the crowdsView image in fullscreenThe Greeting to the Sun installation.Photograph: Imago/AlamyWith Dubrovnik hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons this year, I was wary of contributing to overtourism. But the lure of the Med on a budget took me on a four-day break with my four-year-old to Zadar.What I discovered was a Croatia without the crowds, a pretty walled city and lots of kid-friendly (and free) things to do. Without spending a bean, we explored the Old Town – wandering along the city walls, enjoying theSea Organ– an experimental musical instrument on the front that plays notes as the waves move in and out of its underwater pipes – and dancing at sunset on theGreeting to the Suninstallation, a 22-metre wide circle of solar panels that harness energy during the daytime, then, when night falls, create an environmentally friendly light show that keeps kids of all ages entertained.For just a few euros, we took a ferry over to Ugljan Island, where we swam in the sea at Preko and climbed to the summit of the fort, parts of which date back to the sixth century, for views over to Italy. Then, before we left, we ventured toVrana Lake nature parkto kayak amid some of the 260 species of birds that call the place home. A perfect break for a family.Phoebe SmithSeafood under the pines, FranceView image in fullscreenCooking éclade de moules.Photograph: Isabel ChoatThe village ofMornac-sur-Seudrein the Charente-Maritime is famous for the oysters that are cultivated in the surrounding marshes, but the dish that caught our attention waséclade de moules– mussels cooked under pine needles. We ordered ours atLe Parc des Graves, where we sat on a terrace overlooking the water. Theécladeis prepared on the road outside – at a safe distance from diners. First, the mussels are arranged on a wooden platter in concentric circles, then they are covered in dry pine needles which are set on fire. The result is an ashy platter of shells that looks more like a sculpture than something edible. But the mussels are surprisingly tasty – smoky and sweet. Virtually every table was tucking into them during our visit – including small children, their faces streaked with ash. We ordered oysters too, and plates of crevettes and langoustines – but theécladestole the show. Once we’d had our fill, we wandered up Rue du Port, past pretty blue-and-white houses, to Saint-Pierre church, known for its giant shell font, a reminder that on this coastline, shellfish are treated with near religious reverence.Isabel ChoatInnocent fun on a Swedish islandView image in fullscreenA fishing hut on South Koster island.Photograph: Mauro Toccaceli/AlamyAs the ferry docked at South Koster, an island off Sweden’s south-west coast about 100 miles north of Gothenburg, it seemed I’d arrived inside a Famous Five novel. Life for the next few days was all carefree cycling down quiet lanes (cars are prohibited), splashing about in the clearest seas (where cold-water coral thrives), kayaking between the smooth granite skerries ofKosterhavet national park, and hauling up on empty beaches to picnic on (lashings of) coffee and hunks of banana bread.The only thing missing was a Blyton-esque mystery to solve – though something was flummoxing me: where were all the people? Coastal Sweden has a curious tourism season. For five weeks in July and early August the place is heaving. Outside of that? Bliss. It was early September: the sky was blue, the berries bright, the water brisk but deliciously swimmable. With the summer crowds gone, it was like discovering my very own Treasure Island.Sarah BaxterStep back in time in a boutique hotel inLatviaView image in fullscreenKukšu Manor hotelI discovered a beautiful 10-bedroom boutique hotel while travelling in the tranquil, lushly green region of Kurzeme in Latvia. Restored by German chef and hotelier Daniel Jahn,Kukšu Manorhas spectacular interiors and a wonderful lakeside location – cranes fly overhead, storks perch on chimney-top nests, nightingales warble. But it isn’t on any booking sites so it remains something of a secret.Every door, wall and architrave is delicately painted with 18th-century frescoes, stencils and murals. Every piece of cornicing is intricately carved. Beneath lavishly painted ceilings (my favourite was ultramarine blue scattered with golden flowers), each room is an extravagant curation of antique finery. But there’s nothing formal here: Jahn and his two labradors greet visitors like old friends.This is a place where you can step back in time and imagine yourself as aBaltic baron. And the breakfasts are to die for: garden berries, homemade jams, marinated vegetables, forest mushrooms, local fish and meat, freshly baked bread and pancakes. All for the price of a very average British B&B.Annabel AbbsWales’s answer to Land’s EndView image in fullscreenAndy Pietrasik on the Llŷn peninsula in WalesThe long slender finger of the Llŷn peninsula had been beckoning me for years, but I only made it to this area of outstanding natural beauty in north Wales this year. It was love at first sight.It probably helped that my initial encounter was with the head-turningTŷ Coch Inn, set in a stunning little cove near Nefyn. But over the course of a few days’ walking and camping along theWales Coast Path, there were so many other beguiling moments: the sweeping curve of Whistling Sands beach; the pod of seals lolling in a secluded bay that mimicked the outline of Wales; the kestrel hovering above a promontory; the musical lilt of people speaking Welsh.But perhaps the standout moment was arriving, after a long day’s ramble, in the picturesque fishing village of Aberdaron at the tip of the peninsula, and settling in for a couple of pints in the sunshine outside theShip Hotel. This was followed by crab cakes, chips and mushy peas at the Sblash fish bar around the corner. Perfect.Andy PietrasikMeeting theresident cat in Norwich CathedralView image in fullscreenBudge the cathedral cat.Photograph: Bill SmithI am fond of cats. I am keen on churches. Better yet are churches with resident cats. How delightful then, on a recent visit to Norwich Cathedral, to encounter Budge. He was seated on a pew, eyes as green as The New English Hymnal, a small creature in that great ancient space.I hadn’t meant to visit, but found myself with an hour to spare. Long enough to stroll from the bright copper font to first world war heroineEdith Cavell’s grave. Time, too, for a circuit of the cloister, sun slanting through the tracery and making the flagstones gleam.Budge, though, was the highlight, and I learned his story. As a young cat, he roamed the pubs, but has long since left that roguish life behind. “He’s found God,” I was told. “He’s found a place he feels at home.” His day begins with morning prayer and ends with evensong. He makes a wonderful place even more wonderful. He let me stroke his back then padded off up the nave.Peter RossExplore more on these topicsTravelEurope holidaysCity breaksSkiing holidaysWalking holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I tend usually not to recommend no-churn ice-creams unless there is booze involved, so this sherry and raisin one is a great candidate (the alcohol stops the ice-cream from becoming too hard and crystallised). And keep the leftover egg whites from the mince pies to make the chestnut and pear meringue, an alternative for theChristmaspudding haters at your table – there is always one. I think it’s important to have at least two puddings at Christmas.Chestnut and pear meringues (pictured top)This is a great make-ahead pudding, because the meringues can be made up to a month in advance and the pears and chocolate sauce five days before. Once assembled, you can keep it in the fridge for a few hours before serving.Prep10 minCoolOvernightCook1 hr 15 minServes8For the meringues100gegg whites(from about 3 eggs)100gsoft light brownsugar100gcastersugarFor the pears4 pears125glight brown soft sugar2tbsp brandy½tsp ground ginger1 cinnamon stick4 strips of lemon zest2tsp vanilla bean pasteFor the chocolate sauce45gcastersugar5gcocoapowder100gchocolate of your choice(54% cocoa solids or above if you prefer it darker), choppedTo serve250g doublecream1tsp vanilla bean paste240g sweetened chestnut purée from a tin(Clément Faugier is my favourite)50gcooked chestnuts, crumbledEdible gold leaf(optional, but recommended)Start by making the meringues (you will need to do this at least the day before you want to serve them). Heat the oven to 120C (110C fan)/250F/gas low and line a large oven tray with baking paper.Whisk the egg whites on high in the bowl of a stand mixer to stiff peaks. Mix the sugars in a second bowl, then, with the mixer running, spoon into the egg whites a dessertspoonful at a time, making sure each one is fully incorporated before adding the next. Once the meringue is nice and glossy, check that the sugar has fully dissolved by rubbing a bit of the meringue between two fingers: if it feels grainy, continue mixing. If not, it’s ready to go.Spoon the meringue into eight mounds on the lined tray, use the back of the spoon to flatten them a little into rounds, then make a swirl on the top. Bake for 30–35 minutes, then turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside overnight. You can then store them in an airtight container for up to a month.Next, poach the pears. Peel and halve each pear, then use a teaspoon to remove the cores and any stringy stems. Put the pears in a saucepan for which you have a lid and that’s large enough so they fit snugly inside. Add water (about 500g) just to cover, then add all the remaining pear ingredients and put the pan on a low heat. Simmer for 20–25 minutes, until the fruit is soft but still holding its shape, then take off the heat and leave to cool in the syrup. The pears can then be decanted into an airtight container and stored in the fridge for up to five days.For the chocolate sauce, mix 100g water, sugar and cocoa in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Simmer for a few minutes, until the sugar dissolves, then take off the heat and stir in the chocolate until it melts and you have a smooth, glossy sauce. This sauce can now be stored in the fridge for up to five days.To assemble, bring the chocolate sauce up to room temperature. Whip the cream and vanilla bean paste to soft peaks. Spoon 30g of the chestnut puree over each meringue and spread it out to the edges. Spoon on a tablespoon of the chocolate sauce and let it drip down the sides a little. Dollop a generous tablespoon of whipped cream on top of the chocolate.Put half a poached pear on top of the cream and press it down gently. Finish with a crumble of cooked chestnuts and a little gold leaf, if using, then store in the fridge for up to three hours before serving.Sherry and raisin ice-creamView image in fullscreenFlora Shedden’s sherry and raisin ice-cream.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian. Food and prop styling: Florence Blair. Food styling assistant: Emma Cantlay.Mum made a very decadent version of this last Hogmanay, and it was so perfect I vowed to recreate it. The recipe was taken out of a magazine and I think the cutting was soon lost in the new year, so I have had to improvise. When testing, my dad, a keen rum-and-raisin fan, declared that this was actually very good. Which, if you know my dad, is the highest of praise.Prep15 minSoak2 hr+Freeze6 hr+Makes2 litres225graisins150g sherry(I like to use a fino or very dry one), plus extra to serveFinely grated zest of ½ orange½ nutmeg,finely grated600gdoublecream397gtincondensed milk2tsp vanilla bean pasteAmaretti, to serveA few hours before making the ice-cream, and ideally the night before, soak the raisins. Put them in a small airtight container, cover with the sherry and add the orange zest and nutmeg. Stir to combine, then seal and leave the raisins to absorb the sherry; don’t worry, there will still be some liquid left.To make the ice-cream, mix the cream, condensed milk and vanilla bean paste in a large bowl. Whisk with a hand mixer until the mix thickens to soft peaks, then fold in the soaked raisins and any remaining sherry, and mix until well combined. Spoon into a 2kg airtight container, seal and freeze for at least six hours.Serve with amaretti biscuits crushed on top and/or a drizzle more sherry, if you fancy.Fig and hazelnut crumble mince piesView image in fullscreenFlora Shedden’s fig and hazelnut crumble mince pies.This makes 12 mince pies, but I always recommend doubling this up as 12 never seem to last long enough in our house.Prep10 minChill30 minCook50 min, plus coolingMakes12For the pastry125gbutter100gicingsugar, plus extra to serve250gplainflour, plus extra for dusting2 egg yolksFor the filling110gdried figs, stalks removed, flesh chopped400gmincemeat30gbrandyFor the crumble75ghazelnuts, roughly chopped50goats25gsoft light brownsugar25gbutterTo serveBrown sugar brandy butter, or clotted creamFirst, make the pastry. Put all the ingredients apart from the egg yolks in a food processor and blitz on high speed until the mixture hasa crumble-like consistency (alternatively, do this by hand, working the butter into the flour and sugar until you have a sand-like texture). Stop the machine, scrape down the sides and blitz again, stopping when the mixture just starts to come together into a dough.Add the egg yolks, then work gently to bring the dough together.Flatten the dough into a rough circle about 2cm thick. This helps chill the dough faster and makes it easier to roll out. Wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (and for up to three days).For the filling, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.When you’re ready to bake, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Take the pastry out of the fridge and leave tit o come to room temperature for 15 minutes.Lightly dust a work surface with flour, then roll out the dough to 2–3mm thick. Use a 10cm pastry cutter to cut out 12 discs, re-rolling any scraps as needed. Lightly flour a 12-hole muffin tin and press a disc into each hole, using your fingers to get it into the corners. Trim off any excess pastry and put in a bowl with any pastry offcuts you have from rolling.To make the crumble, add the chopped hazelnuts, oats, sugar and butter to the pastry offcuts, then mix with your hands until you have a chunky crumble.Divide the mincemeat filling between the tart cases, then spoon the crumble on top. Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the crumble is golden brown and the pastry is cooked through. Remove and leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then lift out gently with a fine knife and transfer to a rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, generously dusted with icing sugar and a good dollop of brandy butter or clotted cream. The pies will keep in an airtight container for up to two weeks.These recipes are edited extracts from Winter in the Highlands, by Flora Shedden, published by Quadrille at £26.

Truffles may come in endless variations, but at their core, they are simply chocolate and cream, which makes the quality of both non-negotiable.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A good dark chocolate, about 60-70% cocoa, brings complexity and depth without bitterness, while the right cream-to-chocolate ratio creates a ganache that’s smooth, rich and just soft enough to dissolve in the mouth. Any further additions such as salt, liqueur, citrus, coffee or spices should never be dominant. And, whatever the finish, be it cocoa powder, toasted nuts, coconut or a glossy shell, it should complement rather than compete with the chocolate ganache inside.The best supermarket chocolate trufflesBestoverall/best bargain:M&S Swiss truffle assortmentView image in fullscreen£12.50 for 665g at Ocado (£1.88/100g)★★★★☆A slightly thick shell, but decent chocolate and a good selection of milk, hazelnut, blond and dark. At £12.50 a box, these seem on the expensive side, but there is a generous number of truffles in here, so these are, in fact, the best value of the whole test group.And the rest …Monty Bojangles signature choccy scoffy chocolatey trufflesView image in fullscreen£4.50 for 135g at Tesco (£3.33/100g)£4.50 for 135g at Sainsbury’s (£3.33/100g)★★★★☆Not exactly bean-to-bar couverture chocolate, but these have a good cocoa flavour, all dark and dusty, that’s balanced by also being smooth and sweet.Tesco Finest salted caramel trufflesView image in fullscreen£5 for 140g at Tesco (£3.57/100g)★★★☆☆The chocolate’s decent and the salted caramel filling is nicely balanced.

It might be too lofty to say that this semifreddo is divine, but the combination of Hobnobs, ricotta, chocolate and amaretto really does it for me. That said, there are many alliances that can be formed in theChristmasstore-cupboard, so use this as a base for any biscuits, dried fruit and chocolate to which you feel most spiritually aligned.Christmas ricotta semifreddoYou’ll need a large loaf tin, baking tin or tub with an approximately 1.8 litre capacity that’s suitable for the freezer (or two smaller tins). Semifreddo melts quicker than ice-cream, so be sure not to leave it out for too long before or after serving (if there’s any left, that is).Prep10 minCook30 minFreeze6 hr+Soften15 minServes83 medium eggs75g runny honey, plus extra to drizzle75g caster sugar250g ricotta400ml double cream2 tsp ground cardamom75ml amaretto(5 tbsp)¼ tsp fine sea salt60g stem ginger in syrup, cut into irregular 2mm-thick slices60g dark chocolate, very finely chopped, plus extra to decorate100g Hobnobs, or ginger snap biscuits, finely chopped, plus extra to decorate30g mixed chopped candied citrus peelLine your tin or tub with baking paper. Separate the egg yolks and whites into two large bowls, then whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks. Shake off the beaters (but don’t wash them).Put the honey and sugar in the egg yolk bowl, whisk until pale and creamy, then add the ricotta and whisk to combine. Again, shake off the beaters but don’t rinse them.Fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture a bit at a time – and gently, so as not to whack out any air. Rinse out the egg white bowl, add the double cream and whip to soft peaks.Add the cardamom, amaretto and salt to the whipped cream, then whisk to soft peaks. Fold the cream into the egg and ricotta mixture, then gently fold in the chopped ginger, chocolate, biscuits and mixed peel.Transfer the mixture to the lined tub or tin, smooth out the top with the back of a spoon, then cover the top with a sheet of baking paper. Freeze for at least six hours, until solid.Take the semifreddo out of the freezer 15 minutes before serving. Put a couple of biscuits in a mortar, then crush to a fine-ish crumb (or bash with a rolling pin on a board). Peel the top layer of baking paper off the semifreddo, then invert it on to a platter. Carefully peel off the second sheet of paper, then evenly sprinkle the crushed biscuits over the semifreddo. Grate on the extra chocolate, drizzle with more honey, then cut into slices and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodMeera Sodha recipesDessertIce-cream and sorbetChristmas food and drinkChristmasCheeseItalian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
