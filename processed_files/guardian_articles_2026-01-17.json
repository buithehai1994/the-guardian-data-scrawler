Some of my friends have spoken to their families – it seems that they can call from Iran, but we can’t call into Iran.To her relief, her mother was able to phone her on Tuesday to speak, but only “for a few seconds” as it is so expensive to call.“My heart was in my mouth when she called, I thought I was going to throw up,” says Roya, 27, who has lived in Switzerland since 2017 and works in marketing. “She sounded like she hadn’t slept in days. She sounded exhausted and sad. I was just able to check that they were OK and my brother was OK.“It was such a relief, I could hear the dog barking in the background, but it also made me hungry for more time to speak to my family.”Roya said she had been in touch with some of her friends who left Iran on Monday night to travel to Turkey.View image in fullscreenUsual communication to the outside world was not working after the internet blackout.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty Images“They called us from Turkey and said the number of dead is way higher than the news is making it out to be,” she says. “However, they said that the people are hopeful, they’re strong, they’re angry.”She is concerned about what the future holds for Iran.“I worry about what comes after because I know the voices of the monarchists are really, really loud,” she says. “They want the ‘prince’ [Reza Pahlavi] to return, but it is not a view that I, or a lot of people, share. Many people say we do not want a recycled monarchy. What is this guy going to do? He has barely lived in Iran. What does he understand about the people and how the country is run?“The people calling for intervention by foreign powers are also loud, but that doesn’t mean that is what most people want.

I am sick and tired of all these politicians sitting in their very comfortable spots in their private jets and giving opinions on what other countries should be doing.“I am hopeful that the government is going to fall, I just don’t know when. The lucky thing for the monarchists is that they have a figure whose name they can yell. The problem with the opposition is we don’t really have any one figure to rally behind.“Who is going to come into power, and what is going to happen if there is going to be a war? These things are at the forefront of our minds because, in addition to being worried about the physical safety of our family and our friends, there is also the question of: what’s going to come after?Roya* 27,Switzerland‘The change needed will probably take a generation’Reza, a teacher in the UK whose parents are in Iran, is not hopeful that any regime change will have much effect in the immediate term.“My wife had a very brief conversation with her family to check that they are OK,” he says. “Generally and understandably, people are a bit afraid to go out. My family are not in the capital, and the protests in our city have certainly died down.“The general, ordinary person, and that would be our family, just won’t go out. They don’t want to be caught in some sort of crossfire. I am not worried about my parents; the only worry would be if they needed the hospital, as the staffing has been much reduced, so services are stretched.”View image in fullscreenRug vendors tend a stall at a weekly Friday market in Tehran on Friday.Photograph: Getty ImagesReza, who was born in the UK to Iranian parents, would normally visit Iran two or three times a year. His last visit was in June. He is not optimistic about a solution to the current crisis.“It is a cultural problem, not a political one,” he says. “We must rid Iran of corruption. Too many countries are sticking their noses in where they’re not welcome, which won’t bring the change that we need. Throughout history, only Iranians have changed Iran, no one else.“As for the idea of Trump intervening: Iran is not Venezuela – it is a huge country, with vastly diverse ethnic backgrounds, political views and religious views – it is way too diverse to do that. Trump has this idea that he can point the finger and intervene, but it just won’t work. It is not logistically possible.“It’s a change that will probably take a generation, and I don’t see any one person who can do that.”Reza*,UK‘We want President Trump to help us urgently’Rose, who is from Iran but has been living abroad for 10 years and is a student living in the UK, wants intervention from the US.Iran plans permanent break from global internet, say activistsRead more“The situation has been emotionally devastating and deeply distressing,” she says. “Due to widespread internet and communication blackouts, I have lost contact with family and friends inside Iran. Not knowing whether loved ones are safe, detained, injured, or alive creates constant fear and anxiety.“The world also will never know the exact number of innocent people getting killed right now.

I do believe Trump’s involvement would be bad for both the future of democracy and the stability of Iran and the region.”Hana says she had been trying to contact her family, who live in northern Tehran, since lastThursday, when she “suddenly lost connection” with them. However, on Tuesday morning, she received a very brief phone call from her mother.“I had been so stressed as I didn’t know if they were safe, then I saw the call from my mother, and I was so relieved to speak to her and know that my family is safe that I burst into tears,” she says.View image in fullscreenPro-government demonstrators rally at Enghelab Square in central Tehran in support of the regime.Photograph: Iranian Presidency/Zum Press Wire/ShutterstockHana does not believe a regime change in Iran is the answer.“The current situation in Iran is heartbreaking,” she says. “I am strongly against regime change in Iran, not because I support the current structure of the government, but mainly because I don’t see a viable alternative to this regime at the moment.“I understand that people are frustrated and have lost their hope and trust in the system.

Now 96, push-ups, kettlebell squats and pushing a weight-loaded sledge keep her strongKate LloydSat 17 Jan 2026 11.00 ESTShareI see people 30 years younger than me and they’ve given up,” Jean Stewart, 96, says. It’s not an attitude she relates to. “I like to do things for myself.”Stewart was very active in her youth: she played hockey and softball at school and worked for the Girl Scouts for years. As she got older, however, everyday tasks became harder.“I got to the point where I didn’t have the strength to prune my roses,” she says.Becoming frailer was frustrating. Worse, she was tired of being treated as incapable by those around her. Aged 81, she read about a local CrossFit gym and went along to ask for help – it was the start of what would become 15 years of on-and-off training with its owner, Cheryl Cohen. Back then, Stewart was her only client older than 60. Today, she specialises in classes for older adults, helping them stay independent.Stewart was nervous and excited during her first session. Training focused on movements that would support her day to-day life, including getting up and down from the ground, and walking while carrying 4kg kettlebells. Each session, the weights increased gradually.Soon, she was doing full-body press‑ups, keeping pace with women 10 years younger. She could hold a plank long enough for another member of the senior group to tell a two-minute story. By 83, she could deadlift 70kg. “I couldn’t believe it,” she says. “I thought it was light.”View image in fullscreenStewart, 96 at the Desert Fitness Collective in Palm Springs.Photograph: Nolwen Cifuentes/The GuardianAs she reached 90, her progress was interrupted by a bout of MRSA and “a serious car accident – I was almost demolished”. Stewart lost feeling in her feet and lower legs, and spent two months in rehabilitation. Soon after, she fell again while walking her dog: “Her leash got twisted in my legs.” At 91, she required surgery for a broken hip. “I continued with exercise and got the strength back,” Stewart says. What kept her going? “I’m stubborn.”These days, she can’t deadlift due to spinal stenosis, but still trains twice a week. Her sessions include elevated push-ups, kettlebell squats and pushing a weight-loaded sledge. “The older I get, the more I tell myself I’ve got to keep going,” Stewart says. Cohen recalls a story of her carrying a heavy pail of cat litter at the store. “They say, ‘Ma’am, would you like help with this?’ And she goes, ‘No!’ and walks away.”Stewart can now get down to prune her plants, rise easily from a chair, and is strong enough to help herself up if she falls. “Without strength training I wouldn’t be alive,” she says. She’s evangelical about exercise to friends who think they’re too old to start. To younger people who say they are too busy, her advice is simple: “Make time. Do what you need to do to live longer.”Jean Stewart is a member ofDesert Fitness Collective.Explore more on these topicsFitnessChanged body, changed lifeBody imageHealth & wellbeingWeightliftingOlder peopleHealthDisability and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When she was a 13-year-old girl living in Poland in the late 1930s, on the brink of the Nazi occupation, her mother told her she was pulled away from her mother and put on a boat to Palestine where she spent the rest of the second world war. As a teenager in that country, she said she became part of a radical Jewish underground group for whom she acted as a spy and a saboteur, smuggling bombs and guns which they used against the British army who ran the country at the time and who they very much wanted to force out. “I was a hero,” her mother would often boast, “never a victim.”Stories like those both dazzled and horrified the young Fox, but by the time she was nine she began to realize that certain parts of the tale didn’t add up. “I would say to her: ‘Wait a minute, if you were born in 1935 and [the second world war] started in 1939, you would have been four, not 13,’” Fox said. “Whenever I would say that, she would say: ‘No more questions.’”Fox never got any clearer answers from her mother before she died of colon cancer in 1993. A college student at the time, Fox not only felt loss but also bafflement. It wasn’t until 2010 that she received her first glimpse of the truth. She was having tea with an elderly great-aunt who, by then, was suffering from dementia, a condition which, Fox believes, made her inadvertently blurt out: “Your mother had a hidden identity,” after which she darkly added: “You’re not going to be happy with what you find.”AI, Salman Rushdie and Elon Musk: the most anticipated documentaries of 2026Read moreThat tidbit fired a mission in Fox to finally uncover the true story of her mother, a tale that turned out to be even more dramatic, troubling and sad than the one she had always been fed. That’s the story that’s finally being told in a revelatory new documentary directed and written by Fox, titled My Underground Mother. Through relentless sleuthing over a 15-year period during which she tracked down sources from around the world, Fox discovered that her mother had lied to her, as well as to her father, her siblings and everyone else in her adult life about key information including her true age, her real name, as well as the fact that she had actually lived in Poland for the entire duration of the war.Talking to Fox in her New York apartment as she traces her mother’s complex story has an eerie resonance since they share a number of physical features. “We even wear our hair the same way,” she said.That’s the reason, she now believes, her mother was so shaken when Fox entered adolescence. “When she saw my body changing, and she saw the male gaze coming into view, she became protective in a way that went beyond the normal pale of Jewish mothers,” Fox said. “She was always nervously trying to tell me to cover up. And I didn’t understand it. Her relationship with me began to change and harden.”View image in fullscreenHela Hocherman, the real name of Marisa Fox’s mother, in Israel in 1948.Photograph: Courtesy of Marisa FoxFox believes her mother was triggered by her budding womanhood due to the specific circumstances of the secret part of her history. When the Nazis began their reign of terror in Poland, her mother was actually about 14 and living in a small town near the German border. Her birth mother wound up being sent to Auschwitz while she, and hundreds of the other teenage girls in the area, were taken to a forced labor camp named Gabersdorf. There, they were imprisoned and made to work back-breaking shifts to provide free labor and assets that the Nazis used to help finance the war. The first-hand testimonies Fox offers in the film couldn’t be more moving, drawn from scores of women who had been at Gabersdorf who she tracked down in countries from Sweden and Australia to the US and Israel. The way she accomplished that forms the movie’s main plot, creating an edge-of-your-seat experience for the viewer. The scores of women Fox found, 18 of whom made the film’s final cut, were by then in their 80s and 90s. Since filming began, all but three of those women have died. “Whenever I would hear about somebody relevant to the story, I would hop on a plane to speak to them,” Fox said. “There was no time to waste.”Tracking them down was one thing, but getting them to speak about their most traumatic experiences became a psychological challenge. “I had to earn their trust,” the director said. “A lot of them asked: ‘Do you love your mother?’ because they wanted to make sure I wasn’t out to tell some salacious story. Then, there was a tension between their loyalty to my mother and however much they felt she had abandoned them by lying about her past. They didn’t understand how she could do like that. These women had been everything to each other and, after the war, my mother cut them off.”In the end, the women’s role as witnesses to history, as well as their earlier connection to Fox’s mother, won them over. “They were curious to find out what the hell happened to their friend and why she did what she did,” the director said.The stories the women told Fox about Gabersdorf paint a picture of a harrowing place that grew exponentially worse as the war slogged on. In a coup, Fox not only had the women’s riveting testimony but also a journal they created at the time, to which 60 of the girls contributed. Lines written by Fox’s mother in the journal when she was a teen are among the most eloquent, imagining a defiant future beyond the camp, a sign of her deep survival instincts. “My mother was a badass, even at a young age,” Fox said.Crushing and depressing as their workload and their isolation was, Fox found some fascinating nuances in the lives of certain girls through their relationships with some British PoWs who were later brought to the camp. While the Jewish girls were barely sustained, the PoWs were allowed to receive Red Cross packages, including food and chocolate which they used to entice the girls into sex. With striking honesty, the journal reveals the flings that went on between the PoWs and some of the girls. “The Diary of Anne Frank this wasn’t,” Fox quips in the film.Tellingly, the women who speak on that subject only talk about relations experienced by other girls, never themselves. “These girls were so young, so they had no sexual experience before this,” Fox said. “Their life was completely uprooted, and they were utterly dehumanized right when they were beginning to feel those raging hormones. When all of a sudden, a guy wants you, in that context it becomes exciting. Of course, sexual bartering is a war crime and perhaps some of the girls reported their agreement to the sex just to prove they had agency, but there could also be love and lust. Several of the women later married those PoWs.”Two years into their imprisonment, however, the sexual aspect of life in the camp took a far darker turn. In 1943, when the killing apparatus of the Nazis went into overdrive, SS men and women took over the camp. They instituted practices like nude inspections in which the guards would select certain women to be trafficked as sex slaves for Nazi soldiers on the eastern front. “Those women who were taken from the camp were never heard from again,” Fox says.Other girls at the camp were raped right there, turning the place into a kind of corollary to the “Joy Division” brothels at places like Auschwitz, a grotesque practice later alluded to the 1953 novella House of Dolls by the novelist and camp survivor credited as Ka-Tzetnik 135633, as well as in the name for the dark, post-punk band led by Ian Curtis in the late 1970s. In the film, Fox reveals the horrors certain girls experienced at Gabersdorf, including one who was murdered for becoming pregnant from a rape.View image in fullscreenMarisa holding a picture of her mother.Photograph: Marisa FoxNo record of sexual crimes by the Nazis was kept, a striking feature given the fact that the Germans left incredibly detailed documentation of their other crimes, a key reason we know so much about them. One reason the Nazis omitted sex crimes, Fox believes, was because it was illegal there for non-Jews to have sexual relations with Jews. “It was considered ‘racial defilement’,” she said.In 1945, when the war finally ended, the incidents of rape didn’t cease. The Russian liberators at Gabersdorf violated the girls as well. Even after Fox’s mother made it to Italy on her way to Palestine, one man tried to use sexual coercion as payment for his aid.Given her mother’s treatment in Poland, when she finally got to Palestine, she wanted to remake herself and she joined an insurrectionist movement that, eventually, had a hand in the creation of the state of Israel. Though her mother always saw herself as a freedom fighter, Fox says it wouldn’t be unfair to consider her a terrorist. “These people were taking the law into their own hands,” she said.After Israel was established, survivors of theHolocaustwere often looked upon in the country with suspicion and condescension or seen as damaged goods. For that reason and others, Fox’s mother came to the US hoping to create a life far removed from both her time at a camp and as a bomb-carrying subversive. After getting financial help from an American uncle to emigrate, she married in the 1950s and raised a family in New York. While she would often talk proudly to her daughter about her time as an outlaw in Palestine, not a syllable was ever spoken about the great drama that came before, a decision that could be seen by some fellow survivors as its own kind of Holocaust denial. In a similar way, when her mother was told she had cancer in the 1990s, she ordered her family never to tell a soul. “One of her biggest worries was to be seen as a figure of pity,” Fox said. “She never wanted to be seen as a victim of any kind.”As to why she sustained her lies throughout her life, even to her husband, Fox can only speculate. “There were probably many layers of shame in her,” she said. “Shame about having survived the camp, shame about whatever sexual abuse she experienced, which I can never know for sure, and shame about discovering at one point that she had been a love child, which was why she had changed her name.”Fox admits to having experienced doubts about revealing secrets her mother fought her whole life to conceal. “My brothers said: ‘Doesn’t mom have a right to retain her privacy?’” she said. “But at the end of the day, who wants to hide from themselves? You only do that because you feel bad about something that happened to you, something so horrific that you feel that people won’t understand. Clearly, she never came to peace with that, but I feel like deep down my mother would have liked to have told me. Don’t we all want to be at peace with who we are?”Beyond her own story, Fox believes her mother’s saga can also help others. “I made this film so women who survive these horrific experiences during war don’t feel guilty,” she said. “Shame needs to change sides. The shame doesn’t belong to the women. It belongs to the men who did this to them.”My Underground Mother is screening at the New York Jewish film festival on 19 and 20 January before a wider release later this yearExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsSecond world warHolocaustNazismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trillions of dollars rest on the answer.The figures are staggering: an estimated $2.9tn (£2.2tn) beingspent on datacentres, the central nervous systems of AI tools; the more than $4tn stock market capitalisation of Nvidia, the company that makes the chips powering cutting-edge AI systems; and the $100m signing-on bonuses offered by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to top engineers at OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.These sky-high numbers are all propped up by investors who expect a return on their trillions. AGI, a theoretical state of AI where systems gain human levels of intelligence across an array of tasks and are able to replace humans in white-collar jobs such as accountancy and law, is a keystone of this financial promise.Google parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with AppleRead moreIt offers the prospect of computer systems carrying out profitable work without the associated cost of human labour – a hugely lucrative scenario for companies developing the technology and the customers who deploy it.There will be consequences if AI companies fall short: US stock markets, boosted heavily by the performance of tech stocks, could fall and cause damage to people’s personal wealth; debt markets wrapped up in the datacentre boom could suffer a jolt that ripples elsewhere; GDP growth in the US, which has benefited from the AI infrastructure, could falter, which would have knock-on effects for interlinked economies.David Cahn, a partner at one leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Sequoia Capital, says tech companies now have to deliver on AGI.“Nothing short of AGI will be enough to justify the investments now being proposed for the coming decade,”he wrote in a blog published in October.It means there is a lot hanging on progress towards advanced AI, and the trillions being poured into infrastructure and R&D to achieve it. One of the “godfathers” of modern AI, Yoshua Bengio, says the progress of AGI could stall and the outcome would be bad for investors.“There is a clear possibility that we will hit a wall, that there’s some difficulty that we don’t foresee right now, and we don’t find any solution quickly,” he says. “And that could be a real [financial] crash. A lot of the people who are putting trillions right now into AI are also expecting the advances to continue fairly regularly at the current pace.”But Bengio, a prominent voiceon the safety implications of AGI, is clear that continued progress towards a highly advanced state of AI is the more likely endgame.“Advances stalling is a minority scenario, like it’s an unlikely scenario. The more likely scenario is we continue to move forward,” he says.The pessimistic view is that investors are backing an unrealistic outcome – that AGI will not happen without further breakthroughs.David Bader, the director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, says trillions of dollars are being spent on scaling up – tech jargon for growing something quickly – the underlying technology for chatbots, known as transformers, in the expectation that increasing the amount of computing power behind current AI systems, by building more datacentres, will suffice.“If AGI requires a fundamentally different approach, perhaps something we haven’t yet conceived, then we’re optimising an architecture that can’t get us there no matter how large we make it. It’s like trying to reach the moon by building taller ladders,” he says.Nonetheless, big US tech companies such as Google’s parentAlphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are ploughing ahead with datacentre plans with the financial cushion of being able to fund their AGI ambitions through the cash generated by their hugely profitable day-to-day businesses. This at least gives them some protection if the wall outlined by Bengio and Bader comes into view.But there are other more worrying aspects to the boom. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimate that $2.9tn will be spent on datacentres between now and 2028, with half of that covered by the cashflow from “hyperscalers” such as Alphabet and Microsoft.The rest will have to be covered by alternative sources such as private credit, a corner of theshadow banking sectorthat isactivating alarm bells at the Bank of Englandand elsewhere. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has borrowed $29bn from the private credit market to finance a datacentre in Louisiana.AI-related sectors account for approximately 15% of investment grade debt in the US, which is even bigger than the banking sector, according to the investment bank JP Morgan.Oracle, which has signed a $300bn datacentre deal withOpenAI, has had an increase in credit default swaps, which are a form of insurance on a company defaulting on its debts. High-yield, or “junk debt”, which represents the higher-risk end of the borrowing market, is also appearing in the AI sector via datacentre operators CoreWeave and TeraWulf. Growth is also being funded by asset-backed securities – a form of debt underpinned by assets such as loans or credit card debt, but in this case rent paid by tech companies to datacentre owners – in a form of financing that has risen sharply in recent years.It is no wonder that JP Morgan says the AI infrastructure boom will require a contribution from all corners of the credit market.Bader says: “If AGI doesn’t materialise on expected timelines, we could see contagion across multiple debt markets simultaneously – investment-grade bonds, high-yield junk debt, private credit and securitised products – all of which are being tapped to fund this buildout.”Share prices linked to AI and tech are also playing an outsized role in US stock markets. The so-called “magnificent 7” of US tech stocks – Alphabet,Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia – account for more than a third of the value of the S&P 500 index, the biggest stock market index in the US, compared with 20% at the start of the decade.In October theBank of England warnedof “the risk of a sharp correction” in US and UK markets due to giddy valuations of AI-linked tech companies. Central bankers are concerned stock markets could slump if AI fails to reach the transformative heights investors are hoping for. At the same time the International Monetary Fund said valuations were heading towards dotcom bubble-levels.Even tech execs whose companies are benefiting from the boom are acknowledging the speculative nature of the frenzy. In November Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said there are “elements of irrationality” in the boom and that “no company is going to be immune” if the bubble bursts, while Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has said the AI industry is in a “kind of industrial bubble”, and OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said “there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.”All three, to be clear, are AI optimists and expect the technology to keep improving and benefit society.But when the numbers get this big there are obvious risks in a bubble bursting, as Pichai admits. Pension funds and anyone invested in the stock market will be affected by a share price collapse, while the debt markets will also take a hit. There is also a web of “circular” deals, such as OpenAI paying Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares. If these transactions unravel due to a lack of take-up of AI, or that wall being hit, then it could be messy.There are also optimists who argue that generative AI, the catch-all term for tools such as chatbots and video generators, will transform whole industries and justify the expenditure. Benedict Evans, a technology analyst, says the expenditure numbers are not outrageous in the context of other industries, such as oil and gas extraction which runs at $600bn a year.“These AI capex figures are a lot of money but it’s not an impossible amount of money,” he says.Evans adds: “You don’t have to believe in AGI to believe that generative AI is a big thing. And most of what is happening here is not, ‘oh wow they’re going to create God’. It’s ‘this is going to completely change how advertising, search, software and social networks – and everything else our business is based on – is going to work’. It’s going to be a huge opportunity.”Nonetheless, there is a multitrillion dollar expectation that AGI will be achieved. For many experts,the consequences of getting thereare alarming. The cost of not getting there could also be significant.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingStock marketsAmazonMetaGoogleOpenAIanalysisShareReuse this content"

Psychiatrist Amir Levine gives us a set of tools to help us feel more secure in all our relationships, not just romantic ones, but with colleagues, friends, family and even with ourselves. This is not a fanciful book but is grounded in research and neuroscience. I believe if you follow its principles, you will in time become more secure. But any psychological work is not like rubbing on cream – it wouldn’t be enough just to read the book. You’d have to do the work and then keep up the practice. Secure can help you know yourself better, and self‑awareness is the first step towards positive change, in this case becoming more open and relaxed in all your relationships. If you can’t wait until April, my runner-up is his first book, Attached, written with Rachel Heller.Philippa Perry is a clinical psychologist. Her latest book is The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read.View image in fullscreenHave better conversationsChosen byHannah CritchlowEmily and Laurence Alison’sRapportis fantastic at helping us to understand other people, and showing how we can work with them to increase our own cognitive power. There’s evidence that a huge part of our species’ success has been due to our ability to cooperate. We constantly take shortcuts in our information processing, accumulate biases throughout our lifetimes, and have genetic predispositions to seeing the world in different ways. But when you get a group of people together and allow them to communicate freely, it can balance out biases so they can start to see the world more accurately. And from that, we can start to solve problems and move forward in a positive way.The authors draw on their own experiences as forensic psychologists, working in dangerous, hostile situations, and set out four personality categories – monkey, T rex, lion or mouse – each with communicative strengths and weaknesses. This provides a roadmap to understand yourself and others too. I think it’s incredibly important in the modern world that we continue to build these interpersonal skills, creating rapport even with those who think differently to us, as opposed to just hiding behind our screens.Hannah Critchlow is a neuroscientist at Magdalene College, Cambridge University. Her new book, The 21st-Century Brain, will be publishedinApril.Sustain a long-term relationshipChosen byOrna GuralnikStephen Mitchell was, in a way, the founder of the relational school of psychoanalysis, which is a more contemporary school of psychoanalysis – andCan Love Last?is a very useful book for couples to read. He talks openly, in accessible language, about the underlying unconscious dilemmas that love poses, the risks of vulnerability, dependency and unpredictability and the ways in which we try to avoid risk and dampen love to feel safer. It helps people get in touch with their more fundamental motivations, allowing them to be more courageous in their loving.Rather than offering “three things you can do tomorrow”, it goes deeper. Mitchell gives engaging examples. I love that he speaks intelligently about this intense experience that we all go through; forming relationships, falling in love, struggling with it when often we feel like we don’t understand what’s happening to us. And he speaks beautifully to the tension between the need for safety and the need for adventure.Orna Guralnik is a New York-based clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst, best known for the television showCouples Therapy.View image in fullscreenStop being a people pleaserChosen byAlex CurmiThe Courage to Be Dislikedby Ichiro Kishimi is different from any other self-help book I’ve ever read, with the format of a philosopher talking to a young, frustrated student really drawing you in. Everyone can relate to being that young person trying to figure things out. And I think everyone feels like they have that older, wiser person in them somewhere too. The book is intended to introduce readers to the work of Austrian psychoanalyst Alfred Adler. He felt that at any point you can decide to change your life.People pleasers often unconsciously take on the responsibilities of not just their own life but of other people’s, because they feel if they don’t put in that extra effort, other people are going to dislike them. Kishimi introduces the Adlerian idea of the separation of tasks, where you decide which tasks you are responsible for and then let other people get on with their own tasks.That’s extremely liberating. Of course, the huge irony is that when you live without fear of dislike, people tend to like you much more because they intuit that you have a lot more self respect and you’re being more genuine, and genuineness and authenticity are very appealing.Dr Alex Curmi is a consultant psychiatrist and host of the Thinking Mind Podcast.View image in fullscreenBe happierChosen byPaul DolanI first encountered Oliver Burkeman’s writing when he wrote a series for the Guardian calledThis Column Will Change Your Life. He doesn’t take himself too seriously and I admire his self-deprecation. You can be serious and say things that are important and robust and also have some levity.Four Thousand Weeksis enjoyable to read and consistent with what I’ve always said about one of the key ways to be happier or live better, which is just to get over ourselves about stuff. Burkeman talks about the fact that we’ve got a limited amount of time, hence the title. So, never mind next week. What are you going to do this week to make it just that little bit better? Focus on the small stuff, not the big stuff, do things now rather than later, stop worrying about making next week perfect.It’s fundamentally about happiness, because that is the ultimate achievement. It’s interesting when people say they want to be successful. What is the point of success? It’s a cliched thing to say, but it’s about the journey.Paul Dolan is professor of behavioural science at London School of Economics. His latest book is Beliefism: How to Stop Hating People We Disagree With.View image in fullscreenNavigate traumaChosen byLisa Feldman-BarrettGeorge Bonanno has studied trauma in many forms for over three decades, and inThe End of Traumahe challenges some conventional, outdated beliefs. Stories and case studies show that trauma is personal: it varies across people and contexts. It’s not a feature of an event, but an experience. Adverse events can happen to people and they might not be traumatised, but equally, something that would not be traumatic for many can authentically be traumatic for you. Trauma doesn’t mean “I feel really, really bad”. It means “I’m having intrusive thoughts and can’t connect with the pleasures of the moment. I’m feeling so bad that I can’t function.” Still, most people are surprisingly resilient and do not develop PTSD – even after terrible events such as 9/11, rape or war. People are distressed, they get angry, they grieve, but most can function in their everyday lives.Bonanno also shows that resilience to trauma is rooted in how flexibly you cope. Sometimes it helps to talk about your experience, but other times it helps to distract yourself. Sometimes you should seek company, but other times it’s better to take a hot bath and go to bed, hoping tomorrow will be a better day. It’s always possible to look at the event from different angles, which ultimately gives you more choice in how to feel. Flexibility is a skill that can be learned and practised like any other. Ultimately, you have agency over how you deal with the slings and arrows you encounter in life. With agency there is hope.Lisa Feldman-Barrett is a neuroscientistand a professor at Northeastern University. Her latest book isSeven and a Half Lessons About the Brain.Handle stressChosen byRobert SapolskyI’d recommendDopamine Nationby a colleague of mine, Anna Lembke (a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University). I don’t recall if the word “stress” appears in the book, but it’s ultimately about that in a very meaningful way. Her focus is the biology and psychology of why our cultures leave us so empty and prone to addiction, why the more we eat, the hungrier we get. She emphasises how we, in our privileged lives in the west, have been led to believe that we should never feel pain, failure, defeat, discouragement: “everyone’s a winner”. What this does, for one thing, is make us pathetic and unprepared when it comes to really tough circumstances. She has a model according to which, in the absence of any capacity to tolerate pain and being hypersensitised to the kinds of pain that are inevitable in any life, we get a hypersensitised craving for reward that leads to addiction. The take-home message for me is to remember the consequences of having the goal of a pain-free life with no setbacks or adversity.Robert Sapolsky is professor of biology, neuroscience and neurosurgery at Stanford University. His latest book is Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will.Tackle narcissismChosen byLinda BlairToday we tend to want to label everything, and I don’t think that’s always the most effective way to create change and wellbeing. Narcissism is a term that people love to throw around as an insult: “They’re such a narcissist.” What they actually mean is, “I don’t think they value me enough, and I don’t think they see my point of view, and for that reason they’re annoying me.” Well, guess what? That is narcissism, too. And by focusing on it, either in yourself or in others, you are simply making it worse.To treat a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, the most important thing is working on deepening and strengthening your relationships. What that comes back to is not just thinking about other people’s point of view, but getting more realistic about your own. So – like the Dalai Lama – try to think of everybody as being equally important, including yourself, and spend your time trying to understand them rather than judge. In the blink of an eye, you’ve begun to solve narcissism, either in yourself or in your tendency to call it out in others, and you will emerge happier.The Art of Happinessis a dialogue between a western psychiatrist, Howard Cutler, and the Dalai Lama and I think it’s a winner. It may have been published in 1998 but the wisdom isn’t dated and the Dalai Lama, of course, is still going strong.Linda Blair is a clinical psychologist. Her latest book isSiblings.View image in fullscreenBecome a better parentChosen byEmily OsterThomas Phelan’s1-2-3-Magicis an older book but it is fundamentally sensible and I think it would help a lot of people enormously. It’s a bit of a corrective to some of the more intense and exhausting parenting books we have had lately.The intention is to give you a system, and tell you how to implement it – so it’s very no-nonsense, with a lot of worked-up examples. It feels like good, sensible advice, structured so you can be successful. The crux of it is that, when thinking about behaviour change, kids respond well to a consistently implemented system of rewards and punishments. And – maybe more importantly – if you get to a better place, family life will be easier and there will be more space for fun.Emily Oster is professor of economics at Brown University. Her latest book is The Unexpected: Navigating Pregnancy During and After Complications.View image in fullscreenUnderstand neurodiversityChosen byAlmuth McDowallApproaching Autistic Adulthoodby Grace Liu is one of my favourite books. Grace is mixed race and a lesbian, and beautifully illuminates the intersectional perspective. She does a great job of describing her journey to adulthood and the difficulties she has experienced without sugar‑coating or judging others. Some of it makes me laugh out loud, such as her description of “neurotypical‑splaining”, as in when people who are not autistic try and tell autistic people what it is like. The book gives real-life insight into the autistic mind. It’s a great read for autistic people (“You are not alone! Here are some things for you to think about to navigate life better”) and for people who come in contact with autistic people, which given population prevalence means all of us at some point (“This is how you can respond appropriately, without patronising or belittling people”).It’s an easy and poignant read with many anecdotes. Grace’s approach is also evidence based – she tries to address the double empathy problem: that autistic people understand each other, and neurodivergent people understand each other, but communication across the two neurotypes often results in misunderstanding. She debunks some of the myths and is honest and authentic in her writing.Almuth McDowall is a psychology professor at Birkbeck College, London, specialising in neurodivergence research.View image in fullscreenMaintain focusChosen byOliver BurkemanHow to Focusby John Cassian, translated by Jamie Kreiner,is from a series published by Princeton called Ancient Wisdom for Modern Readers. Cassian was a fourth-century Christian monk but the translation is informal, refreshing and modern. It’s about the problem of concentration and distraction, which they figured was partly because of demons but also because of the vagaries of how human attention works, which they could do something about.First, know that distraction is a perpetual challenge, and it makes a lot more sense to just accept that. Second, prioritise having interesting things to focus on instead of the other tempting distractions that lure you away. So it’s not a self-punishing, “I will not spend an hour doomscrolling”, it’s, “how can I make sure that I am spending some of my time and my life on things that naturally draw me to them, and I prefer to do than spending all that time doomscrolling?”The most borrowable solution offered is the idea of making a daily practice, something that you can keep coming back to, and learning to forgive yourself when your focus is less than what you would have it be. You’re still working the muscle of concentration.There is something profound about any opportunity to glimpse that whatever torments us today might actually, in some way, be a timeless part of the human condition. I feel lifted up or supported somehow by these people. We’re all just chipping away at it and that’s why you don’t need to beat yourself up for not having done more than that.Oliver Burkeman is a writer.

The formerLabourcabinet minister’s fairground ride of a career suggests it is both his superpower and his kryptonite.He was withdrawn last September as US ambassador after emails emerged detailing his close relationship with the billionaire serial sex offenderJeffrey Epstein. They revealed that he had advised his “best pal”, as he described the American in 2003, to “fight for early release” on the eve of his sentencing in 2008 for soliciting prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution.View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson was withdrawn as US ambassador after emails emerged detailing his relationship with his ‘best pal’ Jeffrey Epstein.Photograph: Department of JusticeMandelson’s tendency to be drawn like a moth to a flame to those with power and wealth had let him down again. But Downing Street insiders say Mandelson had been appointed ambassador in the first place – despite the serious reservations of many, including the prime minister – thanks in large part to another relationship he had built with a quite different character, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. “Mandelson was a mentor to him,” said one insider.As it happens, Palantir’s Mosley, the grandson of Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists in the 1930s, is no stranger to Mandelson’s charms either. Palantir was for years a client of Global Counsel, the strategic consultancy co-founded by Mandelson. During Mandelson’s time as Britain’s ambassador in the US, Mosley and Palantir hosted Starmer at the company’s Washington offices.So for all of the condemnation and humiliation, Mandelson, 72, still has admirers, and the drive to go again, even if he has said that he knows public service is a thing of the past. “Who knows what’s next,” Mandelson told Kuenssberg. “I don’t know what’s next. I’m not going to disappear and hide – that’s not me.”Mandelson, who had already notched up two controversy-shrouded cabinet resignations before his latest dramatic fall from grace, had described himself as the “eternal comeback kid” after his appointment as Britain’s man in Washington.Does he really believe he can secure the role of elder statesman again? If Mandelson’sarticle about Venezuelain Michael Gove’s Spectator magazine and interview with the BBC were attempts at that, they were not sure-footed ones.During the interview, Mandelson was pressed to apologise to Epstein’s victims. “If I was complicit or culpable, of course I would apologise, but I was not culpable, I was not knowledgable about what he was doing and I regret, and I will regret to my dying day, the fact that powerless women who were denied a voice were not given the protection they were entitled to expect from the American system.” The line was never likely to hold.View image in fullscreenDuring his interview with Laura Kuenssberg, Mandelson was pressed to apologise to Epstein’s victims. He did not.Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/AFP/Getty ImagesAmong those who condemned the interview was Ayesha Hazarika, a former Ed Miliband press adviser, who described it as a “slap in the face to Epstein victims”. By Monday evening, an apology was delivered. “I was wrong to believe him following his conviction and to continue my association with him afterwards,” Mandelson said. “I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.”In Westminster, the statement confirmed to some the suspicion that Mandelson struggled to apply his media expertise to his own life. “What on earth was Peter playing at?” asked one cabinet minister. “Why would he go on TV on Sunday and then not apologise? It’s totally mad. He needs to disappear for a very long time.”A second cabinet source said: “Peter managed to create several days of headlines on his relationship with Epstein by failing to apologise. He just doesn’t get it. It’s been damaging for Keir. It just reminds everyone that he appointed him.”Epstein files: which royals, politicians, musicians and actors are in the photos?Read moreWhy did Mandelson not apologise to the women in the first instance? One person familiar with his thinking said that Mandelson did not want to “bracket” himself “by implication with those who either participated in Epstein’s grooming activities or simply knew about them and chose to ignore them”.He had made a “split-second judgment” in how to frame his apology in the BBC interview. He felt strongly that people had covered up for Epstein, that “money and power protected Epstein rather than those he preyed on”, and wanted to say so, the source said. Mandelson became concerned though that his comments were being perceived as him “shunning any personal responsibility for not believing the women”. That, he did not want to do – and so he made his statement and felt happier after he had done it.Another source suggested the initial lack of an apology was likely linked to the Labour peer’s experience of being a gay politician of “a certain generation”. “There is a real sensitivity about the idea that he could be in any way complicit in the sexual abuse of young people which he wasn’t,” the friend said. “I think the old spin doctor in him didn’t want headlines of ‘Mandy says sorry for paedo friend’.View image in fullscreenLouis Mosley, the UK head of Palantir, said Mandelson was a ‘masterful interpreter of Trump’.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APOf Mandelson’s recent frame of mind, the source went on: “He has been in a pretty bad way – there have been tears.”It has been one mess after another. Soon after his return to the UK, Mandelson was forced into an embarrassing apology after being photographed urinating against a wall outside George Osborne’s Notting Hill home after dinner with the former Tory chancellor. “The night had to end a little early as Osborne’s kid had fallen ill and then Peter didn’t want to disturb them further by knocking to use the toilet while he waited for an Uber,” said a friend.Peter Mandelson’s lobbying firm hired by company linked to Chinese militaryRead moreHe appears to have taken the blows quite personally. “The 5am call to the ambassador’s residence telling him he was being withdrawn was on Reinaldo’s birthday,” said a source in reference to Mandelson’s husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva. “Peter is very cross with a few people. He is pretty cross with Keir.”One point that is particularly sore, say friends, is that he was not given an opportunity before being withdrawn to explain the context of the Epstein emails to the prime minister, who attended the Labour peer’s wedding at London’s Marylebone town hall in October 2023.A source suggested that a number of people around the prime minister and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had always felt that Mandelson’s appointment was fraught with danger. It did not take much to convince them that there was no mileage in defending him further. “Keir’s instinct had always been to keep Peter at arm’s length,” said the source. “He was reluctant to go to Mandelson’s wedding but he was persuaded.”That instinct to keep a distance has not been shared by everyone, including leading lights in Starmer’s cabinet. In the opposition years, as part of attempts to rid Labour of Jeremy Corbyn and his acolytes, Mandelson was a member of a Sunday supper party held at the Kennington home of Roger Liddle, a fellow Labour peer and longstanding friend. Regular guests included the health secretary, Wes Streeting, and his partner, Joe Dancey, himself a former Mandelson adviser.View image in fullscreenA number of people around the prime minister felt Mandelson’s appointment was fraught with danger.Photograph: Carl Court/AFP/Getty ImagesOthers who frequented the Georgian home for roast lamb and fine wine were Matt Doyle, formerly a spokesperson for Tony Blair and later to be Starmer’s director of communications, Matt Pound, who is today political secretary to chancellor Rachel Reeves, and Matthew Faulding who stood down as secretary of the parliamentary Labour party last November. Streeting is said to have joked that a blue plaque might be put up outside Liddle’s home given its role in the reinvention of Labour. “Maybe we will see Mandelson back by the side of prime minister Streeting?” a source suggested archly.After four decades in frontline politics and a successful business career, Mandelson does not need to work. Company accounts for Global Counsel published earlier this month, show that it had repaid him £1.3m in loans in the last financial year as he cut his ties.“Peter has nothing to do with Global Counsel now,” a source said. He returned from his grand residence on Washington’s Massachusetts Avenue to his rented four-bedroom home in Pewsey Vale, Wiltshire. Even now, in his eighth decade, few believe the peace and quiet will be enough for him. “Peter is addicted to the political life,” said a friend. “He has to be seen.”"

We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”Opposition politicians also condemned Trump’s threats.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said: “President Trump is completely wrong to announce tariffs on the UK over Greenland.“These tariffs will be yet another burden for businesses across our country. The sovereignty of Greenland should only be decided by the people of Greenland.”Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “Starmer’s US policy lies in tatters. Trump is now punishing the UK and Nato allies just for doing the right thing.“Time for the PM to stand firm against the bully in the White House, and work with European and Commonwealth allies to make him back down from this reckless plan.”View image in fullscreenProtesters take part in a rally in Copenhagen, Denmark, under the slogans ‘hands off Greenland’ and ‘Greenland for Greenlanders’.Photograph: Emil Helms/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Reform leader, Nigel Farage, said Trump’s Greenland tariffs would “hurt” the UK. He said: “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t.”Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, said: “Trump’s tariffs and threats mean it’s make your mind up time. If we can’t rely on America and we don’t want to cosy up to China, the answer is to get serious about our strategic future with Europe.“Nato needs this too – the reset must be real, and it must happen quickly for all our sakes.”Greenland crisis: Europe needs the US, but it also needs to stand up to TrumpRead moreLord Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser and retired senior diplomat, told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme that “the right thing for the European countries is to react very calmly” and “go on making the case that America can have all its security interests served by working with Denmark and with Nato”.“Remember that in the cold war, America had 10,000 troops in Greenland, so it’s entirely open to the Americans to increase their military presence without going unilateral and these kind of threatening approaches,” he said.He added that European leaders could in private make clear that “this tariff business isn’t going to work – for one thing, the European Union has a single tariff, so he will find he can’t put tariffs on individual EU countries; it’s the EU as a whole”.“Rather than threatening tariffs, we need to be working together to work out the very legitimate issues about Greenland security – not that China is about to take it over, but that all of us in Nato have Arctic security as a priority,” he said.“The way to do this is to work together and in the past, I think Keir Starmer and others have been quite effective at working with President Trump privately, not taking him on in public, and I think we need to go back into that routine to get him to see that there are other ways of achieving what he wants without this sort of threatening, blustering language about tariffs.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandEuropeDonald TrumpKeir StarmerUS foreign policyForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The industry lobbying group Tech UK met ministers at the rate of more than once every eight working days.X attended 13 meetings, a small proportion of the overall number, but still more than the child safety campaign group the NSPCC or the Molly Rose Foundation, founded by the family of 14-year-old Molly Russell who killed herself after viewing harmful online content.“The frequency of meetings between government and big tech and their advocates is astounding and points to the incredible power imbalance at stake when it comes to protecting children online,” said Andy Burrows, the chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation.View image in fullscreenMolly Russell, two years before she died.Photograph: Family handout/PAThe government defended its position, saying “regular engagement with technology companies is vital to delivering economic growth and transforming public services”. Campaigners said the government should stop “bending the knee to US big tech companies” and that the figures revealed an “incredible power imbalance” when it came to protecting children online.There has been growing controversy over X’s Grok AI tool, and aresurgencein the campaign for the government to follow Australia and ban social media for under-16s, which is opposed by tech companies. In the UK, 84% of peopleare concernedministers will prioritise tech company partnerships over the public interest when it comes to AI regulation.Dame Chi Onwurah, the Labour chair of the science and technology select committee, said the findings underscored “the reality that these firms have turnovers larger than the GDP of many countries, and their ability to influence stands in stark contrast to that of their users, our constituents, or those campaigning to make the internet safer”.She said it was “crucial for big tech to be accountable to parliament – something that the disturbing recent news about ‘nudification’ tools has only underlined further”.View image in fullscreenChi Onwurah MP said it was crucial that big tech was accountable to parliament.Photograph: Richard Gardner/Rex/ShutterstockThe technology companies and their lobbyists attended at least 639 meetings with ministers compared with just 75 meetings attended by the organisations and campaigners fighting for greater protections for children online, such as the NSPCC.The tech firms’ access was also more than three times greater than that of organisations and campaigners seeking to protect creatives’ copyrighted works from being mined to build AI models, a development that figures including Elton John and Kazuo Ishiguro have said risks giving away artists’ “lifeblood”.Ed Newton-Rex, a campaigner for creators’ rights, called the figures “shocking” and said they explained why ministers had launched their consultation on AI and copyright “with a ‘preferred option’ that read like a wishlist from big tech”.“It is imperative that the government stop bending the knee to US big tech companies – which, as the recent Grok debacle has shown, don’t have the interests of the British people at heart,” he said.View image in fullscreenA van drives through Westminster bearing a billboard organised by the corporate accountability group Eko urging the prime minister to shut down X and Grok.Photograph: Maja Smiejkowska/ReutersRecords of more than 11,000 meetings under both Labour and the Conservatives show there were almost 160 meetings with technology companies, more than 100 with organisations lobbying for protections over AI and copyright, and 25 with those involved in child safety.The US and Canadian AI start ups Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere together had 27 meetings with ministers. Last summer they each signed memorandums of understanding with the UK government which included exploring using AI more in public services.A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) spokesperson said regular engagement with tech companies was essential to ensure safe deployment of their technology in the UK.“These meetings cover a wide range of issues – from investment and innovation to implementing our recent laws for a safer online world,” they said. “DSIT ministers also routinely meet with campaign and civil society groups. As her actions on online safety this week have shown, the science and tech secretary [Liz Kendall] is always prepared to stand up and uphold the law and British values.”Keir Starmer tells MPs he is open to social media ban for young peopleRead moreJulian David, the chief executive of Tech UK, said that given its central role in so many aspects of the economy and society, “it is normal that the technology sector engages regularly and broadly with government”.Google said it worked closely with the government to ensure it had “a positive and safe impact in the UK through our investments in communities, digital skills training, new AI products and enhanced product design – including age assurance and compliance with the Online Safety Act”.Lady Beeban Kidron, who campaigns on child safety and copyright as a cross-bench peer, said: “Successive governments’ naivety in relation to tech lobbying is disturbing. This privileged access is mirrored in their policy, and tech industry talking points are parotted by officials. This capture creates harm.“In opposition, Labour promised safety for women and children, and to protect the creative industries, but in government they have refused to take necessary actions on both. It is not wrong to meet with tech companies, but these numbers tell us all we need to know. A government of a sovereign state has a duty to its own citizens, not to the tech bros.”Explore more on these topicsLobbyingTechnology policyGoogleMetaAmazonXAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also told the Israeli foreign minister to contact the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.27-day-old baby becomes eighth to die of hypothermia in Gaza this winterRead moreThe group, described as the “greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled, at any time, any place” byDonald Trumpon Thursday, is meant to temporarily govern Gaza in place of Hamas.The board is part of Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war inGaza. Despite a ceasefire announced in October, Israel continues to kill Palestinians. At least 463 Palestinians have died in Gaza since the nominal truce was established.Israel also continues to restrict food and other forms of aid into the strip, with hunger prevailing in Gaza. Most of the population lives in substandard housing, with frayed tents providing little protection from the elements. Palestinians in Gaza have already died from hypothermia during particularly harsh cold snaps this winter.The exact makeup of the board of peace is still unclear, but two separate governing boards have been announced.The “founding executive board” will focus on investment and foreign relations, while the “Gaza executive board” will oversee another group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), which will oversee day-to-day affairs in Gaza.Rubio is on the seven-member founding executive board, along with the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-lawJared Kushner, and Tony Blair, with Trump as its chair.Blair thanked Trump for the appointment and said that the NCAG was a “massive step forward”.Trump appoints Blair, Kushner and Rubio to Gaza ‘board of peace’Read more“It gives hope to people in Gaza that they can have a future different from the past, and to the Israelis that they may have a neighbour which does not threaten its security,” Blair said in a statement.There was no word as to whether all the invitees had accepted their invitations to join the board of peace, with Sisi and Erdoğan not confirming their appointment.The US-drafted ceasefire plan for Gaza moved into its second phase this week, which includes several thorny issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas, reconstruction and the deployment of an international security force.Hamas has not yet committed to disarm, and the makeup of an international security force is still unknown. Israel has in the past objected to Turkey playing a role in the force.The board of peace will be tasked with not only running the administration of Gaza, but also its reconstruction. Most of the strip was destroyed by Israeli bombs and bulldozers during its more than two-year war, which killed more than 71,000 Palestinians.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The supreme leader railed against the US president,Donald Trump, whom he called a “criminal” for his support of demonstrations, and called for strict punishment of protesters.Khamenei said: “By God’s grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition.”Iranian authorities also released a compilation of footage on Saturday that purported to show armed individuals carrying guns and knives alongside regular protesters – evidence, they said, of foreign saboteurs.Another senior Iranian cleric demanded the execution of protesters, demanding that “armed hypocrites should be put to death”.He described protesters as “butlers” and “soldiers” of Israel and the US, vowing that neither country should “expect peace”.View image in fullscreenAhmad Khatami described protesters as ‘butlers’ and ‘soldiers’ of Israel and the US.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAKhatami, a member of the Guardian Council and a senior member of the Assembly of Experts, which appoints the supreme leader, is a hardline, influential cleric in Iran.The speech was in striking contrast to statements from Trump, this week, who appeared to postpone a military strike in Iran, telling reporters that Iranian authorities had agreed to halt the executions of protesters.On Friday night, Trump thanked Iran for stopping the execution of what he said was 800 protesters, though it was unclear where he was drawing those figures from.The Iranian state silenced protests with brutality. What now for Iran’s opposition?Read moreRights groups have said the repression of protesters is continuing, with more than 3,090 people killed in the unrest and nearly 4,000 more cases still waiting to be reviewed,according to the Human Rights Activists news agency. More than 22,100 people have been arrested in protests, leading to fears of mistreatment of detainees.The two-and-a-half weeks of protests started on 28 December when traders took to the streets in Tehran in response to a sudden dip in the value of the rial. Protests spread and demands expanded to include calls for an end to the country’s government, creating the most serious, and deadliest unrest the country has seen since the 1979 revolution.View image in fullscreenReza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah of Iran and a prominent opposition voice, at a press conference in Washington DC this week.Photograph: Ali Khaligh/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe brutal quashing of demonstrations by authorities, whichHuman Rights Watch said on Fridayincluded the “mass killings of protesters”, has largely driven people off the streets.With the immediate unrest addressed, authorities were making a public show of punishing those involved in the action, which they had styled as a foreign-backed plot to destabilise the country.Khatami, in his Friday sermon, claimed 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other places of worship had been damaged by protesters. He also said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulances, 71 fire trucks and 50 other emergency vehicles had been damaged.It was unclear what the fallout of the protest movement will be, or if it will reignite in the coming days. Iran continues to be cut off from the rest of the world, as authorities maintain the more than week-long internet shutdown.Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah of Iran who had become a prominent opposition voice during the protests, continued tocall for the overthrow of the governmenton Friday and urged Trump to intervene.“I believe the president is a man of his word,” Pahlavi said, adding that “regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight”.Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiProtestTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Rotheram and Burnham said they had both seen “devastating incidents” in their regions and would never support anything that compromised national security.In a joint statement posted on X, the mayors said: “An important part of strengthening the country’s defences is establishing the truth at the earliest opportunity when things go wrong and that is why, if drafted correctly, the Hillsborough Law could create a culture in all public services where that is the norm.“As it stands, we believe the government’s amendment in relation to the security services creates too broad an opt-out and risks undermining the spirit of the legislation.Labour MPs could rebel over Hillsborough law after talks with families break downRead more“We appreciate that the government has made huge strides in working to deliver the Hillsborough Law and are grateful for their willingness to work with campaigners thus far to make it the strongest law possible.“It is in that spirit that we call on them to withdraw their amendment ahead of Monday’s debate and work with the families and the Hillsborough Law Now campaign to find a solution acceptable to all sides.”Calls for aHillsboroughlaw began in 2016 after a second inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans – later becoming 97 – at the Hillsborough football ground in South Yorkshire during a 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.The club’s supporters were crushed and trampled due to negligent crowd control by South Yorkshire police, in what remains the worst sporting disaster in British history.The deaths, and 766 injuries, were compounded when theLiverpoolfans were improperly blamed for the disaster after false reports of hooliganism were fed to the press by the force.Elkan Abrahamson, a lawyer for the Hillsborough Law Now campaign, said the amendments allowed the heads of the security services to make “whatever decision they want” on whether to disclose information and left them “unchallengeable”.He said it should be up to the head of an inquiry to decide whether information was relevant, adding there were already national security exemptions that allowed evidence to be heard in private.Liverpool West Derby MP, Ian Byrne, has also tabled several amendments of his own that would mean duty of candour applies not only to intelligence organisations but also to people who work for them.On Thursday night, he said he could not back the bill in its current form. “I am absolutely gutted writing this,” Byrne said, “but we need to be clear about what is happening.“I made a commitment to deliver the Hillsborough law without exemptions, without loopholes, and without carve-outs … if the government’s amendments are passed then this legislation, in its current form, is not that.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterUK security and counter-terrorismManchesterLiverpool (UK news)Andy BurnhamSteve RotheramLiverpool (Football)newsShareReuse this content"

Doctors found glass shards and plastic fragments in his skull and a fragment of metal lodged just shy of his carotid artery.‘Make no mistake, this is an occupation’: ICE’s deadly presence casts long shadow over MinneapolisRead moreVideo also showed the federal officer drag Rummler several yards across the pavement and into a federal building after shooting him. The shooting left him blind in his left eye.“I can’t sneeze or cough because it’s dangerous,”Rummler told KTLA. “They pulled a piece of plastic the size of a nickel out of my eye.”“They said it was a miracle I survived,” he added.Rummler is 5ft 1in tall and weighs 102lbs, he said.A second person, 31-year-old Britain Rodriguez, described taking a similar close-range shot to the face with a less-lethal round at the same protest, saying it felt like his “eye exploded in my head”, in an interviewwith the Los Angeles Timespublished on Friday.The shooting appeared to take place at roughly the same time as the one that blinded Rummler.Homeland securityuse-of-force policies describe“uses of impact weapons to strike the neck or head” as a form of “deadly force”.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment about the Santa Ana incidents.But a DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, has described the protesters as a “a mob”, accusing them of throwing rocks, bottles and fireworks at federal officers. Local police andmedia reports, however, said protesters threw only traffic cones. There is no evidence of anything being thrown at officers in the video of Rummler being shot.About 150 people gathered last week for a procession and vigil honoring Rene Good at which the shootings took place. The event culminated with a demonstration in front of a federal building used by ICE.Orange county supervisor Vicente Sarmiento described the event as “very peaceful”. Attendees included local elected officials and “many parents with strollers”, he said.A handful of homeland security officers stood at the top of the steps to the federal building during the protest. When protesters moved closer to them, the officers confronted them, according to Sarmiento. Videos of the shooting that blinded Rummler show him approaching the officers with a bullhorn after they grabbed another protester and dragged them up the stairs to detain them.“I feel just outraged that some of our federal delegation and others are considering continuing to fund these federal agencies that have now gone rogue and are no longer protecting us, but are putting people in critical harm – killing people and maiming people,” Sarmiento said. “I’m just really, really distressed.”Crowd control is not a typical function for homeland security. It is not clear why the federal officer chose to engage with protesters who were not the target of immigration enforcement and who appeared to be demonstrating on public property, outside the federal building.Arizona State University criminologist Edward Maguire, who has studied crowd control, did not observe the Santa Ana protest, but said he had noted recent DHS actions elsewhere “appear inconsistent with basic principles of crowd management and de-escalation”.“Decades of research show that when law enforcement responds to crowds and protests in this way, it tends to escalate tension and conflict and increases the risk of harm to both officers and civilians,” Maguire wrote in an email.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationCaliforniaMinneapolisUS policingWest CoastUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Fresh from their anger at the unveiling of Laila Cunningham as Reform’s London mayoral candidate, Zahawi’s recruitment was cast by some of the same vaccine sceptics as another example of a “Muslim takeover” of Nigel Farage’s party.Its head of policy, Zia Yusuf, has long been a target of racist ire from some Reform members and critics of the party on the right.“Another ex-Tory and another Muslim and another that pushed the vaccine, sorry to say but Reform are losing my support rapidly,” posted one member on a private Reform Facebook group, in response to Zahawi’s defection.The comment, on a group with 135,000 members including key figures in the party, was just one of many in a similar vein across it and other online spaces used by Reform members.“Doesn’t fill me with confidence, the vaccine deployment guy, a man who advocated for an amnesty on illegal migrants,” added another.Another added: “yes gonna be loads of us thinking same Especially us with badly disabled son caused by jib [sic] pushed by him.”While Farage initially provided qualified support for vaccines during the pandemic, he later shifted to a more sceptical view, and then towards hostility to the WorldHealthOrganization.He wasaccused of “flirting with vaccine conspiracy”after falsely saying earlier this month that people were being told they needed to keep having Covid vaccinations every six months.Other senior figures, such as Richard Tice, have long raised doubts about the safety and necessity of the vaccine. Last month,it emergedthat a third of Reform’s council leaders across the country have expressed vaccine-sceptic views, openly questioning public health measures that keep millions safe.But such views in the party reached a nadir when a controversial doctor was given top billing at the Reform party conference and usedhis speechto claim the Covid vaccine caused cancer in members of the royal family.The speech was delivered by Aseem Malhotra, a British cardiologist who was appointed as a senior adviser to the US health secretary and vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy, and who was described by Reform’s chair, David Bull, as someone who had helped write the party’s health policy.The issue may continue to be the source of rifts in the party. Among 20 councillors who defected to the party last week – mainly from the Tories – was Dr Chandra Kanneganti, a former chair of the British International Doctors Association who has held policy leads at the British Medical Association and other respected health bodies.While he cited the cost of living, immigration and pressure on public services as the reasons for his defection, Kanneganti said he would also be seeking to share his experience when it came to developing Reform’s health policies and that he disagreed with the views expressed by figures such as Malhotra.“I have a national expertise on this and I will hopefully be involved in the discussions,” said Kanneganti, whowas at the forefrontof urging the public to get vaccinated and has spoken about how the pandemic exposed ethnic inequalities.“I have only just joined but I will hopefully be able to express my views and guide a policy that is actually evidence based,” he told the Guardian. “It’s about following the evidence, while at the same time not forcing people to accept something they disagree with.“Social media has a lot of false information on it but all the scientific evidence shows that getting vaccinated is much, much safer than not getting vaccinated; it’s about getting that point across.”As for Zahawi, he refused several times this week to say if he had been given any assurances on Reform’s position on vaccines before joining, but he did say: “I would not be sitting here, nor would Nigel be sitting next to me, if we didn’t agree we did the right thing to get the vaccine programme to the nation.”Bull, however, was more measured when he came under pressure in an interview last week on Talk TV from callers angry at Zahawi’s defection and his vaccines role.One man said he and his wife felt let down and no explanation would secure their vote or that of many of their friends.Bull replied: “Remember, Nadhim doesn’t have a formal role. He has just joined us. Nigel, Richard and I have not changed out stance on compulsory vaccines.”Explore more on these topicsNadhim ZahawiReform UKVaccines and immunisationCoronavirusHealth policyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Typically, the guidelines are released within six months of the secretaries receiving the dietary guidelines advisory committee’s report,” which should have meant they were released over the summer.Tortilla, broccoli, ‘a piece of chicken’: US agriculture secretary mocked for ‘money-saving’ mealRead moreAnderson said she was pleased to see that some things appeared to be in line with the DGA committee’s report, including an emphasis on eating “real food”, decreasing the amount of processed food in the diet, and decreasing added sugars. But she “grew concerned” when she saw the visual of the food pyramid with images of steak and cheese higher, larger and overall much more prominent than images of plant-based proteins like nuts. This visual contradicts the written guidelines on saturated fats.“I think it will be a challenge to keep saturated fat intake within 10% of overall kilocalories. Now, that, to me, is a confusing message for the American public,” Anderson said.Chloë Waterman – a senior program manager at Friends of the Earth who focuses on school lunches as well as the connection between diet and the environment – also said that the guidelines are contradictory and lack clarity. She suspects the confusion stems from an attempt to “please all stakeholders” – both public health experts and the Maha movement.Waterman said the guidelines are unclear because of the contradiction between the text and the visuals and also because “previous iterations of the guidelines were hundreds of pages long, and these guidelines are 10 pages. So, there’s only so much clarity you can fit into 10 pages.”Increased meat consumption would negatively impact the environment as well, Waterman added.“Americans already eat more protein than is recommended, and we’re one of the highest meat-consuming countries in the world. That level of meat consumption has a disastrous impact on the planet, because industrial animal agriculture is extremely resource intensive,” Waterman said.“When we are getting our calories from animal products, we are getting along with that a bunch of deforestation,” to create space to grow animal feed, as well as “emissions from the animals themselves. Beef and lamb especially have really high methane emissions,” Waterman added. Methaneemanates from the poop, burps and farts of cowsand other animals, and is 80times more potent than carbon dioxide.If Americans would consume more plant-based foods and proteins and less meat, Waterman said it would accomplish two goals at once.“We’re fortunate that those things actually align with each other, that if we shift our diets toward more plant-based foods, that’s going to be better for the environment and for health,” she said, noting that the new guidelines move in the opposite direction.It’s unclear how big an impact the guidelines will have on US adults’ behavior. Waterman said Americans have tended to ignore past iterations of the DGA that encourage more fruit and vegetable consumption, but “this could be different in the sense that people want to eat more meat and dairy”.Waterman is most concerned about how the guidelines will affect school lunches, as children who consume them don’t have control over whether to follow the guidelines or not. She said that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) must create rules to bring school lunches in compliance with the DGA. However, that process can take years, and Waterman imagines that it would be difficult to increase the amount of meat in school lunches, which are already “dominated by animal products” without also going above the 10% calories from saturated fat limit.If the USDA does somehow interpret the guidelines so that school lunches contain even more meat, “we’re going to see a devastating increase in diet-related chronic diseases for children,” like diabetes and metabolic syndrome, Waterman said. Kennedy has said that fighting childhood obesity is a major component of his Maha initiative. But, Waterman continued: “Promoting full-fat dairy and red meat, as depicted in the food pyramid, is going to have the opposite effect on childhood obesity as Kennedy intends.”Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrHealthTrump administrationUS politicsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

But the brand will still show on Monday, and there are other elder statesmen on the schedule in the shape of Ralph Lauren, 86, and Paul Smith, who will be 80 this year.Paul Smith showed his collection on Saturday evening atthe brand’s Italian HQ. Its playful nature was evident from the format as Smith himself compèred, with descriptions of the designs and inspirations over a microphone. The clothes demonstrated all the hallmarks that fans have come to love – bold prints, great suiting (this time oversized) and bright colours on sweaters and shirts.View image in fullscreenPaul Smith at his Milan fashion week show.Photograph: ShutterstockThis is the second time Smith has shown his menswear collection in Milan. At a preview, he explained the compère format was a homage to the shows he saw as a young man at the ateliers of Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent in the 1970s.“I really wanted to do a salon show,” he said. “Because we’re still an independent company, and I still own it, it’s so personal in today’s corporate world, I think it’s really interesting.”He said the collection had been partly inspired by collaborating with his new design director, Sam Cotton, and Cotton’s explorations of 5,000 designs found in the Paul Smith archive. “They come back and they go: ‘Look at this,’” he says. “I say: ‘I did that in 1982.’ ‘Yeah, but it’s bloody marvellous.’ And then we rework it.”Items judged to be “bloody marvellous” shown on Saturday include a jacket first seen in a 1999 collection, and a rust-coloured grandad shirt that, Smith says, “I dyed on a gas cooker in a saucepan.”Working with a different generation, but with items from the brand’s history, is perhaps a smart way to bring new customers to a label that began in 1970. But make no mistake – Smith is very much still the boss. “I get there at six every morning, I’m still completely involved. Nothing’s changed.”Like many brands, Paul Smith has felt the effect of a post-pandemic luxury slowdown, with turnover falling 7% in 2024.He warns that the latest news isn’t great either. “Our results this year won’t be very good at all,” he says. “But we’re here and we’re working it out, and we’re going to be fine.”View image in fullscreenA model at Ralph Lauren’s Menswear Fall/Winter 2026 show at Milan fashion week.Photograph: Alena Zakirova/Getty ImagesRalph Lauren, meanwhile, is more than fine – it’s one of fashion’s current success stories, partly thanks toa boom in preppy, a style that the brand has practically patented over nearly 60 years. Sales were up 11% in the first quarter of 2025, and the phrase “Ralph Lauren Christmas” was trending online this festive season.The show on Friday evening, which combined Polo with the more upmarket Purple label, felt like a celebration of all the style details that have fuelled the success of the label since it started in 1967. Although Lauren himself did not travel, his son David sat in the front row, along with Tom Hiddleston, Colman Domingo and Stranger Things’ Noah Schnapp, in a palazzo bought by Lauren in 1999.The show went through clothes to suit the lifestyle of a wealthy wasp, an American archetype that is now synonymous with the brand. There were the fleeces, sweatshirts and rugby shirts of weekend wear, suits for the office and a night at the opera, and even the puffer jackets and boots of a skiing holiday.As if to underline the point, the brand will be in Milan again in February – this time to dress Team USA for the Winter Olympics.Explore more on these topicsMilan fashion weekFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

On the other, a full moon.The ice shelf is “flat and white”, says Galton-Fenzi. “If there’s cloud around, you lose the horizon.”With temperatures at -20C and a wind chill threatening frostbite, Galton-Fenzi was there in the summer months of 2018-2019 to retrieve radar instruments that were checking the thickness of the ice.But Galton-Fenzi’s concern isn’t what’s happening on top of the ice. It’s what is happening almost two kilometres below his feet where the ocean meets the ice he is standing on.For Antarctic scientists, getting a handle on what’s happening under the ice shelves is urgent because the fate of the planet’s coastlines will depend on how fast they melt.View image in fullscreenDr Ben Galton-Fenzi (pictured) estimates that Antarctica’s ice shelves lose about 843bn tonnes of mass every year.Photograph: Paul WinberryAntarctica has more than 70 ice shelves that extend the continent’s vast ice sheet out over the ocean.Covering about 1.5m sq km, ice shelves float on the water and don’t by themselves push up global sea levels if they melt.But if global heating of the ocean melts them from underneath they could become unstable, allowing the ice sheet to slide faster into the ocean, pushing up global sea levels by several metres.The continent’s most vulnerable regions alone haveenough ice to push up sea levels by about 15 metres if they all melt.Galton-Fenzi, a principal research scientist at the Australian Antarctic Division, lednew research bringing together modelling workon this “basal melt rate” from nine groups around the world.“We need to know because the ocean-driven mass loss is one of the biggest uncertainties in Antarctica ice sheet projections and, therefore, in global sea level rise,” says Galton-Fenzi.View image in fullscreenThe equivalent of 843 giant ice cubes – each a kilometre long, wide and deep – has been lost from Antarctica’s ice shelves.Photograph: Tas van OmmenTaking the nine different models together, Galton-Fenzi and colleagues estimate that over recent decades the continent’s ice shelves lost about 843bn tonnes of mass every year from melting underneath.That is the equivalent of 843 giant ice cubes – each a kilometre long, wide and deep – all melting. It is about the same amount of water that flows from the Nile River into the ocean each year.The results of the analysis – which took a decade to pull together – will help refine future modelling.Antarctica’s ice shelves lose mass when the edges calve into the ocean, but they also gain it from snowfall. Confusing matters even further, there isevidence global heating has caused higher snowfall over the continent.Scientists map Antarctic seafloor canyons to help predict climate breakdownRead moreOnecomprehensive analysis of Antarctica’s entire ice sheetfound that, on balance, satellite data suggested the continent lost 93bn tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2020.Galton-Fenzi says: “Knowing the role of the ocean in driving the mass loss and how that feeds back into the flow of the ice into the ocean is a key problem that a lot of nations are working on.“We do know with very high confidence what the sign of the change will be. The ice sheets will keep losing mass. It is how fast and how much is where the uncertainty is.”Coldest water on EarthAt the ocean surface, seawater freezes at about -1.9C but under an ice shelf where the water can be a kilometre or more down, the pressure means the ocean water doesn’t freeze until about -2.2C.“The coldest water anywhere in the ocean is beneath the Antarctic ice shelves. There is no light,” says Dr Steve Rintoul, an oceanographer and leading Antarctic expert at the Australian government’s science agency, the CSIRO.“All our conventional tools to measure the ocean can’t reach it,” he says.View image in fullscreenResearchers setting up instruments at Totten glacier.Photograph: Nick Morgan“Satellites can’t reach it because it’s covered in ice. Ships can’t get in. The shelves are surrounded by heavy sea ice and they’re often heavily crevassed on the surface. Even if you could drill a hole, it’s challenging to get people there.”Only a handful of holes have been drilled and they can only provide data on what conditions look like in one place amida vast undersea freezing landscape.But Rintoul’s team got lucky. Scientists use autonomous floating instruments known as Argo floats to measure ocean temperatures and salinity around the world. Rintoul and colleagues deployed one underneath the Totten ice shelf but it drifted away, spending nine months instead under two other ice shelves more than 300 metres thick.The float’s datashowed that one of those shelves– the Denman – was being exposed to warm water that was melting it from below.Rintoul says the Denman catchment holds enough water to cause 1.5 metres of global sea level rise.“Its configuration is such that once it gets past a certain point it can retreat in an unstable way without any more [influence] from the ocean.”View image in fullscreenThe relative shortage of data means there are large uncertainties about how quickly the ice shelves will change.Photograph: Ben Galton FenziIn the geological past when the Earth was covered by more ice than today, the glaciers of Antarctica carved giant canyons as they expanded.“They were seeding their own demise, because that’s a deep channel that the warm water can come into,” says Rintoul.Urgent questionsDr Sue Cook, a glaciologist at the University of Tasmania, says in any normal healthy ice sheet, there would be melting from below.But the relative shortage of data means there are large uncertainties about how quickly the ice shelves will change, which means some of the more extreme impacts on the planet are difficult to rule out – not just those that could alter coastlines.A tent, an electric stove and -40C temperatures: the chefs who cook ‘on ice’ in AntarcticaRead moreCook points to another “really urgent question” around Antarctica: how the increasing amounts of meltwater could slow down major ocean circulations thatcould have profound impacts around the world.“That could disrupt some of the very large scale ocean currents, but we really don’t know if it will happen or not. So the models can help us to look into the future.“This ocean conveyor belt is what helps the climate to stay relatively stable. If it gets disrupted, then the consequences could be dramatic.”Cook adds: “We don’t have the full understanding that we need to predict the future changes.”Rintoul says while some of the impacts – such as extreme sea level rise – could take centuries of melting, “we commit to that ice loss much sooner than that”.“It depends how much greenhouse gas we emit. There’s a reason the international community came up with temperature targets – they came in large part because of the risk of destabilising the Antarctic ice sheet.“It changes the map and we can’t put the genie back in the bottle.”Explore more on these topicsAntarcticaOceansGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisClimate sciencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

On 22 March 2016, the Australian expat was due to check in for a flight when Islamic State suicide bombers detonated two nailbombs inside Brussels airport. Miraculously unharmed, she sprinted to the exit after the second blast exploded metres away from her – but then, risking her life, decided to turn back.Screams, wailing alarms and a thick blanket of dust choked the air. The ceiling had caved in. “It turned from buzzing with life to a war zone. It’s horrific, absolutely horrific,” Weemaes-Sutcliffe says.Without hesitation, she crawled over debris and bodies to tend to the wounded, tying tourniquets to stop mutilated survivors bleeding out, comforting them and calling their loved ones to let them know what had happened.In the aftermath of mass violence, the instinctive actions of ordinary people such as Weemaes-Sutcliffe offer a counterpoint to horror – flashes of courage that become symbols of hope. Off-duty nurse Lynne Beavis ran towards gunfire rather than to safety during the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmaniato help the wounded; holidaymakers Richard Joyes and Timothy Britten rushed into a burning nightclub in the wake of the Bali Bombings, rail workerSamir Zitouni blocked a knife-wielding attackeron a high-speed train in Cambridgeshire, saving lives and risking his own.View image in fullscreenAhmed al Ahmed, the man who tackled and disarmed one of the Bondi beach attackers, stands for the national anthems alongside other first responders after receiving a guard of honour for their service, on day one of the fifth Ashes cricket Test match between Australia and England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) in Sydney on January 4, 2026.Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty ImagesThen there are the bystanders immortalised in the international mediaby the everyday objects they wielded to halt violence. French citizen Damien Guerot became“Bollard Man”after he confronted the Bondi Junction attacker, who killed six people, in 2024. The Australiangovernment granted him permanent residency for his bravery. In Melbourne in 2018 it was “Trolley Man” Michael Rodgers who fended off a knife attacker with a shopping trolley. Rodgers, homeless at the time,received more than $155,000 in donationsbefore deciding to turn himself in to police on historical theft and burglary charges.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAnd then, perhaps most starkly, there is the case of Syrian-born Ahmed al-Ahmed, who rose to international fame after he was filmed wresting a rifle from a shooter during Australia’s deadliest terror attack that last month killed 15 people at Sydney’s Bondi beach.In the days that followed, a revolving door of politicians stood by his hospital bedside and praised his heroism. This month heopened a cricket match to a roaring ovation, and made a whirlwind visit to the United States that included attending a Jewish gala dinner, media interviews and meeting members of Congress. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe has so far raised more than $2.65m to support his recovery.But what happens to these people crowned heroes once the headlines fade?A year after the Brussels attack Weemaes-Sutcliffe was awarded an Australian Commendation for her bravery, but that recognition has done little to quell the trauma she has endured.Amid the chaos of the airport attack, Weemaes-Sutcliffe tried to heave a beam that had fallen from the ceiling and pinned a man to the ground. It was too heavy to lift. “I had to turn around and leave him there to die,” she says. “You question every single detail – it’s like, could I have done more?”‘They’ve never spoken to anyone’“Society is well practised at recognising acts of bravery but poorly equipped in identifying or addressing the negative consequences,” says Dr Thomas Voigt, who interviewed 24 Australian bravery award recipients for his PhD studying the consequences of heroism.Nearly 90% of award recipients Voigt interviewed were either diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder or displayed symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome (a similar but less severe condition). One-third suffered financial hardship because they became unemployed or worked reduced hours because of their condition.For Voigt, the subject isn’t just academic. In 1998, he was working at a community health centre when a drunk patient drew a loaded double barrel sawn-off shotgun on staff. Without thinking, he rushed towards the gunman. “I remember it in very slow motion. I took eight steps to get to him, the gun being waved in all directions” he says. Voigt then crash-tackled the gunman to the ground and disarmed him. No one was hurt.Caught up in a violent attack, would you be a hero – or would you run? Both can be valuable | Emma KavanaghRead moreThe ordeal earned him an Australian bravery medal but cost him too. He developed PTSD symptoms that still linger today, 28 years later.“Generally speaking, there’s lots of media attention and lots of hype, you get your award but then there’s nothing,” Voigt says. Emergency services staff involved in traumatic events receive structured support, but no formal dedicated services exist for civilians; 71% of those interviewed by Voigt received no formal intervention or support after their act of bravery.“Evidence tells us that the best way to address trauma is by intervening within the first three to six months,” he says. “I’m seeing people who responded to an incident 10 years ago and they’ve never spoken to anyone.”‘The spotlight moves on’It was Wednesday, 30 July 1997, when thousands of tonnes of liquefied earth descended upon two Thredbo ski lodges, in the New South Wales alpine region,burying 19 people. In the aftermath Dr Fiona Reynolds, then an ABC reporter, rubbed shoulders with victims’ family members as they watched rescue crews dig through the rubble, desperately hoping that their loved ones would be found alive.“And there I am, standing in their space, looking for the next story angle,” Reynolds says.That experience led Reynolds to research how people survive traumatic events in the media spotlight, publishing a PhD in 2019. After mass casualty events, media coverage can help make sense of tragedy but also exacerbate trauma for survivors and grieving families, Reynolds says.View image in fullscreenStuart Diver, a ski instructor, is carried on a stretcher after being pulled from the ruins of two ski lodges, destroyed by a landslide at Thredbo in 1997 .Photograph: Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty ImagesOn day three of the search, sole survivor Stuart Diver was found and quickly elevated to hero status. “It was an extraordinarily uncomfortable label for him, given the loss of 18 lives, including his wife, Sally. That was not the time to shine.” Reynolds says.Diver became an “accidental celebrity”, an ordinary person who is unwittingly thrust into the spotlight at the cost of their privacy and agency, often compounding feelings of helplessness associated with trauma.Crowd roars in standing ovation for Bondi hero Ahmed al-Ahmed at sold-out Ashes Test in SydneyRead moreIn general,media and public attention can destabilise one’s very identity. “When you are held up as a hero type, you can naturally feel very special,” Reynolds says. “Then the spotlight moves on. For some people that’s welcome, but others feel suddenly unimportant and even discarded.”“One day everybody wants to know you, the next everybody wants to know somebody else.”The impulse to crown a hero in moments of terror is as ancient as it is universal, says the University of Sydney academic and former journalist Prof Catharine Lumby. In the wake of unimaginable violence, society often divides events into familiar categories of victims, villains and heroes.“It’s a kind of oversimplification of a chaotic event but is also a way of processing uncertainty,” Lumby says.These narratives serve to restore “moral order” when institutions and social norms appear to fail, but can also compress complexity, flattening people into one-dimensional heroes and forever attaching them to the traumatic event, she says.Once the public story has been told, the question for survivors is how – or whether – to reclaim meaning on their own terms.Post-traumatic growthOf the civilian bravery awardees interviewed by Voigt, one in five expressed doubt as to whether, if put in the situation again, they would act the same way. It’s a thought that has crossed Weemaes-Sutcliffe’s mind.“After the bombings, I probably wished I hadn’t gone back in [to the airport], because I fucked up my life,” she says, describing years marked by intrusive memories, panic and enduring guilt for those she could not save.View image in fullscreenAnneke Weemaes-Sutcliffe at home in Melbourne.

For some that materialises in pursuing a passion or sudden urge to tick items off the bucket list, Voigt says.For Weemaes-Sutcliffe it’s a greater appreciation for the small joys of life: that glass of wine after work, morning coffee or delicious piece of cake.“Because you just never know what will happen tomorrow,” she says. “One day it might be you.”Explore more on these topicsPsychologyCrime - AustraliaPost-traumatic stress disorderMental healthBondi Junction stabbingsBondi beach terror attackfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How can you keep them strong and pain free for longer?Bianca NogradySat 17 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 20.59 ESTShareDentists have trained us well to visit them on a regular basis for a check-up, rather than waiting until things start to hurt. Hylton Menz, a professor of podiatry at La Trobe University in Melbourne, wishes we’d do the same for our feet.“We probably ignore our feet relative to other parts of our body, because we stick them in shoes and they’re a long way away, so we tend to forget about feet,” he says. “It’s only really when they don’t actually function properly – so when they become painful, they don’t do what we want them to do – that we really think about them.”About one quarter of all the bones in our body are in our feet, connected by 33 joints and more than 100 tendons and ligaments. Our feet aremarvels of engineering, but we tend to treat them like a neglected cart horse. Experts tell us how we can give the foot some much-needed care.Sensible shoes“The worst ankle injury I have ever seen was a woman in her early 20s who had got very inebriated wearing four-inch heels, and she fell off her heel and she destroyed her ankle,” says physiotherapist Dr Kathryn Mills, from Kensington Physiotherapy and Macquarie University in Sydney. She says ankle injuries tend to increase in the silly season, thanks to a combination of party shoes and alcohol.The Venn diagram of fashion and foot health overlap by a slim margin, but when it comes to looking after our feet and ankles, we need to decide which of those two circles we value more. Physiotherapist Dr Jillian Eyles, from the University of Sydney, advises choosing health. “Stuffing your feet into pointy-toe shoes and wearing high heels all the time is probably not going to be great for your feet and your ankles,” she says.Find the right shoe for youWhat constitutes the right footwear varies enormously according to age, activity and personal preference, according to Menz. “It’s important that that shoes are actually shaped like your foot, which sounds obvious, but a lot of shoes aren’t,” he says.‘They don’t have a nice socket structure’: how to really look after your kneesRead moreShoes should also bend where the foot bends, around the ball of the foot, Menz says, which will make them more comfortable. But comfort isn’t always an indicator that a shoe is good for your needs. Elderly people, for example, might find a thick, soft sole more comfortable, but that will also be less stable and could increase the risk of falls. Instead, they should choose a thinner firmer-soled shoe, so they are better able to feel the ground, and also look for slip-resistant soles. Similarly, slip-on shoes might be easier to put on, but they also hold the foot less securely, which can also increase the risk of falls.It’s also important to vary your footwear, says Mills. “What you want to do is have as many pairs of shoes as you can afford and rotate between them, in terms of your physical activity shoes, because different shoes will do different things.”Watch your weightOur entire body weight rests on the soles of our feet, so maintaining a healthy weight is an important part of looking after our feet.It’s not just for mechanical reasons but also metabolic, Menz says. “There’s really good evidence now that adipose tissue – fat tissue – is active stuff, so it tends to become activated on nerve endings, so there’s a really stronglinkbetween foot pain and being overweight,” he says. “There’s lots of benefits to having a healthy body weight, and one of the benefits is you’re far less likely to get foot pain.”Foot strengthWe spend so much time on our feet yet rarely think of them as a body part that needs exercising. But there are some foot exercises that can help maintain the big and small muscles in the foot that are critical for balance and movement.“Even some simple things, like trying to form an arch with your foot, so keeping your toes on the ground and trying to lift up your arch, helps to engage those deeper muscles in your foot,” says Assoc Prof Natalie Collins, a sports and exercise physiotherapist at the University of Queensland. She also suggests doing calf raises – rising up on to the ball of the foot – to strengthen the foot, ankle and lower limb.Mills adds that standing on a towel and trying to scrunch it up into a ball with your toes, or trying to move your big toe independently out about half a centimetre from the other toes and back in, are both good activities to strengthen the muscles that go from the outside of the foot inwards.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe way you moveFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then she fell hard for DougFind more stories fromthe moment I knew seriesAs told toDoosie MorrisSat 17 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 20.54 ESTShareIn 2015 I was in my early 20s and living in New York City, working as a journalist and moonlighting as a comedian. My dating life wasnotgoing well, and my poor little heart had taken a beating.Datingin the city had set the bar very low. But even if it hadn’t, Douglas would’ve stepped right over it.On our first date, something felt different. For one thing, I spent the entire time talking, rather than smiling and nodding when appropriate. Instead of knocking back a series of drinks just to get through it, I found myself nursing a single cocktail the entire evening as I fielded his questions about my opinions and aspirations. Compared with the self-indulgent jerks I usually suffered through dates with, Doug’s common decency was a revelation. I even phoned my mum on the way home to gush about him.The moment I knew: huddled under a spooky bridge by the Canal de l’Ourcq, we were like two little penguinsRead moreWeeks went by before we arranged a second date, but when he kissed me on that crisp autumn night in Brooklyn Bridge Park after a perfect evening of Italian food, ice-cream and debating politics, a rogue thought crashed unbidden into my mind: “You’re kissing the man you’re going to marry.” I didn’t think I was looking for anything as serious as a husband, but the thought was so loud and so clear, I journalled about it that night.Things were going well and I fell for him hard. A few weeks later we were meeting for dinner at a dumpling place in Williamsburg; as soon as he arrived I sensed something was off. When we finally sat down he said he’d been offered a job in Melbourne, Australia. My stomach sank. I cried all the way home in the cab then called my mum, sobbing.I was shocked by how upset I was and I knew that I couldn’t let him go so easily. My mother, being the hopeless romantic she is, endorsed this folly completely. “Well, it’s simple,” she said. “I guess you’re going to Australia.”I was unhappy in my job and on our first date I’d jokingly told Doug not to get too attached, as I planned to quit and backpack around the world, starting in Australia. I figured I could leverage this to explain what I did next.As he prepared for his move to Melbourne I casually told him I was heading to Sydney on a work-holiday visa. In my mind, the distance between Sydney and Melbourne was enough that I could play down any creepy stalker vibes. But when Sydney didn’t work out and I moved to Melbourne a few months later, my claims that it was for the comedy scene felt flimsy, even to me.If life was a romcom it would have been fine, but in reality I had effectively hunted this man across the globe and frankly, he was a little freaked out. Doug took my impulsivity as a possible red flag and tried to keep things casual.View image in fullscreenMel McGlensey with Doug at their wedding in California in 2023.Photograph: Danielle Elizabeth PuringtonBut a few months later, as I prepared to head back to grad school in Chicago, his trepidation dissolved and he finally realised he felt as strongly as I did. The day I left Melbourne we had one of the most heartfelt and heartbreaking farewells in history, but he promised we’d meet again.As I licked my wounds on a stopover in Thailand, he sent me a playlist. Every song said something about us and as I listened, weeping, on the plane I knew our story was far from over. By the time I landed in Chicago, instead of breaking up like I’d assumed we would, we went exclusive and did long distance for two punishing years.I moved back to Melbourne months before Covid lockdowns began. My career as a live performer stalled and I sunk into a deep depression. But through it all, Doug was a ray of sunshine. He’s not an animal guy but when our guest room lay empty for months thanks to travel restrictions, he let me fill it with foster kittens. After years of being on the other side of the world, we became the whole world to each other.Doug proposed in 2022 on the beach at Inverloch with a sapphire the colour of the ocean. The night before we were married, I crawled into bed with my journal and read him that entry from our second date, for the first time. We love our life in Melbourne and every day I am grateful I followed my heart, all the way to the other side of the world.

When she hit her ‘goal weight’ and still didn’t feel happy, a supportive online community showed her a new way to liveKate LloydSat 17 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 07.02 ESTShareMegan Jayne Crabbe’s transformation goes beyond the physical. “My ‘before’ was trying to make myself as small as possible in every conceivable way: my body, voice, emotions, opinions,” she says. “My ‘after’ is allowing myself to be my biggest self, however that looks.”Crabbe, 31, became aware of diets before she turned 10. As she entered puberty that intensified and she became fixated on magazine articles about how to change her body, eating as little as possible as a way to manage anxiety about school and growing up.At 14 Crabbe was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphia: “I was convinced I was fat and disgusting and needed to lose more weight.” For years she concealed how unwell she was, until the physical symptoms became impossible to ignore. Her body began shutting down – severe fatigue, low blood pressure, hearing loss and dizziness: “There’s hair that grows all over your body, because it’s trying to keep itself warm.”She spent several months between mental health facilities and hospital. At her lowest point, after her parents were warned her body could fail at any moment, she was hospitalised and fed through a tube. “In that time where your eating disorder is saying to you, ‘You have to stay in control’, having that taken away is torturous.”View image in fullscreenCrabbe: ‘I’m strong. I’m fit. I can do everything I want to.’Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianThe first shift towards recovery came when her father, usually stoic, broke down in tears. “Seeing the pain my eating disorder had caused him was a massive jolt for me,” she says. She committed to recovery with the same “all or nothing” mindset that had once fuelled her anorexia. “I covered up all the mirrors in the house because I didn’t want to see my body changing, and I couldn’t eat in front of other people yet, but I ate meals by myself.”By 17, she was declared recovered. “Not the case,” she says. “I was sent back into the world in this newly soft, larger body, and I didn’t know what to do with that. I fell straight back into the diet culture trap.”The turning point came at 21. “I had been crash dieting all summer, had reached my elusive ‘goal weight’ and I still hated everything about how I looked. Something started to click in my brain of, ‘Wait, this isn’t working.’”She discovered the online body positive community – “People of all shapes and sizes saying, I’m not dieting, not hating my body, I’m wearing what I want, living my life” – and a decade on is one of its leading voices. She’s seen grinning in a swimming costume in Little Mix’s Strip video, celebrating her body’s softness on Instagram and has written books on self‑empowerment. Getting here took reshaping her cultural environment: setting boundaries with friends who talked about weight loss, disengaging from influencers who triggered shame, and reading books such as The Beauty Myth andHealthat Every Size.“I started realising the problem was not me. The problem was how we are taught to see ourselves.” Reconnecting with her body became central to healing: relearning hunger and fullness cues and moving for enjoyment. “My eating disorder years were trying to detach from my body and feel nothing. And now the goal is to be with my body and listen to her.“If I look back at my ancestors, this is the body they had. I’m strong. I’m fit. I can do everything I want to, and I can also enjoy food as a nice part of my life that I don’t obsess over.”Megan Jayne Crabbe’s bookWe Don’t Make Ourselves Smaller Hereis out now.Explore more on these topicsBody imageChanged body, changed lifeHealth & wellbeingAnorexiaEating disordersMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, wrote an open letter to fans on Saturday morning, the tone of which was supportive, the overriding message being a call for patience.But the drama of the West Ham game, when Spurs fell to a stoppage-time winner from the substitute Callum Wilson, has led the club to wonder whether they can persist with Frank.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The mood inside the stadium was toxic, with fans booing at various points of the game, including half-time and full-time. They jeered Frank for his decision to substitute the winger Mathys Tel in the 62nd minute as they trailed 1-0, although Cristian Romero equalised straight after that. The “sacked in the morning” chant followed Wilson’s winner.Romero pulled no punches with his post-match assessment. “At this moment this is a disaster for us,” he said. “We played sometimes good, sometimes bad. We must work hard and go again. It’s a difficult moment for us. We are not the best on the pitch.”View image in fullscreenCristian Romero equalised for Tottenham but was left dejected by West Ham’s late winner.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersSpurs brought the former Ajax manager John Heitinga on to Frank’s coaching staff this week to replace the assistant Matt Wells, who left before Christmas to become the head coach at the Colorado Rapids. Frank said he had driven the appointment, despite the suggestion that Heitinga could potentially replace him on a caretaker basis if results did not improve.Frank said after the West Ham game that he retained the faith of the hierarchy and would turn around what he described as a “supertanker” of a club. He did not sugar-coat the blow but said he had taken heart from Venkatesham’s letter. The defeat kept Spurs 14th in the Premier League. Frank’s team have won just three of their past 15 matches in the competition.“I have seen the letter and I took six to eight positive things out of it,” Frank said. “What I take out of that letter is that we are a club and an executive team with Vinai on top that are aligned and know this is a big transitional phase.“It’s a supertanker we’re turning in the right direction and there are a lot of good signs behind the scenes and also in some of the performances. But, of course, when you lose last-minute to one of your rivals, it is very emotional and there will be noise. That noise we need to keep out there and get our head down and keep walking, keep doing the right thing.“Of course, I’ve probably had better times. But I understand [the chant]. I’m the man in charge. So the blame will go to me. That’s fair, no problem in that sense. If you’re not winning enough, we know you will not get enough support from the fans. But when we’re winning, it will change … when we start winning again. Which we will do. I’m not in doubt of that.“It seems to be the perfect storm at the moment in many ways. We have a last-minute defeat when everyone feels that everyone has given everything, including the fans, to back the team. You get a sucker punch in injury time and it’s unbelievably tough to take. You have to keep going. You can’t feel sorry for yourself.”After Romero’s goal, it looked as though Spurs might go on to win. But Frank was left to lament the biggest single failing of his tenure – the lack of cutting edge from the attacking players.Wilson’s last-gasp West Ham winner deepens Frank’s Tottenham crisisRead more“It’s a sign that the goal is scored by Cuti, our captain and centre-back,” he said. “And we didn’t have enough chances or the cutting edge from the offensive players. That, of course, is no criticism, it’s just reality. We didn’t have the cutting edge, the perfect weighted pass, the sharp finish. We need to keep working on that.”Frank did say the players were still fighting, despite three defeats in a row. “Let’s say the previous two games – against Bournemouth in the league and Aston Villa in the FA Cup – and now the game here. If the players stop running or stop doing anything or are not working hard and we are not the team that’s closest to winning … then you can say: ‘OK’. But the team is working very hard. And I still think, and I know it sounds a little bit crazy, that we are closer to something very good, than further away.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Coveted talent like Antoine Semenyo and now Marc Guéhi opt for blue when a generation ago, Old Trafford was the destination of dreams.United’s myth and legend becomes increasingly sepia-tinged but there may be life in it yet. The list of Sir Alex Ferguson’s boys able to take the reins in times of emergency is being exhausted but Michael Carrick,on his second turn, found a way to feed off it. He has just 17 games though there is a tantalising prize on offer. A return to the Champions League looks possible. Rather than embracing the void, Carrick’s United reminded that sporting directors, analytic departments and strategic reviews may have their place in the eventual restoration of power, but dogged spirit, wanting it more, can win the day.Carrick has dream start as Mbeumo and Dorgu give Manchester United derby delightRead moreOn Fergie’s face a broad smile, while a haunted, defeated Pep Guardiola, City’s chances of reclaiming the title dwindling to dust, rocking back into his cushioned seat, was delicious for United followers. As was the sullen departure of Erling Haaland, loping off with 10 minutes left, finally rid of Lisandro Martínez and Harry Maguire checking his every move. As City fans of a certain age will recall, the failures of rivals can be almost as sweet as sustained success. Your team actually delivering mortal blows is sweeter still.Ruben Amorim was the manager who never appeared to remotely believe in the United legend. Reliving former glories is not nearly enough, as the past 13 years have shown, but snotting City will do fine for now. And perhaps the players for whom Amorim showed such distaste have more to offer than he was prepared to admit. Free at last from three-at-the-back – Bruno Fernandes asked to supply key passes instead of ratting round midfield – who would have thought that United’s players might find a way to express themselves?A Stretford End flag day showed the United legacy still burns among the die-hards. In response, and until their team began to malfunction, those in the City end showed the braggadocio success will bring, all smirks and jibes. Where, until 2011, a ticker counting back the years since City had won a trophy - it reached 35 - the number 115 was brandished in the stand’s lower reaches. That United fans hope to wipe away their lost decadevia a legal processthat shows no sign of reaching a conclusion is a source of considerable amusement for those in blue.View image in fullscreenKobbie Mainoo, hampered by Antoine Semenyo, whose rejection by Amorim was a key indicator the former manager had little interest in club traditions, showed flashes of his old magic.Photograph: Neal Simpson/Getty Images/AllstarBeyond the institutional stuff, the company law, the political economy of nation states and petrochemical billionaires, how about some actual football? Old Trafford crackled as of old from the early stages, the rafters shaking when Maguire nodded against the crossbar. Guardiola scratching his cranium distractedly was a positive sign, as was Gianluigi Donnarumma twice having to bail out dozing City defenders. Alongside him, with hands behind his back, clad in the type of black overcoat his old boss once wore, Carrick paced calmly, far less demonstrative than an opposite number becoming ever more anxious.“Use the energy of the people” had been Carrick’s advice to his players, words he would have heard many times as a United player. Such a rallying call will not work every time, there will be occasions the crowd cannot provide the fuel, but a Manchester derby was just the place to employ it.‘A version of normal’: Carrick asks for consistency after Manchester derby triumphRead moreIt undoubtedly helped United that this is not the City team of three years ago, despite almost £500m being spent on renovations in the last calendar year. In a frantic first half, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, both making welcome returns from Morocco, were the outlets for a series of wildcat counters. Kobbie Mainoo, whose rejection by Amorim was a key indicator the former manager had little interest nor understanding of club traditions, showed flashes, too, digging in with Casemiro against City’s old firm of Rodri, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva. The trio’s class became lost amid the frenzy.United pressed hard, stayed compact as a unit, and by doing so, occasioned on the better chances. Abdukodir Khusanov and Max Alleyne in central defence, callow to say the least, suggested just whyGuéhi has been signed. Nico O’Reilly, the substitute only 30 Premier League games into his career, approaches positive veteran status.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola shows his frustration as City’s title ambitions slip away at Old Trafford.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesGuardiola, who offered a manly embrace to Khusanov after a touchline tackle, clearly enjoys his role in establishing the next generation for a time beyond his tenure but, for all those players’ bright futures, City are struggling to live in the present. Rico Lewis was horribly culpable for United’s second, beaten soundly to the punch by Patrick Dorgu.City are struggling with the discipline of attempting to stay successful while in a rebuilding process. Not every City signing has paid off, there has been significant wastage. At least Donnarumma, the keeper who was not supposed to suit the Guardiola doctrines, has been a palpable hit. Without him, City’s defeat would have come far earlier.Donnarumma’s second-half double save from Amad and then Casemiro reminded that for all the high-minded ideals of a ball-playing keeper, making saves will always be the most important part of the job. That the Italian was celebrating his stops so demonstratively was evidence of the increasing pressure and emotional energy City eventually collapsed underneath.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedManchester CityMichael CarrickanalysisShareReuse this content"

That’s how it feels like right now.“We played quite well and I think my players left their hearts on the pitch but I couldn’t support them from the bench,” said Glasner who failed to make a single substitution as his side were sunk by goals from Enzo Le Fée and Brian Brobbey after Yéremy Pino had given them the lead against the run of play.“We feel that we’re being abandoned. There’s no support. Everybody’s disappointed. We’ve been playing with 12 to 13 players for weeks now. On the bench I had just kids. They had never played in a stadium with an atmosphere like this.“Why I’m saying this is not to protect myself but to protect them. They need protecting. I made no substitutions because it would have been unfair. I see them in training every day. That’s where we are. The [senior] players need support.”Glasner suggested that the slenderness of a squad he believes is in urgent need of reinforcement is responsible for a disastrous run that last week saw Palacebow out of the FA Cup to non-league Macclesfield.“We’ve known we’re in this situation for weeks, for months now,” he said. “What are we doing? We’re selling our captain [Guéhi] one day before a game. One day before a game, the first time I heard about it was 10.30am yesterday. All the set pieces, everything was prepared for Guéhi playing.“Then, we had to change everything. Nobody told us. So then I have to stand in front of the group and tell them, ‘oh, the captain doesn’t play tomorrow’.“I think the players did well in the circumstances. I’m so direct today because I feel I have to protect them.”Glasner at least believes relegation can be avoided this season. “I feel we will get these few more points we will need to not get relegated,” he said. “But I know the players are not happy and satisfied. I don’t need support butCrystal Palaceneeds it.”Asked how he could stay on while this unhappy, Palace’s manager replied. “Because the players deserve it. The players and the fans deserve it 100%. For me it’s now about fighting with these players to get the results back. But they deserve Oliver Glasner now to be their leader.“But to protect them I have to say this in public. Saying these things behind closed doors makes no sense. And this is maybe the last try to get things done that have to get done. And, if we continue doing this, Crystal Palace, not Oliver Glasner will get the bill. If you’re fine with that continue.”Questioned as to whether he expected a “reaction” from the board he said: “I don’t know. It’s their club.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

They may only be five points clear of the relegation zone, afterWest Ham’s last-gasp win at Tottenham, but Sean Dyche was understandably proud of his team’s efforts that suggest Forest are moving in the right direction.Aina did appear to move his arm towards a right-wing cross that initially struck his shoulder and would have led to anotherArsenalcorner. And everyone knows where that so often leads.Nottingham Forest v Arsenal: Premier League – liveRead moreArteta was told that the video assistant referee had adjudged there should be no penalty as the ball ricocheted off Aina’s shoulder on to his arm. “They are right that it hits the shoulder,” the Arsenal manager said, “[but] then he takes the ball with a hand. So their explanation is not right. The order is OK but the timing and the intention of the player is very clear. So in my opinion, it’s a very clear penalty.”Afterthe goalless draw with Liverpoolbefore their cup adventures, this is only the third time Arsenal have failed to score in two successive league games since 2022/23 and, on each occasion, Forest have been the second opponents.This game had been summed up neatly in the 82nd minute when two Forest players hunted down Gabriel Jesus as the Arsenal substitute tried to see the ball out for a throw-in. Elliot Anderson was not settling for that, crashing into the tackle that won his team the restart. Sixty yards down the touchline, Dyche clapped his hands above his head; Arteta reached out to either side, palms raised to the skies in incredulity that his team could get so legally bullied.Yet such is the way of this season. Just as the opportunity knocked, withManchester City losing to Manchester Unitedearlier in the day, for Arsenal to stretch their lead at the top, with Forest seemingly on the ropes after only one win in six games, up comes the underdog with a feisty performance to sum up this manager.If the jury is still out on Dyche despite the positive start to his reign, then this was the kind of performance to get the Forest faithful back onside.Arsenal, in contrast, appeared well in control of their destiny and, able to rotate their wide players, tested Forest’s vulnerability from set-pieces with two superb corners in the early moments. Declan Rice almost netted with his stomach from another cross, from Ben White, and both Gabriel Martinelli and Martín Zubimendi should have scored when getting on the end of Noni Madueke’s sense of creativity.Forest, having ended a four-game losing streakby winning at West Ham11 days ago, rallied after this challenging first half hour. As they got a foothold in the game, Michael Oliver, the referee, made an astute close call when awarding a free-kick just outside the area after Callum Hudson-Odoi was tripped by Jurriën Timber.View image in fullscreenMikel Merino contends for the ball along with teammate Gabriel as Nottingham Forest defend resolutely.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesDyche compared this penalty claim with Arsenal’s for Aina’s alleged handling offence. “It hits our player on the arm and you’re like, ‘Where does this live?’ We’ve got to be careful with all this.“I thought we had a really good shout. Callum’s gone in, he’s in mid-flow. He’s going into the box [so] to decide the moment of contact is a tight call. If that was on them, I’d be buzzing to get that one. I’d be singing hallelujah.”When Forest continued in the ascendancy at the start of the second half, Arteta took decisive action and made four changes by the hour mark.Bukayo Saka immediately made a difference. He scampered down the right wing to pull his cross back for Rice, whose volley, tipped aside by Matz Sels, was Arsenal’s first effort on target – in the 59th minute.When Rice returned the favour from the other flank, Saka’s header was brilliantly turned aside by Sels at full stretch. Then Saka crossed and MikelMerino’s header needed brushing behind. Suddenly, it was all Arsenal.Forest were on a good night, however. They tend to be when Ibrahim Sangaré plays. Dyche’s team have only lost twice in the 12 games when the Ivorian midfielder has featured, and missed him badly when he was away at the Africa Cup of Nations. He provided the glue in this gritty performance, holding in front of the defence, nicking 50/50s and with the corollary of allowing Anderson, Forest’s best player, more freedom to go foraging.Arteta was not unduly disheartened. “Every week is an opportunity,” he said. “We want to win every game. But we made a smaller step, not the one that we wanted, but it’s a step.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

With the Sunday start, the Australian Open’s first round is now split across three days, so Raducanu’s first match could have been played on Monday.Alcaraz chases history at Australian Open despite split while women’s draw is openRead more“It’s very difficult,” she said. “You would love to have more time in the environment, more time practising, but I guess I was pretty much handed the schedule to try and turn it around and make the most out of what is in front of me. I think it’s easy to get down and complain about it, but it’s not going to help. So I’m just trying to focus and turn it around for tomorrow.”On Thursday, Raducanu lost to the world No 204,Taylah Preston, in the quarter-finalsof the Hobart International. A delayed flight meant she only arrived in Melbourne late on Friday. She will have just one training session in Melbourne before her first round match.Coming after a best-of five-sets men’s match, Alexander Bublik against Jenson Brooksby, Raducanu’s match is due to start at a late hour against Sawangkaew, a talented 23-year-old Thai who broke into the top 100 last June. Sawangkaew is ranked No 195 owing to a six-month injury layoff.“I think it’s very difficult to be scheduling women’s matches after a potential five-set match,” said Raducanu. “To me, it doesn’t really make as much sense, but I think after seeing it, the initial reaction is probably, like: ‘Oh, it’s a late one.’ Then you deal with it, and you try and shift your day and adjust.“Today I’m going to practise and see what it’s like. I don’t think I have been in that situation. Only once before maybe when I played the semis of the US Open. I played second night match, but other than that, I haven’t played that late. So for me, it’s a new experience, something that I need to learn to do. Hopefully if I’m playing this game for a long time, I’ll probably be in this situation again, so it’s a good learning step to try and adjust and deal with that day, as well.”View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic says the PTPA lawsuit prompted his exit from the players’ body he helped found.Photograph: Morgan Hancock/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Novak Djokovic cited the ProfessionalTennisPlayers’ Association’s lawsuit against the governing bodies as a significant reason behind his surprise decision to sever ties with the organisation. Djokovic, who co-founded the PTPA alongside the former player Vasek Pospisil, announced at the beginning of the year that he would be stepping away.“It was a tough call for me to exit the PTPA, but I had to do that, because I felt like my name was overused in pretty much every single article or communication channel,” he said. “I felt like people, whenever they think about PTPA, they think it’s my organisation, which is a wrong idea from the very beginning. So this was supposed to be everyone, every player’s organisation across the board, men and women.“And I also didn’t like the way the leadership was taking the direction of the PTPA, and so I decided to step out. Does that mean that I’m not supporting PTPA? No, I am. I am still wishing them all the best, because I think that there is room and there is a need for 100% players-only representation existing in our ecosystem.“Going back to the lawsuit, as well, back in Miami, March last year, it was partly I exited because of that, because I didn’t agree with everything that was in there, and I decided not to be one of the player plaintiffs. So that was also one of the big reasons.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Emma RaducanuAustralian OpenTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

In part because of the excellent playing conditions, this has been anAfrica Cup of Nationsdevoid of shocks. The better teams keep winning. There has been a lot of good football, but not a huge amount of memorable football.And the consequence is that, in the final, we have the two best teams, or certainly the best team in north Africa against the best team in sub-Saharan Africa: the hosts and World Cup semi-finalists Morocco against Senegal, who have reached three of the past four Afcon finals.African football chiefs accused of not consulting fully over controversial Afcon changeRead moreIn that sense this tournament has been an organiser’s dream, a content-production machine: 44 games to get to quarter-finals featuring the eight teams who were highest-ranked for the purposes of the draw. Two of the quarter-finals were games of genuine quality and if the two semi-finals – one goal between them – fell into the sterile stereotype of the Cup of Nations, they were at least tense and meaningful.The problem was the last 16, in which half the games were essentially box-ticking exercises, and more especially a group stage in which the 16 qualifiers were known with six games still remaining. Having two-thirds of the third-placed sides going through destroys jeopardy, particularly when combined with separating teams level on points not by goal difference but by head-to-head. The World Cup will suffer from the same flaws.Quick GuideSalah and Marmoush fail in shootout as Nigeria beat EgyptShowMohamed Salah and Omar Marmoush failed from the spot as Egypt suffered a 4-2 penalty shootout defeat to Nigeria in the Africa Cup of Nations third-place playoff.The Liverpool forward Salah and the Manchester City striker Marmoush each saw their efforts saved by the Nigeria goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali before Ademola Lookman converted the winning penalty.Nigeria missed the opening kick of the shootout, with Fisayo Dele-Bashiru's effort kept out by Egypt's keeper Mostafa Shobeir after an uneventful bronze-medal encounter in Casablanca ended goalless.The Nigeria striker Paul Onuachu had a 36th-minute goal disallowed following a VAR review as he was adjudged to have caught the Egypt defender Hamdy Fathy with an elbow in the buildup.PA MediaPhotograph: Ulrik Pedersen/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.For only the second time this century, neither of the managers of the finalists is foreign. Although Senegal’s Pape Thiaw was playing in France for Saint-Étienne by the age of 17 and enjoyed a career that took him to Switzerland, Russia and Spain, he was born in Dakar and cut his teeth in management with Niarry Tally, the team of Senegal’s largest biscuit manufacturer. Walid Regragui was born in a suburb of Paris and spent most of his playing career in France, but he was capped 44 times by Morocco and coached in Rabat, Casablanca and Qatar before getting the national job.View image in fullscreenSenegal’s head coach, Pape Thiaw (left) and his Morocco counterpart, Walid Regragui. All of the semi-finalists were coached by Africans.Photograph: Sebastien Bozon,gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty ImagesFor a long time, an obvious area for development for African football was management and at last there has been a turn away from European journeymen towards local coaches, almost invariably using the experience they have gained playing for European clubs. All of the last four were coached by Africans, the first time that has happened since 1965.The most recent instance of a final with a pair of African coacheswas 2019, when Djamel Belmadi’s Algeria beat Aliou Cissé’s Senegal: the managers then had grown up in neighbouring districts of Paris. That trend of African football being developed in Europe has continued. Roughly a third of all players at this edition were born outside Africa. Only 14 members of Morocco’s 28-man squad were born in Morocco, and only 15 of Senegal’s squad in Senegal.This is a process that has been aided by two relatively recent changes in the regulations. In 2009 Algeria led a motion that lifted the prohibition on players changing footballing nationality after the age of 21 and, in 2020, Morocco pushed for a change that permitted players who had played three times or fewer for a country to switch allegiance.The Cup of Nations is increasingly a tournament of the many African diasporas. That is not to question any player’s affiliation to their country, nor to doubt the complexities of national identity in a globalised world, but it does highlight the effectiveness of the quasi-industrialised youth development systems of western Europe: 14 players across the finalists’ two squads were born in France, five in Spain, and three in each of the Netherlands and Belgium.Africa is now benefiting from whata piece on PlaytheGamedescribed as “a bug in the trajectory of the workforce flow in the world”. That said, Morocco has also invested in youth development with the Mohammed VI football academy opening in 2009. Four of its graduates, including Youssef En-Nesyri and Nayef Aguerd, were in the squad that reached the 2022 World Cup semi-finals, and the continuing success of the academy system was seen as Morocco won the Under-20 World Cup last year.View image in fullscreenMorocco fans with flags inside the stadium before the semi-final. The hosts have emerged as the modern heart of the African game, with impressive infrastructure.Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/ReutersThe test Senegal will face in the final will not be dissimilar to that of the previous two rounds. Morocco are nowhere near as cautious as the other north African giants but they will probably sit deep and allow Senegal the ball. As Sadio Mané stressed after thesemi-final win over Egypt, Senegal have been very effective in probing without overcommitting. They will, though, be without their captain, Kalidou Koulibaly, and the midfielder Habib Diarra for the final after they picked up their second yellow cards of the knockout stages.Like Senegal, Morocco are looking for their second Cup of Nations triumph but, 50 years after their previous success, there is real urgency about their quest. Morocco – two events into a three-tournament run of hosting, after the 2024 Women’s African Cup of Nations and as a co-host of the 2030 World Cup – hasemerged as the modern heart of the African game, with undeniably impressive infrastructure. But that brings with it expectation and there is little doubt that pressure has underlain some laboured displays, especially in the group stage.Although Achraf Hakimi is their obvious star and the goalkeeper Yassine Bounou has proved again hisproficiency in a penalty shootout, the two players who have really stood out have been the wide forwards Brahim Díaz, who is the tournament’s leading scorer with five, and, on the left, Ez Abde, without whom Morocco’s counterattacks would be nowhere near as penetrative. The battle between them and Senegal’s two full-backs, Krépin Diatta and El Hadji Malick Diouf, is likely to be decisive.View image in fullscreenMorocco star Achraf Hakimi celebrates reaching the final with the host nation’s mascot.Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/ReutersThe sense so far has been of a Cup of Nations that has been almost too slick, too polished. The reputation of a tournament is based not only on quality but on intrigue and drama, and, despite a few moans about refereeing, there has not yet been much of that. Predictability may speak of a tournament’s maturity, of smooth pitches and first-class facilities, but it will not live long in the mind of the neutral. That may yet be redeemed by a thrilling final but, with the World Cup and its inflated narratives looming, there is a risk that this becomes a forgotten Cup of Nations.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Inside footballMorocco football teamSenegal football teamAfrica Cup of NationscommentShareReuse this content"

Wisely, Arne Slot chose not to dispute it. TheLiverpoolhead coach got almost everything he wished for against Burnley – more creativity and more chances in particular – but the failure to kill off a relegation-threatened opponent who scored from their only shot on target brought familiar torment.Liverpool had 32 attempts on Martin Dubravka’s goal, including one from the penalty spot, with 11 on target. Two were cleared off the line by the Burnley defender Bashir Humphreys. Slot had asked for dominant ball possession to yield more opportunities and here was the response, of sorts. Only Florian Wirtz converted, however, and the champions were held to afourth successive Premier League drawwhen Marcus Edwards rewarded Burnley’s improved second half showing with a fine equaliser. More missed chances followed from Liverpool before a chorus of condemnation greeted the final whistle.Spurs v West Ham, Chelsea v Brentford, Liverpool v Burnley, and more: football – liveRead moreAsked whether he understood the home crowd’s reaction, Slot replied: “Yes. In my head there wasn’t booing but there was frustration as well. You have to give credit toBurnleyfor doing everything to prevent us scoring but if, as Liverpool, you are not disappointed by drawing at home to Burnley then something is wrong. I completely understand the frustration. I have the same frustrations and the players definitely have the same frustrations as the fans.”Scott Parker and his players merited the credit that Slot offered. The first half resembled a training exercise of attack versus defence as Liverpool constantly probed their deep, five-man defence. Armando Broja was so isolated in the Burnley attack he operated in a different postcode to his teammates. They conceded a soft penalty, missed by Dominik Szoboszlai, and fell behind shortly before the interval when Wirtz lashed home his fourth goal in six games. But the visitors’ concentration never wavered. A braver, more enterprising second half resulted in Edwards sweeping home his first goal of the season and sparking pandemonium in the away section.View image in fullscreenMarcus Edwards scores Burnley’s equaliser at Anfield.Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesIt was a far cry from Parker’s last appearance at Anfield –the 9-0 defeat with Bournemouthin 2022 and the angry post-match reaction that prompted his sacking as manager. “The key for us was getting in at half-time still in the game so we could fix a few things,” he admitted.Liverpool had more answers than of late against a low block but found Dubravka in commanding form in the Burnley goal. The keeper produced three good, and similar, saves to deny Hugo Ekitiké, Cody Gakpo and Wirtz in the first half.Slot’s team were gifted a chance to take the lead when awarded a soft penalty by the referee Andrew Madley. Receiving Curtis Jones’ pass inside the area, Gakpo turned on to his favoured right foot and straight into Florentino Luís before going down under the challenge. The Burnley midfielder could do little about the collision but caught Gakpo with his knee. The visitors raged against the decision and would consider justice done when Szoboszlai smacked the spot-kick against the crossbar.View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai hits the bar from his first-half penalty.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPALiverpool broke the deadlock when Dubravka saved at his near post from Ekitiké and Jones had the presence of mind to locate Wirtz inside a crowded penalty area. The German playmaker fired an emphatic finish into the top corner through a pack of incoming defenders. Ekitiké’s part in the breakthrough must be singled out for praise. The forward controlled Virgil van Dijk’s cross-field ball exquisitely before spinning away from both Kyle Walker and Axel Tuanzebe and testing Dubravka from a tight angle. Tuanzebe played despite knowing his wife had gone into labour. “It was touch and go whether he would play as it was going on for about 16 hours,” said Parker. “But we had a car outside with the engine running and he’s with her now.”Burnley had to show more adventure in the second half. And they delivered. The visitors served notice of newfound intent when Edwards broke free and attempted to find Jaidon Anthony unmarked in front of goal. Ibrahima Konaté, lunging to intercept, almost converted into his own net but Alisson reacted sharply to scoop clear. Moments later, and to Anfield’s general astonishment. Burnley were level. Luís prised open a static Liverpool defence with a fine pass into Edwards who, in space on the left of the area, rifled a powerful finish into the far corner.“They both came in the same five-minute period,” lamented Slot. “They were the only moments when we struggled.” But Liverpool’s struggles in front of goal continued. Dubravka saved from Wirtz, Humphreys made two vital goalline clearances from Gakpo, Ekitiké had a goal disallowed when coming back from an offside position to convert a Van Dijk header and Alexis Mac Allister sliced badly wide seconds after his introduction from the bench. Jones was in despair when he dragged a shot across the face of goal and Ekitiké just failed to apply the finishing touch. The feeling was soon shared across Anfield.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolBurnleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The team anyone would pay good money to watch. A collection of youngsters from Manchester were given the best seats in the house, as their magisterial hosts ran rings round them. This is Sale’s record defeat. This is Toulouse avenging theirdefeat to Saracens last week. Far older and uglier players than Sale could call on would have suffered similarly.Both teams thus qualify for the last 16.Toulouseleapfrog their visitors into second place, for now, which means a home tie. They will be cheering on Glasgow, who host Saracens in the last match of the pool stages on Sunday.Sale were missing 13 players and had already qualified. Toulouse were missing quite a few too, but there’s an injury-struck squad and there’s a Toulouse squad. Still they were able to send out international after international. Thomas Ramos ended the match with 27 points, a try in the second half and 11 conversions out of 11, the last from the wrong touchline, just to show off. He is the deadliest goal-kicker in the world, possibly in history.‘I was knocked for six’: Zander Fagerson on his Lions injury despair and Glasgow’s European questRead moreToulouse began the match outside the qualifying places, believe it or not, fifth out of six in Pool 1. There was never any question of them not qualifying, a win all but guaranteed against the travelling youngsters, but it was fun trying to imagine the aristos of this competition failing to make the last 16.That idle fancy did not last long. It says something that Sale played out of their skins for 40 minutes, nearly crossing the line themselves at one point, but they turned around 28-0 down, bonus-point fourth try conceded on the stroke of half-time. Toulouse had their first in the third minute, the monstrous Emmanuel Meafou not needing a lot of his 145kg to break through flailing arms off an attacking lineout.That was Toulouse resorting to muscle for their first score, and it is to Sale’s credit that they had to repeat the trick to score their second, a whole 20 minutes later. Which means until that point, Sale survived an avalanche of penalties and pressure to keep their hosts at bay. No stopping Julien Marchand, though, at the back of an advancing lineout and drive at the start of the second quarter.Then Toulouse showed us a flash of the kind of rugby for which they are better known. Blair Kinghorn, looking imperious at fly-half, released Dimitri Delibes and Léo Banos to combine down the right, before he did the same down the left for Ramos to put Matthis Lebel away. He found Antoine Dupont supporting on the inside, the maestro running home Toulouse’s third.Quick GuideRoundup: Leicester on the brink after Cape Town collapseShowLeicester's last-16 hopes were left in tatters after a 39-26 defeat byStormersin Cape Town. Early tries from Evan Roos and Andre-Hugo Venter put the hosts in control before George Pearson pulled one back.Some Will Wand magic hauled the Tigers back into the match at half-time and they led by six when Jamie Blamire went over early in the second half. However, tries from Leolin Zas and JD Schickerling edged the Stormers back in front before Tom Manz scored for Leicester.But Imad Khan denied the Tigers a losing bonus point when his late try (pictured) sent Stormers through. Instead, a losing bonus point against Harlequins on Sunday will be enough for La Rochelle to qualify from Pool 3 and knock out Leicester.Leinsterbattled to a 22-13 win atBayonnewhich secured home advantage in the last 16. Bayonne – who had lost their opening three Pool 3 games, including to Leicester and Harlequins – took an early lead at the Stade Jean Dauger through a breakaway try from Sireli Maqala in the 14th minute before Harry Byrne's penalty got Leinster, already qualified from Pool 3, on the board.After Joshua Kenny just failed to take the ball and go over in the corner, a long-range penalty from Joris Segonds put the French side further ahead. Thomas Clarkson then saw his 33rd-minute try disallowed for a double movement as Bayonne went into half-time 10-3 in front.Bayonne's Herschel Jantjies was shown a yellow card in the 49th minute for a deliberate knock-on. Leinster made the most of their advantage when Dan Sheehan slid over in the 56th minute and Byrne nailed the conversion to bring the visitors level at 10-10.Segonds kicked another penalty on the hour to swiftly restore Bayonne's lead, which looked to have been wiped out when Jimmy O'Brien charged on to a kick from Sam Prendergast and went down in the corner – only for his try to be ruled out by the television match official for failing to ground the ball as he was tackled over the line.Leinster produced a strong finish as Prendergast latched on to Byrne's chipped pass under the posts and then Max Deegan crossed in the corner to make sure of another hard-earned win to maintain their 100% record at the top of the group.Gloucester's Champions Cup hopes suffered a knockout blow asToulondumped them from the tournament by winning 31-14 at Kingsholm. The French side did not look back following early tries by wings Gael Drean and Mathis Ferte, with Gloucester never seriously threatening a meaningful fightback.The flanker Lewis Ludlam also crossed for the visitors during a one-sided opening half as they guaranteed themselves a home tie in the last 16, before Drean added an 80th-minute bonus-point clincher.Gloucester, despite touchdowns from Jack Clement and Tomos Williams, with George Barton converting both, were largely shut out, and the Toulon full-back Marius Domon's goal-kicking – four conversions and a penalty – kept his side in the driving seat. Gloucester's defeat meant Edinburgh progressed from Pool 2 alongside Toulon, Bath and Castres, with George Skivington's team having now lost 11 of their 13 Prem and Champions Cup games this season as even a Challenge Cup consolation place eluded them.PA MediaPhotograph: Gallo Images/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The young Sale side’s world caved in just before the break. First Alex Wills was shown yellow for a deliberate knock-on. From the subsequent attacking lineout, Kalvin Gourgues scored Toulouse’s fourth from Delibes’s inside ball, but the referee, a touch mercilessly, showed Sale another yellow, Sam Dugdale having sacked the lineout and manhandled Dupont in vain.So Sale faced the opening 10 minutes of the second half with a two-man disadvantage. They almost laughed at the prospect, scoring a fine try, their only one of the match, four minutes in, Tom Curtis looping his captain, Marius Louw, to scythe through, as if it were Toulouse who were down to 13.Quick GuideToulouse 77-7 Sale teams and scorersShowToulouseRamos; Delibes (Thomas 49), Gourgues, Chocobares, Lebel; Kinghorn (Graou 57), Dupont (capt); Baille (Neti 49), Marchand (Mauvaka 55), Aldegheri (Mallez 49), Flament, Meafou (Roumat 62), Banos, Willis (Cros 53), Jelonch (Brennan 49).TriesMeafou, Marchand, Dupont 2, Gourgues, Delibes, Lebel 2, Ramos, Graou, Brennan.ConsRamos 11.SaleDavies; Ene, Ma’asi-White (Bedlow 62), Louw (capt), Wills Grace 49; Curtis, Warr (Hanson 59); Rodd (McIntyre ht), Jibulu (Caine ht), Harper (Bell 45), Burrow (Hogg 70), Andrews, Gilmore, Woodman, Dugdale (Logan 51).Yellow cardsWills 40, Dugdale 40, Andrews 73.TryCurtis.ConCurtis.RefereeAndrew Brace (Ire).Att18,754.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.They had been allowed their fun. The tries rained down from then on, all one way, more than a few the sort you could hang on the wall. Let’s reserve special mention for Dupont’s second, in the final quarter, from Ramos’s cross-kick to the interplay between Gourgues and Lebel down the left and that maestro again supporting on the inside. We thought Dupont had finished another, even more outrageous move from their own 22 a few minutes later, but a forward pass earlier on did for the score.Alas, Sale suffered anyway, Hyron Andrews shown their third yellow of the night for a high tackle on Peato Mauvaka. Toulouse scored two more while Andrews was away and had another disallowed for Teddy Thomas’s simultaneous foot in touch as he dived for the line.That was the third try Toulouse had been disallowed. It could have been worse. Or more beautiful. They are still in the competition. Rejoice.Explore more on these topicsChampions CupToulouseSaleRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Higgins gave Trump something to think about before the mid-session interval by clawing it back to 3-2, including a century break, but breaks of 70 and 57 by the world No 1 helped him move to within a frame of victory at 5-3.Higgins fought back for a second time and brought it back to 5-5 before his break of 70 in the decider meant Trump is still without a tournament win this season.Higgins, who at the age of 50 becomes the oldest triple crown finalist, told BBC Sport: “He is so tough to play against. I missed a couple of reds to put myself safe and then he did what he always does which is clear up.“Even at 5-3, I didn’t give up. It was the same against Zhao Xintong. Who knows, maybe my name is on the trophy? You just don’t know.“I think I’m a better player now than I’ve ever been. You play these great champions like Judd and I’ve lost the last few against him.”Higgins will face Kyren Wilson, who also battled through a last-frame decider, to beat China’s Wu Yize 6-5.Wu trailed 4-2 but breaks of 75, 87 and 81 put the 22-year-old 5-4 up and one frame from the final. But a nerveless clearance of 57 hauled Wilson level and the world No 2 got over the line with the first century of the match, a composed break of 116.“I wasn’t at the races at all today,” last year’s runner-up told the BBC. “I don’t know where I got those last two frames from. Sometimes the snooker gods are on your side and you’ve just got to make the most of it.”Explore more on these topicsSnookerJohn HigginsJudd TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Slipping on ice, I fell and broke my right wrist, so now I can’t hold a pen with my writing hand. But my experience of theNHSwas a good reminder of a few facts.Heading to the nearest A&E, I expected one of those 12-hour waits and corridors lined with trolleys of the near-dead, rowdy with drunken and psychotic mayhem.The Guardian recently foundthat violent incidents recorded by 212 NHS trusts in England rose from 91,175 in 2022-23 to 104,079 in 2024-25, the equivalent of about 285 cases reported every day. So I was ready for whatever. Notices warned that there would be zero tolerance of abuse of staff.But the place was unexpectedly hushed, with about 25 people waiting – some very old, one a young child, some glum, most calm, with only one swaying and moaning under her breath. Names were called, consulting room doors opened and shut. Sicker patients lay on trolleys in bays with curtains. I was lucky, I reckoned, to be here on a day and at a time when the atmosphere was bustling, but without any mayhem. I settled in for many hours, my fingers swollen like fat sausages, but not in howling agony, not an emergency. How long would it take?After half an hour I was sent for an X-ray. Less than an hour later, a tousle-haired doctor in scrubs told me that, yes, it was broken and needed a cast. He phoned specialists in thumb, hand and wrist care, took their guidance and set to work. I asked about his day: they’d had 71 patients in this fracture clinic, and my plaster cast was the 19th and last of his shift, the length of which – 12 hours – I wouldn’t have guessed from his patience. He booked a follow-up appointment and even wrote it in my diary as, of course, I couldn’t write.How lucky I was. But then I think a bit more. All my working life I have written about the ups and downs of NHS statistics – some of thebest ever in 2010, some of the worst ever since then. How bad are A&E waiting times? The Nuffield Trust and Health FoundationNHS dashboardshows the95% targetfor treatment within four hours has beenbadly missed for years. The latest figures show a slight improvement: 26.1% of peoplein Englandwaited for more than four hours. But that means 73.9% of patients didn’t wait too long. So, statistically, I was not especially fortunate, but quite ordinary.View image in fullscreen‘Painfully slowly, NHS statistics do improve: waiting numbers fall and many more people were treated last year.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAs for the disorderly reputation of emergency departments, I hadn’t been all that lucky, either, to find relative calm. ARoyal College of Nursing (RCN) reportlast August found that “during a typical working day in England, A&E staff are now being attacked every hour”. That’s appalling. How could people behave like that? But thinking about the RCN figures, there were 4,054 incidents in the 89 trusts that replied. Multiply that by two to get close to the 200 or so trusts in the UK overall. But then put that number into the context of6.7 million people attending A&Ein the second quarter of 2024-25 in England alone. Many violent incidents against NHS staff were classed by trusts as “unintentional”, the result of delirium or mental health problems, according to a Guardian investigation.Awful things do happen, with a new RCN investigation into the ongoing scourge of corridor care in the NHS calling it “a type of torture” that leads to patient deaths.I fell victim to the “I’ve been lucky” syndrome monitored over decades by the pollster Ipsos, which has tracked attitudes to public services.Many more peoplethink their local NHS provides a good service than think the NHS nationally does well. That applies to most things – crime, immigration, council services: “It’s terrible out there, but I’m lucky in my home patch.” How dispiriting for politicians that dismal news reports carry more weight than the evidence of people’s own eyes.Painfully slowly, NHS statistics are improving. Waiting numbers fell in 2025 despite it being the NHS’s busiest year – but more of the ageing population joined the queue. Few people will have noted Labour’s focus on health inequality:waiting lists are fallingthree times faster in areas with thehighest joblessness.Ipsos’s annual report,The Perils of Perception, shows how wildly people overestimate social ills. Since ancient times, humans have thought the present worse than imaginary golden ages. But the current pessimism and declinism have a genuine cause, as living standards have flatlined and reckless austerity has diminished public services, in a world where there are more wars and fewer democracies than 20 years ago.Even when things improve, politicians can expect scant credit: the best they get is public concern moving elsewhere, says Gideon Skinner, an Ipsos senior director. It’s for them, he says, to offer words of hope that things will get better. So far, this government has failed to project a belief that we are back on the path of progress. But it only takes a click of a mouse – or a trip to A&E – to find out the facts that will tell you things are usually not as bad as you fear. I should have known better – I certainly do now.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsA&EOpinionNHSHospitalsHealthPublic services policycommentShareReuse this content"

AI is putting others through my nightmareMara WilsonI was a child actor, exploited by strangers on the internet. Now millions of children face the same dangerSat 17 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 07.02 ESTShareWhen I was a little girl, there was nothing scarier than a stranger.In the late 1980s and early 1990s, kids were told, by our parents, by TV specials, by teachers, that there were strangers out there who wanted to hurt us. “Stranger Danger” was everywhere. It was a well-meaning lesson, but the risk was overblown:most child abuse and exploitation is perpetrated by people the children know. It’s much rarer for children to be abused or exploited by strangers.Rarer, but not impossible. I know, because I was sexually exploited by strangers.From ages five to 13, I was a child actor. And while as of late we’ve heard many horror stories about the abusive things that happened to child actors behind the scenes, I always felt safe while filming. Filmsets were highly regulated spaces where people wanted to get work done. I had supportive parents, and was surrounded by directors, actors, and studio teachers who understood and cared for children.The only way show businessdidendanger me was by putting me in the public eye. Any cruelty and exploitation I received as a child actor was at the hands of the public.“Hollywood throws you into the pool,” I always tell people, “but it’s the public that holds your head underwater.”Grok scandal highlights how AI industry is ‘too unconstrained’, tech pioneer saysRead moreBefore I was even in high school, my image had been used for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). I’d been featured on fetish websites and Photoshopped into pornography. Grown men sent me creepy letters. I wasn’t a beautiful girl – my awkward age lasted from about age 10 to about 25 – and I acted almost exclusively in family-friendly movies. But I was a public figure, so I was accessible. That’s what child sexual predators look for: access. And nothing made me more accessible than the internet.It didn’t matter that those images “weren’t me”, or that the fetish sites were “technically” legal. It was a painful, violating experience; a living nightmare I hoped no other child would have to go through. Once I was an adult, I worried about the other kids who had followed after me. Were similar things happening to the Disney stars, the Strangers Things cast, the preteens making TikTok dances and smiling in family vlogger YouTube channels? I wasn’t sure I wanted to know the answer.When generative AI started to pick up a few years ago, I feared the worst. I’d heard stories of “deepfakes”, and knew the technology was getting exponentially more realistic.Then it happened – or at least, the world noticed that it had happened. Generative AI has already been used many timesto create sexualized images of adult women without their consent.It happened to friends of mine. But recently, it was reported that X’s AI tool Grok had been used, quite openly,to generate undressed images of an underage actor. Weeks earlier, a girl was expelled from school for hitting a classmate who allegedly made deepfake porn of her,according to her family’s lawyers. She was 13, about the same age I was when people were making fake sexualized images of me.In July 2024,the Internet Watch Foundation found more than 3,500 images of AI-generated CSAM on a dark web forum. How many more thousands have been made in the year and a half since then?In order to stop the threat of a deepfake apocalypse, we need to look at how AI is trainedGenerative AI has reinvented Stranger Danger. And this time, the fear is justified. It is now infinitely easier for any child whose face has been posted on the internet to be sexually exploited. Millions of children could be forced to live my same nightmare.In order to stop the threat of a deepfake apocalypse, we need to look at how AI is trained.Generative AI “learns” by a repeated process of “look, make, compare, update, repeat”, says Patrick LaVictoire, a mathematician and former AI safety researcher. It creates models based on things it’s memorized, but it can’t memorize everything, so it has to look for patterns, and base its responses on that. “A connection that’s useful gets reinforced,” says LaVictoire. “One that’s less so, or actively unhelpful, gets pruned.”What generative AI can create depends on the materials the AI has been trained on. Astudy at Stanford Universityin 2023 showed that one of the most popular training datasets already contained more than 1,000 instances of CSAM. The links to CSAMhave since been removed from the dataset, but the researchers have emphasized that another threat is CSAM made by combining images of children with pornographic images, which is possible if both are in the training data.GoogleandOpenAIclaim to have safeguards in place to protect against the creation of CSAM: for instance, by taking care with the data they use to train their AI platforms. (It’s also worth noting that many adult film actors and sex workers have had their images scraped for AIwithout their consent.)Generative AI itself, says LaVictoire, has no way of distinguishing between innocuous and silly commands such as “make an image of a Jedi samurai” and harmful commands, such as “undress this celebrity”. So another safeguard incorporates a different kind of AI that acts similarly to a spam filter, which can block those queries from being answered. xAI, which runs Grok, seems to have been careless with that filter.And the worst may be yet to come:Metaandother companieshave proposed that future AI models be open source. “Open source” means anyone can access the code behind it, download it and edit it as they please. What is usually wonderful about open-source software – the freedom it gives users to create new things, prioritizing creativity and collaboration over profit – could be a disaster for children’s safety.Once someone downloaded an open-source AI platform and made it their own, there would be no safeguards, no AI bot saying that it couldn’t help with their request. Anyone could “fine-tune” their own personal image generator using explicit or illegal images, and make their own infinite CSAM and “revenge porn” generator.Meta seems to havestepped back from making its newer AI platforms open source. Perhaps Mark Zuckerberg remembered thathe wants to be like the Roman emperor Augustus, and that if he continued down this path, he might be remembered more as the Oppenheimer of CSAM.Some countries are already fighting against this. China was the first to enacta law that requires AI content to be labelled as such. Denmark is working on legislation that would give citizens the copyright to their appearances and voices, and would impose fines on AI platforms that don’t respect that. In other parts of Europe,and in the UK, people’s images may be protected by General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).The outlook in the United States seems much grimmer. Copyright claims aren’t going to help, because when a user uploads an image to a platform, they can use it however they see fit; it’s in nearly every Terms of Service agreement. Withexecutive orders against the regulation of generative AIand companies such as xAIsigning contracts with the US military, the US government has shown that making money with AI is far more important than keeping citizens safe.Therehasbeen some recent legislation “that makes a lot of this digital manipulation criminal”, says Akiva Cohen, a New York City litigator. “But also, a lot of those statutes are probably overly restrictive inwhatexactly they cover.”For example, while making a deepfake of someone that makes them appear nude or engaged in a sexual act could be grounds for criminal charges, using AI to put a woman – and likely even an underage girl – into a bikini probably would not.“A lot of this very consciously stays just on the ‘horrific, but legal’ side of the line,” says Cohen.Maybe it’s not criminal – that is to say, a crime against the state, but Cohen argues it could be a civil liability, a violation of another person’s rights, for which a victim requires restitution. He suggests that this falls under a “false light, invasion of privacy” tort, a civil wrong in which offensive claims are made about a person, showing them in a false light, “depicting someone in a way that shows them doing something they didn’t do”.“The way that you can really deter this type of conduct is by imposing liability on thecompaniesthat are enabling this,” Cohen says.There’s legal precedent for that: theRaise Actin New York, andSenate Bill 53in California, say that AI companies can be held accountable for harms they have done past a certain point. X, meanwhile,will now block Grokfrom making sexualized images of real people on the platform. But itappears that policy changedoesn’t apply to the stand-alone Grok app.But Josh Saviano, a former practicing attorney in New York, as well as a former child actor, believes more immediate actions need to be taken, in addition to legislation.“Lobbying efforts and our courts are eventually going to be the way that this is handled,” says Saviano. “But until that happens, there are two options: abstain entirely, which means take your entire digital footprint off the internet … or you need to find a technological solution. “Ensuring the safety of young people is of paramount importance to Saviano, who has known people who’ve had deepfakes of them,and – as a former child actor – knows a little about losing controlof one’s own narrative. Saviano and his team have been working on a tool that could detect and notify people when their images or creative work are being scraped. The team’s motto, he says, is: “Protect the babies.”Regardless of how it may happen, I believe that protection against this threat is going to take a lot of effort from the public.There are many who are starting to feel an affinity with their AI chatbots, but for most people, tech companies are nothing more than utilities. We may prefer one app over another for personal or political reasons, but few feel strong loyalty to tech brands. Tech companies, and especially social media platforms like Meta andX, would do well to remember that they are a means to an end. And if someone like me – who was on Twitter all day, everyday, for more than a decade – can quit it, anyone can.But boycotts aren’t enough. We need to be the ones demanding companies that allow the creation of CSAM be held accountable. We need to be demanding legislation and technological safeguards. We also need to examine our own actions: nobody wants to think that if they share photos of their child, those images could end up in CSAM. But it is a risk, one that parents need to protect their young children from, and warn their older children about.If our obsession with Stranger Danger showed anything, it’s that most of us want to prevent child endangerment and harassment. It’s time to prove it.Mara Wilson is a writer and actor living in Los AngelesExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)OpinionGrok AIXInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

The capture of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, dominated headlines for a while but it hasn’t stopped the ghost of Epstein from haunting Donald Trump.All the chest-beating around annexing Greenland doesn’t seem to be doing much to memory-hole the Epstein files either. During a visit to a Ford plant in Michigan this week, Trump was heckled by an autoworker who reportedly called the president a “pedophile protector”. And Shawn Ryan, an influential podcaster, who supported Trump’s 2024 run, also publicly accused the president of “protecting pedophiles” by not fully releasing the Epstein files. “I voted to get these damn files released, and it’s like a total 180 just happened,”Ryan complainedon a podcast released Thursday. Your first problem, sir, was ever believing a word the convicted felon said.The newest plan to take the heat off Trump’s Epstein connection? Judging by recent events, it seems to be to try and make us all focus on the Clintons’ Epstein links instead.While things escalated this week, the Trump administration has been slinging mud at Bill Clinton for a while. Which, to be fair, isn’t difficult to do, considering the Democratic former president’spersonal history, and his well-documented ties with Epstein. The disgraced financier visited the White Houseat least 17 timesduring the early years of Clinton’s presidency. The pair also travelled together. However, Clinton maintains that (unlike several other powerful people) he cut ties with Epstein in 2005, before the sex offender pleaded guilty to solicitation of a minor in Florida. Clinton has never been formally accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Trump administration, however, has done a lot of informal accusing. Last year the Department of Justice released a number of photos of Clinton alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, postedone photo on X in Decemberwith the caption“Oh my!”And, lastAugust, the House oversight committee issued subpoenas to Bill and Hillary Clinton, along with various others, demanding “testimony related to horrific crimes perpetrated byJeffrey Epstein”.“Given your past relationships with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, the Committee believes that you have information regarding their activities that is relevant to the Committee’s investigation,” the committee’s Republican chair, James Comer, wrote in a letter to Bill Clinton. A much vaguer version of this letter was issued toHillary Clinton.This week the Clintons made it clear they have no plans to cooperate with the committee’s investigation,announcingthey would not comply with the subpoena demanding testimony. Comersaid in responsethe committee would seek to hold both Clintons in criminal contempt of Congress.In a letter addressed to Comer, and posted onsocial mediaon Tuesday morning, the Clintons issued a scathing statement about the Trump administration and the contempt proceedings.“Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences,”the Clintons wrote. “For us, now is that time.”Oh, give me a break. I don’t doubt that the Trump Administration is going after the Clintons to create a sideshow, but isthisreally the moment when the power couple have decided that they’ve had enough? Spare me the sanctimony from two people who worked overtime tojustify(and deny) Israel’s genocide in Gaza. For many people in the US, seeing children in Gazaburned alivewith theirtaxpayer dollarswas when they stood up to fight for their principles, no matter theconsequences. For the Clintons, however, the moral red line seems to be harm to their personal brand. They are not fighting for the country here, they are fighting for themselves.This isn’t to say the Clintons should just quietly go along with this sham of an “investigation”. As the comedian Jon Stewart said this week, the Clintons should comply with the subpoenas, but only as part of a process where everyone is fully complying. “Why should [Clintons] comply if the Department of Justice is not complying with releasing the files?” Stewart said. “[But] do I personally think [the Clintons] should comply? Abso-fucking-lutely, absolutely. And if they’ve got something to hide nefarious, yes, we should know about all this. This is bonkers how long this is going on.” Quite.Anyway, here’s a little memo to Maga: focusing on the Clintons is not going to work for you. I’m sure the Clintons have some superfans but they don’t preside over a cult the way Trump does. If they have done anything immoral concerning Epstein, I think you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who thinks they should be shielded from consequences because they’re Democrats. The little stunt of holding the Clintons in contempt while theTrump administrationdrags its feet on releasing all the Epstein files just demonstrates the government’s contempt for the American public.California refuses to extradite doctor over abortion pillLouisiana officials have been trying to extradite a doctor in California who they claim sent abortion pills to the southern state. Medication abortion, to be clear,has been availablein the US since 2000 and decades of studies have shown it is safe and effective. However, Louisiana has banned almost all abortions and the state’s Republican attorney general has described sending abortion pills to the state as “illegal drug trafficking”. California has said there isno way an extraditionis happening.Renaming the Department of Defense the ‘Department of War’ could cost up to $125mThere always seems to be money fornonsense like thisand never any money for universal healthcare. Someone should create a “department of government efficiency” to look into this …Texas A&M University is banning Plato because of “gender ideology”The public research university has a new policy of restricting discussions of race and gender, which means around 200 courses have had to be revised. It turns out Plato’s Symposiumis problematicbecause of the “Myth of Androgyne,” in which Aristophanes describes three genders.Alabama library denied state funding because of inappropriate booksThe Fairhope public library will take a funding hit because it kept The Handmaid’s Tale and certain other booksin its teen section, rather than moving them to the adult section.How gender bias impacts math educationA new Rutgers University–New Brunswickstudyhas found that children are moreinclined to believeincorrect math information from men than accurate information from women. This plays into the well-documented “brilliance bias”: studies show girls as young as six think boys are more likely to be “really, really smart”.Mike Pompeo wants “to make sure history books don’t write about the victims of Gaza”The former US Secretary of Statereceived rapturous applauseat a pro-Israel conference on Tuesday after saying that “we need to make sure that the story [of October 7] is told properly so that when the history books write this, they don’t write about the victims of Gaza, right?” The good news for Pompeo is that journalism is supposed to be the first draft of history, and there is precious little journalism coming out of Gaza – by design. The international pressstillisn’tfreely allowed to report from Gaza, where babies are continuing tofreeze to death.The week in pawtriarchySome emu-sing news out of Florida, where police have been on the lookout for a runaway bird.

Instead, thanks to films such as The Hangover and Bridesmaids, as well as the general Americanisation of what a “bachelor” or “bachelorette” party should be, we’ve ended up with too many overindulgent, wildly inconvenient and quite frankly underwhelming send-offs to our friends who are getting married.Somewhere along the way, they’ve morphed into three-day tests of stamina and disposable income. Groomsmen bankrupting themselves on long weekends in Vegas that are billed as obligatory for anyone who wants to keep calling themselves a friend. Injuries sustained during ill-advised human pyramids on Spanish beaches. Weddings called off after drunken lapses of judgments in strip clubs. To add insult to injury, in 2023,a survey by Avivafound the average person spends £779 attending a stag or hen in the UK – and that goes up to £1,208 when it’s held abroad. Consequently, they’ve become gruelling and – crucially – not even fun any more.View image in fullscreenA scene from The Hangover Part II (2011).Photograph: Courtesy Warner Bros PicturesFirst, let’s address the elephant in the room: are stag and hen dos even necessary in this age of equality and frugality? Some would argue that they are archaic rites rooted in fragile ideas of masculinity and femininity and it’s time to do away with such debased ideas of fun. To that I say: boringggg. Now put on the pink cowboy hat, take a sip from the phallic-shaped straw, and embrace the ritual. I’ve come up with a five-step formula that respects tradition, but modernises some aspects, and makes for an actually enjoyable stag do or hen party. My credentials? I’ve been a best man a couple of times, thrown a hen do, and officiated a wedding.1Keep it to just one day/night.People always drink too much on the first night (and why shouldn’t they?), meaning that whatever activity is planned for the next day is scuppered by huge hangovers. At best, that means everyone is tired and has a headache; at worst, vomiting inside go-kart helmets or paintball masks. Booking a multi-night bender where friends need to deplete their savings and use precious annual leave is also a big no-no.2. Forget thedivision of the sexes.When I was planning a stag a few years ago, the groom considered not inviting his best friend of 25 years because she happened to be a woman. Barmy. But what if it’s awkward? Definitely no more awkward than inviting your future father or mother-in-law to partake in group fancy dress or slam shots in an All Bar One.View image in fullscreenA scene from Bridesmaids (2011).Photograph: Universal Pictures/Allstar3.Offer some kind of non-alcoholic icebreaker activity.First, this means there’s something for the ever-increasing number of people who don’t drink. Second, if you’re bringing together friends from childhood, adulthood and family, sometimes axe-throwing, a murder mystery or a spa is required to give attendees at least some common ground before commencing a night on the lash.4. Cheeky fun is a must. Simply tradition.It doesn’t have to be someone getting their kit off and frolicking around for entertainment, but a low-level hum of rudeness sets apart the sacrality of a stag or hen from any other night on the town. And if you can’t laugh at Magic Mike Live or some mildly obscene cake, you may have mistaken the occasion for corporate away day.5. Prioritise real friends.Make the nearly-wed pick a close group of friends to choose the date. Only add other contacts after this. I was once added to a 20-person stag do group chat where dates were polled, and the winning one worked for people the groom hadn’t seen since school, but not his best mates. Great news for Matt from year 9 Duke of Edinburgh, bad news for the people you really want to see there.In short, the perfect stag or hen doesn’t need be a logistical endurance test, followed by months of chasing a friend of a friend to bank transfer you their airfare. It should be a well-curated night with the people that matter to the bride or groom. If the best man or woman can provide that, you won’t just be sending your friend into married life, you’ll be giving them one last, genuinely great night out before the seating plan arguments begin. And you’re guaranteed to stay a friend long after the speeches are over.Liam Pape is a writer and live comedy producerExplore more on these topicsWedding, honeymoon and stag tripsThe hill I will die onWeddingsFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

When we met, her message about the struggle was clearSat 17 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 07.06 ESTShare“In life, there’s the beginning and the end,” John Carlos, the African American sprinter who raised his fist in a black power salute from the podium of the 1968 Olympics, oncetold me. “The beginning don’t matter. The end don’t matter. All that matters is what you do in between – whether you’re prepared to do what it takes to make change. There has to be physical and material sacrifice. When all the dust settles and we’re getting ready to play down for the ninth inning, the greatest reward is to know that you did your job when you were here on the planet.”Claudette Colvin, whodied earlier this weekin a hospice in Texas, did her job while she was here on the planet, although it was several decades before her physical and material sacrifice was acknowledged. On 2 March 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, aged just 15, Colvin took a stand and refused to give up her bus seat to a white woman.The driver called the police, who kicked her a few times and then, when she still stayed put, took her to City Hall and charged her. Fred Gray, her lawyer, thought she would make a strong test case to end segregation in the city. But levels of hierarchy in the deep south did not stop at black and white. The church-led, male-dominated leadership considered Colvin a liability – not only was she young, rebellious and outspoken, she was dark-skinned in a world where shade mattered, and poor. “The black leadership in Montgomery at the time thought that we should wait,” said Gray.Nine months later, Rosa Parks suffered a similar fate after she too refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. Local leaders thought she was an ideal candidate: “I probably would’ve examined a dozen more before I got there if Rosa Parks hadn’t come along,” said a local leader, ED Nixon.In between the two arrests, Colvin fell pregnant and, for several decades, into the footnotes of history. When Iinterviewed herat her home in the Bronx 45 years later, she was working as a nurses’ aide in a care home in Manhattan, mostly unheard of and completely uncelebrated.“[There is] a system of power that is always deciding in the name of humanity who deserves to be remembered and who deserves to be forgotten,” the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano,once told me. “We are much more than we are told. We are much more beautiful.” Eventually, well into her 60s, Colvin’s story broke through that system. Her obituary this week appeared, among other places, in theNew York Times,the BBC,the Washington Post,Le Mondeand eventhe Telegraph.View image in fullscreenClaudette Colvin in Birmingham, Alabama, February 2021.Photograph: Tamika Moore/The GuardianThere are many lessons we might learn from Colvin’s life and brave actions, but for now I want to concentrate on just four that feel urgent and relevant. The first is that popular history is made by ordinary people, like Colvin, doing extraordinary things – but it is all too often written as though it were the work of saints in a crude morality play. This is not only untrue; it demeans everyone implicated, including the sanctified. In the case of the Montgomery bus boycott, Parks is depicted as a seamstress who just happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. “She was a victim of both the forces of history and the forces of destiny,” said Martin Luther King, who, as a young preacher in town, was chosen to lead the fightback. Parks wasnobody’s victim. She was a militant feminist and anti-racist who had a good personal relationship with Dr King, buther hero was Malcolm X. “I had almost a life history of being rebellious against being mistreated against my colour,” she said.Second, the fact that inequalities of race, class, gender and shade mean that some people are more likely to be honoured in history and promoted in politics, detracts not one iota from the bravery or salience of their actions.Last September, Silverio Villegas González was shot dead in Chicago by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent who claimed he feared for his life. Villegas González was an undocumented migrant and there is no video to contradict the ICE account. Renee Good, who was shot dead in Minneapolis last week by an ICE agent while peacefully protesting against an ICE raid, has beencommemorated around the world. The fact that Good was a white, US citizen of course plays a role in why she is remembered in a way that Villegas González and so many others are not. The challenge here is not to diminish her sacrifice and bravery, but to also call Villegas González’s name, as we should call Colvin’s. Colvin resented the fact that her protest left her vulnerable and she should have had more support. But she understood why they had championed Parks and not her. “They picked the right person,” she told me. “They needed someone who would bring together all the classes. They wouldn’t have followed me.”Third, that ultimately the story of Montgomery isn’t about Colvin or Parks, any more than the story of immigration rights is ultimately about Good or Villegas González. The struggle against segregation demanded organisation –most of it by women– and thousands working together, to make change. It was only after the black community boycotted the buses for 13 months that Montgomery’s local establishment finally relented. An individual may resist, butresistanceis collective.Finally, that resistance never stops. The very rights Colvin fought for are being rolled back today. Key elements ofcivil rightsandvoting rightsprotections are being reversed. Last weekDonald Trump saidhe thought civil rights had led to “white people [being] very badly treated”.When Colvin was asked if she would help promote the opening of the Rosa Parks museum on the grounds that it might bring her closure, she refused. “What closure can there be for me?” she asked me. “There is no closure. This does not belong in a museum, because this struggle is not over. We still don’t have all that we should have. And, personally, there can be no closure. They took away my life. If they want closure, they should give it to my grandchildren.”Gary Younge is a professor of sociology at the University of ManchesterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His escapades are likely to cost himSidney BlumenthalHistory tells us what happens when American presidents focus on foreign policy  and neglect domestic economic policySat 17 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 12.01 ESTShareDonald Trump’s blitzkrieg since his 3 January seizure of the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has been guided by his triumph of the will, as hetoldthe New York Times. “Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me … I don’t need international law.”Trump treats the spectacle as a reality TV show in which he is both the executive producer and the host who ultimately declares himself the winner. At his 3 January press conference on the day of Maduro’s seizure, Trump mentioned “oil” 27 times, “money” 13 times and “democracy” not once. He trashed the democratic opposition as lacking “respect” and “support”. The capture of Maduro was a decapitation, not regime change. Indeed, Trump served as a convenient agent of an internal coup of the existing powers, whom he declared “an ally”. “We have to fix the country first,” hesaid. “You can’t have an election.”Trump has dubbed his Venezuelan exploit as the “Donroe Doctrine”. It is of a piece with his rebranding of history, along with dropping mention of his impeachments from his picture caption at the National Portrait Gallery and coercing the Smithsonian not to focus on “how bad slavery was”. Hetoldthe Times that the civil rights movement of the 1960s resulted in “white people” being “very badly treated”. He presents himself anachronistically as the White Citizens’ Council president.His “Donroe Doctrine” runs against the intent of the author of the original Monroe Doctrine, the then secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, whostatedthat the United States “goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy … She might become the dictatress of the world. She would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.”Trump announced that he would “run” Venezuela, “money will be controlled by me” and he would control the oil industry there “indefinitely”. His White House released a photo imitating a Wikipedia page that depicted him as “The Acting President of Venezuela”.He invited CEOs of big oil companies to the White House to convince them to take the plunge into Venezuela, where the oil infrastructure is dilapidated and the oil resembles tar, difficult to extract and refine into usable products like gasoline. The ExxonMobil chieftoldTrump that realistically “it’s uninvestable” and that the country lacked a proper legal system.Trump interrupted his meeting to say, “We have many others that were not able to get in. I said, ‘If we had a ballroom, we’d have over a thousand people.’ I never knew you had that many people in your industry.” He got up to gaze from the East Room window at the gigantic hole in the ground he had made of the South Lawn, where his gargantuan ballroom is being constructed. “Wow! What a view. This is the door to the ballroom.” When he returned to his seat hecontinueddiscussing the ballroom. “I don’t think there’ll be anything like it in the world, actually.” Later, hesaidabout Venezuela, “I will probably be inclined to keep Exxon out.” Of course, Exxon did not want to go in. No matter. His foreign policy is like a vanity ballroom, or plastering “Trump” above the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Arts: schlock and awe.In the meantime, Trump has turned again to his dream of annexing, purchasing or invading Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, a Nato ally. The US has maintained military bases on Greenland under a separate agreement since 1951. “If we don’t do it the easy way, we’re going to do it the hard way,” said Trump. He told the Times that he must have “ownership”, which was “psychologically necessary for success”. The leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom issued a rebuke that Greenland “belongs to its people”. Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, would-be viceroy,declaredthat “nobody [is] going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.” Danish and Greenland officials told the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, there was a “fundamental disagreement”.Trump’s imperialism centers on his imperial self. Vladimir Lenin, in his determinist tract,Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism, published in 1917, saw finance capital driving colonialism in search of profits, leading to great power rivalry, the world war and “proletarian revolution”. Trump turns Lenin on his head. He drives the reluctant capitalists into freebooting imperialist adventures with uncertain consequences. Trump represents, in Leninist terms, the lowest stage of imperialism.His “Donroe” atavism fits with his other primitive throwback policies, from tariffs (recalling the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 that deepened the Great Depression) to immigration, racial discrimination and restriction (recalling the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924 excluding southern and eastern Europeans and barring Asians).While Trump strides across the stage posing as a world conqueror, the Quinnipiac pollshowshim to be an incredible shrinking man – 57% opposed to “running” Venezuela; 73% opposed to sending troops there; 55% opposed to taking over its oil sales; 86% opposed to militarily seizing Greenland; 55% opposed to buying it; and 70% against military action against Iran. According to the AP-NORCpoll, 61% disapprove of his foreign policy in general. The Reuters-Ipsospollshowed only 17% in favor of Trump acquiring Greenland and 4% in favor of military force.Public disapproval of Trump’s foreign policy now nearly equals thedisapprovalof his economic policy, on cost of living at minus 25 points. Trump has repeatedlyderidedthe reality of the “affordability crisis” as a “hoax”, “scam” or “con job”, lately on 13 January, as a “fake word”, as though he could magically make it vanish.The last thing that might occur to Trump is any historical lesson, especially a cautionary story about a president who was far more popular than he has ever been, achieved great military victories and yet was politically defeated.Shortly after President George HW Bush lost the election of 1992, I went to his White House to learn how the mighty had fallen from the pinnacle of victory in the Gulf war. I met with Richard Darman, one of the most thoughtful and capable people there, who had been at the center of both the Reagan and Bush administrations and was especially close to James Baker, who had left as secretary of state to take charge of Bush’s campaign at the end. Darman had been Reagan’s staff secretary, deputy secretary of the treasury to Baker, and under Bush the budget director. I had been speaking as a journalist with Darman since the start of the Reagan administration.Darman told me about the research that the Bush campaign had conducted that exposed the phenomenon of how the positive transformation of his image had become his undoing in public opinion. Darman’s story of a reversal of fortune casts an unexpected historical light on how the perception of Republicans in the forthcoming midterm elections as supine weaklings and Trump’s psychodrama as a strongman may combine to undermine them all. The performance of supreme power is not always what it seems.In October 1987, on the eve of the campaign when Bush would emerge from the vice-presidency,Newsweekpublished a cover story headlined, “Fighting the Wimp Factor”. “Bush suffers from a potentially crippling handicap – a perception that he isn’t strong enough or tough enough for the challenges of the Oval Office. That he is, in a single mean word, a wimp.” The story was wildly unfair to the college athlete, the second world war pilot who had been shot down and former CIA director, but it captured the awkward conundrum he faced as the Connecticut Yankee who donated to Planned Parenthood and ridiculed Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts as “voodoo economics” to remake himself into the Texas congressman opposed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and uncomfortably sought to assume Reagan’s mantle.Constrained by his belief that boastfulness was coarse, Bush’s overcompensation was embarrassing,half-jokinghe was a “pit bull”. On the eve of his invasion of Panama and seizure of its military dictator, Gen Manuel Noriega, Bush was subjected to scathing criticism. “Prudent Meets Timid”, ran the front-pageheadlinein the New York Times. The conservative columnist for the Washington Post, George Will, ripped “An Unserious Presidency”. A Democratic congressman stated, “There’s a resurgence of the wimp factor.” When Bush launched Operation Just Cause on 20 December 1989, he consulted with congressional leaders of both parties who gave their approval; Noriega, who had come to power through a coup, was removed; and the rightfully elected president took office. Bush’s popularity rose to 80% in the Gallup poll. Yet “the wimp factor” lingered.On 2 August 1990, Iraq’s dictator Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait to grab its vast oil reserves. The United Nations security council issued the ultimatum to withdraw or face “all necessary force”. In the Gulf war, a coalition of 43 countries led by the US defeated Saddam to restore Kuwait, but did not march to Baghdad or occupy Iraq. Bush’spopularitysoared to 89%, the highest of any president ever recorded. At last, he had vanquished “the wimp factor”.On 6 March 1990, Bushspoketo a joint session of the Congress, to proclaim “a victory for every country in the coalition, for the United Nations. A victory for unprecedented international cooperation and diplomacy … a victory for the rule of law.” The jubilant Republican members waved small American flags. The big-name potential Democratic presidential candidates declined to run.Darman explained to me that Bush’s Gulf war triumph had persuaded the public that he was not a “wimp”, but truly strong. They believed he was a leader with a steely core. When the recession deepened, they believed he was strong, but reasoned that he would not help them and became embittered against him. Enter Bill Clinton who felt their pain with his program of “Putting People First”.On its surface, Darman’s explanation seemed counterintuitive. Through a strange political alchemy, however, the stronger Bush appeared, the weaker he became. The greater his accomplishment loomed, the more he was diminished. His towering act was unquestioned, but led paradoxically to his political demise.When Bush lost, it was a commonplace that he had been a foreign policy president who neglected economic policy, that he was a patrician whose strained attempts to establish rapport with those falling into the vertigo of a recession – “Message: I care” – jangled as off-key. But it was not so simple. The metamorphosis of his image also propelled the dynamic.George W Bush remained a captive of his father’s dilemma, which he sought finally to dispel. His invasion of Iraq in an elusive quest to find and destroy weapons of mass destruction was widely understood at the time as “Unfinished Business”, asthe Economistput it, in part a reaction to his father’s war, followed by his political defeat, and the lingering smoke of the “wimp factor”.Donald Trump smashed the Bush legacy to gain control over the Republican party and recast it in his own image. Trump humiliated and shoved aside Jeb Bush, the family and party heir apparent, the brother of George W Bush and son of George HW Bush, and the former Florida governor, in a debate on 13 February 2016. “Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, all right?” Trumpsaid. He added, “They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction – there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.” Then Trump blamed the terrorist attack of September 11 on George W Bush. Jeb sputtered, “I am sick and tired of him going after my family.” Trumpsurgedto a two-to-one lead for the Republican nomination.After the death of Barbara Bush in early 2018, President Trump issued an official White Housestatementthat he would not attend her funeral. A frail George HW Bush was soon hospitalized. Trump trashed him at a rally, ridiculing Bush’s signature slogan for his program of voluntary civic engagement. “Thousand points of light,” Trumpsaid. “What does that mean? I know one thing. ‘Make America Great Again’ we understand. Putting America first we understand. Thousand points of light, I never quite got that one. What the hell is that? Has anyone ever figured that one out? It was put out by a Republican, wasn’t it?”Bush died a few months later. Trump’s insult was his imprimatur on his own Republican party that on bended knee pays him tribute or else. On 14 January, the Republican Senate, its internal dissenters crushed, blocked a resolution to require Trump to seek congressional approval for military force in Venezuela.So, the Republicans defer again to Trump, evade their constitutional role and careen heedlessly toward the midterm elections. They define themselves as weak and useless in service to his perceived unchallengeable strength. The more he struts, the more they falter; the more dramatically he postures, the weaker they are perceived. But the strongman, never thought to be a “wimp”, not only ignores the economic plight of the majority but displays open contempt.At the Detroit Economic Club on 13 January, Trump boasted that all is swell: “We’re the hottest country.” Trump has launched a criminal investigation of the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, whom he hasinsultedas “bonehead”, “low IQ”, “stupid”, “not a smart person”. Powell responded that the investigation was a “pretext” for political retaliation in Trump’s attempt to destroy the Fed’s independence and a threat to the economy’s stability.In Minneapolis, an ICE agent killed a US citizen, Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, driving away from a protest scene. Trump blamed her for her killing as “highly disrespectful of law enforcement”. A flood of ICE agents into the city has since fostered violent melees, which have provided the excuse for Trump to threaten to invoke the Insurrection Act. “Trump has made ICE a 70-30 issue – for Democrats,”statesthe pollster G Elliott Morris.Trump claims to stand above any and all restraints: “My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.” He has articulated his justification for his rapacious behavior from the intimacy of the Bergdorf Goodman dressing room to the icy expansive of Greenland. He is the Superman, theUbermensch.Trump’s brief words to frame his philosophy were better explained by Friedrich Nietzsche inBeyond Good and Evil, published in 1889, which later became an ur-text against the “slave-faith” of the Enlightenment and for Naziism and the cult of personality. Nietzsche contrasted the superior “master morality” with the “slave morality”. The “noble” and “aristocratic” master “does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: what is injurious to me is injurious in itself; he knows that it is he himself only who confers honor on things; he is a creator of values. He honors whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals self-glorification.” Nietzsche exalted this as the “DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER”. He wrote that “in real life it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.” He mocked the “enchained class of spirits” who spoke of “Equality of Rights” as well as the “Christian faith” as “self-mutilation”, leading to the “DETERIORATION OF THE EUROPEAN RACE”.It would be eminently safe to wager on the betting markets that Trump has never read Nietzsche or could offer the thinnest account of his work. Nonetheless, Trump has fashioned himself as a child of Nietzsche. A thousand points of light? The lights are going out all over America.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

There’s something magical about being able to access the past in tangible, physical waysSat 17 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 20.36 ESTShareIt’s important to state that I am the most insufferably sentimental person I know.There are old birthday cards collecting dust in my jam-packed cupboards, stuffed toys – their colours long-faded – sitting in my bedroom despite their prime cuddling years over, while gifts handmade by friends I no longer talk to take up real estate on my cluttered shelves. You couldn’t pay me to part with any of them.My apartment is chock-full of these nostalgic knick-knacks – which makes dusting incredibly labour-intensive. I can even pinpoint exactly when and where I got each one.The hot-pink alpaca teddy on my bookshelf? I won it in an arcade game in Japan a decade ago – first try! There’s a coffee-stained print of Matisse’s Blue Nude II I found on the side of the road with my first roommate, still hanging proudly on my wall. A One Direction T-shirt I bought as a teenager at one of their last concerts remains in my weekly pyjama rotation, despite it no longer fitting my adult body.‘What the hell, Mum?’ The parents who keep their children’s baby teethRead moreThere are some recent additions, such as my tiny collection of Sylvanian Family critters gifted to me by a friend last Christmas. Or beloved hand-me-downs, including a ceramic ram that belonged to my grandma.I would describe my interior style choices as sentimental maximalism. Others might say I have the early signs of a hoarding problem.The era of trinket collecting is in full swing within my generation. Spurred on by economic instability and the dreaded inevitability of “proper” adulthood replacing the remaining strands of adolescence, I am one of many who are ditching minimalism in favour of mementoes. It’s impossible to be sad when your home is filled with so much saccharine!Whimsy and nostalgia have been transformed into lifelines, but are we simply digging our claws deeper into a reality that no longer exists?After all, not all my trinkets bring positive emotions. I feel the twang of heartache whenever I see an object associated with someone no longer in my life. It’s not a fun experience when I’m just trying to make my morning coffee.There are also items scattered across my home that bring me unadulterated cringe. Dusty anime figurines from a bygone era of nerdy teenagehood, diaries from my early 20s filled with melodramatic angst, a framed picture of Lana Del Rey I made when I was in the depths of my stan Twitter phase. I could go on forever (but please don’t make me).They are humiliating, but I have a soft spot in my heart for them all.All the trinkets I own reflect the person I was, who I am now and the people who were by my side along the way. It might be easier to go on a social media stalk whenever I get a hankering to wander down memory lane – my apartment would be a hell of a lot tidier too – but there’s something magical about being able to access the past in tangible, physical ways. If you’ve ever mattered to me at any time in my life, odds are a part of you will always have a place in my home.My mum keeps a small amber-coloured glass bird on her dresser, gifted to her by a friend in the 70s who passed unexpectedly. She tells me she has kept it all these years (even surviving multiple international moves) because it acts as a tether to the memory of her friend. Remembering keeps her alive.I can relate. In my birthday card cupboard, there’s a special one from my 16th. It’s decorated with Hello Kitty’s image, and written by a close friend that reads: “I wish you the best for the rest of this week, and the next, and the next, and the rest of forever!”She was killed the following year, and I reread it whenever the pain of her loss hits me at random. A small part of her remains in my life.It’s easy to dismiss trinkets as dust-collecting novelties, but they are so much more meaningful. To me, they aren’t just things. They represent the always-growing mosaic of our lives, and all the people we have ever loved during it.Explore more on these topicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

The Department of Homeland Security justified the decision by claiming that immigrants from these countries are at “high risk” of reliance on welfare and becoming a “public charge”.As an immigration scholar, I was immediately struck by the falsehood of this economic justification. The vast majority of immigrants have beenlegally disqualifiedfrom cash welfare since 1996. Those who do qualify for benefits like Snap and Medicaid use them atmuch lower ratesthan non-immigrants. Through their taxes, immigrants arenet contributors– especiallyundocumented immigrantswho are excluded from federal benefits.I also noted a pattern uniting the countries on the list: nearly all were also restricted through the 1924 Immigration Act’sracial quotas.Abolished in 1965, due to the civil-rights movement’s demands for equality of all races under the law, racial quotas were at the heart of the1924 Immigration Act, also called the Johnson-Reed Act, which for four decades restricted immigration to the United States on the basis of nation of origin.Claudette Colvin’s life should teach us this: resistance is collective, and it never stops | Gary YoungeRead moreAlbert Johnson, its lead author, was a representative from Washington, and a eugenicist, whobelieved that“our capacity to maintain our cherished institutions stands diluted by a stream of alien blood”. Johnson, whoboasted about participatingin Ku Klux Klan violence against south Asians, wrote the Immigration Act to exclude anyone who was not a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.The 1924 law set a cap on total immigration to just a fifth of the pre-first world war number. It used the 1890 census to determine annual quotas for who could come from where, allocating nearly nine out of 10 slots to people from northern and western Europe, with the remaining largely set aside for people from southern and eastern Europe. Asians were totally barred, save for a few slots for people from the Levant, and total African admissions were capped at 1,200 people each year.The Immigration Actalso establishedthe category of “illegal alien” for the first time, as well as visa requirements. An accompanying act later that year allocated funds for the first border patrol.Trump’s rhetoric almost a century later bears a jarring resemblance to Johnson’s. The president has also claimed that immigrants are “poisoning the nation’s blood.” He too hassaid thathe prefers the “nice people” of Sweden, Norway and Denmark to people from “filthy, dirty, disgusting” countries like Somalia.The Johnson and Trump policies also developed in similar ways. Just as this administration is evoking the specter of immigrants becoming a “public charge”, and instructingconsular officersto test immigrant’s English through an interview, Johnson ushered through a bill in 1917, as a precursor to the 1924 Immigration Act, that excluded anyone who was a “public charge” and required a literacy test for immigrants. Both sets of policies demanded more stringent testing on immigrant health – Johnson was aproponentof sterilizing the mentally disabled.At the time, the Johnson-Reed Act was very popular. It passed withover 80%support in both houses of Congress. And it was signed into law by Calvin Coolidge, who believed that “America must be kept American”, echoing the mantra of the Ku Klux Klan, which was aproponent of the law.The Immigration Act achieved its goals of keeping America white and stopping migration. In the coming four decades, immigration to the United States would come to a screeching halt, dropping from 13% foreign-born in the 1920s to less than 5% in 1970. That year, the US was87.5% white.By contrast, today15%of people in the US are foreign-born, and the country is57.8% white. The concern that the United States could becomemajority non-whiteas of 2045 is likely a driving force for Project 2025’smass deportation visionthat Trump is enacting today.Then, like now, refugees were also denied. In one harrowing example, in 1939, more than 900 Jewish passengers aboard theSS St Louiswere forced to return to Europe, almost a quarter of whom later died in Nazi concentration camps. Even after the horrors of the Holocaust were fully revealed, it was not until 1948 that the United States took in Jewish refugees, and even then, just 200,000 people. Signing that bill into law, Harry Truman described himselfas reluctant, denouncing the bill’s restrictions as antisemitic and xenophobic.It is no surprise then that Adolf Hitler, who wrote about the Johnson-Reed Act in Mein Kampf, praised it, writing that the US was the “one state” that “simply excludes the immigration of certain races”.A century later, the 1924 Immigration Act still has fans. Stephen Miller, thearchitectof Trump’s mass deportation policy as the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser,has praisedCoolidge and the four decades of low immigration to the United States.With the return of immigration to the United States after the abolition of racial quotas in 1965 cameeconomic growth. New arrivals breathed life into US industryat all levels, injecting trillions of dollars into the economy, and filling key labor shortages. Yet, as the number of non-white people increased, pathways to admissions narrowed. The United States spent three times as much on the detention of immigrant detention as adjudicating immigrants’ claims. The idea that Trump is closing an open border belies the fact that $410bn has been spent on border securitization alone in the last two decades.None of these facts matter. The purpose of this immigration ban, like theother travel bansthis administration has passed, has nothing to do with economics. Just as the mass deportation agenda hasnothing to dowith immigrant criminality – which has longbeen a myth. The purpose of this latest immigration ban is to whiten the nation, period, just as was the purpose of the ban a century prior. This administration has said and has shown time and time again that there is “no price tag” on accomplishing this goal.But just as this latest immigration ban has precedent in US history, so too does the resistance to it. We can learn from the civil rights movement, from the Black led multiracial coalition that insisted that the rights of all people of color were deeply connected, that they needed to be treated equally under the law. We can recognize too that the work of that movement continues, that the white supremacy it fought is enduring, and that we need to organize and protest, and fight for a system that once and for all refuses enduring racist reasoning, and recognizes the humanity of all.Explore more on these topicsRaceOpinionUS immigrationDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

However, he is being paid only 29p a litre by his milk processor, leaving him operating at a loss, despite trying to run his business as efficiently as possible.Margins have always been tight, in an industry where supermarkets have traditionally used low milk prices to tempt shoppers through to door. Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda are currently charging £1.65 for four pints, which equates to 41p a pint, or 73p a litre. The UK processing industry is dominated by three main players – Arla, Müller and First Milk.Tompkins, the chair of the dairy board at the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), is no outlier: his cost of production is the same as the national average.“Dairy farmers are really good at sharing information, so I can benchmark myself against other businesses,” he says. “Every day we get up and try to do more with less.”If farmgate milk prices remain at the current level, Tompkins believes his farm will make a loss of at least £660,000 this year. However, they appear to be on a downwards trajectory, which could make the hit even bigger.Dairy is a globally traded commodity and farmers are used to market volatility, as the price fluctuates according to supply and demand. However, the speed of the current decline in prices appears to have caught many producers by surprise.It has prompted some to ask whether falling prices could alsohelp cool food price inflationand bring costs down for cash-strapped consumers.The price decline has been blamed on global oversupply of milk, which is outstripping demand.“It is a scary time for producers,” says Mike Houghton, a farm consultant and partner at Andersons.“American production is up and New Zealand is hanging on in there. A lot depends on China and how much they buy and that has not gone up. It all comes together and is a perfect storm. There is too much milk.”More than 7% extra milk was produced by British farmers in the final three months of 2025 compared with the five-year average, according to theAgriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB).Some of the current UK overproduction can be traced back to thedry spring and drought conditionsexperienced across the country in early 2025. A lack of grass for grazing caused many dairy farmers to buy animal feed for their herds – which was relatively cheap at the time, leading to well-fed cows producing record-breaking volumes.Processors struggled to cope with the quantity of milk. In the past few months, the situation has worsened and some producers and processors have had to throw milk away.The picture for dairy producers looks very different from a year ago, when some were benefiting from higher wholesale prices.Some of Britain’s largest supermarkets, including Tesco and Sainsbury’s, have committed to paying their farmers based on the cost of production, and other farmers are part of cooperatives, but these groups are not open to all. However, many farmers say they have little choice in who collects their milk, nor the price they are paid, as they are reliant on local processors.“Unless you’re on a cost-of-production-aligned retail contract now, you’re losing money, or, at very best, breaking even. How long this goes on for, no one really knows,” says Robert Craig, a dairy farmer from Cumbria who is the current chair of the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers.View image in fullscreenRobert Craig, the chair of the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers, says many dairy owners are losing money.Photograph: HandoutThe latest price shock comes as farmers have been knocked by a host of other cost increases – such as fertiliser and fuel – as well aschronic labour shortagesafter Brexit and the pandemic. The government’s move tointroduce inheritance tax on agricultural assetsabove £2.5m has been an additional concern.The environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, recently told an agricultural audience at the Oxford Farming Conference that the government – which has faced a backlash in rural constituencies it fought hard to win at the election – wouldsupport British farmers, as she praised their resilience in the face of volatile markets.However, in the face of financial pressures, significant numbers of dairy farmers have left the industry since the pandemic. Nearly 20% of British producers have quit since October 2019, according to figures from the AHDB, cutting their numbers from 8,720 to 7,010 in just six years.Despite this, the volume of milk produced in Britain has stayed steady, thanks in part to consolidation in the sector, ever-larger herds and remaining producers working to become more efficient.Now farmers and industry experts warn the latest milk price shock will lead to more calling it a day.Houghton predicts that as many as 10% of dairy producers – or 700 farmers – could leave the industry for good.“It’s a combination of factors, if you don’t have a successor, if you have got to reinvest in slurry and silage capacity just to manage production which won’t put on the bottom line, then why would you do all that at a milk price of 35p?” he says.Many shoppers will wonder whether falling wholesale prices will be reflected in the cost of dairy products in their shopping baskets, after months of persistently high food inflation.Some consumers may be waiting a while. The average time lag for lower prices feeding through to consumers is seven months, according to the AHDB. Retail prices for butter are expected to fall “but not until April, with the biggest price drops from June”, wrote Grace Withers, AHDB’s lead retail insight manager in a recent research note. The price of cheddar is also expected to start coming down from July.Morrisons said it had reduced the prices of some milk, butter and cheese products in recent days.Meanwhile, the nation’s coffee lovers are unlikely to enjoy lower prices for their cappuccinos any time soon.“Milk and dairy are a significant cost but far and away not the only one”, says Jeffrey Young, the chief executive of the consultancy Allegra Group. “Rent and people costs are way more substantial. The minimum wage is going up again. Chains might reduce their price increases but it’s unlikely that lower prices will be passed on to consumers.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Juuso WesterlundHow would you feel if your therapist’s notes – your darkest thoughts and deepest feelings – were exposed to the world? For 33,000 Finnish people, that became a terrifying reality, with deadly consequencesByJenny KleemanSat 17 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTShareTiina Parikka was half-naked when she read the email. It was a Saturday in late October 2020, and Parikka had spent the morning sorting out plans for distance learning after a Covid outbreak at the school where she was headteacher. She had taken a sauna at her flat in Vantaa, just outside Finland’s capital, Helsinki, and when she came into her bedroom to get dressed, she idly checked her phone. There was a message that began with Parikka’s name and her social security number – the unique code used to identify Finnish people when they access healthcare, education and banking. “I knew then that this is not a game,” she says.The email was in Finnish. It was jarringly polite. “We are contacting you because you have used Vastaamo’s therapy and/or psychiatric services,” it read. “Unfortunately, we have to ask you to pay to keep your personal information safe.” The sender demanded €200 in bitcoin within 24 hours, otherwise the price would go up to €500 within 48 hours. “If we still do not receive our money after this, your information will be published for everyone to see, including your name, address, phone number, social security number and detailed records containing transcripts of your conversations with Vastaamo’s therapists or psychiatrists.”Parikka swallows hard as she relives this memory. “My heart was pounding. It was really difficult to breathe. I remember lying down on the bed and telling my spouse, ‘I think I’m going to have a heart attack.’”Someone had hacked into Vastaamo, the company through which Parikka had accessed psychotherapy. They’d got hold of therapy notes containing her most private, intimate feelings and darkest thoughts – and they were holding them to ransom. Parikka’s mind raced as she tried to recall everything she’d confided during three years of weekly therapy sessions. How would her family react if they knew what she’d been saying? What would her students say? The sense of exposure and violation was unfathomable: “It felt like a public rape.”Therapy had been Parikka’s lifeline. Now 62, she’d had three children by the time she was 25, including twins who had been born extremely prematurely in the 1980s, weighing only a few hundred grams each. One grew up with cerebral palsy; the other is blind. Parikka spent years juggling medical emergencies, surgeries and hospital stays with a demanding job and a crumbling marriage. “During those years, nobody ever asked me, the mother, ‘How are you?’”View image in fullscreen‘My heart was pounding. It was really difficult to breathe … It felt like a public rape’: Tiina Parikka.Photograph: Juuso Westerlund/The GuardianShe divorced in 2014 and met her current partner a year later. By then, her children were adults with independent lives. After decades of putting everyone’s else’s needs before her own, she should have been finally able to exhale. Instead, she had a breakdown. “I had full-scale anxiety running through my body all the time. I couldn’t sleep. I had panic attacks. I couldn’t eat.” Driving at high speed on the highway one day, dark thoughts descended. “I was thinking, I wouldn’t mind if this car crashed.”In search of urgent help, she went to Google, which led her to Vastaamo, Finland’s one-stop digital shop for people in search of psychotherapy. No doctor referral was necessary. She managed to book a session for the very next day. “It was that easy.”Being able to confide in a total stranger felt liberating. She told her therapist things she had never told another soul. “Trauma in relationships. The disappointment and tragedy of having disabled children, and the influence it had on my life,” she says. “Silly things, childish things. It’s very human to feel hate, anger, rage.”After Parikka read the email that left her struggling to breathe, she had no idea where to turn for help. She rang the emergency services, but the police told her to get off the line; they needed to keep it free for real emergencies. In her bathrobe, her phone still in her hand, she felt utterly alone.But Parikka was far from alone. Across Finland, 33,000 people who had used Vastaamo were discovering that a hacker had got hold of their therapy notes and was holding them to ransom. These were people who, by definition, were likely to be vulnerable, in need of help. Each was experiencing a very personal, individual terror. In a country of only 5.6 million people, everyone knows someone who was hacked.Some victims’ notes had already been cherrypicked for the world to see. Three days before the extortion emails were sent, someone using the handle ransom_man had left posts on the dark web, on r/Suomi, the Finnish-language subreddit, and on Ylilauta, Finland’s equivalent to4chan. This time, the post was in English.“Hello Finnish Colleagues,” it began. “We have hacked the psychotherapy clinic vastaamo.fi and taken tens of thousands of patient records including extremely sensitive session notes and social security numbers. We requested a small payment of 40 bitcoins (nothing for a company with yearly revenues close to 20 million euros) but the CEO has stopped responding to our emails. We are now starting to gradually release their patient records, 100 entries every day.”There was a link to the dark web, where 100 records were already on display. Directly below it, ransom_man had signed off the post with a single word: “Enjoy!”Lawyers know of cases where people took their own lives after they discovered their therapy notes had been hackedThe 100 records included those of politicians, police officers and prominent public figures. Their names appeared alongside therapy notes that contained details of adultery, suicide attempts, paedophilia and sexual violence. Some of the records belonged to children. And whoever was behind the hack was true to their word: the next day, 100 more patient records were uploaded.Some victims went searching on the dark web in a desperate attempt to see if their records were out there. Some paid the ransom, scrabbling to get hold of bitcoin while the clock ticked down. Lawyers representing the victims have told me they know of at least two cases where people took their own lives after they discovered their therapy notes had been hacked.But for all of them, it was already too late. At 2am on 23 October 2020 – the day before the emails began to arrive in tens of thousands of inboxes – ransom_man had uploaded a much larger file. It contained every record of every single patient on Vastaamo’s database. Everyone’s therapy notes had already been published, for free, for everyone in the world to see.Who was behind the biggest crime Finland had ever known? And might they have been motivated by something other than money? I have spent 18 months trying to answer these questions, following threads across Europe and the US. They culminated in a visit to a prison, and one of the most chilling conversations I have ever had.Finland has beenranked the happiest country on Earthby the UN for the last eight years in a row. A world leader inchildcareand education, Finland is also famously hi-tech: it’s themost digitalised countryin Europe, renowned for its communications sector (as the home of Nokia) and leading the way when it comes to cybersecurity and AI innovation. But Finland is also a place of extremes. It hasmore heavy metal bands per capitathan any other nation. In the far north, for the few days around the winter solstice, the sundoes not rise.Vastaamo had long been considered an example of how Finland was getting it right when it came to digital tech. Founded in 2008 by entrepreneur Ville Tapio and his mother, Nina, a psychotherapist, the aim was to open up therapy to the masses, removing the stigma of asking for help. The platform made it easy for people to see who was free, where, and what therapeutic approach they specialised in. The logo had the colour palette of a first-aid kit, with white lettering in a green speech bubble. Vastaamo means “a place for answers”.It was an attractive platform for therapists, too: they didn’t have to worry about marketing or billing – Vastaamo would take care of all of that. The company even provided a behind-the-scenes digital interface where therapists could make and store their notes. This formula, combined with the increasing demand for therapy services, meant Vastaamo grew fast. It opened its own network of around 20 clinics across Finland, employingmore than 220 psychotherapistsby 2018, leading some in Finland to refer to it as “the McDonald’s of therapy”. In the years before Zoom and Teams were part of our daily lives, the remote therapy also offered by Vastaamo was groundbreaking. In 2019, a private equity firm bought a majority stake in the company, earning the Tapio family a payout ofmore than €5m.Meri-Tuuli Auer, 30, describes using Vastaamo as “like Uber for therapy – convenient, accessible, relatively cheap”. She picked her therapist because he offered cognitive psychotherapy – and she liked his photo. “He looked nice. He looked approachable.”Auer’s home, on the outskirts of Helsinki, is a riot of pink. There are Barbie dolls, Barbie books and Barbie-themed handbags on her shelves, as well as a glittery open-top Barbie sports car. A pole-dancing pole takes pride of place in the centre of her living room.“I’m a mixed personality,” she tells me over tea in Moomin mugs. “I love being around people, but I get that inkling, that doubt: maybe they all think I’m full of shit and stupid and ugly and I have no idea what I’m doing.” Auer has struggled with depression for much of her life. When she was 18, she was in a secretive, difficult relationship with a man 29 years her senior, which made her self-esteem plummet further. She was drinking heavily. “If I hadn’t gone to therapy, I don’t know what would have become of me. Maybe there is another universe where I didn’t make it to 30.”View image in fullscreen‘I closed myself in at home, I didn’t want anyone to see me’: Meri-Tuuli Auer.Photograph: Juuso Westerlund/The GuardianMost of the cost of Auer’s treatment was covered by the Finnish healthcare system; she paid only about €25 for each weekly session. She was making great strides. “After going to therapy in 2018 and 2019, I had gained a basic sense of security. That was lost in 2020.”Vastaamo’s CEO knew the company’s patient registry was being held to ransom weeks before his customers found out. On 28 September 2020, Ville Tapio received an email demanding the bitcoin equivalent of €450,000 to keep it safe. Sample patient records attached to the email proved the extortionist wasn’t bluffing. Tapio called in a cybersecurity firm to investigate.Medical information is an obvious target for would-­be extortionists, says Antti Kurittu, the security specialist Tapio hired. But this was something else: “Whatever I tell a therapist is, by its very nature, a lot more private than what my blood pressure is,” he says, drily.Kurittu used to be a detective, investigating cybercrimes for the Finnish police; he says he insisted they be told about the ransom attempt so they could begin a parallel investigation. Meanwhile, he began inspecting Vastaamo’s server, looking for clues as to who might be behind the hack – and one of the first things he noticed was how lax security had been. “It was definitely unfit for purpose for storing this kind of information,” he says. He tells me that the patient records database was accessible via the internet; there was no firewall and, perhaps most egregiously, it was secured with a blank password, so anyone could just press enter and open it. Kurittu determined that whoever had hacked Vastaamo had probably just been scanning the internet in search of any badly secured databases that could be monetised. “They tried a bunch of bank vaults to see which ones were open, and just happened to stumble on this one.”Our worst secrets – things we might really, really not want to share with the entire world – they exist onlineFor a few weeks, the hacker and Vastaamo exchanged emails, but there was no question that Vastaamo would pay the ransom. If they did, they’d have to trust a criminal’s word that the records had been destroyed – plus, Kurittu says, it goes against the national character. “Finns are a bit of a belligerent bunch. We’re not known for paying ransom quietly or easily, which I take great national pride in.”After ransom_man started leaking patient records to put pressure on the company, Kurittu kept a close eye on the server being used to publish them. He had a hunch whoever was behind this was either Finnish, or had lived in Finland for a long time: they knew which famous names to flaunt from the patient records.When Auer learned about the hack, she downloaded a browser that would enable her to access the dark web, for the first time in her life. “I was thinking to myself, I just have to see if my records are there.” She found her name wasn’t among the first batch posted, and closed the file without reading anyone’s records. But she saw other people discussing what they’d seen. “People had already picked – in their opinion – the funniest parts from the patient records. They were laughing at these people’s misery. A 10-year-old child had gone to therapy, and people found it funny.”Auer began to spiral. “I closed myself in at home, I didn’t want to leave, I didn’t want anyone to see me,” she tells me. She had no hope that the hacker would ever be found. “It’s not that I don’t trust the police in Finland – it’s just that it seemed like an impossible task.”But the much larger file ransom_man had uploaded to the dark web – the one that contained every single one of Vastaamo’s patient records – also included vital clues to his identity. The first three batches of therapy notes had been posted manually, but when the hacker had tried to automate the process, he had not only accidentally uploaded all of the therapy notes, but also his entire home folder. It had appeared only briefly before it was taken down, along with a post that read “whoopsie :D”, but ransom_man had screwed up.“After spending several evenings with the file, I had the feeling I’d seen this kind of thing before,” Kurittu says. The data on the hacker’s home drive wasn’t systematically organised and arranged in folders, as you would expect from someone for whom extortion was a business. “It had that sort of chaotic, passionate hobby feeling to it.” And there was something about the childish way ransom_man had named some of the files that was eerily familiar (the one containing all the patient data was entitled “therapissed”).Kurittu’s mind went back to 2013 when he was a senior detective constable for the Helsinki police, and the file names he’d seen on a computer he’d seized from a 16-year-old boy. “It made me think of Julius Kivimäki.”Aleksanteri Kivimäki – who used to go by his middle name, Julius, or the online handle zeekill – had long been notorious among cybersecurity investigators. Not because of any particular talent as a hacker, but because he seemed prepared to go further than most who spend their time in the darkest parts of the internet.Aged 14, Kivimäki was involved with a group called Hack the Planet (named after the tagline of the 1995 movie Hackers). They would break into big companies and show off what they had managed to steal online. “It was for the LOLs,” says Blair Strater, a former hacker from Illinois who hung out with Kivimäki in internet relay chat forums at that time. “You notice that something is open and you just take it. It’s not targeted.”This kind of hacking was about impressing others – winning online clout, not extorting money. But some of those involved may have felt they were also serving a noble purpose: exposing security vulnerabilities in major corporations, or the hypocrisy of cybersecurity firms who claimed to be qualified to advise businesses while being unable to secure their own network.Strater found Kivimäki amusing, at first. “A lot of the things he did early on were objectively funny,” he tells me over Zoom from his home in Illinois. When I ask Strater whetherIwould find them funny, he clarifies that his humour was an acquired taste best suited to 4chan. But in 2010, when Strater was 17 and Kivimäki was 14, they fell out over which one of them was going to publish a report of a recent hack.Orders of pizzas and Chinese takeaway began arriving at the home Strater shared with his parents and younger sister on the outskirts of Chicago; when they opened the door, the delivery driver would ask for Julius Kivimäki. “Taxis were ordered. Hookers were ordered,” Strater says. “My father had to send away a big dump truck filled with gravel.” Strater received a blizzard of letters from credit card and insurance companies, and government agencies, including one from the department of social security confirming that an appointment with the welfare office had been created for him and his spouse – Julius Kivimäki.Then, at 2am one morning, police in body armour carrying guns with laser sights turned up outside the Straters’ home, responding to reports that Blair had beaten his mother to death in a drug-fuelled rage. When she answered the door, they took her blood pressure to verify that she was, in fact, alive. It was the first of dozens of so-called swatting attacks the family would endure. After a lull of a couple of months, Strater learned that someone using his name had emailed a bomb threat to a local police officer; it led to Strater spending three weeks over Christmas in a juvenile detention centre.Several years into their feud, in 2015, someonehacked Elon Musk and Tesla’s Twitter accounts,and tweeted that anyone who rang the Straters’ landline or showed up at their home would get a free car; their phone rang off the hook for days, and Blair’s father had to turn several disappointed people away from their porch. Someone using Blair’s mother’s name posted a threat to shoot up the elementary school where his 10-year-old sister was a pupil. His mother’s LinkedIn and Twitter accounts were hacked and filled with juvenile, racist posts, as well as antisemitic insults directed at the company where she worked as a healthcare statistician. Within months, she had lost her job.The campaign of terror lasted for many more years. Strater says it’s never going to be fully over. “It’s like having cancer: it’s never really cured, it goes into remission,” he says. “Every so often, someone would hit me up and say, ‘Hey, I was one of the people that helped Julius do these things.’ Sometimes they would say, ‘He made me do them. He was blackmailing me,’ which is something he does to an awful lot of people. I want to make this very clear: I am not the person zeekill fucked with the most.”Indeed, Kivimäki set his sights far beyond the Strater family. In August 2014 – days after his 17th birthday – he rang ina fake bomb threatthat grounded a flight carrying John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment, who oversaw PlayStation’s multiplayer network. A group calling themselves Lizard Squad claimed responsibility, posting almost nonsensically on Twitter that the attack was in sympathy with Islamic State. Lizard Squad struck again, on 25 December 2014, with a cyber-attack that shut down Xbox and PlayStation, and ruined Christmas morning for millions. Brazenly, Kivimäki gave interviews toBBC 5 LiveandSky Newsas a Lizard Squad spokesperson, claiming they did the hack both to amuse themselves and to expose Microsoft and Sony’s poor cybersecurity. He seemed to revel in the chaos and drama. He appeared on camera on Sky News; he used a fake name, but his boyish face – blond hair, blue eyes, plump cheeks – was visible for all to see.In July 2015, following Kurittu’s investigation with the Finnish police, Kivimäki was convicted of hacking into servers at MIT and Harvard universities, as well as money laundering and fraud. He wasfound guiltyof more than 50,000 data breaches, and received a two-year suspended sentence; he had his computer confiscated and was forced to pay back more than €6,000 obtained through his crimes. He never faced justice for any of the offences he perpetrated against Blair Strater and his family.Shortly after he received his suspended sentence, Kivimäki updated his Twitter bio to read “untouchable hacker god”.Kivimäki spent the next few years travelling the world. During lockdown, he lived in an air-conditioned apartment in Westminster, 20 metres away from the central London headquarters of MI5. There were trips to Dubai, Hong Kong, Barcelona and Paris. According to the images of himself he liked to post online, he was living the life of an international jetsetter. But he was not, in the end, untouchable.Police made a micropayment of 0.1 bitcoins to ransom_man. They were able to determine that, when it was laundered into real-world currency, it was transferred into Kivimäki’s bank account. The home folder ransom_man had accidentally uploaded had led the police to some servers, one of which had been paid for using a credit card linked to him – the same one he’d been using to pay for Apple services and an OnlyFans subscription.As investigators traced the history on ransom_man’s home folder, they were able to determine that, as well as looking for keywords such as rape, abuse and child molestation in the database of patient records, the hacker had also searched for Kivimäki’s home address, and the names of his family members. “Before publication, he ensured there was no harmful information about him, or people close to him,” Pasi Vainio, the lead prosecutor on the case, tells me. Those searches took place using an IP address linked to Kivimäki’s Westminster apartment. “He was in London when the crimes were committed.”But it was a drawn-out, arduous investigation. There were terabytes of data to comb through. The crime had so many victims that the police had to create an online portal for everyone to register and give their statements. That generated more than 21,000 criminal reports, all of which needed to be looked at individually. So it was October 2022 – two years after Parikka, Auer and the other victims had received their ransom demands – before Vainio signed an arrest warrant for Kivimäki. His face – chubby-cheeked and floppy-haired – was added to Europol’s list of most-wanted fugitives, alongside murderers and drug traffickers.On 3 February 2023, French police were alerted to a report of domestic violence taking place in a flat in a Paris suburb. Officers used a battering ram to enter the property and found a man and a woman inside. The man was pale and white-blond, but when asked to identify himself he handed over a Romanian passport that gave his name as Asan Amet. “We have a Scandinavian-looking guy, 195cm tall,” Vainio tells me with a smile. “I think the French police just thought something’s off.” They searched their databases and discovered Amet was one of Kivimäki’s known aliases. He was handed over to the Finnish authorities a few weeks later.View image in fullscreenAleksanteri Kivimäki photographed in prison in February 2024.Photograph: Juuso Westerlund“I don’t know what I had expected, but I was surprised to see that he looked so normal,” Auer says. “He looks like a regular Finnish young man. It did make me feel like it could have been anyone.”“I had heard that he was in a court hearing,” Parikka says. “We have a habit – every night at 8.30pm, I’ll lie here on the couch with my spouse and watch the main news. Without warning, Kivimäki was there on the screen. Kivimäki came to my living room.” She glances over to her couch, metres away from where we sit, and is overcome with tears.“I didn’t sleep the next night.”But when the trial began, in November 2023, Parikka was determined to watch Kivimäki face justice. The logistics of inviting more than 21,000 registered victims to court were impossible; instead, proceedings were relayed to public spaces such as cinemas so that the plaintiffs could watch in real time. In a case that was all about the right to privacy and anonymity, it sounds a profoundly awkward setup. “We were all sitting far away from each other,” Auer says. “It was dead silent.” Parikka had a similar experience. “We pretty much kept to ourselves.”On 30 April 2024, Kivimäki was found guilty of all charges – including 9,600 counts of aggravated invasion of privacy and more than 21,300 counts of attempted aggravated extortion – and sentenced to six years and three months in prison: a long stretch by Finnish standards, but shy of the seven-year maximum he could have received. His appeal against his sentence is currently under way.Even if his conviction is upheld, he will be a free man by the end of this year.“The sentencing scale is too low, in my opinion. But that’s the framework we have in Finland,” Vainio says. He tells me a colleague has tried to quantify the harm caused, using the conservative estimate that each person had endured a week of agony as a result of the hack. “When you multiply it with the number of victims of this case, you would have 635 years of suffering.”Now 28, Kivimäki has served much of his sentence in a spotless, bright but suitably austere facility in Turku, south-west Finland, a two-hour train ride from Helsinki. For months, he had refused to grant me an interview, but while I am in Finland reporting this story, he changes his mind. As I sit in silence in the prison’s visitor room for what feels like hours, watching the clock tick down behind a panel of reinforced glass, I wonder if Kivimäki is trolling me; if he has dragged me over here simply to derail the other interviews I already had scheduled, with no intention of ever leaving his cell. But after 40 minutes he appears. With his white-blond hair, ice-blue eyes and razor burn, and dressed in a black T-shirt and shorts, he looks like an overgrown teenage boy.He didn’t do it, he says; he’s simply a victim of his own notoriety. “They had to find somebody. They just chose somebody who was convenient for the story.” When I point out that there’s an enormous amount of circumstantial evidence linking him to the hack, Kivimäki is defiant. “The obvious answer is that it’s just somebody close to me.” He has an idea who it is, he continues, but he isn’t prepared to name names.Life after the Ashley Madison affairRead moreIt seems very selfless to do time for someone else’s crime, I say. I tell him Parikka says having her therapy notes held to ransom felt like a public rape. “I’m sure that’s how she felt,” he replies, blankly. “It’s quite remote to me. I’m involved, in that I was in court over this stuff, but I didn’t do it. It’s another story in the news.”As a fellow human being rather than the person convicted of the crime, I ask, what’s your response to people taking their lives after having their therapy notes stolen? “There’s a lot of terrible things going on in the world. I don’t really feel any differently about this. I turn on the news and there’s people dying in Gaza or wherever. It’s like, how do you feel aboutthat? I think the honest answer for most people is that they just …don’t.” You don’t have anything to say to the victims? “Not really,” he replies. “These are nameless, faceless people.”“There’s been just one question that I would ask Kivimäki,” Parikka says. “That would be: ‘Was there ever such a moment that you felt empathy?’ I don’t think he’s able to put himself into anybody else’s situation.” She pauses. “I think that he really needs therapy.”Vastaamo wasdeclared bankruptin February 2021. Days after patients received the ransom emails, the board announced that it had let the CEO, Ville Tapio, go. In April 2023, Tapio wasfound guiltyof criminal negligence in his handling of patient data. His conviction was overturned on appeal in December 2025. (He declined my requests to interview him.)“I have actually been more angry towards Ville Tapio than I have been towards Kivimäki,” Auer says. “As CEO of the company, he had the responsibility to make sure that it was prepared for all kinds of risks, and that they had sufficient information security. It seems like it was never a priority to him.” What was his priority?“Making money. He ran a very successful business.”“I believe that originally the Tapios were wanting to help people and make therapy available,” Parikka says. “There are now maybe thousands of people who will never use therapy again, because they can never trust. And that’s really bad.”Alongside more than 6,000 other plaintiffs, Auer and Parikka are part of a civil case suing Kivimäki for damages. Despite the lifestyle he projects online, he claims not to have the funds to pay damages; so far, no one has been able to find his assets. The government has agreed to pay compensation to victims – anything froma few hundred euros to a few thousand,depending on how many pages of their therapy notes Vastaamo had in its database, and how sensitive the information contained in those pages was – but the sum is likely to be symbolic. How can you ever repay the damage of being exposed in this way?Copies of the patient files have been circulating ever since they were first released in October 2020. At one point, someone created a special search engine for browsing the database. This doesn’t surprise Parikka. “Kivimäki isn’t just one of a kind,” she says. “I know human curiosity. People want to know.”Other people are as prepared as Kivimäki was to break moral and legal boundaries – for money, for online clout, out of ghoulish curiosity or simply for the LOLs. In May, Finnish policeannouncedthat there was a second suspect in the Vastaamo case, a US citizen living in Estonia – suspected of aiding and abetting Kivimäki, helping prepare the files. He has been charged with assisting in the attempted extortion.In an era when AI models aretrained on our Zoomconversations,emailsand status updates, it is naive to believe that anything can ever be fully secure. The human need to confide in others can be met in an extraordinary range of ways in the digital age. In a world of unparalleled connectivity, can our innermost secrets ever be truly safe?Kivimäki thinks we are all clinging on to analogue expectations about privacy in a digital world. “So many of our worst secrets – I meanworstof worst, things we might really, really not want to share with the entire world – they exist online. They’ll exist in the database of some company you used,” he tells me. “Everybody’s photos, everybody’s text-messaging histories.” He fixes me with his eyes. “You fundamentally want to believe in this privacy. But, on the other hand, I don’t know how you’re going to get there.”Intrigue: Ransom Man, Jenny Kleeman’s six-part series for BBC Radio 4, is availablenow on BBC Sounds.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeCyberbullyingCounselling and therapyInternetMental healthFinlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So, I don’t know. That’s going to be for some economists to tell and also – and I’ll be involved in that decision too. But they have a very big market share.”The next day, Paramount Skydancelauncheda $108.4bn hostile takeover bid, financially backed by its chief executive officer, David Ellison, and his father, the billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison. Both men are friendly with the Trump administration.The Netflix-WBD deal hasfaced backlashfrom US politicians, with US senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts calling it “an anti-monopoly nightmare” in a statement shortly after the announcement.The deal, which would bring shows such as Game of Thrones into Netflix’s streaming library, was also criticized by the Writers Guild of America, which said it would “would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers”.Trump bought about $100m in municipal and corporate bonds from mid-November to late December, Friday’s financial disclosure showed. He previously bought more than $100m in company, state and municipal bonds during the first six months of his second term, including bonds in Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.The White House did not immediately respond to questions from the Guardian. However, an unnamed administration official reportedlytoldthe Washington Post that Trump’s “stock and bond portfolio is independently managed by third-party financial institutions”.The official reportedly added: “Neither President Trump nor any member of his family has any ability to direct, influence, or provide input regarding how the portfolio is invested or when investments are bought or sold.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpWarner BrosNetflixEthicsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The £7 chicken satay ready meal and £2 coconut water shot “H₅O”, it says, are ideal for people “reducing their food intake”. Meanwhile, the Co-op is plugging “mini meals” – 250g-280g pots “inspired by global cuisines” costing £3.50 a go.About 6% of UK adults are thought to be taking GLP-1 drugs, said Jonny Forsyth, a senior analyst at the market research company Mintel. However, he argues the hype around them is having an “outsize influence” on consumer behaviour and amplifying other diet trends, such as eating high protein foods.View image in fullscreenOcado’s Turf & Clover small extra lean steak.Photograph: Ocado/PAIn the recent flurry of Christmas trading updates, some big high street names said the drugs were starting to change how people shopped. This included eating fewer sausage rolls, and Roisin Currie, the Greggs chief executive, commented that people were looking for “smaller portions” and healthier options.Sainsbury’s has also spotted new behaviour. “For customers using these products, we’re seeing more of that switch into healthier choices, into fresh food, into fibre,” said its chief executive, Simon Roberts. This month the grocer introduced more low-calorie and high-protein ready meals. The 300g “Small but Mighty” range includes dishes such as teriyaki chicken and costs £3.Ken Murphy, theTescochief executive, said the supermarket was watching “very closely” how the GLP-1 trend was developing.Indeed, while total UK grocery sales rose 2.5% in value terms over the four weeks to 27 December, the amount of food and drink sold declined 0.2% on a volume basis, according to the market researcher NielsenIQ.For food and hospitality businesses the fear is that the widespread uptake of these drugs could put a dent in profits. A2024 Cornell Universitystudy found households with at least one GLP-1 user cut their grocery spend by 5.3% within six months, while for higher-income households it was 8.2%.Although there were declines in most food categories over the period studied, in some areas they were marked, with savoury snacks such as crisps down 10.1% and an 8% drop in spending at fast-food chains and coffee shops. In the US almost 20% of adults are taking weight-loss drugs.However, can supermarkets turn small portions into a virtue, given consumers are fed up withshrinkflation(where shoppers get less product for the same or higher price)? There is also a question mark over whether people want ranges with “GLP-1” stamped on the front as they may not be open about the fact they are using medication.The Morrisons “GLP-1 friendly” own-label ready meals, which include a chicken casserole, weigh just 280g but cost the same as dishes in its other diet ranges. The £3.75 price is fairly typical in ready meals, but if one compares the price per kilo it is a different story,said Charlotte Derra, fast-moving consumer goods category consultant.“Morrisons Counted and Protein ranges are the same price for typically 380g v the 280g GLP-1 friendly range,” she said. “At £0.99 v £1.34 per 100g for the GLP-1 friendly ranges this is at a 35% price premium.” The M&S Nutrient Dense ready meals come in 400g packs and cost £7 (£1.75/100g), which she said was within typical ready meal pack sizes.M&S, Co-op and Iceland have “rightly” avoided explicitly mentioning GLP-1 drugs on the front of packs, Forsyth said. “This is smart marketing because we know from our data that if you group people into a club, such as Weight Watchers, where people feel there is a stigma attached to belonging, you restrict your potential audience.”The M&S range is the “most likely to do well because its user base are among the minority of Brits who can afford to pay for these drugs privately” added Forsyth, who found it “bizarre” that Greggs had said the drugs were hitting sales. “I suspect it has more to do with people cutting back on discretionary food spend in response to much higher food prices since 2022. Even Greggs’ iconicsausage roll has soared in priceby 30%,” he said.The GLP-1 ready meals in Morrisons mean it is now sells four healthy chicken tikka masala dishes. However, in a cutthroat UK grocery market worth £250bn a year, food market product developers are under pressure to react, given the outlook for some food categories is “pretty bleak”, said Mark Whalley, a co-founder of the video insights company Explners.“UK supermarket retail is dominated by everybody worrying that the other guys are on to something,” he said. The hard part will be convincing shoppers: “Being small is in itself a benefit. That’s what they’re effectively saying when the price doesn’t go down with the portion size.“It’s just whether there’s an actual need for these products, or whether people could just eat a little bit less of the products that they already buy. Does it specifically need a new product, an extra thing on shelf that’s just 100g smaller?”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industrySupermarketsWeight-loss drugsRetail industryMarks & SpencerMorrisonsAsdanewsShareReuse this content"

As a child, Chasing Horse had acted in the 1990 Oscar-winning movie Dances with Wolves. As an adult, he traveled North America performing healing ceremonies.In 2005, Leone, then a mother of a seven-year old daughter, attended a ritual in which Chasing Horse said he was connecting with ancestral spirits. “It was like he turned the lights on in a dark room,” Leone said. “It all just felt like I belonged. He had this ability to charm you.”Eventually, after becoming part of Chasing Horse’s group, the Circle, attending healing ceremonies and surviving cancer, Leone started to see him as a messianic figure.“He could say, ask or do anything, and there was no wrong,” Leone said.And that was where it all went bad.The belief that Chasing Horse had healing powers made it easy for him to sexually abuse minors, including Leone’s daughter, according to a criminal indictment. Chasing Horse now faces 21 charges, including sexual assault, sexual assault with a minor, first-degree kidnapping of a minor and the use of a minor in producing pornography.He has pleaded not guilty, and his trial started last Tuesday inLas Vegas, throwing light on a shocking case of what seems to have operated like a cult and also on the often under-reported area of sexual or violent exploitation of Native American women.Leone and others say the indictment is about more than Chasing Horse facing justice for his alleged sexual abuse. They see his behavior, including also allegedly sexually abusing and manipulating adults, as part of a larger problem of people in his position taking advantage of those they offer to heal – and of police not doing enough to stop them.“This is about medicine people, and all Indian country, exploiting their people under the guise of spirituality,” Leone said. “That must end.”In Dances with Wolves Chasing Horse starred as a character named Smiles a Lot and made a “noticeable cameo”, theNew York Timesreported. “The beautiful Indian child Smiles a Lot … comes of age during the film through his first tomahawk murder,” the newspaper wrote.As an adult, Chasing Horse spoke atpowwowsaround the country.At a 2013Fort Mojave tribegathering, Chasing Horse shared how doctors diagnosed his mother with terminal throat cancer and told the family to “prepare because she’s not going to be here very long”.But they held a ceremony, during which a messenger told her she would live. When she returned to the “white doctors” in New York, tests showed she was cancer-free, Chasing Horse said.He then explained how a ceremonial whistle’s healing powers worked.“The purpose of blowing this whistle is you’re going to give a part of your life to that person you’re blowing for, so be sure that you mean it because your life will be shortened a few years,” Chasing Horse said. “If you don’t do it from your heart, maybe they’ll take your whole life. That’s the exchange.”Chasing Horse frequently instilled that sort of fear in his followers, said Fernando Trujillo, who from 2006 until 2014 was part of the Circle, which at its peak had about 300 members, theAssociated Pressreported.Chasing Horse asked Trujillo to travel with his crew after a ceremony because he learned Trujillo could sing.“I felt honored to know somebody like that,” Trujillo said.But he started to see how Chasing Horse womanized and convinced people to give him their money.“Let’s say you need help in some way, and the doctors ain’t trying to do much for you, you might say, ‘Hey, I think I want to go to a healer,’” said Trujillo. Chasing Horse “was able to manipulate a lot of people” by portraying himself as “the ultimate of medicine people or somebody with a spiritual connection that others didn’t have”.When Leone was diagnosed with cancer in 2013, her 14-year-old daughter, Ren Leone-LaCroix, traveled to Las Vegas to ask Chasing Horse for help, according to court records. She prepared a meal and a pipe for him. He then took her into his bedroom closet, where he told her it was “a life for a life and explained that it meant taking her first born and her virginity”, records state.Chasing Horse allegedly raped her and then took her on the road with him, where he raped her every night, she toldABC News.Leone also survived cancer three times.“He was saving people’s lives,” Leone said she believed at the time.He allegedly continued to sexually abuse Leone-LaCroix for years.In 2015, leaders of the Fort Peck tribe in Montana banned Chasing Horse from holding ceremonies on their reservation because of alleged human trafficking, drug dealing, spiritual abuse and intimidation of tribal members,IndiJ Public Media, an Indigenous news organization, reported.“Lilda Christian, another supporter of Chasing Horse, said [she was] to seek out the actor because there are no legitimate medicine men around the reservation and the local ones have served time in prison for sex crimes,”IndiJ Public Mediareported in 2015.More than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence and more than half have experienced sexual violence, according to a 2016National Institute of Justicestudy.Chasing Horse is “not a one-off”, said Crystal Lee, CEO and founder of the organization United Natives, which offers services to victims of sexual abuse. Since 2024, purported medicine men among theSaskatchewan Cree; theOjibway-Anishinaabeg; and theUte Mountain Utehave all been convicted of sexual assault.“It’s a big elephant in the room of holding our Native men accountable for being perpetrators among our own women, children and family community,” Lee said.At 16, the age of consent inNevada, Leone-LaCroix told her mom she wanted to become one of Chasing Horse’s spiritual wives.Chasing Horse told Leone nothing had happened between them and that they were asking her permission, she said.Leone told ABC News that she “looked at it as an honor” and that “when she told me that she loved him, that was enough”.She said she had not been aware that he had allegedly previously raped her daughter and threatened her that if she said anything, her mother would die. She also did not learn until later that after Leone-LaCroix became one of his wives, he allegedly regularly beat her.However, Leone had heard other allegations.“He would always have evidence to justify that what the victims were saying was not true,” Leone recalled. “I’m not ignorant, but the brainwashing and the spiritual manipulation he uses to control each one of us in there. I didn’t understand what happened to me.”Trujillo said he left the Circle when he learned that Chasing Horse had sexually abused a girl, who had become like a niece to Trujillo.He wanted to leave before 2014, but Chasing Horse would “fearmonger that if you left his Circle, your family would die”, Trujillo said.In 2023, eight years after the Fort Peck tribal leaders banished Chasing Horse, Las Vegas police arrested him at the home he shared with five wives.TheAssociated Pressreported that Chasing Horse told his wives to “shoot it out” with police officers if they ever tried to “break their family apart”. Police also found video of him having sex with a minor and sexual photos of a young girl, according to court records.Chasing Horse also faces sexual exploitation and assault chargesin Canada.A Nevada judgedismissed the casestemming from the 2023 arrest because of the prosecution’s “improper instruction to the grand jury”, But a grand juryagain indictedhim in 2024.The prosecuting and defense attorneys did not respond to the Guardian’s interview requests.Despite the earlier dismissal, Leone said she was “100% confident” he will be convicted.She also remains cancer-free – but now realizes it wasn’t because of Chasing Horse.When Leone’s daughter left Chasing Horse and told her she had been raped, she said: “But mom, this is the reason why you’re not sick.”Leone told her: “I am not giving Nathan the power over my wellness or my sickness.”Explore more on these topicsNative AmericansNevadaLas VegasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cradled in the arms of their mother, Mafuko, the tiny twins clung to her body for warmth in the forest clearing in Virunga national park, in easternDemocratic Republic of the Congo(DRC).Katutu, head of gorilla monitoring in Virunga, has seen dozens of newborns in his 15 years as a ranger. But, he tells the Guardian, even he was touched by the sight of the fragile infant males, who face serious obstacles if they are to become silverbacks one day.“Watching Mafuko holding two babies was both moving and filled me with responsibility, given the twins’ extreme vulnerability,” he says.Twin births in mountain gorillas are extremely rare and present significant survival challengesJacques Katutu“Twin births in mountain gorillas are extremely rare and always present significant survival challenges. We are cautious and vigilant, while also maintaining hope. The first four weeks are the most critical.”The mother and her babies are being monitored daily since they were spotted on 3 January, with specialist vets on hand if the gorillas show signs of distress. The young males are healthy for now, rangers say, but the subspecies hashigh rates of infant mortality– with about a quarter falling victim to disease, trauma or infanticide.Mafuko gave birth to twins in 2016, but neither survived more than a few days. The males have been born into the Bageni family, Virunga’s largest group of mountain gorillas, which now has 59 members. Despite the rangers’ caution, their arrival is another milestone in one ofthe greatest conservation success storiesof the past century.View image in fullscreenThe mountain gorilla twins. From barely 250 as they neared extinction in the 1970s, numbers of the subspecies have climbed to above 1,000 now.Photograph: Courtesy of Virunga national parkBarely 250 mountain gorillas were left in the 1970s, split between two isolated territories in south-west Uganda and the Virunga massif mountain range, and many thought the animals faced extinction.Decades of intense conservation work saw population numbers surpass 1,000 in 2018 and the gorilla subspecies has since been downgraded from critically endangered to endangered by conservation authorities.But the DRC section of Virunga mountain range remains one of the most dangerous places in the world for wildlife rangers. Over the past 20 years, more than 220 rangers have been killed in the park, where rebel groups such asM23 and other militias, as well as bandits, operate with impunity.Mafuko is an example of the species’ resilience, say conservationists. Her mother was killed by an attacker when she was four but she has gone on to have several young, including the latest newborns.Mountain gorillas are back from the brink. But what happens if they run out of room?Read more“Mafuko is an experienced mother. She is carrying both babies and is attentive to their needs. This is encouraging, although the situation remains delicate,” says Katutu.“We are closely monitoring the twins and mother – observing her breastfeeding and the overall health of the newborns. Allowing her to care for her babies naturally and minimising intervention is the priority.”Specialist veterinary care has played a leading role in the revival of the species. In Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC, organisations such as the Gorilla Doctors have prevented dozens of deaths by helping animals affected by human behaviour, such as releasing gorillas accidentally caught in poachers’ traps.One studyattributes half of the mountain gorillas’ population increase to the vets.Katutu says that neither infant will be named until their survival looks more certain. But for now, at least, the signs are promising.“Initial observations show that they are calm and maintain good contact with their mother. Their behaviour is consistent with newborns in a good condition, while remaining very vulnerable,” he says.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsEndangered speciesThe age of extinctionDemocratic Republic of the CongoAnimalsConservationWildlifeAfricaPrimatologynewsShareReuse this content"

They call for the bill to be passed in good time before the first Ocean Cop summit, which is expected to take place this year, to ensure Britain is included.“Disappointingly, while the world celebrates, the UK is still not among the 81 countries, including China, France, Japan, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, that have signed the treaty into law,” the letter says. “We urge the government to complete it at least 30 days before the first Ocean Cop, which could take place as early as August this year, in order to guarantee the UK’s attendance there. It would be a failure of leadership to miss it.”Thebiodiversity beyond national jurisdiction billis due for its third reading in the House of Lords on Monday. The Foreign Office has been contacted for comment.View image in fullscreenGreenpeace members celebrate the treaty in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe high seas form part of a global commons that covers nearly half of the planet. However, as they lie beyond national borders, there has until now been no legal framework to protect biodiversity in them.“The entry into force of the high seas treaty marks a long-awaited turning point for ocean governance,” said Dr Lance Morgan, the chief executive of the Marine Conservation Institute. “For decades, these vast waters – and the abundance of biodiversity that inhabits them – were beyond the reach of effective protection. Now, the global community has both the mandate and the responsibility to act.”The new treaty creates, for the first time, the tools to create marine protected areas on the high seas, and sets clear obligations on how to ensure ocean resources are used sustainably.In St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, a striking new mural will be unveiled this weekend to celebrate the treaty coming into force. The colourful artwork, twice the length of a doubledecker bus, was painted on the town’s beachside Bathing Hut cafe as part of a global action in which artists, Indigenous peoples, activists and communities from 13 countries across five continents, representing every ocean, worked with Greenpeace to create ocean protection-inspired street art to mark this significant moment.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The UK government is committed to make this into law, using the standard democratic parliamentary process. This treaty was signed under the last government and this government is committed to ratifying this quickly.”Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeHigh seasUnited NationsConservationWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

He has now been charged with a further 15 offences that pre-date those for which he was convicted, relating to possession of indecent images of children and acts of outraging public decency.The new charges relate to incidents which did not take place in the same location as his previous crimes. They include nine counts of taking an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child, including the most severe category, and six counts of acts of outraging public decency. The charges relate to nine girls.Chan, from Finchley, is in custody awaiting sentencing for his earlier convictions. These included five sexual assaults by penetration of a child aged between two and four years, four sexual assaults, 11 counts of taking indecent photos, and six of making indecent images of children.The police investigation is ongoing.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The Moroccan diaspora in North Kensington is in no doubt that on Sunday the Atlas Lions will triumph against Senegal in the final of theAfrica Cup of Nations.“There’s not just an excitement, it has completely taken over everything else,” said Souad Talsi, who runs the Al-Hasaniya Moroccan women’s centre at the base of 31-storey Trellick Tower, at the north end of Golborne Road.She added: “There is so much gloom and doom around at the moment and people are depressed about Gaza, but football has given us a respite from all that. It has completely united the Moroccan diaspora and given us a purpose and a sense of belonging.”Mohamed Chelh said that ifMoroccoprevail it will be first time they have lifted the Afcon trophy since 1976, a tournament he cannot even remember.Sipping mint tea in the Trellick Lounge cafe after Friday prayers, he said: “They should win. They’ve got the best team.” He points to Morocco’s success in the last World Cup when they reached the semi-finals and beat Spain and Portugal on the way.Chelh, who works in a bakery, plans to head to Trafalgar Square to celebrate Morocco’s anticipated victory.View image in fullscreenMohamed Chelh, who hopes to celebrate a Morocco victory – their first in the Afcon tournament since 1976 – in Trafalgar Square on Sunday.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianOn a big screen at the back of the cafe, the Trellick Lounge has shown all of Morocco’s games in the tournament so far. On Friday, more than 48 hours before Sunday’s game, it was already showing a buildup programme on the satellite channel Maghreb TV. On Sunday there will also be a screen on the street outside the cafe.Ali Mssr, who runs the cafe, predicts that hundreds will turn up to the watch the final. “Outside there will be even more,” he said.Mohamed, a retired gardener, said he could hear the celebrations in the cafe from his flat down the street when Morocco scraped through on penalties against Nigeria in the semi-final.“It was a beautiful atmosphere. They were really happy. And I’m very proud. I love Morocco, my mum and dad are there. And I love it when they play well and win.”Further down Golborne Road, at Hakim’s cafe, Yassim, a courier, said: “The mood is very good. I have confidence we will win. We beat Nigeria and they are the toughest team in the tournament. We will win whether it is 90 minutes or 120 minutes.”Talsi is planning to watch the game with her extended family, including her 85-year-old-mother, her brothers and their children, after a meal of couscous.She said: “Football reminds us that people are not always bad and people can come together and forget their differences. Whether you are an international trader or a cleaner, all they want is for Morocco to win.“It has also broken the gender barrier. At the semi-final there was an outdoor screen and there were as many loud girls as there were loud boys.”View image in fullscreenCouscous is prepared at a community centre inside Trellick Tower, which, says Saoud Talsi (left), will be eaten before the match.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianLailah Khallouk, a senior outreach worker at the women’s centre, said: “I hate football but I love to watch the Moroccan team. There’s huge excitement and a lot of organising about where to watch the game –in cafes or social clubs or house parties.“My son Adam, who is 11, is passionate about it, he’s like a professional fan.“It’s something that brings us all together. Despite where we were born, our ages, our social classes, is a just a great event. Finally we have something to be proud of.”Mohamed Rhiam, an Uber driver, has just got back from a visit to relatives in Casablanca. “The atmosphere was crazy. There will be great disappointment if they lose, because everyone is into it now. But we’ll win.”Rhiam witnessed protests before the tournament on the amount of money spent on stadiums rather than public services. “I share those concerns. I believe the money they spent on it they could have done more for the economy. But the football still makes me proud.”Asked if an Afcon win would make up for the disappointment of the last World Cup, Rhiam said: “It wasn’t a disappointment, we got to the semi-final.”Explore more on these topicsLondonMoroccoAfrica Cup of Nations 2025SenegalAfricaAfrica Cup of NationsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Efforts should be focused on clearing the old backlog, rather than responding to new correspondence.”British pensioner Jill Eden*, who lives in the Netherlands, said she had to borrow money while waiting for a £48,000 rebate from HMRC.“I pay Dutch tax on my pension and, since my husband died two years ago, HMRC has also taxed it at the rate of £2,100 a month,” she said. “I submitted a refund claim in April under thedouble taxation treatyand was told it would be dealt with by October, but I’ve heard nothing, and it’s impossible to contact it by phone. I am 83 and wondering if HMRC thinks my age is to its advantage because, once I die, it will be able to hang on to this money for years.”Jane Leigh*, who lives in France, was told that the refund of £78,000 in tax due after she cashed in her UK pension had been approved in September, seven months after she submitted her claim under double taxation rules. She told Guardian Money she was still waiting for the refund. “I keep being told the cheque has been sent, then given different reasons why it hasn’t arrived,” she says.“Each time I’m told to wait six weeks for progress.”View image in fullscreenHMRC said it was investing £500m in digital services to speed up refunds.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianWhile taxpayers face stiff penalties if they are late with payments, HMRC pays modest compensation when it misses its own targets. Taxpayers are charged interest calculated at the Bank of England base rate plus 4% (currently 7.75%), while HMRC is only liable for interest at 1% below the base rate.It has also emerged that some employees with more than one job are reporting long waits for refunds of overpaid NICs.Kabir Das, who works across different NHS departments, was expecting his refund last April but said he was told his claim will not be processed until this September.University professor Linda Ashcombe*, who holds two roles, is overdue £1,000 since submitting a request in April.“For 15 years I’ve had my overpayments refunded within six weeks. This year I was first told my request should be acted upon by November,” Ashcombe said. “In December, HMRC’s online tracker said March 2026. Call centre agents say they can’t understand the delay or do anything about it. What the hell is going on?”HMRC said it would investigate all the cases referred to it by Guardian Money. Since the paper got in touch, most have received their refunds.It added: “We receive millions of tax refund claims every year, and the vast majority are paid promptly, but we apologise to those experiencing a delay. We’re committed to cutting wait times and are investing £500m in digital services to speed up refunds as well as help customers pay the right tax first time so fewer refunds are necessary.”* Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsIncome taxNational insuranceTaxHMRCnewsShareReuse this content"

He called for peaceful protests to pressure the authorities to release what he called the “rightful results”.Wine also alleged that he fled his home to escape arrest by security forces who raided his house on Friday, with his political party claiming earlier that he had been taken from his home in an army helicopter.“Last night was very difficult at our home … The military and the police raided us. They switched off power and cut off some of our CCTV cameras,” Wine said in a post on X.View image in fullscreenBobi Wine alleged that he fled his home to escape arrest by security forces who raided his house on Friday.Photograph: Michel Lunanga/Getty ImagesIn an earlier statement, Ugandan police said that Wine had not been arrested, but that they were restricting the area to the public to prevent unrest.Among the irregularities was the failure of biometric voter ID machines which delayed voting in cities – large bases of support for the political opposition. Pro-democracy activists had asked that the machines be used in elections to prevent any allegations of voter fraud and rigging.Electoral officials then resorted to manual lists of voters, which Wine alleged allowed for “massive ballot stuffing”, as well as claims of favouritism to the incumbent’s party. Museveni endorsed the use of the manual voter register.Despite the internet shutdown and allegations of fraud, the election largely passed with little incident, save a clash between police and opposition in central Uganda. Seven people died and three were injured after police fired in self-defence against opposition “goons”, police said, a claim disputed by MP Muwanga Kivumbi, who said security forces killed 10 people in his house.Uganda is termed as “not free” by rights monitor Freedom House, which noted that while the country holds regular elections, they are not considered credible. Museveni, 81, has been the president of the country for 40 years, making him the third-longest-serving non-royal national leader in the world.Uganda has not had a peaceful transition of power since it gained its independence from British colonialism six decades ago.Museveni has rewritten Uganda’s laws to stay in power, including by removing term and age limits from the constitution. He has also jailed opposition opponents.He has overseen a period of stability in Uganda, which has allowed the economy to grow, with growth forecasted to rise next year.Wine wore a flak jacket and helmet due to fears over his safety, as he alleged security forces harassed him and his supporters including through the use of teargas.Explore more on these topicsUgandaYoweri MuseveniAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The four astronauts will live and work in the Orion capsule, testing life support and communications systems and practising docking manoeuvres.Patches of the moon to become spacecraft graveyards, say researchersRead moreJared Isaacman, the billionaire private astronaut sworn in as Nasa’s administrator in December, said on Thursday the mission was “probably one of the most important human spaceflight missions in the last half-century”.It will be the second time in space for three Nasa astronauts, Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and the first for Jeremy Hansen, a Canadian astronaut. Koch will become the first woman, and Glover the first person of colour, to travel beyond low Earth orbit.The astronauts will not land on the moon or enter lunar orbit, but will be the first to travel around the moon sinceApollo 17 in 1972.The mission follows an uncrewed test flight in 2022 and paves the way for Artemis III, which aims to land astronautsnear the lunar south poleas early as next year.“These are the kinds of days that we live for,” John Honeycutt, the chair of the Artemis II mission management team, told a press briefing on Friday. “It really doesn’t get much better than this: we are making history.”“It’s a big deal,” said David Parker, the former head of the UK Space Agency and a visiting professor at the University of Southampton. “It is a step towards what we in the space world always dreamed of: the sustained human and robotic exploration of the moon and, one day, on to Mars.”Some paint the return to the moon as a second space race, with the US competing against China, which hopes to put its own boots on the moon by 2030. “I’ll be damned if the Chinese beat Nasa or beat America back to the moon,” Sean Duffy, Nasa’s former acting administrator, said in September. “We’re going to win.”Artemis II to the moon: launch to splashdown (Nasa mission animation)The SLS rocket and Orion capsule stand nearly 100 metres tall, with the rocket carrying more than enough liquid propellant to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool. When burned through the rocket’s engines, it produces sufficient thrust to fly to the moon at speeds of up to 24,500mph.But first, the rollout. As early as Saturday morning, Nasa’s crawler-transporter 2, an enormous tracked vehicle, will start lugging the 5,000-tonne rocket and spacecraft from the vehicle assembly building to the launchpad. The four-mile journey can take up to 12 hours.Nasa will then work through a preflight checklist. If all goes to plan, engineers will move on to a wet dress rehearsal, loading the rocket with more than 700,000 gallons of propellant, conducting a trial countdown and demonstrating that they can remove the propellant safely.Any substantial problems would require the rocket to be rolled back to the vehicle assembly building for repairs. In recent days, technicians have been working on a bent cable in the rocket’s flight termination system, a faulty valve used to pressurise the Orion capsule, and leaks in equipment that pumps oxygen into the spacecraft.The entire process must go smoothly for the mission to launch on 6 February. If technical problems or bad weather intervene, Nasa has identified 14 other dates to launch before mid-April. “We’re going to fly when we are ready,” said Honeycutt. “From launch through the mission days to follow, the crew’s safety is going to be our number one priority.”After liftoff, the crew will loop twice around the Earth. Before heading to the moon, the Orion capsule will separate from the rocket’s upper stage. The astronauts will then fly the spacecraft manually, using cameras and the view outside the window, to approach and retreat from the jettisoned stage. This will give Nasa a sense of how Orion handles for future Artemis missions where crews will dock and undock in lunar orbit.For all Nasa’s preparations and the astronauts’ extensive training, the mission could still throw up some surprises. “This is a test flight and there are things that are going to be unexpected,” said Jeff Radigan, Artemis II’s lead flight director.A final push from Orion’s European service module will send the crew to the moon. The astronauts will travel more than 230,000 miles from Earth, passing around the far side of the moon, before looping back in a giant figure-of-eight trajectory. During the voyage, the crew will practise emergency procedures and test Orion’s radiation shelter, designed to protect them from harmful solar flares.More than 50 years after humans went to the moon, it is time to get excited again – and perhaps a little nervous. “Every rocket launch is a nail-biter,” Parker said. “We’re putting astronauts on a rocket, and it’s flown only once before, so of course it’s a nail-biter. But I’m confident Nasa will only launch when they are ready.”Explore more on these topicsScienceNasaThe moonAstronomySpacenewsShareReuse this content"

But amidpollingthat shows an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose taking control of the island and warnings from Denmark that an invasion would spell the end of Nato, some congressional Republicans have issued forceful warnings against pursuing the issue.Greenland and Denmark set for anti-Trump protests – Europe liveRead more“The thought of the United States taking the position that we would take Greenland, an independent territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, is absurd,” North Carolina senator Thom Tillis said in a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday. “Somebody needs to tell the president that the people of Greenland, up until these current times, were actually very, very pro-American and very, very pro American presence.”Nebraska congressman Don Bacon toldthe Omaha World-Herald: “If he went through with the threats, I think it would be the end of his presidency. And he needs to know: the off-ramp is realizing Republicans aren’t going to tolerate this and he’s going to have to back off. He hates being told no, but in this case, I think Republicans need to be firm.”Mitch McConnell, the former Senate Republican leader, compared the possibility of the US seizing Greenland to Joe Biden’s 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, which becamean unpopular momentin the Democrat’s presidency.“Following through on this provocation would be more disastrous for the president’s legacy than withdrawing from Afghanistan was for his predecessor,” McConnell said, warning that it would amount to “incinerating the hard-won trust of loyal allies in exchange for no meaningful change in US access to the Arctic”.Trump has displayed an expansionist streak in his second term as president and publicly declared that he would like the United States to annex Canada, the Panama canal and Greenland, even though it is part of Denmark, a Nato ally.The subject appeared to have fallen by the wayside in recent months as Trump grappled withslumping approval ratingsdriven by public concern over the cost of living and his militarized immigration enforcement campaign but he began fixating on Greenland again after the successful raid in Venezuela that saw Maduro taken to stand trial in a New York court.European countries have reacted with alarm to Trump’s comments, and troops from France, Germany, the UK, Norway and Swedenarrived in Greenlandthis week in a show of political support that one country said doubled as a scoping mission for what a sustained deployment in the territory would look like.The foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark sat down with Trump, vice-president JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio on Wednesday, but the meeting did not change the US president’s demands. Trump later said that the US still “needs” Greenland for national security reasons, and on Friday, the president warnedhe may impose tariffson countries that oppose his campaign.Trump has kept the bulk of Republicans in line, even on foreign policy issues. After the Senate last week advanced a war powers resolution that would have required Congress be notified before attack Venezuela again,the president saidthe five Republicans who joined with Democrats in supporting the measure “should never be elected to office again”. On Wednesday, two of the GOP senator changed their votes this weekto kill the resolution.Tillis – whobroke with Trumpover his signature domestic policy bill – along with Bacon and McConnell, are not seeking re-election this year. Other Republicans who spoke out against Trump’s campaign for Greenland are among the few to frequently disagree with the president.“This senator from Alaska does not think it is a good idea, and I want to build on the relationship that we have had,”centristLisa Murkowski on Friday said during a visit by a bipartisan congressional delegation to Copenhagen. “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset.”There are signs that Republicans closer to the president are uncomfortable with his campaign as well, and in particular the threat it poses to Nato.“As head of the US delegation to the [Nato parliamentary assembly] , I can not overstate the importance of our transatlantic relationships,” Ohio congressman Mike Turner wrote on X. “We must respect the sovereignty of the Danish and Greenlander people.”Inan interviewwith CNN last week, Lousiana senator John Kennedy said: “To invade Greenland and attack its sovereignty, a fellow Nato country, would be weapons-grade stupid. President Trump is not weapons-grade stupid.”Explore more on these topicsRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nvidia did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment made outside regular business hours.Nvidia had expected more than one million orders from Chinese clients, the report said, adding that its suppliers had been operating around the clock to prepare for shipping as early as March.Chinese customs authorities this week told customs agents that Nvidia’s H200 chips were not permitted to enter the country, Reuters reported.Trump imposes 25% tariff on Nvidia AI chips and others, citing national securityRead moreSources have also said government officials summoned domestic tech firms to warn them against buying the chips unless it was necessary.The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said authorities had not provided any reasons for their directives and had not given any indication if this was a formal ban or a temporary measure.The H200, Nvidia’s second most powerful AI chip, is one of the biggest flashpoints in US-Sino relations. There is strong demand from Chinese firms, but it remains unclear if Beijing wants to ban the chips outright to encourage domestic chip companies to develop their own; whether the Chinese government is still mulling restrictions; or if it is all a bargaining tactic.If the import ban is confirmed, it adds to a convoluted situation that includes the Trump administration allowing the US-designed, Taiwanese-manufactured H200 chipsto be exported to China, with the US government reportedly to take a share of the profits.The US government then decreed that instead of the completed chips being sent directly to China from Taiwan, they instead first go to a US laboratory for testing,allowing a 25% tariff to be imposed as they pass through the US. The tariff was also applied to chipmaker AMD’s MI325X processor.Experts and analysts are split on whether selling the H200 toChinais strategically a good idea. Those in favour say its availability might slow China’s progress developing similar chips and keep Chinese companies dependent on US technology; those against say the H200 is, for example, powerful enough to be used in weapons systems that China’s military might one day deploy against the US or its allies.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsNvidiaChinaInternational tradeTaiwanAsia PacificGlobal economyEconomicsShareReuse this content"

Easter eggs in the UK are smaller but pricier this yearChocolate treats reduced in size or weight as higher price of cocoa drives new wave of ‘shrinkflation’Sarah ButlerSat 17 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTShareChocolate eggs are looking smaller than ever this year and it is not just because Easter is still so far away.Many of the Easter eggs already out on supermarket shelves this month not only cost more, but have been reduced in size or weight as the price of cocoa has driven a new wave ofshrinkflation.Maltesers is living up to its “the lighter way to enjoy chocolate” slogan with its XL egg rather less large this year at 194g in many shops, down from 231g in 2025, while the price charged by Tesco has risen by £1 to £7.The weight loss is largely down to there being one fewer mini pack of Maltesers inside the box, according to trade journal the Grocer, meaning the price per gram is up 39% to 3.6p.A similar move with Cadbury’s Twirl eggs – which now include only two individually wrapped Twirl fingers rather than two full bars – means they have shrunk by 9.5% or 23g to 218g. However, the price in most shops has risen to £7 from £6 last year, leading to a price per gram increase of more than 28%.Four fewer eggs in a Mini Eggs family pack means the Cadbury’s treat is now 4% smaller at 256g compared with 270g a year ago, while the price has risen to £6.20 at Tesco for those without a loyalty card, compared with £4.85 a year ago. That is equivalent to a 35% increase in price – although the same pack is priced at £5.50 at Sainsbury’s and Waitrose and £4.94 at Asda for those who wish to shop around.View image in fullscreenLindt gold bunnies are now £8.50 at most retailers for the 200g size.Photograph: Piranhi/AlamyLindt gold bunnies have held their ground at 200g for the largest option, but are now £8.50 at most retailers (without a loyalty card), a £3 jump from their £5.50 price at Tesco a year ago.The cost of chocolate confectionery has increased sharply in the past few years as cocoa prices have soared after poor harvests in the main growing regions of Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire over the past three years, amid extreme temperatures and unusual rainfall patternsdriven by the climate crisis.With sugar, energy and labour costs also on the rise, manufacturers have turned to a variety of tactics, frommaking bars and biscuits smallerto reducing cocoa content in an effort to keep the prices paid by shoppers down.In October, McVitie’sreduced the amount of cocoa in the recipes of Club and Penguin barsso much they are now only “chocolate flavour”.A spokesperson for the Maltesers owner Mars Wrigley’s UK and Ireland business said: “We understand the cost pressures that shoppers continue to face and always aim to absorb rising costs wherever possible.“However, ongoing pressures, driven in part by well-documented rises in the cost of cocoa, mean we have had to make carefully considered changes. Decisions around product size are not taken lightly, but they help to ensure shoppers can continue to enjoy their favouriteEastertreats without any compromise on the quality or taste they expect from Mars. As with all our products, final pricing remains at the discretion of individual retailers.”View image in fullscreenCadbury’s owner Mondelēz International said it faced ‘significantly higher input costs across our supply chain’.Photograph: Alan Edwards/AlamyA spokesperson for Cadbury’s owner Mondelēz International said retailers were free to set their own prices, adding: “We understand the economic pressures that consumers continue to face and any changes to our product sizes is a last resort for our business.“However, as a food producer, we are continuing to experience significantly higher input costs across our supply chain, with ingredients such as cocoa and dairy, which are widely used in our products, costing far more than they have done previously.“Meanwhile, other costs like energy and transport, also remain high. This means that our products continue to be much more expensive to make and while we have absorbed these costs where possible, we still face considerable challenges.“As a result, we are having to make carefully considered changes to the recommended promotional price alongside small weight reductions to our Cadbury Twirl Easter Egg (218g), Cadbury Wispa Easter Egg (177g) and Cadbury Mini Egg bags (256g).”Lindt was approached for comment.

A museum’s success can collapse it, like the Louvre, with some rooms becoming oversaturated. The important thing is not to collapse.”With that in mind, Falomir added, the Prado was exploring how best to preserve – and preferably enhance – the visitor experience. Among the ideas for guaranteeing quality over quantity are optimising entrances to the museum, rethinking the size of visiting groups, and making sure people know they are not allowed to take photos in the galleries.‘We won’t come again’: dazed visitors fed up with overcrowded LouvreRead moreThe queues of mid-January can hardly be compared with those of the summer months, when they stretch on and on beneath the merciless Madrid sun, but getting into the museum this week proved painless. After buying a ticket online on Thursday, the Guardian pitched up at the museum at 10.30am on Friday, queued at the entrance for 90 seconds and was through security in less than a minute.But the real test lay inside – especially as Falomir had insisted that visiting the Prado “can’t be like catching the Metro at rush-hour”. He may well have been haunted by the words of his counterpart at the Louvre, who admitted last year thatvisiting the Paris museum was “a physical ordeal”.Although the initial pace through the galleries was slow, it soon picked up and the crowds were more fidgety shoals than heaving masses.View image in fullscreenCentral panel from The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch.Photograph: Album/AlamyHieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights proved predictably popular, with 50 people standing in front of it and obscuring the lower half of its enchantments. But then a tour group moved on and a space opened up at the rope in front of the triptych.The Goya rooms were a better bet. A suspiciously well-behaved school group hovered beneathFight to the Death with Cudgelsand the unbearably poignantThe Drowning Dog.In a nearby room, Alexander Jute from Stockholm was sitting on a bench with his four children and drinking in the horrors of Goya’sThe 3rd of May 1808 in MadridandThe Fight Against the Mamelukes.How was their visit going? How were the crowds?“I think it’s perfect,” said Jute. “Perhaps it could even be a little more crowded. I’ve been here a couple of times before – including in the summer, and that was much busier.”Down a corridor that led off a granite staircase echoing with the shouts and laughter of another school party, Laura Moya and her partner, Enrique Ayala, were also pleasantly surprised by the lack of crowds.“We’re not seeing too many people here today,” said Moya. “The only problem is knowing where to start but the audioguide is very good.”The couple, who were visiting Madrid from the south-eastern region of Murcia, said they had been relieved to be able to stash their coats and bags as they had heard the cloakrooms sometimes filled up quickly.View image in fullscreenOne of the galleries at the Prado.Photograph: Alex Segre/Alamy“We came early to beat the queues,” added Moya. “It’s a great experience; wherever you look you find something.”Visitors hoping for a more solitary trot around the Prado can find respite in some of the museum’s less trodden areas. The Alonso Cano gallery was deserted, leaving no one to appreciate the 17th-century Spanish master’sDead Christ Supported by an Angel, hisPenitent Magdalene, or hisSaint Bernard and the Virgin.Even the room holding such treasures as Velázquez’s portraits of court entertainers, includingThe Buffoon Calabacillas, was almost empty save for Enrique, a Madrid local who is also a member of the museum.View image in fullscreenQueues at another of the Prado’s entrances.Photograph: Bob Korn/AlamyHe said his frequent visits to the Prado had never been marred by impossible crowds. “Visitor numbers keep going up and up and I’m glad that they do,” said Enrique. “It’s really good that people want to come and see culture.”Some cultural draws, however, are more potent than others. By 11.10 on Friday morning, room 12, which houses Las Meninas, was filling up and growing noisy.Visitors attempting to take photos of the picture were politely pounced on by sharp-eyed attendants: “No photos,por favor. No photos.”Velázquez appeared to glower briefly from the canvas. And the dog dozed on.Explore more on these topicsSpainMuseumsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His death, at 55, was as sudden as it was not. For years, alcoholism had been changing the shape of his heart.He died less than a mile from his old office; top law firm, equity partner. Four miles from our once tight-knit home in a leafy neighbourhood. He had lost both his family and his job in 2019. Raised in Barry, working class, he had been proud of the beautiful life he had built for us. Others thought he “had it all”. He was widely adored, but drinking made him volatile. He was homeless and often behind bars in his final two years.I saw my dad for the last time in the spring of 2019, just before I moved to Australia. I was no longer able to bear the distress and chaos caused by his addiction. From then on I saw him only in photos: an article about homeless people getting Christmas dinner; the police’s missing-person appeals. Wherehadmy caring, clever dad gone?I never spoke about his drinking. It seemed disloyal, then gloomy, then futile. He had been one of my closest friends. It was only after losing him for good that I realised I wanted others to know him. This came through writing, which I began compulsively the morning after the news. It’s what I do to keep my mind steady. I was five when my dad sat me down to write about an event that had shaken me: my brother’s first epileptic seizure in 1999. It was a lesson in how finding the words could help in the face of unthinkable things.My memoir,Long Going, came out last summer. It’s the story of my life with and without the lightning-strike man who raised me. Our story resonates, it turns out. Readers say they found it surprisingly uplifting. I feel lighter since writing it.At events, I’m often asked about my relationship with alcohol. My response is evolving. Like my dad, I never suffered hangovers. I could drink to oblivion with friends and wake up fine. Nowadays I’m vigilant. Since becoming a parent myself, I count myself among therising numberof sober-curious people. I know what’s at stake.In June I was on a Tŷ Newydd writing course with Amy Liptrot, whose memoirThe Outrunis an invigorating account of recovering from alcoholism in Orkney (the film adaptation, starring Saoirse Ronan, was released in 2024). Amy suggested to us that memoirs could be windows on to different worlds, or mirrors of our own worlds. Or sometimes, I wonder, both? Even writing my own book, my dad’s pencilled notes gave me a window into his world of prison cells and leaky tents.Over the past year, I’ve been drawn towards other memoirs about addiction. Either I hadn’t realised these books existed or I avoided them. I’m not sure which is true, but I wish I had read them sooner.View image in fullscreenBack on top … Ashley Walters in Adolescence.Photograph: NetflixTakeAlways Winningby Top Boy star Ashley Walters. Raised in Peckham, with his dad circling between prison and binges, Walters ended up in a young offender institution at 20. He ultimately managed to turn his life around, and forged a stellar acting career, most recently starring in hit show Adolescence. His reading of the audiobook is revealing, particularly on how he confronted his alcoholism and broke cycles by going into rehab. I saw my dad in Walters’ recollections of his arrogance. I saw myself in his memories of loved ones treading on eggshells, unsure which version of him to expect.Alcoholism is known as a family disease, whether that means lurking in genes or spilling consequences on to those around the addict. A powerful testament to this isIn the Blood, co-written by Arabella Byrne and her mother, Julia Hamilton. With admirable honesty, they reflect on what brought them to Alcoholics Anonymous nine months apart. Arabella and I held an event at Blackwell’s in Oxford during my book tour. Her mother was in the front row. My baby daughter was on my lap. It felt like we were breaking cycles together.Thankfully, there is no shortage of memoirs about recovery. We need them. Haunted by his dad’s addiction, Jesse Thistle’sFrom the Ashesis a gritty, gripping book about his own long struggle with addiction and homelessness before he went into rehab, found love and became a scholar. Octavia Bright’sThis Ragged Gracebeautifully articulates her journey into sobriety, alongside her dad’s descent into Alzheimer’s.My dad once said he’d rather die than go soberIn reading these books, I inevitably look for explanations. Why didn’t my dad recover? What else could I have done? I won’t pretend to know the unknowable, but something does keep coming up. Each writer describes a moment of clarity that life would be better without alcohol. This simple inner conviction – rather than external pressure – takes them to AA or rehab. Here, ego and destructive patterns are exchanged for community and healthy habits. A day at a time, they continue to choose this better life, embraced again by loved ones.I was told that my dad once said he’d rather die than go sober. Some things can’t be explained. He had so much to live for. He deserved to enjoy retirement and time with grandkids. Had he recovered, he’d have been an incredible presence in my daughter’s life – just as he had been in mine.This month I’m marking his birthday with three events – from a bookshop in Chester, where he attended law college, to the homeless shelter that fed him on Christmas Day, to Bristol with Nacoa, the charity for children of alcoholics. I can’t change how my dad’s story ended, but I can pass on what he taught me about finding the words. Here’s to more windows opening, and fewer unthinkable things.Long Going by Sophie Calon is published by Honno Welsh Women’s Press. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Its two lead characters have the making of a classic comic double actRhik SamadderSat 17 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTShareTheGame of Thronesfranchise has fruited again, like an abundant oak. Where’s left to go? A startling opening, in which a lumbering oaf takes a dump behind a tree, gives us a clue. Chronologically, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Monday 19 January, 9pm, Sky Atlantic) sits between the juggernaut original and its courtly prequel, House of the Dragon. Tonally, it’s in a world of its own.That oaf eventually gets a name: Dunk. Contrary to expectation, Dunk is a knight. Specifically, a “hedge knight”, a lower-status category whose kind cannot afford their keep and must sleep under trees. “Any knight can make a knight” we are reminded, by simply dubbing them. This lack of gatekeeping has resulted in a class system in which highborn valiants scorn their ignoble brethren. They are knights in name only, and only just. Of course, there’s nothing just about this.My jaw was agape for much of the first episode, as I wondered what game HBO were playing. It takes place largely on a featureless moor, following Dunk in his meaningless solitude, apart from three horses whom he speaks to as equals. He is demonstrably dim-witted, penniless and naive. He misses his father figure – a recently deceased, geriatric, alcoholic knight who beat him. There’s a Beckettian bleakness to this vision. Like much of Beckett, it’s also a comedy.This is, on the surface, a simple tale. Dunk makes a journey to a “tourney” – a jousting competition where he hopes to prove himself. We follow his attempts to get on the ballot, given his nondescript lineage. He falls for a girl, takes part in a tug-of-war. He is hampered as much as assisted by his new squire, Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell) – a bald, pubescent boy who latches on to him at an inn.With six short episodes, the creators aren’t pumping hot air into George RR Martin’s source novella. (They avoidthe mistake ofthe prequelHobbit films, which stretched their story, and audience patience, into what felt like 200 hours of numbing dragon-tease.) Since we’re talking size, we need to talk about Dunk. This fella looks like Paul Mescal had a baby with Reacher. I had to buy a bigger TV to fit him on the screen. He’s played, with great heart, by Peter Claffey, a former rugby union player from Galway. Paired with the fragile figure of Egg, you have the equation for a classic comedy double act.There’s a joy to being wrongfooted, especially in a high-stakes project. I was reminded of Rian Johnson’sThe Last Jedi(though it’s more closely akin to the Heath Ledger filmA Knight’s Tale). The creators wilfully subvert expectations of grandeur or heroism. Scenes are punctuated by our hero Dunk being called big or thick or out of place, by his superiors, children and random minor characters. He walks into a door frame at one point, twice. Asserting himself by bossing Egg around, he is verbally outmatched. “Don’t run away or I’ll hunt you down with dogs,” he commands. “Where will you get the dogs?” comes the faux-innocent reply.But like its main characters, this is a tale full of surprises. I barked with laughter, before a series of revelations upended the tone again. The series reveals the deeper game it has been playing, judging deftly when to show its hand. Details would spoil the journey but, as you’d expect, Claffey has his Ugly Betty moment. He grows into a towering moral compass.A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms may not be a sprawling, dynastic myth but it is concerned with family and inheritance. Of course Westeros fans, like Omaze players, get excited by great houses. They’ll be thrilled by Daniel Ings, chewing scenery as Lyonel Baratheon. The Targaryens, too, slither into town in crisis, having misplaced a few sons on their way to Ashford – presumably not the ex-Eurostar station in Kent.This is Game of Thrones at its best. A rich, politically complex meal, with sides of bone-snapping violence. Its boldness has stayed with me, as what started in coarse slapstick becomes a moving exploration of true nobility, survivor’s guilt and goodness. The oaf has moral fibre in his diet. No wonder he needed that dump.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherGeorge RR MartinGame of ThronesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had visited the country a couple of times, on family driving holidays to Brittany and Normandy, but my parents did all the talking and I didn’t see the point of learningleandla,soixante-dixorquatre-vingts. It was just something on the curriculum that I had to do.Then, one evening at home, in Stirlingshire, Scotland, with everyone else in bed, I sat on the sofa and put on a VHS of Eddie Izzard’s standup show Dress to Kill. My parents were fans and I’d caught a glimpse on TV and thought it looked funny. I was young and some of the material was probably too rude but I enjoyed the surreal and absurd comedy, impressions and mad tangents.Suddenly, Izzard did a bit about learning French then put together an absurd situation using all these random school French phrases during a trip to France, most memorably trying to bring the words cat (le chat), mouse (la souris) and monkey (le singe) up in conversation. I loved it. It spoke to an experience of the language that I understood. Then, as part of the encore, Izzard redid a whole section of the show in French. I found I could actually understand it. There was one line in particular, “le singe a disparu” (the monkey has disappeared) where a whole verb table suddenly clicked into place. And another sequence about getting out of an awkward conversation by saying “Je dois partir parce que ma grand-mère est flambée” (My grandmother is on fire).Being able to follow had not only let me in on the joke, it made it funnier. All those dry verb tables, conjugations and vocabulary lists finally made sense and I realised languages can be funny – and fun. Unexpectedly, Dress to Kill gave French a purpose.From that day on I threw myself into French lessons. It became my favourite subject, and my best. I soon started learning German, too; the interest I’d taken in French made it easier to pick up and, I went on to study German and Turkish at university.All those verb tables and vocabulary lists finally made sense – languages can be funnyOnce I’d graduated, I took a job in online marketing in Berlin in order to move there. I fell in love with the city. I loved being immersed in a foreign language and culture and was thrilled to converse with the locals. In early 2014, I saw a flyer for Izzard who was doing a show, in German, at a theatre in the city. I excitedly booked a ticket and, in that small dark room, had the same sort of feeling again: this English comic taking a language I’d spent a long time learning and making it funny.After three years in Berlin I moved to Amsterdam and added Dutch to my repertoire. Then, in 2016, moved to Brussels to work for the European Commission. I’d let my French slip in the intervening years but now, here I was, in a French- (and Dutch-) speaking city and it was a delight to be reacquainted. My job is in communications, research and innovation and while my day-to-day work is in English, I liaise with people of all nationalities, and use my languages wherever possible.Sometimes, there are little reminders of Dress to Kill. The first time I took the train to Bruges, walking from the station to the city centre, I passed a hotel called Le Singe d’Or (The Golden Monkey). In the many times I’ve passed since I always smile, imagining Izzard pronouncing it on stage.When I first watched Izzard all those years earlier I’d rarely left Scotland; I never imagined it would take me so far. I use my languages every day and, when I became a Belgian citizen in 2022, I filled out the application in French. I still sometimes wonder: would I ever have worked for the EU, would I ever have moved to Brussels, would I ever have moved abroad at all, if it hadn’t been for Eddie Izzard asking a confused Frenchman: “Où est le singe?”Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

What’s next?Elle HuntSat 17 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 00.02 ESTShareTough luck if you prefer your romcoms PG-rated, or ice hockey leaves you cold: there is no escaping Heated Rivalry. The steamy coming-of-age series has been a sensation in North America, making instant stars of its leads as producers rush to make more of it. It’s hard to remember the last TV show to spark such a furore, let alone one from Canada’s “Crave network”. So who are the young men at the centre of the frenzy – and how are they coping with all that thirst?1. From waiting tables …Heated Rivalry is about the down-low romance between two hockey players: the Canadian good-guy Shane Hollander, played by 24-year-old Hudson Williams, and the Russian Ilya Rozanov, played by real-life Texan Connor Storrie, 25. Youmightrecognise Storrie from the 2024 film Joker: Folie à Deux (his character kills Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker), but neither actor looked earmarked for huge fame. Both were waiting tables when they came to audition for Heated Rivalry. Storrie wasn’t having much luck at that, either. During an appearance onthe Today Show, Storrie told the story of how, on the day he learned he’d landed the part in Heated Rivalry, he’d received a dressing-down from his manager: “I messed up a table so bad.” Production on the series began about a week later.View image in fullscreenWilliams and Storrie at the Golden Globes on 11 January.Photograph: Michael Kovac/Getty Images/Moët & Chandon2 … to the toast of TinseltownAfter premiering in Canada in late November, Heated Rivalry was soon picked up by HBO Max and swiftly became the platform’s “top-rated live-action acquisition ever”, according toa profile of the actors in GQ. HBO’s CEO Casey Bloys explained in that same story: “When somebody says there’s a gay hockey show with explicit sex scenes, you go, ‘Great, I want to look at that.’” The two stars’ rise to fame has been so rapid, they’re reportedly still living with their families while navigating what’sbeen likened to“One Direction-level fandom”. Even A-listers are starstruck. Though not nominated at Monday’s Golden Globes, Storrie and Williamsreceived a rapturousresponse as presenters and were seated at a front table with Charli xcx and Hamnet stars Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley. “The buzz the whole night, and I’m not exaggerating, was ‘They’re coming! They’re coming!’” host Gayle Kingtold Williamson the Golden Globes red carpet on Monday. “Yeah, we do that a lot,” he quipped. At a star-studded Chanel party last week,Storrie was reportedly“theecrush of the night” and mobbed for selfies. Actor Tessa Thompson even singled him outin her speech: “Everybody wants to meetyou.” And Williams drew hundreds, if not thousands of screaming fans to his recent taping of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,earning comparisonsto the turnout for Harry Styles. He wenton to overshadowthe stars of Industry at their own season premiere.NBC security told fans that they saw something similar to today’s crowds only when Harry Styles was previously on The Tonight Show with Jimmy FallonHudson Williams you are a star.

Everyone’s shipping #HollanovThe show, based on the Game Changers novels by Rachel Reid, has been hailed as groundbreaking representation: Shane is Asian-Canadian, Ilya is bisexual and both characters are closeted. While queer audiences celebrate a same-sex on-screen love story (and thirst over its Adonis-like leads), Heated Rivalry has also been embraced by straight women seeking escapist romance and non-problematic poster boys. Gay bars have beenhostingpublicscreenings, while fans are throwing private “watch parties”, “basking in collective horniness” (Woman & Home’s phrasing,to be clear). Meanwhile,fancams, memes and other online tributes to the “Hollanov” pairing have kept the buzz going well beyond the six-episode run time: Williams and Storrie now have more than 2 million followers on Instagram. The young stars themselves seem to be taking their sudden fame and their lusty fandom in their stride. “Thank you for tweeting about our butts,” Storrietold hordes of fans at a West Hollywood gay bar.4. Sex still sellsView image in fullscreenSteamy … Storrie and Williams.Photograph: Sphere Abacus/SkyAs much as some fans want to believe Storrie and Williams are really together, neither actor has spoken publicly about their sexuality. Series creator Jacob Tierney, who is himself gay, has defended their right to privacy, sayingthey were castfor their “enthusiasm and willingness to do the work”. Storrie has said that, before shooting the show’s many sex scenes, he and Williamsagreed theywere game for “the most extreme form of kissing … the least amount of clothing … [and] doing anything outside of having actual sex”. But while viewers might have been initially attracted by Heated Rivalry’s“smutty”reputation, the real-life chemistry between its charismatic stars is holding their attention. “We just love each other very dearly,”said Williams.They even havematching tattoos reading“sex sells”. Storrie’s is outlined in a heart; Williams’ is on his upper thigh.5. They’re helping men out of the closetAll titillation aside, Heated Rivalry hasbeen celebratedfor sparking an important conversation about institutionalised homophobia within professional sports. Recently, on Andy Cohen’s podcast, Williams said he’s received“so many messages”from closeted queer athletes. The show has even helped at least one make the leap. On Wednesday, Jesse Kortuem, a league hockey player from Minnesota, publicly came out as gay, crediting the show withgiving him the courage. “Never in my life did I think something so positive and loving could come from such a masculine sport,”he told Out magazine. A reality show inspired by Heated Rivalry is also in the works, with casting currently under way to find “The Avengers of gay hockey” for an unscripted series.Sorry to be a corny gay but it’s insane that this is real in my lifetime and maybe all the mass psychosis this show has unleashed in people (myself included) really is a net positive.pic.twitter.com/Tnq3zGCLGX— Bradley Stern (@MuuMuse)January 15, 20266 … and shining the spotlight on hockeyBrock McGillis, the first professional hockey player to publicly come out as gay, earlier disagreed “wholeheartedly” with the suggestion that Heated Rivalry could help closeted players to come out, because homophobia was so enshrined in the sport it was “more likely to have an adverse effect”. If “hockey bros” were watching the show, “I don’t think … they’re talking about it positively”, McGillistold PinkNewsin December. Conservative commentators have duly spoken out against the show,calling it“pornographic smut” and claiming thatits successand real-world relevance have been overblown. Author Rachel Reid is in fact a lifelong hockey fan andwrote Heated Rivalry to exploreher ambivalence about exclusion and misconduct in the sport. The National Hockey League, at least, seems just happy to be in the conversation. “In the NHL’s 108-year history, this might be the most unique driver for creating new fans,” a reptold the Hollywood Reporter. On Thursday, Canada’s heritage ministerpraised Heated Rivalryfor showcasing the national sport and its “great plot”, though he warned: “It is racy. People have to be ready for that.”7. Heated Rivalry is only heating upView image in fullscreenHotting up … season two is already in the making.Photograph: Sphere Abacus/SkyThe show’s runaway success has fast-tracked production of season two. On Wednesday,Storrie said heexpected filming to begin “soon”, prompting speculation ofa 2027 release date. Reidalso confirmedthis week that a third book will be published in September, revisiting Hollanov “now they’re out, married and even playing on the same team”. She’s also consideringwriting a musical. For Storrie and Williams, it points to a long game ahead. They’ve already been tirelessly promoting the show, taking talkshow hoststhrough their favourite stretches, fielding questions about their glute-boosting workouts (“I think legs are super-important,”said Storrie), andlifting the lid ontheir skincare routines. Just on Monday night, Storrieflew straight from the Golden Globesafterparty to New York to tape Late Night With Seth Meyers. “I said hello to Parker Posey, then got on a plane,” he said. Asthe Cut concluded, “no one in Hollywood is working harder”. But how long can they keep it going?Intense fandoms can prove a burden as much as a blessing, and there are already signs of parasocial behaviour brewing. Meanwhile, both stars have their own projects on the backburner. Williams has co-directed a short film, and has publicly beenlobbying for apart in the upcoming live adaptation of DC’s Teen Titans, while Storrie has his own feature in the pipeline, “about an alien spirit that incarnates into a human body”. That was how he spent his Heated Rivalry wages, he toldInterview magazine, having figured “it was only a matter of months until I’d have to go get another serving job again”. Now it seems unlikely that Storrie and Williams will ever go back to waiting tables and working in kitchens. But only time will tell if they can handle the heat.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionCelebrity crib sheetDisney+Ice hockeyLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the 31-day stretch that’s important – you could do it whenever. But of course this is wrong: we reserve these privations for January on purpose. Despite, or perhaps because of the month’s prodigious capacity to disappoint, we go out of our way to make January hard on ourselves.It starts with the tremendously misleading idea of a clean slate. It always takes me until around the 10th to realise that all the missed deadlines and unfulfilled obligations of December have simply followed me into January, that no one I’m indebted to is thinking in terms of fresh starts. By the 15th, I have accepted that I’m beginning 2026 further behind than I ended 2025, and that this cycle will continue until I die.As my wife and I arrive home from walking the dog on a cold and thankless morning, something terrible occurs to me as I Iook up our road.“Oh shit,” I say. “It’s bins.”Like every January, bin collection has moved to a staggered timetable. And like every January, I have failed to adapt.My wife watches as I drag the rubbish bin down the front path to the pavement, shaking her head.“What?” I say. “Maybe the bin men are also late.”“The bin men,” she says, “have been.”Any toilet repair must be effected while standing on a ladder, and conducted largely by feel. It’s marginally preferable to doing my taxesThe fridge is full of food with sell-by dates from either side of Twelfth Night. Some of it we eat anyway, on the basis that fresh food is for people who have their shit together. The rest of it stays put for now, because there is no room in the bins.In some ways I like the despairing nature of January, which obliges you to find joy where you can. That’s what I’m thinking as I sit in my office shed watching a snowflake the size of a pigeon feather waft to earth outside, instead of doing my taxes. My wife crosses the garden and opens the door.“The loo won’t flush,” she says.“That’s January for you,” I say.“Nothing happens when you pull,” she says. “It’s come off inside again.”“Yeah, what can you do?” I say.“Fix it,” she says.I know there is no fixing these things: our high-mounted, chain-pull toilet cistern has a certain period charm which in no way offsets its tendency towards malfunction. The fulcrum on which the chain-pull mechanism operates relies on a single rivet, a rivet that has long since lost its proud edges, so that it eventually works its way loose and falls into the cistern – on average every 40 days.To complicate things, any repair must be effected while standing on a ladder, and conducted largely by feel. It would be fair to say that I’ve spent some of my lowest moments in that position, but it’s marginally preferable to doing my taxes, so I fetch the ladder and carry it upstairs.I am not prone to epiphanies – especially in January – but I have one right there on that ladder, with my left arm up to the elbow in cistern water, fishing around for that stupid rivet. I wish I could say it had something to do with the nature of existence, or the function of beauty in an otherwise bleak and unforgiving world.“I realised that if I could find a bit of stout galvanised wire, the kind you use for trellises, I could probably thread it through the rivet.”“I see,” my wife says.We’re standing in the kitchen, an hour later.“And I did find some, and it did fit through,” I say. “Then I bent both ends down with a pair of pliers, so now the rivet can’t work loose.”“Well done,” she says.“You don’t understand,” I say. “This is a permanent solution. Our lives are about to change.”“Is it bins tomorrow?” she says, looking in the fridge. “I think it’s bins.”Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The recipe is based on (but not authentic to) the Turkish dishmenemen. There is much to love about these eggs, not least how magnificently delicious they are and how fun it is to scoop them up with hot flatbread. On a practical note, meanwhile, they can be eaten at any mealtime and, if not finished, reheated later. Which, if you love eggs and leftovers as much as I do, is a (small) dream come true.Turk-ish eggs with lemon yoghurtPrep10 minCook45 minServes440g pine nuts200g greek yoghurt1 lemon, zest finely grated, then juiced to get 1½ tbsp1¾ tsp fine sea salt3½ tbsp rose harissa pasteExtra-virgin olive oil1 brown onion, peeled and finely chopped2 green peppers(400g), stalks, pith and seeds discarded, flesh very finely chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced2 tbsp sun-dried tomato paste2400g tins chopped tomatoes30g flat-leaf parsley, leaves and tender stems only, finely chopped6 large eggsFlatbreads, warmed, to servePut the pine nuts in a wide pan for which you have a lid, turn on the heat to low and stir every now and then until they turn nut brown all over. Transfer to a plate.Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the yoghurt with the lemon zest and juice, and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. In another small bowl, make a harissa oil to dress the eggs with by mixing a tablespoon of the harissa with four tablespoons of olive oil.Put four tablespoons of olive oil in the empty pine nut pan on a medium heat. When hot, add the onion, peppers and a teaspoon and a half of salt, then cook, stirring often, for 18-20 minutes, until very soft. Stir in the garlic, sun-dried tomato paste and the remaining two and a half tablespoons of harissa, then add the chopped tomatoes and let everything bubble and blip away for 10 minutes.Fold the parsley through the sauce, then crack the eggs into the tomato mixture and cover with a lid for a minute. Gently break up the eggs, so they marble through the sauce (don’t overmix), pop the lid back on for another minute, or until the yolks and whites are just set, then take off the heat.To serve, scoop a quarter of the egg and tomato mixture into each of four shallow bowls. Top with a generous spoonful of yoghurt and a spoonful of harissa oil, followed by a good sprinkling of pine nuts, then serve straight away with warmed flatbreads.Explore more on these topicsTurkish food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodEggsMain courseTomatoesBrunchrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Although the high cost of living is continuing to put a strain on household finances, for many the annual getaway to somewhere sunny is sacrosanct, with travel companiespredicting a 5%rise in bookings this year.If you haven’t yet booked a break, but are sizing up your options, here is what to do to make sure you get your money back if something goes wrong.Package or DIY?While it can feel more adventurous to put together your own itinerary via different websites, it is hard to beat a package holiday for the peace of mind it provides.All UK companies selling holidays including flights must be signed up to the Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing (Atol) scheme. To get its protection, you need to book a combined flight and hotel package with a UK-based firm. (Atol is not travel insurance, so it will not cover you if you fall ill and cannot travel.)Guy Hobbs, a travel expert at consumer group Which?, says: “There is nothing wrong with putting your own itinerary together, but it is good to be aware of risks.”View image in fullscreenSome users have reported scams on Booking.com, but it says cybersecurity is a top priority.Photograph: Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/ShutterstockHe adds: “In the summer of 2024 and spring 2025 we searched Booking.com reviews for the word ‘scam’ and found hundreds of people from the past few months complaining that they’d paid for accommodation that didn’t exist.” (Booking.com provided a detailed response tothe allegationsand said cybersecurity was a top priority.)Says Hobbs: “We always recommend booking a package holiday as the Atol scheme ensures you won’t be left out of pocket or, worse, stranded abroad if your holiday company were to go bust.”If you opt for a package, you will be covered financially and legally by the Package Travel Regulations, which means the holiday operator is responsible for sorting out any problems, from disruption caused by wildfires, to the hotel not being up to scratch.Some people turn their noses up at the idea of a package holiday, but if you buy two big elements of a holiday – flights and accommodation, for example – in a single transaction, from the same travel company, it’s a package. How adventurous that package is, is up to you – it could be cruising the Med from the safety of a sun lounger or cycling across Sri Lanka on a guided tour.View image in fullscreenBuying a package from a travel company such as Tui can give more protection than separate flights and accommodation.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThis means you can book an Atol-protected break though an online travel agent such as Expedia or Lastminute.com, but be careful when you put together the itinerary, and read through the site’s policy carefully.The Lastminute.com site spells out itspolicy. Your “booking is protected under the Atol scheme when it includes flights and accommodation booked together as a flight + hotel package (ie, a city break or a holiday). Additionally, flight and car rental bookings are also covered, when both of these products are booked in the same transaction. If you do receive an Atol certificate, but not all of the products you have booked in the transaction are listed on it, then the missing products are not Atol-protected.”For cruises and package holidays without a flight, look for the safety net provided by a travel association such as Abta. The operating name of the Association of British Travel Agents, it provides some financial protection if you make a booking and the travel company goes bust. Another option is theTravel Trust Association.Abta members sign up to a code of conduct, and if you have a complaint and can’t resolve it directly with the company, you can turn to itsdispute resolution service.For those who prefer to book the different elements of a holiday – flights, transfers, accommodation – themselves for flexibility, you can get extra protection, mainly by using a credit card to pay (more on this later).What it will costA consumer poll issued by Nationwide this month found that despite more than half (54%) being concerned about the cost of living, travel is a “top priority” for Britons in 2026.They plan to spend, on average, £5,517 a year on longer trips and £2,348 on short trips, according to the survey.If cost is the deciding factor, then Spain’s Costa Blanca, best-known for its sandy beaches and resorts such as Benidorm and Alicante, is the cheapest choice for a peak-summer holiday in Europe, according toWhich? Travel’s price checkof more than 5,000 holidays.View image in fullscreenCosta Blanca resorts such as Benidorm are the cheapest choice for a peak-summer holiday in Europe, according to Which? Travel.Photograph: imageBROKER.com/AlamyIt is the only trip that costs less than £900 a person, on average, for a week in August, it found. But two other regions of mainland Spain – the Costa Brava and Costa Dorada – made its top 10, at £1,125 pp and £1,133 pp, respectively. Six of the 10 locations are in Spain.It’s hard to avoid the January sales hype, but the consumer organisation says it may pay to wait.It trackedmore than 40,000 summer package holiday pricesthis time last year and found that, on average, they actually came down after January. July was the cheapest month to book in August for popular destinations, including France and Turkey.There is no certainty the same will happen this year – not least because of the apparent increased demand – and if you wait, the risk is that there might be less choice.How to payIf you can, the best option is to use a credit card. Although holiday firms and hotel chains increasingly offer buy now, pay later (BNPL), using this option can mean missing out on vital financial protection.If you pay with a credit card, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act means that if a purchase between £100 and £30,000 goes wrong, the credit card provider is jointly liable with the retailer.This cover is not there if you pay by debit card, though you may be able to get a refund viathe chargeback scheme. If you make a bank transfer, neither applies.With BNPL, if there is a problem, you will usually have to chase the retailer or travel company yourself. It is worth checking if the firm has a dispute process, but these aren’t as robust or guaranteed as section 75.If an airline goes bust, and you have booked directly with it, you can at least get your money back from the card company. But to get section 75 protection, you have to have paid the supplier directly.You don’t get it if you used an online travel agent to make a flight-only booking.Is it refundable?Most package holidays are refundable, but there is a sliding scale in terms of how much money you will get back depending on how close to the departure date it is.For example, with Jet2holidays if you cancel 70 days or more before departure you lose the deposit. However, the firm keeps a bigger percentage of the holiday cost the closer it gets, and if it is under a fortnight, you lose all your money.If you have booked the flight yourself, the flight will often be non-refundable if you do not travel. Ryanair will not refund you if you cancel, and you will have to pay £45 a flight, for each person, as well as the difference in cost to rebook (if the new flight costs more).View image in fullscreenEasyJet allows you to cancel within 24 hours of booking, for a fee.Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/Rex/ShutterstockMeanwhile, easyJet lets you cancel within 24 hours of booking, but you must pay a £49 fee.Booking.com and Expedia are among the sites that let you search for hotels and apartments offering free cancellation, which may appeal to some who worry that their plans could be affected by life events during the year.The cutoff time for when this ends will vary – typically from one to two weeks, to up to 24 hours before check-in. And usually you pay more for this flexibility.We went on to Booking.com and looked at hotels in central Amsterdam that advertised various rates for the same room based on whether you chose free cancellation, or a non-refundable booking. The premium for free cancellation for a weekend break around Valentine’s Day varied widely, from 4% to 40%, so shop around. Some may feel a small premium is worth peace of mind.A big advantage of selecting free cancellation is that you can keep checking the websites and switch to a new deal if the price falls, or you find something cheaper. This strategy can also work with things such as car hire.Buy insurance, quickArguably the biggest mistake people make is to book an expensive holiday and then wait until the last minute to buy travel insurance. By buying both at the same time, you will get all-important cancellation cover, which should kick in if a serious accident or illness, involving one of those going on the trip, or a close family member, prevents the holiday from going ahead.Hobbs says: “We can’t emphasise enough how important it is to buy travel insurance as soon as you book. It means you’re much more likely to be covered for any pre-departure issues that mean you can’t travel.“Many holiday companies and airlines will try to sell you their own insurance – don’t take it. It isn’t usually any cheaper, and it’s certainly not better.”View image in fullscreenAn annual multi-trip policy will cover you for all holidays you take in a year.Photograph: Peter Titmuss/AlamyIf you buy a single-trip policy, this should insure you from the point of purchase right until you return home from holiday. An annual multi-trip policy will cover all trips that take place during the period it is valid.It is vital that you are honest with your travel insurer about any medical conditions. Failure to do so may invalidate the cover.It is also important to let your insurer know if there are any changes to your health after you buy the policy – this is known as “ongoing duty of disclosure”. The insurer will then review the cover and may increase the cost.Explore more on these topicsMoneyTravel insuranceConsumer affairsFlightsEuropeTravel & leisureInsurancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But right now, things look a little different. This week, Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, appeared at a joint press conference with Denmark’s leader to say that he had no intention of acquiescing to Donald Trump’s stated desire to “own” Greenland – all while wearing a glacial-blue windbreaker.It is a garment Nielsen wears regularly but, in this shifting geopolitical moment, it took on a new, loaded and striking messaging.A practical outer layer, the windbreaker or anorak is widely seen as a modern descendant of the parka, which wasinvented in the Arcticregion to which Greenland belongs. Traditionallymade from intestinal membranes from marine mammals – a proto-Gore-Tex– the parka was designed for survival. Nielsen’s jacket hasbeen called “a modern take on the Inuit anorak”.View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet in London wearing a Marty Supreme promotional windbreaker.Photograph: Neil Mockford/GC ImagesThe windbreaker’s resurgence has also been fuelled by popular culture. It followed one of the most rollercoaster press tours in recent memory, forMarty Supreme, in which a $250 (£185) windbreaker took centre stage.Part of a collection produced by the LA-based luxury brand Nahmias in collaboration with A24, the film’s production company, along with the actorTimothée Chalametand his stylist, Taylor McNeill, the jacket was emblazoned with the film’s title and three gold stars.Worn by Kendall and Kylie Jenner, the American ballet dancer Misty Copeland, the rapper Kid Cudi and even,as seen via a festive Instagram post, Ringo Starr, it helped transform a film about a striving ping-pong player into the kind of manufactured cultural moment not seen since Barbie turned 2023 pink.As the brand’s founder, Doni Nahmias, told GQ: “It’s like a modern take on vintage sportswear … we kind of just decided the fans are going to need these.”The windbreaker, although not actually featured in the film, quickly sold out and is now on offer for many times its original price on resale sites – a blue size large was listed at just under £16,000 on StockX.More affordably, Depop – where searches for “windbreakers” are up 60% in the past six months and searches for “Marty Supreme” have soared by 1,475% in six weeks – is awash with retro versions that closely resemble the original.Nor was it the only cultural moment to bring the windbreaker in from the cold. Hailey Bieber, Zoë Kravitz and Charli xcx wore versions on the front row of Saint Laurent’s Paris show in September, securing the jacket’s unlikely status as both fashion item and cultural signal.View image in fullscreenFrom left, Hailey Bieber, Zoë Kravitz, Charli xcx and Rosé at the Saint Laurent fashion show in Paris in September.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/WWD/Getty ImagesAccording to Daniel-Yaw Miller, a sports and fashion journalist and writer ofSportsVerse, “windbreakers are definitely having a moment in both menswear and womenswear. There’s an emphasis on an elevated style of dressing inspired by 90s sportswear and street fashion.”For J’Nae Phillips, a trend forecaster and the creator of theFashion Tingznewsletter, windbreakers feel timely because they “sit at a very specific emotional crossroads: practicality, nostalgia and irony, without tipping fully into any one of those”.The brooding Britpop summer may also have played a role: the outdoor specialist Berghaus reissued its 90s Trango jacket, fronted by the campaign’s leading man, a moodyLiam Gallagher, accessorised with his trademark pinched pout.But there is another, meteorological, reason. “We’re in a permanently ‘in-between’ climate moment,” says Phillips, as Storm Goretti brings 99mph gusts to the UK. “Not cold enough for a coat, not warm enough for nothing. Windbreakers are designed for uncertainty, which mirrors how people are dressing more broadly: adaptable, layerable, non-committal.”View image in fullscreenThe musician Mark Ronson at the Golden Globe awards in Beverly Hills, California, last week.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesIn general, she says, windbreakers “align with a broader mood shift away from aspiration and toward realism. They’re democratic, vaguely sporty, slightly unfashionable in a way that now reads as chic. They acknowledge that life is windy, unpredictable, and often a bit damp, and that being dressed for that feels oddly reassuring right now.”So it is that, even though they generally read more trainspotter than trendspotter, wind is being broken all over the high street. Zara is hitting two trend birds with one stone with itspolka dot version, while Damson Madder, a London-based brand beloved of “the girlies”, has several takes. Cos offers its own iteration, andthe Scandi label Ganni a leopard-print option.Leading the charge, however, is the Paris-founded, Milan-based brand K-Way and its reimagined Le Vrai jacket. Lorenzo Boglione, the chief executive of BasicNet Group, which owns K-Way, said that while “windbreakers started as simple protection from the elements, today they’ve become true lifestyle pieces”.Damson Madder is also framing windbreakers as a “lifestyle object rather than a technical one”, favouring “soft colours, clean lines, easy shapes”. Still undeniably sporty and outdoorsy, the rebrand means they no longer represent “gorpcoreat its peak; it’s gorpcore domesticated. The girlies aren’t dressing for Everest, they’re dressing for walking, errands, life.”Explore more on these topicsFashionTimothée ChalametMarty SupremeRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The second evening of our most recent visit: the beach floodlit by the last embers of a flaming sunset, the mountains that stand sentry around the town softening into deep purple hues. Before our eyes, all was transformed: sunloungers stacked away, waiters whisking back and forth with tables, menus and small rechargeable lamps. A little further along, in one of the bar areas on the beach, a trio of Turkish women, their hair in shades of pepper and smoke, sat with their toes in the sand, happily knitting. I recalled other beaches in Turkey, where oligarchs and influencers preen and pose, and thought – yes, this is exactly where I want to be.Akyaka – a small town, huddled on the eastern end of blue-washed Gökova Bay – is an old friend of mine. Thirty years ago, working as a holiday rep, I visited on a weekly basis, popping in to see the handful of clients who were staying at simplepansiyons(small B&Bs) in the town. Back then … well, actually, back then it wasn’t that different from today, which is something that can’t be said about many of the Turkish villages and small resorts I knew in the mid-1990s.Of course, Akyaka has changed to some degree: more houses and hotels, the beach has been extended, and it’s now a major kitesurfing destination (more on that later), but it’s still got a lovely slow-paced, slightly ramshackle, properly authentic feel.Part of that, I think, is due to its status as one of Turkey’s“slow towns”; a concept that focuses on preserving local traditions and culture, promoting quality of life and generally swerving all the worst excesses of tourist development. The town’s vibe is also partly the legacy of the Turkish poet and architect Nail Çakirhan, who retired there in 1971 and built a house that blended traditional Ottoman design with local materials. Others followed his lead, revitalising local crafts, most notably carpentry, and by the 1990s, the architectural standards established by Çakirhan were brought in for most new properties. The result is streets lined with elegant houses, their wood-carved balconies spilling over with bougainvillea, and not a modern, glass-walled box in sight.View image in fullscreenThe view from the İskelem hotelIt wasn’t until 2022 that I went back to Akyaka for a proper visit, with my husband, Mark – and promptly fell in love. The lack of big all-inclusive or sprawling resort hotels means it’s still mostly the preserve of Turkish tourists, who come for the fish restaurants that flank the banks of the sparkling Azmak River, to hike the paths that weave their way through the Akyakaorman(forest) that rises up from the western end of the beach, or simply to sit and knit their way through the day on the beach.Akyaka is one of Turkey’s slow towns; a concept that focuses on preserving local traditions and cultureSince then, we have always stayed at theİskelem Otel, on the other side of the pine forest, a few minutes’ drive out of town. It’s one of three little hotels set on a small bay that opens out on to the gulf, and we were unsure at first; disappointed to find sunloungers on a wooden jetty and a lawned area, rather than a beach. But the warm, if surprised (“English? You are …English?”),welcome from Müjgan, İskelem’s charming receptionist, the glorious views from our bedroom, and the swift delivery of ice-cold Efes beer soon allayed any concerns. At night, the İskelem pulls a similar trick to Akyaka’s beach: sunloungers are swapped for linen-clad tables flickering with candlelight for dinner on the jetty surrounded by the sea.View image in fullscreenAkyaka is one of the Med’s leading watersports destinations.Photograph: Thankful Photography/AlamyAnd what dinners we’ve eaten: sea bream, crispy-skinned and tangy with lemon and salt; spiced Adana kebabs, the lamb smooth and dense; silky aubergine; yoghurt thick with garlic; and baklava that sticks to our fingertips and sends us to bed buzzing with sugar and honey and sticky pistachio filling. In the mornings, the gluttony continues, with more than a dozen dishes brought to the table: crispybörek(filo rolls) filled with feta cheese; neat piles of scarlet tomatoes and leafy parsley; honey; jams; omelette still sizzling from the pan. I tell myself a ferocious hour of paddleboarding will work it off, while Mark, who usually has a more taxing morning planned, tucks in with gusto.For Mark, all of Akyaka’s beauty is trumped by the fact that it’s also one of the Med’s leading watersports destinations. The thermic winds that blow across the gulf from May to November rise in the late morning every day, regular as clockwork, always onshore, usually between 15 to 18 knots (all key factors, apparently). About 10 minutes’ drive out of town, Akçapinar Beach billows with branded kite-surf flags. By early afternoon, the sky is filled with dozens of brightly coloured canvas crescents whisking through the breeze, pulling tiny figures along in their wake. The shallow, sandy beach makes it a great spot for first-timers, whether kiting or wing-foiling.The truth is, Turkey is changing; what used to be a come-one, come-all summer sun destination has morphed into something far more fracturedBeyond the town and its blustery beach, there is much to explore: Göcek, with itsgulets(wooden vessels) and sleek, sailing-hub vibe; the still, blue waters of Lake Köyceğiz, flanked by forests of sweetgums, perfect for a gentle, shady walk; and on Thursdays, Muğla market, the best in the region, which involves a breathtaking drive of switchbacks and hairpin bends up into the mountains. It is a world away from the knock-off handbags and “cheaper than M&S” patter that characterises more touristy markets.View image in fullscreenThe Thursday market in Muğla.Photograph: Grant Rooney/AlamyFinding these authentic experiences is, for me, a key part of holidaying in Turkey these days. The truth is, the country is changing; what used to be a come-one, come-all summer sun destination has morphed into something far more fractured: part playground for the super-rich, with Maldivian-style luxury resorts that top £1,000 a night; part one-stop shop for health tourists seeking anything from hair transplants to gleaming veneers; part all-inclusive ghetto, with sprawling resorts where most guests never venture beyond the lobby. Hyperinflation and President Erdoğan’s economic policies mean prices are constantly increasing – and these are inevitably passed on to visitors, meaning Turkey is no longer the budget destination it once was.But the good news is there are still places, like Akyaka, that refuse to be pigeonholed into those categories. And if you find a resort that mainly caters to a domestic clientele, you’ll find more reasonable prices. One of our favourite places to eat is theAzmak Çorba Salonu, where fresh-bakedpide(Turkish pizza), sizzling grilled chicken and a parsley salad, tangy with sumac, costs about £30 for two.View image in fullscreenEarly-morning bathers take to the calm waters.Photograph: John Wreford/AlamyIf you’re looking for late-night cocktail bars, Michelin-esque restaurants or swanky spa resorts – and there are plenty of all three in Turkey these days – Akyaka won’t be for you. It’s not polished or glitzy, but my goodness, it’s beautiful. It’s Turkish coffee andsimit(Turkish bagels) for breakfast, eaten while flicking through theDailySabah(an English-language newspaper); it’s backgammon on the jetty in the lazy hours of the afternoon; and it’s iced glasses of Efes as the sun dips and Gökova Bay glows iridescent blue and silver. Akyaka is the kind of place that makes me think – why would I go anywhere else in Turkey? Who knows, I might even take up knitting.Rooms at theİskelem cost from£105-£260 B&B.

But what did farmers do for the hundreds of years before stock fencing was invented?Hedges, so rooted in what we wistfully consider to be our natural landscape, are in fact human-made features, planted almost solely for the purpose of enclosure. Unmanaged hedges are not a permanent solution, though: young trees mature, trunks become bare, and animal‑sized holes appear, rendering them useless. To remedy this, the practice of hedge laying was developed; unlike bricklaying, it is an act of maintenance rather than creation.Regional styles abound: Devon’s hedges growing atop banks are laid very low; the “Midland style” is laid high and thick to withstand cattle. Learning to lay in the “south of England style” was not complicated, but becoming proficient has taken years of practice.Early this morning, I began laying a stretch of leggy hawthorn by removing the undergrowth and low branches. Then, starting at one end, I freed the first tree from its neighbours and cut almost, but not entirely, through the base with an angled swing of the axe. This pleacher is then bent over, still attached to its root by a tongue of living material, and laid down in line with the hedge. This is repeated until there is a continuous, thick barrier.View image in fullscreen‘This pleacher is bent over, still attached to its root by a tongue of living material, and laid down in line with the hedge.’Photograph: Michael WhiteIt will still be vulnerable to wind and barging animals, so I’ll drive wooden stakes in through its central line and apply a rope-like binding of hazel wands, securing it until new growth knits the structure together. A well laid and maintained hedge can last decades; when it fails, it can simply be relaid.The hedge before me will never hold livestock. Like most modern hedge-laying projects, the aim is to reinvigorate it and reinstate it as an environmental asset, a home and conduit for creatures, rather than a barrier.To the onlooker, this is conspicuously romantic work, repairing the living arteries of a landscape with ancient skills and simple tools. On the ground, it is harsh, physical labour, undertaken in all weathers. But it is beyond these hardships that true romance resides: to look, cold and exhausted, over a section of completed hedge is a profound pleasure.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsRural affairsCountry diaryFarmingTrees and forestsKentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He called for peaceful protests to pressure the authorities to release what he called the “rightful results”.Wine also alleged that he fled his home to escape arrest by security forces who raided his house on Friday, with his political party claiming earlier that he had been taken from his home in an army helicopter.“Last night was very difficult at our home … The military and the police raided us. They switched off power and cut off some of our CCTV cameras,” Wine said in a post on X.View image in fullscreenBobi Wine alleged that he fled his home to escape arrest by security forces who raided his house on Friday.Photograph: Michel Lunanga/Getty ImagesIn an earlier statement, Ugandan police said that Wine had not been arrested, but that they were restricting the area to the public to prevent unrest.Among the irregularities was the failure of biometric voter ID machines which delayed voting in cities – large bases of support for the political opposition. Pro-democracy activists had asked that the machines be used in elections to prevent any allegations of voter fraud and rigging.Electoral officials then resorted to manual lists of voters, which Wine alleged allowed for “massive ballot stuffing”, as well as claims of favouritism to the incumbent’s party. Museveni endorsed the use of the manual voter register.Despite the internet shutdown and allegations of fraud, the election largely passed with little incident, save a clash between police and opposition in central Uganda. Seven people died and three were injured after police fired in self-defence against opposition “goons”, police said, a claim disputed by MP Muwanga Kivumbi, who said security forces killed 10 people in his house.Uganda is termed as “not free” by rights monitor Freedom House, which noted that while the country holds regular elections, they are not considered credible. Museveni, 81, has been the president of the country for 40 years, making him the third-longest-serving non-royal national leader in the world.Uganda has not had a peaceful transition of power since it gained its independence from British colonialism six decades ago.Museveni has rewritten Uganda’s laws to stay in power, including by removing term and age limits from the constitution. He has also jailed opposition opponents.He has overseen a period of stability in Uganda, which has allowed the economy to grow, with growth forecasted to rise next year.Wine wore a flak jacket and helmet due to fears over his safety, as he alleged security forces harassed him and his supporters including through the use of teargas.Explore more on these topicsUgandaYoweri MuseveniAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Moroccan diaspora in North Kensington is in no doubt that on Sunday the Atlas Lions will triumph against Senegal in the final of theAfrica Cup of Nations.“There’s not just an excitement, it has completely taken over everything else,” said Souad Talsi, who runs the Al-Hasaniya Moroccan women’s centre at the base of 31-storey Trellick Tower, at the north end of Golborne Road.She added: “There is so much gloom and doom around at the moment and people are depressed about Gaza, but football has given us a respite from all that. It has completely united the Moroccan diaspora and given us a purpose and a sense of belonging.”Mohamed Chelh said that ifMoroccoprevail it will be first time they have lifted the Afcon trophy since 1976, a tournament he cannot even remember.Sipping mint tea in the Trellick Lounge cafe after Friday prayers, he said: “They should win. They’ve got the best team.” He points to Morocco’s success in the last World Cup when they reached the semi-finals and beat Spain and Portugal on the way.Chelh, who works in a bakery, plans to head to Trafalgar Square to celebrate Morocco’s anticipated victory.View image in fullscreenMohamed Chelh, who hopes to celebrate a Morocco victory – their first in the Afcon tournament since 1976 – in Trafalgar Square on Sunday.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianOn a big screen at the back of the cafe, the Trellick Lounge has shown all of Morocco’s games in the tournament so far. On Friday, more than 48 hours before Sunday’s game, it was already showing a buildup programme on the satellite channel Maghreb TV. On Sunday there will also be a screen on the street outside the cafe.Ali Mssr, who runs the cafe, predicts that hundreds will turn up to the watch the final. “Outside there will be even more,” he said.Mohamed, a retired gardener, said he could hear the celebrations in the cafe from his flat down the street when Morocco scraped through on penalties against Nigeria in the semi-final.“It was a beautiful atmosphere. They were really happy. And I’m very proud. I love Morocco, my mum and dad are there. And I love it when they play well and win.”Further down Golborne Road, at Hakim’s cafe, Yassim, a courier, said: “The mood is very good. I have confidence we will win. We beat Nigeria and they are the toughest team in the tournament. We will win whether it is 90 minutes or 120 minutes.”Talsi is planning to watch the game with her extended family, including her 85-year-old-mother, her brothers and their children, after a meal of couscous.She said: “Football reminds us that people are not always bad and people can come together and forget their differences. Whether you are an international trader or a cleaner, all they want is for Morocco to win.“It has also broken the gender barrier. At the semi-final there was an outdoor screen and there were as many loud girls as there were loud boys.”View image in fullscreenCouscous is prepared at a community centre inside Trellick Tower, which, says Saoud Talsi (left), will be eaten before the match.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianLailah Khallouk, a senior outreach worker at the women’s centre, said: “I hate football but I love to watch the Moroccan team. There’s huge excitement and a lot of organising about where to watch the game –in cafes or social clubs or house parties.“My son Adam, who is 11, is passionate about it, he’s like a professional fan.“It’s something that brings us all together. Despite where we were born, our ages, our social classes, is a just a great event. Finally we have something to be proud of.”Mohamed Rhiam, an Uber driver, has just got back from a visit to relatives in Casablanca. “The atmosphere was crazy. There will be great disappointment if they lose, because everyone is into it now. But we’ll win.”Rhiam witnessed protests before the tournament on the amount of money spent on stadiums rather than public services. “I share those concerns. I believe the money they spent on it they could have done more for the economy. But the football still makes me proud.”Asked if an Afcon win would make up for the disappointment of the last World Cup, Rhiam said: “It wasn’t a disappointment, we got to the semi-final.”Explore more on these topicsLondonMoroccoAfrica Cup of Nations 2025SenegalAfricaAfrica Cup of NationsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Cradled in the arms of their mother, Mafuko, the tiny twins clung to her body for warmth in the forest clearing in Virunga national park, in easternDemocratic Republic of the Congo(DRC).Katutu, head of gorilla monitoring in Virunga, has seen dozens of newborns in his 15 years as a ranger. But, he tells the Guardian, even he was touched by the sight of the fragile infant males, who face serious obstacles if they are to become silverbacks one day.“Watching Mafuko holding two babies was both moving and filled me with responsibility, given the twins’ extreme vulnerability,” he says.Twin births in mountain gorillas are extremely rare and present significant survival challengesJacques Katutu“Twin births in mountain gorillas are extremely rare and always present significant survival challenges. We are cautious and vigilant, while also maintaining hope. The first four weeks are the most critical.”The mother and her babies are being monitored daily since they were spotted on 3 January, with specialist vets on hand if the gorillas show signs of distress. The young males are healthy for now, rangers say, but the subspecies hashigh rates of infant mortality– with about a quarter falling victim to disease, trauma or infanticide.Mafuko gave birth to twins in 2016, but neither survived more than a few days. The males have been born into the Bageni family, Virunga’s largest group of mountain gorillas, which now has 59 members. Despite the rangers’ caution, their arrival is another milestone in one ofthe greatest conservation success storiesof the past century.View image in fullscreenThe mountain gorilla twins. From barely 250 as they neared extinction in the 1970s, numbers of the subspecies have climbed to above 1,000 now.Photograph: Courtesy of Virunga national parkBarely 250 mountain gorillas were left in the 1970s, split between two isolated territories in south-west Uganda and the Virunga massif mountain range, and many thought the animals faced extinction.Decades of intense conservation work saw population numbers surpass 1,000 in 2018 and the gorilla subspecies has since been downgraded from critically endangered to endangered by conservation authorities.But the DRC section of Virunga mountain range remains one of the most dangerous places in the world for wildlife rangers. Over the past 20 years, more than 220 rangers have been killed in the park, where rebel groups such asM23 and other militias, as well as bandits, operate with impunity.Mafuko is an example of the species’ resilience, say conservationists. Her mother was killed by an attacker when she was four but she has gone on to have several young, including the latest newborns.Mountain gorillas are back from the brink. But what happens if they run out of room?Read more“Mafuko is an experienced mother. She is carrying both babies and is attentive to their needs. This is encouraging, although the situation remains delicate,” says Katutu.“We are closely monitoring the twins and mother – observing her breastfeeding and the overall health of the newborns. Allowing her to care for her babies naturally and minimising intervention is the priority.”Specialist veterinary care has played a leading role in the revival of the species. In Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC, organisations such as the Gorilla Doctors have prevented dozens of deaths by helping animals affected by human behaviour, such as releasing gorillas accidentally caught in poachers’ traps.One studyattributes half of the mountain gorillas’ population increase to the vets.Katutu says that neither infant will be named until their survival looks more certain. But for now, at least, the signs are promising.“Initial observations show that they are calm and maintain good contact with their mother. Their behaviour is consistent with newborns in a good condition, while remaining very vulnerable,” he says.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsEndangered speciesThe age of extinctionDemocratic Republic of the CongoAnimalsConservationWildlifeAfricaPrimatologynewsShareReuse this content"

The 54-year-old was put into an induced coma on 27 December and was fighting for his life in a Gold Coast intensive care unit until he woke eight days later.Martyn said he had been unable to walk or talk after coming out of the coma, but, “with the doctors in disbelief”, spoke and moved four days later. “My life was taken out of my hands … when meningitis took over my brain, and unbeknownst to me I was placed into a paralysed coma for eight days to help me fight this awful disease,” he said.Allow Facebook content?This article includes content provided byFacebook.

She concluded Royupa, a trainee at a winery, was “exploited” and exposed to “potentially criminal” conduct during his five weeks in Australia.Royupa died in March 2019 after “voluntarily” jumping or falling from a van driven by his training scheme sponsor, who cannot be named due to legal reasons, the coroner said. In the days before his death, Royupa became “increasingly fearful” of his visa sponsor, Hosking found.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailOn 14 March 2019, Royupa voluntarily exited the van being driven by his sponsor after the man threatened to take him to the airport or police.While Royupa lay unconscious on the side of the road, the sponsor failed to immediately call an ambulance, disparaged him to a paramedic and left the scene after being told not to.Hosking described the training sponsor’s conduct as “deplorable”.Bitter fruit: the dark underside of the booming NSW blueberry industryRead moreRoyupa died the following day at the Royal Melbourne hospital from complications of “multiple blunt force injuries”, Hosking said.Hosking said she could not conclude the precise reason why Royupa left the vehicle but could not rule out there was some threat.The training sponsor understood that if Royupa absconded he would be liable for costs associated with the worker’s recovery, the coroner said. While living at the winery where he worked, Royupa did not have access to his passport, Hosking found.Royupa, a Filipino national who had studied agriculture, moved to Australia five weeks before his death. He arrived on a temporary subclass 407 visa, designed for workplace-based occupational training.But the coroner found Royupa was “exclusively” performing manual labour and was not engaged in any educational training, contrary to what had been proposed to him.The 21-year-old worker was required to work “excessive” hours – up to 60 a week – which was at odds with the “training schedule” that had been proposed, Hosking said.He was required to work outside in excessive heat with no appropriate clothing or sun protection.He was promised a “generous allowance” – which Hosking said was “wholly inadequate”. But no payments were made to him during his time in Australia, because the sponsor told Royupa the salary would be paid after six months.Royupa’s proposed remuneration was a monthly base salary of $134.92, despite working 10 hours a day for six days a week, the inquest heard.Hosking accepted the Department of Home Affairs view that it was “inappropriate” to approve the training visa, as the same documentation provided by the sponsor in a separate nomination after Royupa’s death was rejected. The decision maker for the second nomination said they were not satisfied a “genuine” training opportunity was intended.The three-day inquest, held in December 2024, was the first in Australia to examine concerns of forced labour since modern slavery offences were criminalised through standalone offences in 2013.Hosking made six recommendations, including that the coronial brief of evidence and transcript from hearings be referred to the AFP for consideration of further investigations.She recommended the home affairs minister conduct an internal review to identify potential “lessons learned” and consider the need for a formal review to investigate the department’s role in approving 407 training visas that may have been used for exploitation of visa-holders.Hosking’s other recommendations included that the NSW police commissioner liaise with the state’s anti-slavery commissioner to develop and implement mandatory modern slavery training for officers working in high-risk areas such as regional parts of the state.A spokesperson said the Department of Home Affairs had provided full assistance to the inquest and was carefully reviewing the findings and recommendations.“The department expresses our condolences to the family and friends of Mr Royupa,” the spokesperson said.“The department is working on strengthened regulations for the training visa to protect visa-holders and will incorporate the coroner’s findings in this work.”The department “applies close scrutiny” to all applications in the subclass 407 visa category, with refusal rates for 2025-26 now sitting at 45%, the spokesperson said.NSW Police was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesAustralian immigration and asylumMigrationWorkers' rightsModern slaverynewsShareReuse this content"

They held signs of protest, waved their national flag and chanted “Greenland is not for sale” in the face of increasing threats of an American takeover.Just as they finished their trek from the small downtown of Greenland’s capital city, Nuuk, to the US consulate, the news broke that Trump had announcedhe would charge a 10% tariff on eight European countriesfrom February over their opposition to US control of Greenland.Trump threatens 25% tariff on European allies until Denmark sells Greenland to USRead more“I thought this day couldn’t get any worse, but it just did,” Malik Dollerup-Scheibel said after the Associated Press told him about Trump’s announcement. “It just shows he has no remorse for any kind of human being now.”Trump has long said he thinks the US should own the strategically located and mineral-rich island, which is a self-governing territory ofGreenland. Trump intensified his calls a day after the military operation to oust the former Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.Trump threatens 25% tariff on European allies until Denmark sells Greenland to USRead moreDollerup-Scheibel, a 21-year-old Greenlander, and the Greenland prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, were among what others described as the island’s biggest protest, drawing nearly a quarter of Nuuk’s population.Others held rallies and solidarity marches across the Danish realm, including in Copenhagen, as well as in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut in Canada’s far north.“This is important for the whole world,” a Danish protester, Elise Riechie, said as she held Danish and Greenlandic flags in Copenhagen. “There are many small countries. None of them are for sale.”In Nuuk, Greenlanders of all ages listened to traditional songs as they walked to the consulate. Marie Pedersen, a 47-year-old Greenlander, said it was important to bring her children to the rally “to show them that they’re allowed to speak up”.“We want to keep our own country and our own culture, and our family safe,” she said.Her nine-year-old daughter, Alaska, crafted her own “Greenland is not for sale” sign. The girl said her teachers have addressed the controversy and taught them about Nato at school.“They tell us how to stand up if you’re being bullied by another country or something,” she said.Meanwhile, Tom Olsen, a police officer in Nuuk, said Saturday’s protest was the biggest he’s ever seen there.“I hope it can show him that we stand together inEurope,” he said. “We are not going down without a fight.”Tillie Martinussen, a former member of Greenland’s parliament, said she hopes the Trump administration will “abandon this crazy idea”.“They started out touting themselves as our friends and allies, that they wanted to make Greenland better for us than the Danes would,” she said, as others chanted in the background. “And now they’re just plain threatening us.”She added that the push to preserve Nato and Greenland’s autonomy were more important than facing tariffs, though she added that she was not dismissing the potential economic impact.“This is a fight for freedom,” she said. “It’s for Nato, it’s for everything the western Hemisphere has been fighting for since world war two.”But when the AP asked Louise Lennert Olsen what she would say to Trump, the 40-year-old Greenlandic nurse instead said she wanted to give a message to the American people.“I would really like them to support our wish to be Greenland as we are now,” she said as she marched through Nuuk. “I hope they will stand against their own president. Because I can’t believe they just stand and watch and do nothing.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpDenmarkEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

He doubled down on those statements by posting on Truth Social an image of himself accompanied with the caption “Mister Tariff” and “The Tariff King”.A crowd walks to the US consulate to protest against Trump's policy in Nuuk, Greenland.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APEarlier today, thousands gathered all aroundDenmarkand in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, as part of a planned “Hands Off Greenland” action protesting Donald Trump and his threats to take over the island. “We are demonstrating against American statements and ambitions to annex Greenland. We demand respect for the Danish Realm and for Greenland’s right to self-determination,” Camilla Siezing, chair of the Joint Association Inuit, said in a statement.Meanwhile, a bipartisan congressional delegation continued to meet with Danish and Greenlandic leaders in Copenhagen, where they maintained their support of both Greenland and Denmark in direct contrast with statements coming from the White House.WithNatotroops in Greenland this week, some Greenland residents are now preparing for the worst, either stocking up on supplies or readying themselves to flee quickly.Share"

While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has beendisputedby US allies, including Denmark.In the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato alliesdeploying troopsin Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister,respondedon social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee,wrotein more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”The tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.In response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said ina statementthat the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer,said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”Emmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote ina social media riposteto Trump.Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer,echoedthe warning about a potential “downward spiral”.“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson,added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, whowrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”Germany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.On Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt,suggestedthat Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bildrevealedbroad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.Even before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland andDenmarkon Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.1:01Greenland prime minister joins protests over Trump threats – videoHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he hadstruck a trade pact with the UK– and six months after he announced apact with the European Union.The UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.Trump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Faragewrote.There was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina,calledthe president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.The president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombiaagreed to accept military aircraftcarrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.Trump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.His aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.While the White House has played down such concerns, avast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring– when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.But his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according tothe Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardianreportedthat European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that EuropeanNatomembers were serious about Arctic security.Fewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, apollpublished on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.Much of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGreenlandTrump tariffsNetherlandsDenmarkNorwaySwedennewsShareReuse this content"

All EU international trade deals are conducted centrally through Brussels, as was the case last summer.The EU-US trade deal was agreed under considerable pressure from Trump at his Scottish golf course last July. However, while it has entered into force in the US, the 0% tariffs promised to the US have yet to be legally ratified in the EU.“The EPP is in favour of the EU-US trade deal, but given Donald Trump’s threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,” said Manfred Weber, the leader of the EPP. “The 0% tariffs on US products must be put on hold.”Kathleen Van Brempt, vice-president for trade for the S&Ds, said there could be “no trade deal under [the] given circumstances”.Later on Saturday, the liberal voting bloc Renew said it would join attempts to halt the ratification of the US trade deal.TheUK’s trade deal, as it was described last May, is already in force, but applies to a limited number of products – cars, beef, aerospace, ethanol and steel – with a 10% tariff deal on other exports ranging from salmon to bone china.Keir Starmer says Trump’s threat to impose tariffs over Greenland ‘completely wrong’Read moreBoth the EU and the UK are in the middle of sensitive negotiations to reduce tariffs Trump has already imposed, particularly on steel, which are rated at 25% for British exports and 50% for EU products.The latest threat will be seen as another attempt by a man – sometimes ally, sometimes adversary – desperate to win an argument, using one of his favourite weapons. It will also be seen as an attempt to divide Europe and quash their opposition to hisGreenlandtakeover ambition.Saturday’s threat underlines the unstable nature of any deal with Trump but also seems to have fired up the EU, which many have considered weak in the face of multiple episodes of bullying by the US.An emergency meeting of EU ambassadors is expected on Sunday.Late last year the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, warned there would be no deal on reducing steel tariffs unless the EU rolled back on tech laws. This is despite the EU and the US’s common interest in forming a club to fight cheaper Chinese imports.Trump threatens tariffs against those who oppose him taking GreenlandRead moreThe EU has consistently pushed back on any attempt to link tech with tariffs, and in particular to revise a€120m fine on Elon Musk’s X. It is unlikely to do anything other than issue a further statement on Saturday reiterating its right and strong intention to defend its sovereignty.Mikkel Runge Olesen, senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, said Trump’s latest threat was a sign that Europe’s opposition to his threat to takeover Greenland was working.“I think it is a reaction to the European troops going to Greenland, because if you look at the tariffs they match the countries who sent troops,” he told Sky News.“We are never going to see American troops on the ground in Greenland, this is a negotiating tactic.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandEuropeDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also told the Israeli foreign minister to contact the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.27-day-old baby becomes eighth to die of hypothermia in Gaza this winterRead moreThe group, described as the “greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled, at any time, any place” byDonald Trumpon Thursday, is meant to temporarily govern Gaza in place of Hamas.The board is part of Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war inGaza. Despite a ceasefire announced in October, Israel continues to kill Palestinians. At least 463 Palestinians have died in Gaza since the nominal truce was established.Israel also continues to restrict food and other forms of aid into the strip, with hunger prevailing in Gaza. Most of the population lives in substandard housing, with frayed tents providing little protection from the elements. Palestinians in Gaza have already died from hypothermia during particularly harsh cold snaps this winter.The exact makeup of the board of peace is still unclear, but two separate governing boards have been announced.The “founding executive board” will focus on investment and foreign relations, while the “Gaza executive board” will oversee another group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), which will oversee day-to-day affairs in Gaza.Rubio is on the seven-member founding executive board, along with the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-lawJared Kushner, and Tony Blair, with Trump as its chair.Blair thanked Trump for the appointment and said that the NCAG was a “massive step forward”.Trump appoints Blair, Kushner and Rubio to Gaza ‘board of peace’Read more“It gives hope to people in Gaza that they can have a future different from the past, and to the Israelis that they may have a neighbour which does not threaten its security,” Blair said in a statement.There was no word as to whether all the invitees had accepted their invitations to join the board of peace, with Sisi and Erdoğan not confirming their appointment.The US-drafted ceasefire plan for Gaza moved into its second phase this week, which includes several thorny issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas, reconstruction and the deployment of an international security force.Hamas has not yet committed to disarm, and the makeup of an international security force is still unknown. Israel has in the past objected to Turkey playing a role in the force.The board of peace will be tasked with not only running the administration of Gaza, but also its reconstruction. Most of the strip was destroyed by Israeli bombs and bulldozers during its more than two-year war, which killed more than 71,000 Palestinians.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

With maternal and newborn care dismantled by fuel shortages, blocked medical supplies, mass displacement and relentless bombardment, relocating to overcrowded tent encampments has become the only remaining option.In the first months of 2025 there were 17,000 recorded births, a 41% drop from the same period in 2022.Winter storms kill five in Gaza amid desperate conditions in makeshift campsRead moreLife in Gaza remains precarious. A Unicef spokesperson, James Elder, said more than 100 children had been killed in the territory since the ceasefire came into force in October.While airstrikes and gunfire have slowed, they have not ceased. Recent storms have compounded the crisis, causing deaths and flooding in displacement camps already stretched beyond their limits.Strong winter winds caused walls to collapse on to flimsy tents for displaced Palestinians on Tuesday, killing at least four people.The Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday that another baby, aged one, died of hypothermia overnight.At least 464 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 1,280 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to the health ministry.Gaza war leads to 41% fall in births prompting allegations of reproductive violenceRead moreExplore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warMaternal mortalitynewsShareReuse this content"

The supreme leader railed against the US president,Donald Trump, whom he called a “criminal” for his support of demonstrations, and called for strict punishment of protesters.Khamenei said: “By God’s grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition.”Iranian authorities also released a compilation of footage on Saturday that purported to show armed individuals carrying guns and knives alongside regular protesters – evidence, they said, of foreign saboteurs.Another senior Iranian cleric demanded the execution of protesters, demanding that “armed hypocrites should be put to death”.He described protesters as “butlers” and “soldiers” of Israel and the US, vowing that neither country should “expect peace”.View image in fullscreenAhmad Khatami described protesters as ‘butlers’ and ‘soldiers’ of Israel and the US.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAKhatami, a member of the Guardian Council and a senior member of the Assembly of Experts, which appoints the supreme leader, is a hardline, influential cleric in Iran.The speech was in striking contrast to statements from Trump, this week, who appeared to postpone a military strike in Iran, telling reporters that Iranian authorities had agreed to halt the executions of protesters.On Friday night, Trump thanked Iran for stopping the execution of what he said was 800 protesters, though it was unclear where he was drawing those figures from.The Iranian state silenced protests with brutality. What now for Iran’s opposition?Read moreRights groups have said the repression of protesters is continuing, with more than 3,090 people killed in the unrest and nearly 4,000 more cases still waiting to be reviewed,according to the Human Rights Activists news agency. More than 22,100 people have been arrested in protests, leading to fears of mistreatment of detainees.The two-and-a-half weeks of protests started on 28 December when traders took to the streets in Tehran in response to a sudden dip in the value of the rial. Protests spread and demands expanded to include calls for an end to the country’s government, creating the most serious, and deadliest unrest the country has seen since the 1979 revolution.View image in fullscreenReza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah of Iran and a prominent opposition voice, at a press conference in Washington DC this week.Photograph: Ali Khaligh/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe brutal quashing of demonstrations by authorities, whichHuman Rights Watch said on Fridayincluded the “mass killings of protesters”, has largely driven people off the streets.With the immediate unrest addressed, authorities were making a public show of punishing those involved in the action, which they had styled as a foreign-backed plot to destabilise the country.Khatami, in his Friday sermon, claimed 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other places of worship had been damaged by protesters. He also said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulances, 71 fire trucks and 50 other emergency vehicles had been damaged.It was unclear what the fallout of the protest movement will be, or if it will reignite in the coming days. Iran continues to be cut off from the rest of the world, as authorities maintain the more than week-long internet shutdown.Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah of Iran who had become a prominent opposition voice during the protests, continued tocall for the overthrow of the governmenton Friday and urged Trump to intervene.“I believe the president is a man of his word,” Pahlavi said, adding that “regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight”.Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiProtestTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

What now for Iran’s opposition?Grieving, bruised and divided on the wisdom of foreign-backed revolt, how can the Iranian people achieve change?Patrick WintourDiplomatic editorSat 17 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareThe Japanese writer Haruki Murakami in his novel 1Q84 may have foreshadowed the great and indelible rift Iranian society is about to experience. “The ones who did it can always rationalize their actions and even forget what they did. They can turn away from things they don’t want to see. But the surviving victims can never forget. They can’t turn away. Their memories are passed on from parent to child. That’s what the world is, after all: an endless battle of contrasting memories.”Inside Iran, contrasting memories are already being brought into even sharper relief and made more traumatic by the blanket propaganda from Iran state TV portraying protesters as drug-crazed or pawns of a foreign power attracted to a violent terrorist culture reminiscent of Islamic State.But underlying this battle for narrative lies a wider political challenge for the opponents of the Iranian government inside and outside the country.View image in fullscreenIran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian (right), meets the chief of police, Ahmad-Reza Radan, in Tehran on 3 January.Photograph: Iranian Presidency/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockYet again the Iranian state, faced by a revolt, has resorted tooverwhelming repressionand state violence to silence. The initial promise by the reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, that he would listen to the voices of protest as the grievances were legitimate emerged to be hollow, or quickly superseded. The notion that reformist governments can or want to control the security apparatus, or suppress the prejudices of the supreme leader, have been dispelled.Arash Azizi, the author ofWhat Iranians Wantand a supporter of an Iranian Republic, says the scale of this repression is unprecedented. “The impact has been disastrous and numbing. We are still digesting it. We are talking about the most brutal actions by the Islamic Republic since the 1980s. The vast majority of Iranians do not remember anything like this. It’s now emerging that we almost all knew someone who was killed.”The necessity to reflect collectively on such a tragedy inside Iran is made more difficult by a weeklong blackout of communications. It leaves the opposition grieving, in disarray, and still bitterly divided over the wisdom of foreign-backed revolt and how change can be achieved.Some cling to the hope that Donald Trump and Sen Lindsey Graham will still make good on their promise to help the revolution and whatever help comes has only been postponed. Others accuse Trump of betrayal and of offering false hope, urging the protesters on to the streets only for them to be mown down. Trump clings to thethreadbare excusethat the regime has promised not to execute the protesters.3:05Reza Pahlavi: is the last shah's son a viable opposition leader for Iran? – video explainerThe inquest will be most intense around the role ofReza Pahlavi, the 65-year-old exiled son of the former shah of Iran. Even anti-monarchists admit chants for the return of the shah have featured strongly, even if they differ on the depth of that support and its meaning. In the words of Mehrdad Khamenei, writing on the news website Akhbar Rooz, “it is a paradox of the opposition that, unable to produce liberation, [it] has taken refuge in the reproduction of the past”.Rouzbeh Parsi, an adjunct lecturer at Sweden’s Lund University, says Pahlavi is for many Iranians born after the shah’s repressive rule little more than a convenient blank page. “The calls for the return of a monarch is a sign of desperation on the part of some protesters, who under the repression of the Islamic Republic have not been able to coalesce around any single political figure inside the country.”One of the striking aspects of Pahlavi is that in interview he is unfailingly polite, cautious to the point of robotic, and seemingly unexceptional in his stated centrist ambitions to help bring about a modern Iran, ideally through a referendum. He has three daughters raised in the west, of which the oldest, Noor, cultivates her Instagram accounts with 1.3 million followers, balancing images of her luxurious modern lifestyle with articulate calls for her father to be given the chance to restore Iran’s freedom.View image in fullscreenReza Pahlavi (right) with his family, including his father, the shah of Iran, and mother, Farah Pahlavi, in April 1979.Photograph: Jayne Kamin/APIn interview, Pahlavi avoids criticising his father’s rule, which was brought to an end by the revolution of 1979. Pressed, he says his father took on too much responsibility, but that Iran was on course to become South Korea, instead of resembling North Korea.In contrast, some of Pahlavi’s closest supporters appear to be, online at least, intolerant, rightwing and vengeful. After half a century of bloodshed and sacrifice, perhaps that is not surprising. Iranian exiles are inevitably deeply invested one way or another and Pahlavi has come to personify all that remains unresolved about Iran if the current regime was to collapse.Azizi, a long-term opponent of a return to monarchy, argues that Pahlavi and his advisers have a lot to explain. He said: “He now faces a huge credibility challenge. He asked people to come out and they did, but he did not seem to have a plan to follow through. He called for strikes that did not take place. He repeatedly promised intervention by Trump but not only did it not come, Trump refused to meet him and openly cast doubt on his chances even if he said some nice things about him personally.”Pahlavi had also courted the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting Israel in 2023, but now Israeli officials are briefing on Netanyahu’s scepticism about Pahlavi’s credentials and leadership skills.9:37What are we hearing from inside Iran? | The LatestThe tensions over Israel’s refusal to intervene is apparent among some of his closest advisers such as Saeed Ghasseminejad. On 15 January, he wrote on X: “If Israel remains on the sidelines while the massacre and execution of Iranians continues, it will shape Iranians’ perception of the Jewish state for generations. However, if Israel acts on the explicit promise Prime Minister Netanyahu made weeks ago and helps Iranians bring down the regime, a new era of Israeli-Iranian alliance under the ‘Cyrus Accords’ framework [a proposed peace agreement] will emerge, one where the sky’s the limit for economic, security, and military partnership. The regime’s back is to the wall, the decision is Israel’s to make and it will define Bibi’s legacy.”Pahlavi’s allies seek vengeance, not just against the Iranian state but against those that called for negotiations with that state.View image in fullscreenWomen in the city of Holon, Israel, rally in support of the Iranian people and against the suppression of protest.Photograph: Yael Guisky Abas/Sopa Images/ShutterstockAmir Etemadi, another adviser, wrote: “The architects of the slaughter of the Iranian people are Khamenei, his underlings and his mercenaries; and their accomplices in crime are the apologists who, under the guise of analysts and journalists, whitewashed the reformist branch of the Islamic Republic time and again, enabling its greatest atrocities to unfold during the eras of Rouhani and Pezeshkian. You’re done for. Every last one of you – wherever you may be in the world.” Others promised that the “Reza boys” were coming to get the defenders of the regime.During the 1979 revolution, the many rivulets of opposition met to form one mighty river to overcome the shah. This time the tributaries inside and outside Iran remain separated.It has been a perennial problem since the late 90s. As the Iranian elite started to fracture, and protests grew, Pahlavi made several attempts to build opposition coalitions, including the National Council of Iran for Free Elections, launched in 2013. Most have struggled with internal disagreements. The diverse coalition formed at Georgetown University during the “women, life, freedom” movement in February 2023 rapidly fell apart. The Canada-based activist Hamed Esmaeilion, one of the six-strong council, without naming Pahlavi, wrote: “Imposing opinions is not democratic and the consensus of a group’s members, not just one member, is a precondition of a democratic movement.”Pahlavi’s critics also challenge his personal capacity to lead, saying he has been erratic about his envisaged role and the need for foreign intervention.Mostly Pahlavi describes himself as an honest broker, above the fray, promising to act with absolute neutrality to secure a transition. But at other times his aides appear to insist they alone can commandeer the protests and act as if Pahlavi aspires to be something of a ruling monarch on the model of his father.View image in fullscreenProtests in Barcelona in solidarity with the demonstrations in Iran on 13 January.Photograph: Marc Asensio/NurPhoto/ShutterstockPahlavi also faces criticism for urging Iranians on to the streets without a realistic plan. Insisting he was prepared to die for freedom, he declared: “All institutions and apparatuses that are responsible for the regime’s false propaganda and the severing of communications are considered legitimate targets.” The option of layered, non-violent resistance was spurned.Asked by CBS on 12 January whether he had to bear some responsibility for the deaths, he responded: “This is a war and war has casualties” – words that in isolation sound callous. Pahlavi’sclaimthat 50,000 members of the security services were primed to defect also proved optimistic. He revised the claim, saying: “Thousands of military and police forces did not go to work so as not to participate in the suppression.”Azizi hopes that with Pahlavi’s failures being more evident, “the moral authority ofthose inside Iranin prison such as Nobel prizewinner Narges Mohammadi and Mostafa Tajzadeh will grow”.Azizi claimed: “The so-called Republicans will now have the ball thrown at us in a way. It’s our turn to organise a serious, credible alternative to the regime, something we have consistently so far failed to do.”Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

All other Iranians would be allowed to access only the national internet: a domestic, parallel internet cut off from the broader world.Graphic showing internet use in Iran in JanuaryIran’s ongoing internet shutdown began on 8 January after 12 days of escalating anti-regime protests. Thousands of people have beenkilled, although the demonstrationsappear to have slowedunder the weight of a brutal crackdown.Only limited information is filtering out of the country because of the blackout, which is one of themost severe internet shutdowns in history, lasting longer than Egypt’s 2011 internet shutdown during the Tahrir square protests. A government spokespersonreportedly told Iranian mediathat the international internet would be shut off until at least Nowruz, the Persian new year, on 20 March.A former US state department official who worked on internet censorship said the idea that Iran might attempt a permanent break from the global internet was “plausible and terrifying”, but also costly.“It’s not out of the question that they’re going to do it, but seeing these situations unfold, the economic impact and the cultural impact will be really massive. And they may overplay their hand.”Rashidi said: “It looks like [authorities] are happy with the current level of internet connectivity, and they believe this kind of shutdown helped them to control the situation.”Iran’s current shutdown is the culmination of a 16-year effort to cement the regime’s control over the country’s internet. One side of this effort involves asophisticatedsystem to filter internet traffic, allowing a select few to access the global internet and blocking everyone else – a practice known as whitelisting.View image in fullscreenPeople shoping at a market in Tehran. Only limited information is filtering out of the country because of the internet blackout.Photograph: Getty ImagesThis whitelisting was probably enabled by technologyexportedby China, said researchers focused on Iran’s internet at Project Ainita and Outline Foundation, who asked not to be named owing to Iranian reprisals against digital rights researchers. This is made possible by high-capacity middleboxes, devices that attach to network cables to monitor and manipulate internet traffic. Systems commercially available now could be scaled up to allow authorities to inspect the internet traffic of entire countries – spying on individual users, as well as blocking websites, protocols, and certain VPN tools.“Basically, there’s this censorship equipment that is sitting on every network, and the government can prevent connections going in both directions,” they said.Map of Iran’s internet networkThe other side of this is Iran’s national internet, which can only be accessed inside the country. It allows all Iranians to use a handful of websites and applications purpose-built by the regime, including Iranianmessaging services, searchengines, navigation apps and avideo streaming servicesimilar to Netflix. It is monitored and has virtually no links to the broader internet.Iran has been working towards national internet since 2009, after authorities briefly shut down the internet during mass protests after the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and realised that a wholesale shutdown had extreme costs.“They literally just pulled the plug without thinking. They had never done it before,” said the researchers at Outline Foundation and Project Ainita. “And it basically threw the entire internet, and it really damaged a lot of things on their end as well.”View image in fullscreenThe Milad telecommunication tower in Tehran. Iran has been working towards national internet since 2009.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPABy 2012, the government hadestablishedthe Supreme Council of Cyberspace and started to plan for a splintered, domestic internet. Over time, authorities started to refine their internet shutdowns – blocking services such as Facebook, Twitter and Google during the 2012 protests, but leaving other economically valuable services running.In the 10 years that followed, Iranian authorities used a “carrot and stick” approach to force online businesses, banks and internet service providers to move their key infrastructure – datacentres and offices – inside the country, said the researchers at Project Ainita and Outline. Authorities provided tax breaks to those who did, and prevented those who refused from working in Iran.In 2015, a group of researchers used Bitcoin to buy serverspacein Iran and began to scan the country’s IP address space; the range of addresses allocated to devices on a network.They made a startling discovery: Iran was building a domestically connected internet entirely partitioned from the outside world, using the same protocols to connect the internal network for a corporate office or home.“It’s like when you’re in your office space, you’ve got file servers or you’ve got HR systems, which, if you go to a coffee shop, you’re not going to be able to reach them because it’s in an internal network. It’s impossible to route outwards,” said one of the researchers.Iran succeeded. The national internet has been working throughout the protests, and is now the only option most Iranians have to go online. It is likely to evolve, but it remains inaccessible to outside users, and unconnected to the broader internet.The former US state department official said the powers Iran had revealed in recent days, in terms of its ability to control the internet, were considerable; beyond those of some other authoritarian regimes who might wish to do the same.But it remains to be seen if Iran can create a new, permanent online reality. “The digital rights community is right to raise the alarm. But the impacts of this will be really severe for Iranian authorities, who will bear responsibility for that harm to their economy.”Explore more on these topicsIranInternetMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The industry lobbying group Tech UK met ministers at the rate of more than once every eight working days.X attended 13 meetings, a small proportion of the overall number, but still more than the child safety campaign group the NSPCC or the Molly Rose Foundation, founded by the family of 14-year-old Molly Russell who killed herself after viewing harmful online content.“The frequency of meetings between government and big tech and their advocates is astounding and points to the incredible power imbalance at stake when it comes to protecting children online,” said Andy Burrows, the chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation.View image in fullscreenMolly Russell, two years before she died.Photograph: Family handout/PAThe government defended its position, saying “regular engagement with technology companies is vital to delivering economic growth and transforming public services”. Campaigners said the government should stop “bending the knee to US big tech companies” and that the figures revealed an “incredible power imbalance” when it came to protecting children online.There has been growing controversy over X’s Grok AI tool, and aresurgencein the campaign for the government to follow Australia and ban social media for under-16s, which is opposed by tech companies. In the UK, 84% of peopleare concernedministers will prioritise tech company partnerships over the public interest when it comes to AI regulation.Dame Chi Onwurah, the Labour chair of the science and technology select committee, said the findings underscored “the reality that these firms have turnovers larger than the GDP of many countries, and their ability to influence stands in stark contrast to that of their users, our constituents, or those campaigning to make the internet safer”.She said it was “crucial for big tech to be accountable to parliament – something that the disturbing recent news about ‘nudification’ tools has only underlined further”.View image in fullscreenChi Onwurah MP said it was crucial that big tech was accountable to parliament.Photograph: Richard Gardner/Rex/ShutterstockThe technology companies and their lobbyists attended at least 639 meetings with ministers compared with just 75 meetings attended by the organisations and campaigners fighting for greater protections for children online, such as the NSPCC.The tech firms’ access was also more than three times greater than that of organisations and campaigners seeking to protect creatives’ copyrighted works from being mined to build AI models, a development that figures including Elton John and Kazuo Ishiguro have said risks giving away artists’ “lifeblood”.Ed Newton-Rex, a campaigner for creators’ rights, called the figures “shocking” and said they explained why ministers had launched their consultation on AI and copyright “with a ‘preferred option’ that read like a wishlist from big tech”.“It is imperative that the government stop bending the knee to US big tech companies – which, as the recent Grok debacle has shown, don’t have the interests of the British people at heart,” he said.View image in fullscreenA van drives through Westminster bearing a billboard organised by the corporate accountability group Eko urging the prime minister to shut down X and Grok.Photograph: Maja Smiejkowska/ReutersRecords of more than 11,000 meetings under both Labour and the Conservatives show there were almost 160 meetings with technology companies, more than 100 with organisations lobbying for protections over AI and copyright, and 25 with those involved in child safety.The US and Canadian AI start ups Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere together had 27 meetings with ministers. Last summer they each signed memorandums of understanding with the UK government which included exploring using AI more in public services.A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) spokesperson said regular engagement with tech companies was essential to ensure safe deployment of their technology in the UK.“These meetings cover a wide range of issues – from investment and innovation to implementing our recent laws for a safer online world,” they said. “DSIT ministers also routinely meet with campaign and civil society groups. As her actions on online safety this week have shown, the science and tech secretary [Liz Kendall] is always prepared to stand up and uphold the law and British values.”Keir Starmer tells MPs he is open to social media ban for young peopleRead moreJulian David, the chief executive of Tech UK, said that given its central role in so many aspects of the economy and society, “it is normal that the technology sector engages regularly and broadly with government”.Google said it worked closely with the government to ensure it had “a positive and safe impact in the UK through our investments in communities, digital skills training, new AI products and enhanced product design – including age assurance and compliance with the Online Safety Act”.Lady Beeban Kidron, who campaigns on child safety and copyright as a cross-bench peer, said: “Successive governments’ naivety in relation to tech lobbying is disturbing. This privileged access is mirrored in their policy, and tech industry talking points are parotted by officials. This capture creates harm.“In opposition, Labour promised safety for women and children, and to protect the creative industries, but in government they have refused to take necessary actions on both. It is not wrong to meet with tech companies, but these numbers tell us all we need to know. A government of a sovereign state has a duty to its own citizens, not to the tech bros.”Explore more on these topicsLobbyingTechnology policyGoogleMetaAmazonXAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

Rotheram and Burnham said they had both seen “devastating incidents” in their regions and would never support anything that compromised national security.In a joint statement posted on X, the mayors said: “An important part of strengthening the country’s defences is establishing the truth at the earliest opportunity when things go wrong and that is why, if drafted correctly, the Hillsborough Law could create a culture in all public services where that is the norm.“As it stands, we believe the government’s amendment in relation to the security services creates too broad an opt-out and risks undermining the spirit of the legislation.Labour MPs could rebel over Hillsborough law after talks with families break downRead more“We appreciate that the government has made huge strides in working to deliver the Hillsborough Law and are grateful for their willingness to work with campaigners thus far to make it the strongest law possible.“It is in that spirit that we call on them to withdraw their amendment ahead of Monday’s debate and work with the families and the Hillsborough Law Now campaign to find a solution acceptable to all sides.”Calls for aHillsboroughlaw began in 2016 after a second inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans – later becoming 97 – at the Hillsborough football ground in South Yorkshire during a 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.The club’s supporters were crushed and trampled due to negligent crowd control by South Yorkshire police, in what remains the worst sporting disaster in British history.The deaths, and 766 injuries, were compounded when theLiverpoolfans were improperly blamed for the disaster after false reports of hooliganism were fed to the press by the force.Elkan Abrahamson, a lawyer for the Hillsborough Law Now campaign, said the amendments allowed the heads of the security services to make “whatever decision they want” on whether to disclose information and left them “unchallengeable”.He said it should be up to the head of an inquiry to decide whether information was relevant, adding there were already national security exemptions that allowed evidence to be heard in private.Liverpool West Derby MP, Ian Byrne, has also tabled several amendments of his own that would mean duty of candour applies not only to intelligence organisations but also to people who work for them.On Thursday night, he said he could not back the bill in its current form. “I am absolutely gutted writing this,” Byrne said, “but we need to be clear about what is happening.“I made a commitment to deliver the Hillsborough law without exemptions, without loopholes, and without carve-outs … if the government’s amendments are passed then this legislation, in its current form, is not that.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterUK security and counter-terrorismManchesterLiverpool (UK news)Andy BurnhamSteve RotheramLiverpool (Football)newsShareReuse this content"

He has now been charged with a further 15 offences that pre-date those for which he was convicted, relating to possession of indecent images of children and acts of outraging public decency.The new charges relate to incidents which did not take place in the same location as his previous crimes. They include nine counts of taking an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child, including the most severe category, and six counts of acts of outraging public decency. The charges relate to nine girls.Chan, from Finchley, is in custody awaiting sentencing for his earlier convictions. These included five sexual assaults by penetration of a child aged between two and four years, four sexual assaults, 11 counts of taking indecent photos, and six of making indecent images of children.The police investigation is ongoing.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The £7 chicken satay ready meal and £2 coconut water shot “H₅O”, it says, are ideal for people “reducing their food intake”. Meanwhile, the Co-op is plugging “mini meals” – 250g-280g pots “inspired by global cuisines” costing £3.50 a go.About 6% of UK adults are thought to be taking GLP-1 drugs, said Jonny Forsyth, a senior analyst at the market research company Mintel. However, he argues the hype around them is having an “outsize influence” on consumer behaviour and amplifying other diet trends, such as eating high protein foods.View image in fullscreenOcado’s Turf & Clover small extra lean steak.Photograph: Ocado/PAIn the recent flurry of Christmas trading updates, some big high street names said the drugs were starting to change how people shopped. This included eating fewer sausage rolls, and Roisin Currie, the Greggs chief executive, commented that people were looking for “smaller portions” and healthier options.Sainsbury’s has also spotted new behaviour. “For customers using these products, we’re seeing more of that switch into healthier choices, into fresh food, into fibre,” said its chief executive, Simon Roberts. This month the grocer introduced more low-calorie and high-protein ready meals. The 300g “Small but Mighty” range includes dishes such as teriyaki chicken and costs £3.Ken Murphy, theTescochief executive, said the supermarket was watching “very closely” how the GLP-1 trend was developing.Indeed, while total UK grocery sales rose 2.5% in value terms over the four weeks to 27 December, the amount of food and drink sold declined 0.2% on a volume basis, according to the market researcher NielsenIQ.For food and hospitality businesses the fear is that the widespread uptake of these drugs could put a dent in profits. A2024 Cornell Universitystudy found households with at least one GLP-1 user cut their grocery spend by 5.3% within six months, while for higher-income households it was 8.2%.Although there were declines in most food categories over the period studied, in some areas they were marked, with savoury snacks such as crisps down 10.1% and an 8% drop in spending at fast-food chains and coffee shops. In the US almost 20% of adults are taking weight-loss drugs.However, can supermarkets turn small portions into a virtue, given consumers are fed up withshrinkflation(where shoppers get less product for the same or higher price)? There is also a question mark over whether people want ranges with “GLP-1” stamped on the front as they may not be open about the fact they are using medication.The Morrisons “GLP-1 friendly” own-label ready meals, which include a chicken casserole, weigh just 280g but cost the same as dishes in its other diet ranges. The £3.75 price is fairly typical in ready meals, but if one compares the price per kilo it is a different story,said Charlotte Derra, fast-moving consumer goods category consultant.“Morrisons Counted and Protein ranges are the same price for typically 380g v the 280g GLP-1 friendly range,” she said. “At £0.99 v £1.34 per 100g for the GLP-1 friendly ranges this is at a 35% price premium.” The M&S Nutrient Dense ready meals come in 400g packs and cost £7 (£1.75/100g), which she said was within typical ready meal pack sizes.M&S, Co-op and Iceland have “rightly” avoided explicitly mentioning GLP-1 drugs on the front of packs, Forsyth said. “This is smart marketing because we know from our data that if you group people into a club, such as Weight Watchers, where people feel there is a stigma attached to belonging, you restrict your potential audience.”The M&S range is the “most likely to do well because its user base are among the minority of Brits who can afford to pay for these drugs privately” added Forsyth, who found it “bizarre” that Greggs had said the drugs were hitting sales. “I suspect it has more to do with people cutting back on discretionary food spend in response to much higher food prices since 2022. Even Greggs’ iconicsausage roll has soared in priceby 30%,” he said.The GLP-1 ready meals in Morrisons mean it is now sells four healthy chicken tikka masala dishes. However, in a cutthroat UK grocery market worth £250bn a year, food market product developers are under pressure to react, given the outlook for some food categories is “pretty bleak”, said Mark Whalley, a co-founder of the video insights company Explners.“UK supermarket retail is dominated by everybody worrying that the other guys are on to something,” he said. The hard part will be convincing shoppers: “Being small is in itself a benefit. That’s what they’re effectively saying when the price doesn’t go down with the portion size.“It’s just whether there’s an actual need for these products, or whether people could just eat a little bit less of the products that they already buy. Does it specifically need a new product, an extra thing on shelf that’s just 100g smaller?”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industrySupermarketsWeight-loss drugsRetail industryMarks & SpencerMorrisonsAsdanewsShareReuse this content"

Fresh from their anger at the unveiling of Laila Cunningham as Reform’s London mayoral candidate, Zahawi’s recruitment was cast by some of the same vaccine sceptics as another example of a “Muslim takeover” of Nigel Farage’s party.Its head of policy, Zia Yusuf, has long been a target of racist ire from some Reform members and critics of the party on the right.“Another ex-Tory and another Muslim and another that pushed the vaccine, sorry to say but Reform are losing my support rapidly,” posted one member on a private Reform Facebook group, in response to Zahawi’s defection.The comment, on a group with 135,000 members including key figures in the party, was just one of many in a similar vein across it and other online spaces used by Reform members.“Doesn’t fill me with confidence, the vaccine deployment guy, a man who advocated for an amnesty on illegal migrants,” added another.Another added: “yes gonna be loads of us thinking same Especially us with badly disabled son caused by jib [sic] pushed by him.”While Farage initially provided qualified support for vaccines during the pandemic, he later shifted to a more sceptical view, and then towards hostility to the WorldHealthOrganization.He wasaccused of “flirting with vaccine conspiracy”after falsely saying earlier this month that people were being told they needed to keep having Covid vaccinations every six months.Other senior figures, such as Richard Tice, have long raised doubts about the safety and necessity of the vaccine. Last month,it emergedthat a third of Reform’s council leaders across the country have expressed vaccine-sceptic views, openly questioning public health measures that keep millions safe.But such views in the party reached a nadir when a controversial doctor was given top billing at the Reform party conference and usedhis speechto claim the Covid vaccine caused cancer in members of the royal family.The speech was delivered by Aseem Malhotra, a British cardiologist who was appointed as a senior adviser to the US health secretary and vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy, and who was described by Reform’s chair, David Bull, as someone who had helped write the party’s health policy.The issue may continue to be the source of rifts in the party. Among 20 councillors who defected to the party last week – mainly from the Tories – was Dr Chandra Kanneganti, a former chair of the British International Doctors Association who has held policy leads at the British Medical Association and other respected health bodies.While he cited the cost of living, immigration and pressure on public services as the reasons for his defection, Kanneganti said he would also be seeking to share his experience when it came to developing Reform’s health policies and that he disagreed with the views expressed by figures such as Malhotra.“I have a national expertise on this and I will hopefully be involved in the discussions,” said Kanneganti, whowas at the forefrontof urging the public to get vaccinated and has spoken about how the pandemic exposed ethnic inequalities.“I have only just joined but I will hopefully be able to express my views and guide a policy that is actually evidence based,” he told the Guardian. “It’s about following the evidence, while at the same time not forcing people to accept something they disagree with.“Social media has a lot of false information on it but all the scientific evidence shows that getting vaccinated is much, much safer than not getting vaccinated; it’s about getting that point across.”As for Zahawi, he refused several times this week to say if he had been given any assurances on Reform’s position on vaccines before joining, but he did say: “I would not be sitting here, nor would Nigel be sitting next to me, if we didn’t agree we did the right thing to get the vaccine programme to the nation.”Bull, however, was more measured when he came under pressure in an interview last week on Talk TV from callers angry at Zahawi’s defection and his vaccines role.One man said he and his wife felt let down and no explanation would secure their vote or that of many of their friends.Bull replied: “Remember, Nadhim doesn’t have a formal role. He has just joined us. Nigel, Richard and I have not changed out stance on compulsory vaccines.”Explore more on these topicsNadhim ZahawiReform UKVaccines and immunisationCoronavirusHealth policyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump insists the report is inaccurate and says no such offer was ever made.JP Morgan boss says Trump attacks on Federal Reserve could push up inflationRead moreThe president also reiterated his claim that JPMorgan Chase – the largest US bank – improperly cut off his banking access after the January 6 Capitol attack, without providing evidence. He also did not provide evidence for his often-repeated false claim that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against him.“I’ll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting – The Election was RIGGED!” he wrote.Trump has alleged that several banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, refused to accept his deposits following the events of 6 January 2021. Both institutions have strongly rejected those accusations.In a statement, Dimon clarified that “there was no job offer” and said he thought things were now being handled “better than I could have” done.A separate statement from JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Trish Wexler said: “Serving more than 80 million Americans is our privilege, and we agree that no one’s account should ever be closed because of political or religious beliefs. We appreciate that this administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts.”Last week, Dimontold reportersthat Trump’s attacks on the US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, are putting central bank independence at risk and could backfire and ultimately push up interest rates and inflation.Trumprespondedby defending his campaign against Powell, saying: “I think it’s fine what I’m doing. And we have a bad Fed person.”When asked about the comments by Dimon, who warned against chipping away at the Fed’s independence, Trump said this week: “I think he’s wrong. We should have lower [interest] rates.Jamie Dimonprobably wants higher rates, maybe he makes more money that way.”Fed up: inside Trump’s unprecedented bid to exert control over the US central bankRead moreTrump and his administration have come under fire in recent days for their attacks on Powell, who is facing a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice over alleged “abuse of taxpayer dollars” linked to renovations to the central bank’s headquarters in Washington.Powell has claimed the Fed is being targeted for not agreeing to Trump’s demands for lower interest rates. The president has claimed he was not aware of the investigation before it emerged last weekend.Trump also took further shots at the Wall Street Journal on Saturday, stating the paper “ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE”.Last year, Trumpfiled a lawsuitseeking $10bn damages against Rupert Murdoch, the Journal’s owner, along with two Journal newspaper reporters for libel and slander over claims that he sent the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein a lewd letter and sketch of a naked woman.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJP MorganJamie DimonFederal ReserveTrump administrationUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

Typically, the guidelines are released within six months of the secretaries receiving the dietary guidelines advisory committee’s report,” which should have meant they were released over the summer.Tortilla, broccoli, ‘a piece of chicken’: US agriculture secretary mocked for ‘money-saving’ mealRead moreAnderson said she was pleased to see that some things appeared to be in line with the DGA committee’s report, including an emphasis on eating “real food”, decreasing the amount of processed food in the diet, and decreasing added sugars. But she “grew concerned” when she saw the visual of the food pyramid with images of steak and cheese higher, larger and overall much more prominent than images of plant-based proteins like nuts. This visual contradicts the written guidelines on saturated fats.“I think it will be a challenge to keep saturated fat intake within 10% of overall kilocalories. Now, that, to me, is a confusing message for the American public,” Anderson said.Chloë Waterman – a senior program manager at Friends of the Earth who focuses on school lunches as well as the connection between diet and the environment – also said that the guidelines are contradictory and lack clarity. She suspects the confusion stems from an attempt to “please all stakeholders” – both public health experts and the Maha movement.Waterman said the guidelines are unclear because of the contradiction between the text and the visuals and also because “previous iterations of the guidelines were hundreds of pages long, and these guidelines are 10 pages. So, there’s only so much clarity you can fit into 10 pages.”Increased meat consumption would negatively impact the environment as well, Waterman added.“Americans already eat more protein than is recommended, and we’re one of the highest meat-consuming countries in the world. That level of meat consumption has a disastrous impact on the planet, because industrial animal agriculture is extremely resource intensive,” Waterman said.“When we are getting our calories from animal products, we are getting along with that a bunch of deforestation,” to create space to grow animal feed, as well as “emissions from the animals themselves. Beef and lamb especially have really high methane emissions,” Waterman added. Methaneemanates from the poop, burps and farts of cowsand other animals, and is 80times more potent than carbon dioxide.If Americans would consume more plant-based foods and proteins and less meat, Waterman said it would accomplish two goals at once.“We’re fortunate that those things actually align with each other, that if we shift our diets toward more plant-based foods, that’s going to be better for the environment and for health,” she said, noting that the new guidelines move in the opposite direction.It’s unclear how big an impact the guidelines will have on US adults’ behavior. Waterman said Americans have tended to ignore past iterations of the DGA that encourage more fruit and vegetable consumption, but “this could be different in the sense that people want to eat more meat and dairy”.Waterman is most concerned about how the guidelines will affect school lunches, as children who consume them don’t have control over whether to follow the guidelines or not. She said that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) must create rules to bring school lunches in compliance with the DGA. However, that process can take years, and Waterman imagines that it would be difficult to increase the amount of meat in school lunches, which are already “dominated by animal products” without also going above the 10% calories from saturated fat limit.If the USDA does somehow interpret the guidelines so that school lunches contain even more meat, “we’re going to see a devastating increase in diet-related chronic diseases for children,” like diabetes and metabolic syndrome, Waterman said. Kennedy has said that fighting childhood obesity is a major component of his Maha initiative. But, Waterman continued: “Promoting full-fat dairy and red meat, as depicted in the food pyramid, is going to have the opposite effect on childhood obesity as Kennedy intends.”Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrHealthTrump administrationUS politicsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

So, I don’t know. That’s going to be for some economists to tell and also – and I’ll be involved in that decision too. But they have a very big market share.”The next day, Paramount Skydancelauncheda $108.4bn hostile takeover bid, financially backed by its chief executive officer, David Ellison, and his father, the billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison. Both men are friendly with the Trump administration.The Netflix-WBD deal hasfaced backlashfrom US politicians, with US senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts calling it “an anti-monopoly nightmare” in a statement shortly after the announcement.The deal, which would bring shows such as Game of Thrones into Netflix’s streaming library, was also criticized by the Writers Guild of America, which said it would “would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers”.Trump bought about $100m in municipal and corporate bonds from mid-November to late December, Friday’s financial disclosure showed. He previously bought more than $100m in company, state and municipal bonds during the first six months of his second term, including bonds in Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.The White House did not immediately respond to questions from the Guardian. However, an unnamed administration official reportedlytoldthe Washington Post that Trump’s “stock and bond portfolio is independently managed by third-party financial institutions”.The official reportedly added: “Neither President Trump nor any member of his family has any ability to direct, influence, or provide input regarding how the portfolio is invested or when investments are bought or sold.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpWarner BrosNetflixEthicsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

As a child, Chasing Horse had acted in the 1990 Oscar-winning movie Dances with Wolves. As an adult, he traveled North America performing healing ceremonies.In 2005, Leone, then a mother of a seven-year old daughter, attended a ritual in which Chasing Horse said he was connecting with ancestral spirits. “It was like he turned the lights on in a dark room,” Leone said. “It all just felt like I belonged. He had this ability to charm you.”Eventually, after becoming part of Chasing Horse’s group, the Circle, attending healing ceremonies and surviving cancer, Leone started to see him as a messianic figure.“He could say, ask or do anything, and there was no wrong,” Leone said.And that was where it all went bad.The belief that Chasing Horse had healing powers made it easy for him to sexually abuse minors, including Leone’s daughter, according to a criminal indictment. Chasing Horse now faces 21 charges, including sexual assault, sexual assault with a minor, first-degree kidnapping of a minor and the use of a minor in producing pornography.He has pleaded not guilty, and his trial started last Tuesday inLas Vegas, throwing light on a shocking case of what seems to have operated like a cult and also on the often under-reported area of sexual or violent exploitation of Native American women.Leone and others say the indictment is about more than Chasing Horse facing justice for his alleged sexual abuse. They see his behavior, including also allegedly sexually abusing and manipulating adults, as part of a larger problem of people in his position taking advantage of those they offer to heal – and of police not doing enough to stop them.“This is about medicine people, and all Indian country, exploiting their people under the guise of spirituality,” Leone said. “That must end.”In Dances with Wolves Chasing Horse starred as a character named Smiles a Lot and made a “noticeable cameo”, theNew York Timesreported. “The beautiful Indian child Smiles a Lot … comes of age during the film through his first tomahawk murder,” the newspaper wrote.As an adult, Chasing Horse spoke atpowwowsaround the country.At a 2013Fort Mojave tribegathering, Chasing Horse shared how doctors diagnosed his mother with terminal throat cancer and told the family to “prepare because she’s not going to be here very long”.But they held a ceremony, during which a messenger told her she would live. When she returned to the “white doctors” in New York, tests showed she was cancer-free, Chasing Horse said.He then explained how a ceremonial whistle’s healing powers worked.“The purpose of blowing this whistle is you’re going to give a part of your life to that person you’re blowing for, so be sure that you mean it because your life will be shortened a few years,” Chasing Horse said. “If you don’t do it from your heart, maybe they’ll take your whole life. That’s the exchange.”Chasing Horse frequently instilled that sort of fear in his followers, said Fernando Trujillo, who from 2006 until 2014 was part of the Circle, which at its peak had about 300 members, theAssociated Pressreported.Chasing Horse asked Trujillo to travel with his crew after a ceremony because he learned Trujillo could sing.“I felt honored to know somebody like that,” Trujillo said.But he started to see how Chasing Horse womanized and convinced people to give him their money.“Let’s say you need help in some way, and the doctors ain’t trying to do much for you, you might say, ‘Hey, I think I want to go to a healer,’” said Trujillo. Chasing Horse “was able to manipulate a lot of people” by portraying himself as “the ultimate of medicine people or somebody with a spiritual connection that others didn’t have”.When Leone was diagnosed with cancer in 2013, her 14-year-old daughter, Ren Leone-LaCroix, traveled to Las Vegas to ask Chasing Horse for help, according to court records. She prepared a meal and a pipe for him. He then took her into his bedroom closet, where he told her it was “a life for a life and explained that it meant taking her first born and her virginity”, records state.Chasing Horse allegedly raped her and then took her on the road with him, where he raped her every night, she toldABC News.Leone also survived cancer three times.“He was saving people’s lives,” Leone said she believed at the time.He allegedly continued to sexually abuse Leone-LaCroix for years.In 2015, leaders of the Fort Peck tribe in Montana banned Chasing Horse from holding ceremonies on their reservation because of alleged human trafficking, drug dealing, spiritual abuse and intimidation of tribal members,IndiJ Public Media, an Indigenous news organization, reported.“Lilda Christian, another supporter of Chasing Horse, said [she was] to seek out the actor because there are no legitimate medicine men around the reservation and the local ones have served time in prison for sex crimes,”IndiJ Public Mediareported in 2015.More than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence and more than half have experienced sexual violence, according to a 2016National Institute of Justicestudy.Chasing Horse is “not a one-off”, said Crystal Lee, CEO and founder of the organization United Natives, which offers services to victims of sexual abuse. Since 2024, purported medicine men among theSaskatchewan Cree; theOjibway-Anishinaabeg; and theUte Mountain Utehave all been convicted of sexual assault.“It’s a big elephant in the room of holding our Native men accountable for being perpetrators among our own women, children and family community,” Lee said.At 16, the age of consent inNevada, Leone-LaCroix told her mom she wanted to become one of Chasing Horse’s spiritual wives.Chasing Horse told Leone nothing had happened between them and that they were asking her permission, she said.Leone told ABC News that she “looked at it as an honor” and that “when she told me that she loved him, that was enough”.She said she had not been aware that he had allegedly previously raped her daughter and threatened her that if she said anything, her mother would die. She also did not learn until later that after Leone-LaCroix became one of his wives, he allegedly regularly beat her.However, Leone had heard other allegations.“He would always have evidence to justify that what the victims were saying was not true,” Leone recalled. “I’m not ignorant, but the brainwashing and the spiritual manipulation he uses to control each one of us in there. I didn’t understand what happened to me.”Trujillo said he left the Circle when he learned that Chasing Horse had sexually abused a girl, who had become like a niece to Trujillo.He wanted to leave before 2014, but Chasing Horse would “fearmonger that if you left his Circle, your family would die”, Trujillo said.In 2023, eight years after the Fort Peck tribal leaders banished Chasing Horse, Las Vegas police arrested him at the home he shared with five wives.TheAssociated Pressreported that Chasing Horse told his wives to “shoot it out” with police officers if they ever tried to “break their family apart”. Police also found video of him having sex with a minor and sexual photos of a young girl, according to court records.Chasing Horse also faces sexual exploitation and assault chargesin Canada.A Nevada judgedismissed the casestemming from the 2023 arrest because of the prosecution’s “improper instruction to the grand jury”, But a grand juryagain indictedhim in 2024.The prosecuting and defense attorneys did not respond to the Guardian’s interview requests.Despite the earlier dismissal, Leone said she was “100% confident” he will be convicted.She also remains cancer-free – but now realizes it wasn’t because of Chasing Horse.When Leone’s daughter left Chasing Horse and told her she had been raped, she said: “But mom, this is the reason why you’re not sick.”Leone told her: “I am not giving Nathan the power over my wellness or my sickness.”Explore more on these topicsNative AmericansNevadaLas VegasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The outlet said it had not retracted the story, made no apology and had not made any cash payment to LaCivita.The lawsuit alleged the Daily Beast fabricated claims about his campaign compensation and deliberately damaged his professional reputation in its reporting about millions of dollars LaCivita’s company received from the Trump campaign.US House candidate buys nazis.us domain to redirect visitors to homeland securityRead moreLaCivita said the Daily Beast’s reporting had created a “false impression that he was personally profiting excessively” and prioritized personal gain over campaign success. The lawsuit did not specify damages sought but said: “It is estimated that it would cost millions of dollars to repair Mr LaCivita’s reputation.”Despite that bullishness, the lawsuit will no longer go ahead. It represents quite a turnaround from LaCivita, who last Marchsaid of the legal action, “Fuck around and Find Out,” and claimed: “I’m really looking forward to making my case in front of a jury.”The lawsuit centered on a series of reports from the Daily Beast which suggested LaCivita had “raked in” huge payments, including a piece by the journalist Michael Isikoff that was headlined “Trump in Cash Crisis – As Campaign Chief’s $22m Pay Revealed”.LaCivita said the reporting harmed his personal reputation. The lawsuit claimed the multimillion-dollar figure represented gross campaign advertising expenditures, not personal income.After initial correction demands from LaCivita’s legal team, the Daily Beast modified its reporting, reducing the claimed compensation to $19.2m and clarifying that funds went to LaCivita’s consulting firm. However, the lawsuit argues these changes did not adequately address the fundamental misrepresentation.LaCivita’s lawsuit against the Daily Beast was one front in a broader pattern of legal standoffs pitting Trump and those in his orbit against media organizations – often centering on defamation complaints. Trump and his allies have spent years resorting to litigation to challenge journalistic reporting they perceive to be hostile or inaccurate.As the Daily Beast noted, the Atlantic hadreportedin November 2024 that Trump furiously questioned LaCivita about the monetary figure the latter would eventually sue over while they were both on a campaign plane. Trump told LaCivita, “You should sue those bastards,” and would later teasingly refer to him as “my $22m man”, according to the Atlantic’s reporting.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDefamation lawDonald TrumpNewspapers & magazinesMedia lawUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has beendisputedby US allies, including Denmark.In the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato alliesdeploying troopsin Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister,respondedon social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee,wrotein more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”The tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.In response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said ina statementthat the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer,said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”Emmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote ina social media riposteto Trump.Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer,echoedthe warning about a potential “downward spiral”.“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson,added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, whowrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”Germany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.On Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt,suggestedthat Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bildrevealedbroad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.Even before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland andDenmarkon Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.1:01Greenland prime minister joins protests over Trump threats – videoHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he hadstruck a trade pact with the UK– and six months after he announced apact with the European Union.The UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.Trump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Faragewrote.There was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina,calledthe president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.The president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombiaagreed to accept military aircraftcarrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.Trump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.His aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.While the White House has played down such concerns, avast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring– when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.But his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according tothe Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardianreportedthat European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that EuropeanNatomembers were serious about Arctic security.Fewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, apollpublished on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.Much of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGreenlandTrump tariffsNetherlandsDenmarkNorwaySwedennewsShareReuse this content"

Trump insists the report is inaccurate and says no such offer was ever made.JP Morgan boss says Trump attacks on Federal Reserve could push up inflationRead moreThe president also reiterated his claim that JPMorgan Chase – the largest US bank – improperly cut off his banking access after the January 6 Capitol attack, without providing evidence. He also did not provide evidence for his often-repeated false claim that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against him.“I’ll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting – The Election was RIGGED!” he wrote.Trump has alleged that several banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, refused to accept his deposits following the events of 6 January 2021. Both institutions have strongly rejected those accusations.In a statement, Dimon clarified that “there was no job offer” and said he thought things were now being handled “better than I could have” done.A separate statement from JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Trish Wexler said: “Serving more than 80 million Americans is our privilege, and we agree that no one’s account should ever be closed because of political or religious beliefs. We appreciate that this administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts.”Last week, Dimontold reportersthat Trump’s attacks on the US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, are putting central bank independence at risk and could backfire and ultimately push up interest rates and inflation.Trumprespondedby defending his campaign against Powell, saying: “I think it’s fine what I’m doing. And we have a bad Fed person.”When asked about the comments by Dimon, who warned against chipping away at the Fed’s independence, Trump said this week: “I think he’s wrong. We should have lower [interest] rates.Jamie Dimonprobably wants higher rates, maybe he makes more money that way.”Fed up: inside Trump’s unprecedented bid to exert control over the US central bankRead moreTrump and his administration have come under fire in recent days for their attacks on Powell, who is facing a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice over alleged “abuse of taxpayer dollars” linked to renovations to the central bank’s headquarters in Washington.Powell has claimed the Fed is being targeted for not agreeing to Trump’s demands for lower interest rates. The president has claimed he was not aware of the investigation before it emerged last weekend.Trump also took further shots at the Wall Street Journal on Saturday, stating the paper “ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE”.Last year, Trumpfiled a lawsuitseeking $10bn damages against Rupert Murdoch, the Journal’s owner, along with two Journal newspaper reporters for libel and slander over claims that he sent the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein a lewd letter and sketch of a naked woman.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJP MorganJamie DimonFederal ReserveTrump administrationUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

(There’s also Alpha News, a conservative outlet that made headlines by publishing cell phone video taken by the ICE officer who killed Good.)While there are always debatesabout national and international journalists parachuting in to cover catastrophes, “I think people in Minneapolis are actually excited to see national coverage of this, because we know that we can’t stop what’s happening by ourselves,” Carlson said.He also predicted that Minneapolis will remain an epicenter of ICE activity and counter-protests, withDonald Trumprecently threatening to invoke the Insurrection Action and send troops to the city.“I would be very happy if the national news were able to leave because things have died down,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is not a case where things are dying down.”Here are some of the journalists and newsroom leaders who have participated in coverage.Omar Jimenez, anchor and correspondent, CNNJimenez, 32, came to the story last week with a lot of experience reporting in Minneapolis.In May 2020, Jimenez was arrested live on CNN while covering protests in the city following the murder of George Floyd, which occurred just blocks away from where Good was killed.While Jimenez’s team was quickly released, the incident made international headlines as an extraordinary incursion into the activities of journalists.Since then, Jimenez has returned to the city multiple times for reporting trips. He said his antenna is always up for stories involving Minneapolis. So he flew to Minnesota a few hours after the shooting, arriving on the evening of 7 January and driving straight from the airport to the spot where Good was shot.View image in fullscreenOmar Jimenez speaks on 16 November 2023 in New York.Photograph: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images“When it became clear that obviously this was going to be as big as it has become, that’s when a manager of mine kind of walked in and said, ‘Hey, are you able to go to Minnesota as soon as possible?’” (He was only delayed, he said, because he needed to go home and get warmer clothes after seeing the weather forecast in Minnesota.)During his reporting in Minneapolis last week, Jimenez said he met several people that he first encountered back in 2020.“It’s a little bit of a balance in the sense that you obviously don’t want to be the story,” he said. “But I do think what you want is to try and be able to convey an authentic space, especially when you have the luxury of a camera. Even though everyone is seeing what you’re seeing, they’re not feeling it. There is a little bit of a barrier still. And so that’s why it is a constant balance of: ‘how close do we want to get?’”Jimenezgot pretty close to the action on 8 January, when CNN viewers watched him and his crew running away from law enforcement agents who had moved aggressively toward protesters after someone threw a water bottle at them.While Jimenez is now back in New York City, he said: “I am not done with this story. I can tell you that.”Kathleen Hennessey, editor and senior vice-president, Minnesota Star TribuneA veteran of the Associated Press and the New York Times, Hennessey only took on the top editorial position at the newspaper (which was previously called the Minneapolis Star Tribune) last May. It’s fair to say that she’s been busy, considering the number of major stories that have happened in the state since then, including the June 2025 assassination of state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband.“It’s been maybe busier, newsier than I expected to some degree, but it’s also been really rewarding to be at a place that feels so needed,” she said.Hennessey’s newsroom of about 200 people has broken several major stories since the shooting, including being the first outlet to report the ICE officer’s name. That story drew a sharp rebuke from DHS press secretary Tricia McLaughlin,who called the outlet“reckless” and said it should “delete their story immediately” (it didn’t).Hennessey said the decision to name the shooter (Jonathan Ross) was “a very deliberate, much-discussed decision” – but she added that it “wasn’t a particularly tough call”.View image in fullscreenKathleen Hennessey welcomes people to the Minnesota Star Tribune’s inaugural North Star Summit in 2025.Photograph: Star Tribune/Getty ImagesShe said her news team had been “on edge and prepared and ready” for the Good story, considering the surge of deportation enforcement in recent weeks in the community.“By this time, we feel pretty well practiced in sort of the quick mobilization of an all-hands-on-deck moment,” she said. “And so this was another one of those, really. Just about everybody immediately ran to their stations and did what they do.”Considering how widely covered this story has been, “I encourage our newsroom to remember that nobody knows this place better than we do,” she said, “and nobody can be as close to the people involved, and be a more reliable source for people who actually live here.”Unsurprisingly, Hennessey said the Star Tribune’s website has received a very large number of online readers over the last week and a half – though it’s a bit harder to net paying subscribers.Going forward, she said she expects her newsroom to remain in overdrive covering the story. “It’s ongoing, it’s unfolding, and it feels very everywhere all at once,” she said. “At any given moment, there’s just a million videos popping up everywhere of incidents and encounters with ICE that feel newsworthy.”Alex Tabet, political reporter, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC)Tabet, who arrived in Minnesota at 1am on 7 January, made it to the scene of the shooting extremely quickly. He had already been tipped off by an ICE observer that there was an enforcement action going on in the neighborhood, and then got word that someone had been shot. It was his third reporting trip to Minnesota over the past month. “We were the first – at least – TV crew on the ground,” he said.Tabet’s first call was to his network’s editorial leaders and standards officials, telling them, “Hey, this is what we know, this is what we don’t know,” he said. “And we started vetting all of the information that we had to try to figure out what is appropriate to put on air, what should we hold off on, basically making sure we had hit the threshold of understanding what was going on.”View image in fullscreenAlex Tabet.Photograph: Courtesy of MS NOWTabet, who left Minnesota on Tuesday after almost a full week, said he’s “hoping to go back as soon as possible” – though he said the network is well staffed on the story. The decision to leave “was a discussion between my bosses and I, because there’s only so many days [you can go] without sleep”.“I know MS NOW is committed to having a strong presence on the ground, because they recognize how important of a story this is right now,” he said.Megan Burks, deputy managing producer, MPR News (Minnesota Public Radio)Burks, who coordinates daily news coverage for the NPR member station, said the newsroom had been settling into a new rhythm since the 7 January killing of Good. And then on Wednesday, a federal officer shot a man in the leg, leading to new protests and clashes with law enforcement.“Just as it felt like we were settling into a manageable rhythm, this new twist came and now we’re back to trying to figure out what is our new normal, what is our new rhythm,” she said.Burks said that MPR journalists have focused less on competition with other outlets and more on answering the questions of viewers.“Knowing that we can’t focus on everything, we’re trying to let the audience drive some of what we choose to put our stamp on,” she said.Nicole Sganga, homeland security correspondent, CBS NewsSganga arrived in Minneapolis two days before the shooting. She participated in a ride-along with immigration agents andinterviewed Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary,pressing her on how she can “justify” the government sending 2,000 DHS agents to the city.In addition to reporting on the ground about Good’s killing, Sgangacovered the intensificationof immigration raids after the incident.“My approach is always, ‘get there, bear witness, ask questions,’” Sganga said.View image in fullscreenNicole Sganga.Photograph: Courtesy of CBS NewsShe said it’s been important to cover the story from Minneapolis to be able to press government officials on “contradictory accounts” of what happened and what is happening.“That kind of independent reporting and verification is critical to holding power to account and to clarifying the facts for the public,” said Sganga, who has reported for the network for a decade.Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Donald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They may only be five points clear of the relegation zone, afterWest Ham’s last-gasp win at Tottenham, but Sean Dyche was understandably proud of his team’s efforts that suggest Forest are moving in the right direction.Aina did appear to move his arm towards a right-wing cross that initially struck his shoulder and would have led to anotherArsenalcorner. And everyone knows where that so often leads.Nottingham Forest v Arsenal: Premier League – liveRead moreArteta was told that the video assistant referee had adjudged there should be no penalty as the ball ricocheted off Aina’s shoulder on to his arm. “They are right that it hits the shoulder,” the Arsenal manager said, “[but] then he takes the ball with a hand. So their explanation is not right. The order is OK but the timing and the intention of the player is very clear. So in my opinion, it’s a very clear penalty.”Afterthe goalless draw with Liverpoolbefore their cup adventures, this is only the third time Arsenal have failed to score in two successive league games since 2022/23 and, on each occasion, Forest have been the second opponents.This game had been summed up neatly in the 82nd minute when two Forest players hunted down Gabriel Jesus as the Arsenal substitute tried to see the ball out for a throw-in. Elliot Anderson was not settling for that, crashing into the tackle that won his team the restart. Sixty yards down the touchline, Dyche clapped his hands above his head; Arteta reached out to either side, palms raised to the skies in incredulity that his team could get so legally bullied.Yet such is the way of this season. Just as the opportunity knocked, withManchester City losing to Manchester Unitedearlier in the day, for Arsenal to stretch their lead at the top, with Forest seemingly on the ropes after only one win in six games, up comes the underdog with a feisty performance to sum up this manager.If the jury is still out on Dyche despite the positive start to his reign, then this was the kind of performance to get the Forest faithful back onside.Arsenal, in contrast, appeared well in control of their destiny and, able to rotate their wide players, tested Forest’s vulnerability from set-pieces with two superb corners in the early moments. Declan Rice almost netted with his stomach from another cross, from Ben White, and both Gabriel Martinelli and Martín Zubimendi should have scored when getting on the end of Noni Madueke’s sense of creativity.Forest, having ended a four-game losing streakby winning at West Ham11 days ago, rallied after this challenging first half hour. As they got a foothold in the game, Michael Oliver, the referee, made an astute close call when awarding a free-kick just outside the area after Callum Hudson-Odoi was tripped by Jurriën Timber.View image in fullscreenMikel Merino contends for the ball along with teammate Gabriel as Nottingham Forest defend resolutely.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesDyche compared this penalty claim with Arsenal’s for Aina’s alleged handling offence. “It hits our player on the arm and you’re like, ‘Where does this live?’ We’ve got to be careful with all this.“I thought we had a really good shout. Callum’s gone in, he’s in mid-flow. He’s going into the box [so] to decide the moment of contact is a tight call. If that was on them, I’d be buzzing to get that one. I’d be singing hallelujah.”When Forest continued in the ascendancy at the start of the second half, Arteta took decisive action and made four changes by the hour mark.Bukayo Saka immediately made a difference. He scampered down the right wing to pull his cross back for Rice, whose volley, tipped aside by Matz Sels, was Arsenal’s first effort on target – in the 59th minute.When Rice returned the favour from the other flank, Saka’s header was brilliantly turned aside by Sels at full stretch. Then Saka crossed and MikelMerino’s header needed brushing behind. Suddenly, it was all Arsenal.Forest were on a good night, however. They tend to be when Ibrahim Sangaré plays. Dyche’s team have only lost twice in the 12 games when the Ivorian midfielder has featured, and missed him badly when he was away at the Africa Cup of Nations. He provided the glue in this gritty performance, holding in front of the defence, nicking 50/50s and with the corollary of allowing Anderson, Forest’s best player, more freedom to go foraging.Arteta was not unduly disheartened. “Every week is an opportunity,” he said. “We want to win every game. But we made a smaller step, not the one that we wanted, but it’s a step.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He had Amad Diallo to the right and Patrick Dorgu and Mbeumo on the left; United’s streetwise captain delayed the pass, then found the Cameroonian, whose finish beat Gianluigi Donnarumma.‘A version of normal’: Carrick asks for consistency after Manchester derby triumphRead moreOld Trafford – the blue zone apart – went into near combustion, the atmosphere supercharged as the neighbours from across town went behind in the 198th derby.This was precisely what United deserved for taking the contest to City all afternoon, and more soon followed. Carrick had dropped the in-form Benjamin Sesko for Mbeumo. Six minutes after the opener, he removed the scorer, due to his recent Africa Cup of Nations endeavours, in favour of Matheus Cunha and the Brazilian created the second.This was simple as Cunha whipped in a cross from the right and Dorgu nipped in front of a slumbering Rico Lewis to pinball home off the right post.View image in fullscreenPatrick Dorgu scores Manchester United’s second from Matheus Cunha’s cross.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesThe red congregation was in raptures, Pep Guardiola a picture of impotency, slumped in his seat. Further glee for the home fans followed when Erling Haaland was taken off, making it no goals from open play in seven matches for Manchester City’s No 9.After brickbats from Roy Keane and only four days at the helm, this was the very best of starts for Carrick, as United finished the day in fifth, only one point behind fourth-placed Liverpool. Next, he will plot how to overturn Arsenal in north London on Sunday week.For City’s title challenge this was a dark day but could have been worse – they remain in second, seven points off the leaders after Mikel Arteta’s team were held 0-0 at Nottingham Forest in the late game.City were unable to contain the pace of United, who refused to let go of the jugular – Amad’s curving run then shot that crashed off the right post as the regulation 90 minutes ran down as emblematic as Mason Mount’s strike, ruled out for offside, in added time.Carrick’s restoration of United’s dogged spirit has Old Trafford crackling again | John BrewinRead moreThe first half intrigued, as United went toe-to-toe with City, edging a period in which they were composed while those in blue started nervously, with Max Alleyne making three errors.Two of these were balls aimed for Nathan Aké that went into touch on the left, and the third a weak backpass that nearly allowed Mbeumo to beat Donnarumma to the ball. Further City shakiness featured Jérémy Doku scuffing a corner low to Fernandes, the first defender at the near post, with United also in ruthless mode, as illustrated when Diogo Dalot caught Doku high on the shin.Anthony Taylor booked the right-back – Guardiola believed it should have been a sending-off – but this was a calling card as clear as Luke Shaw’s upending of Rodri that likewise drew a yellow, tempers fraying further when Maguire manhandled Bernardo Silva in front of the Stretford End.Yet after United had sliced through City in two or three early forays, a warning was sent, Antoine Semenyo the messenger via a cross that Silva blazed over from close in.Earlier, Maguire’s header hit City’s bar from a Fernandes corner, and further dalliances with the visitors’ goal featured Dalot’s misplaced pass meant for Amad and Mbeumo refusing a volley so that Dorgu could shoot, Donnarumma repelling the effort at close range.View image in fullscreenHarry Maguire’s header almost gives Manchester United an early lead.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThere was a pleasing flow to the contest. Amad would knife into City’s area, Doku would expertly dispossess him and two or three seconds later Kobbie Mainoo was blocking the Belgian’s effort near his D, after a lightning counter. Amad then rounded Donnarumma and finished but was offside.As Matheus Nunes had flu, Guardiola drafted Rico Lewis in at right-back yet a player beloved by his manager for locating pockets was stopped from doing so by the United express train.For the second half Guardiola removed Alleyne and the anonymous Phil Foden for Nico O’Reilly and Rayan Cherki. Here was proof that City had been inferior and when O’Reilly began with a booking – for holding Amad – there was further encouragement for United.Then, a curio for being a curio – a Haaland shot that came from his right foot and was blocked, before Senne Lammens collected the resulting corner. Then came United’s grandstand finish and Carrick walking off, at the final whistle, to applause.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

For me what’s important is to be consistent and I’m really happy that I could do that despite the conditions.“There is one more downhill to come, in the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana on 30 January, before the women head for the Games in Cortina d’Ampezzo.Tarvisio also hosts a women’s super-G on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsShareReuse this content"

It’s not thrilled about theNBA’s plans to create a new competitionon the continent.It’s not concerned, either.“We’ve only heard the plan or the fireworks of how amazing it will be, how much potential there is,” EuroLeague CEO Paulius Motiejunas said of the NBA’s proposed league. “But having a theory is one – and making it work is two.”“We’ve been here for 26 years. We know how Europe functions.”Would the NBA’s transatlantic expansion strip the soul of European basketball?Read moreWith clubs like Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, the EuroLeague is considered the best men’s professional competition outside the NBA. The 20-team league is comprised of 13 “shareholder” clubs immune from relegation. The rest either qualify through their domestic leagues or through invitation.The NBA, in partnership with Fiba, is eying a 16-team model with 12 permanent members – with a target start of October 2027. It has identified Athens, Istanbul, Paris, Lyon, Munich, Berlin, Rome, Milan, Madrid, Barcelona, London and Manchester as potential host cities.Attention is currently on three EuroLeague shareholder clubs that haven’t renewed their 10-year licenses – Real Madrid, Fenerbahce in Istanbul and the Tony Parker –owned ASVEL near Lyon. Parker has signaled his support for the NBA, and Spanish sports dailyDiario AS reportedthat Real Madrid favors the NBA project.Recent holdout Barcelona has indicated it will extend for another 10 years beyond this season.“It’s a big deal, of course. It’s an important brand, and we’re happy that they committed,” Motiejunas said of Barcelona, which hasn’t commented publicly.Motiejunas, in an interview with the Associated Press, said he’s confident all 13 clubs will stay.“The NBA has been announcing and announcing things for a year but still it’s nothing that you can grasp on,” Motiejunas said. “As businessmen, these are team owners, they also begin to see it’s a little bit of a broken record of ‘we will announce later,’ ... The ’27 start is already around the corner.”EuroLeague clubs reportedly have a €10m ($11.6m) exit clause, but Motiejunas would only say that through “consequences and legal teams” contracts can be broken. There’s no NBA opt-out, he added.NBA vs EuroLeague?The EuroLeague claims to still be open to some type of relationship with the NBA, whose executives have expressed similar sentiments. But in the meantime, the EuroLeague sent a letter to the NBA warning of legal action should talks with EuroLeague shareholders continue.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver shrugged off the threat Thursday in Berlin ahead of the Orlando Magic’s 118-111 win over the Memphis Grizzlies in the NBA’s first regular-season game in Germany.He also shrugged off the EuroLeague more generally.“If I thought that the ceiling was the existing EuroLeague and their fan interest,” Silver said, “we wouldn’t be spending the kind of time and attention we are on this project.”Media reports indicate the NBA is looking for at least a $500m franchise fee. Silver noted that any investors will have to be patient because “it will take a while, I think, before it is a viable commercial enterprise.” He added it will be “multi-decades in the making”.Silver cautioned that “potentially” starting a new league is an “enormous undertaking” and described talks with Real Madrid and other Spanish clubs as “more in the category of fact finding”.European marketThe European basketball landscape is similar to soccer. EuroLeague is like Uefa’s Champions League in quality, though entry is more restrictive.Basketballalso has several other international leagues – but they’re lesser known than their soccer counterparts, so fans get confused. Fiba, for example, has its own Basketball Champions League, which would be a potential feeder to an NBA league.Silver sees potential because basketball is the No 2 sport in Europe after soccer.“Rather than think of us as taking share from [soccer], I look at the commercial side of basketball as it exists now in Europe, and it probably represents about 1% of the commercial sports marketplace,” he said.Middle East impactMany European basketball teams, including some in the EuroLeague, have struggled financially. The system has often relied on wealthy owners to cover team debts each year. EuroLeague has implemented spending restrictions to promote financial sustainability.In a revenue boost, the EuroLeague last season took its “Final Four” championship outside Europe – to Abu Dhabi – for the first time. It brought a flavor of Euro hoops chaos, too, as Panathinaikos majority owner Dimitris Giannakopoulos was handed a five-game ban for his “threatening actions” against referees.EuroLeague also granted a multi-year license to a newly created Dubai team and recently extended its partnership with global sports marketing agency IMG.“We focus on ourselves,” Motiejunas said. “We will be able to adapt, there’s no question about it, and we will continue to fight.”Explore more on these topicsBasketballNBAUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It was, by some margin, one of the most surprising coaching separations in the history of tennis, a decision that came with no clear warning immediately afterthe greatest seasonof Alcaraz’s career. The discourse has since ranged from his alleged determination to reside exclusively at home in El Palmar, Murcia and train in his home academy, to potential discontent at Ferrero’s absences from numerous tournaments last year.The coach has offered his own perspective in interviews, repeatedly expressing his sadness at a split he did not want. Alcaraz, however, has opted for silence. His mandatory pre-tournament press conference at theAustralian Openon Friday marked his first time publicly speaking about the split, and the 22-year-old offered as little information as possible on the reasons behind it.“With Juan Carlos, we decide to do it. I’m just having plenty of confidence in the team that I have right now,” Alcaraz said. “The practices have gone really well. I’m just feeling well.“I’ve got to say that I’m really grateful for this seven years I’ve been with Juan Carlos. I learned a lot. We closed this chapter in mutual [ways]. We both are still friends. I have the same team that I had last year. Just one member missing. So we didn’t change the routine at all. We’re just going through the pre-season and the season in the same way, probably with the improvement that I really want to do.”1:46Will anyone end the Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz supremacy? – videoThis new chapter begins with one of the most interesting challenges of Alcaraz’s career as, with his former assistant coach Samuel López now by his side as his main counsel, he is attempting to become the youngest man to win the career grand slam. Alcaraz has already won each of the three other grand slam tournaments on two occasions but he has not even come close to producing his optimal level at the Australian Open.Two quarter-final runsremain his best results.The coming fortnight will therefore be a fascinating measure of his maturity. Alcaraz is solely responsible for his talent, ability and determination, but Ferrero always seemed a perfect foil to those stratospheric natural abilities, helping to imbue him with greater discipline and attention to detail, using his knowledge as a coach and former champion to help keep Alcaraz on track. The coming weeks will show just how ready the world No 1 is to take control and tread his own path forward.This is particularly true because of the challenge that will probably await, with his great rival Jannik Sinner also chasing history. The Italian will attempt to win the Australian Open, the scene of his first major title, for a third consecutive year. The pair have contested the past three grand slam finals, but Sinner’s slam record is even more complete. He has now reached the past five major finals,winning threeand holding a match point against Alcaraz at the French Open before losing last year.Not so long ago, grand slam draws were actually significant. Even during the unprecedented dominance of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the placement of the third and fourth seeds was of utmost importance and there were still obvious dangers along the way. But Alcaraz and Sinner have dominated the tour so emphatically over the past year that Thursday’s draw ceremony felt irrelevant. As the top two seeds, their positions in the draw were already confirmed. Nothing else mattered.View image in fullscreenAmanda Anisimova reached two slam finals in 2025, the best year of her career.Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAPNeither player is unbeatable;Sinner trailed Grigor Dimitrovby two sets in the fourth round of Wimbledon last year before the Bulgarian was forced to retire with a freak pectoral injury and Alcaraz can still have erratic days. However, there is now an enormous gulf between the top two and the rest, and all other potential competitors have the unenviable task of trying to bridge that gap in Melbourne.This could not be further from the case in the women’s draw. Last February Amanda Anisimova was ranked No 41 and still desperately trying to fulfil her immense potential. She started this year having just reached a career-high ranking of No 3, marching into thepast two grand slam finalsand putting together a breakthrough year that outstripped all expectations. Today, Anisimova is the purest, most devastating shotmaker in the game, capable of dominating anyone with the force and precision of her ground strokes, particularly that two‑handed backhand.As evidenced by her contribution to theone-point slam on Wednesday, her only serve falling into the bottom of the net and instantly eliminating her, Coco Gauff still has much to work on with her flaky serve. But she has also shown repeatedly that she can make herself incredibly difficult to beat, as the 21-year-old didin the French Open final last year, outsmarting Aryna Sabalenka en route to her second major title. She issued a reminder of her pedigree with a near flawless performance last week with a straight-sets win over the world No 2, Iga Swiatek, at the United Cup.Elena Rybakina’s first serve is one of the most destructive, reliable shots in the game, which she backs up with her relentless shotmaking from the baseline. The past years have been challenging for her, in part because of the many question marks surrounding her coaching partnership with Stefano Vukov, who was banned by the Women’s Tennis Association for much of 2025 due to alleged verbal abuse of his charge, before being reinstated in August. She found her way in spectacular fashion at the close of the year, bulldozing through the best players in the world towin the WTA Finals.A year on from her stellar grand slam return after maternity leave, Belinda Bencic has started the season back in the top 10 and in some of the best form of her life. Mirra Andreeva, still only 18, seems as though she could excel at a grand slam tournament at any moment. Victoria Mboko, Naomi Osaka, Karolina Muchova, Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys – the defending champion – all have the quality to make deep runs and compete among the best.View image in fullscreenIga Swiatek won Wimbledon 2025, leaving her with the Australian Open to win for the career grand slam.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APThese are just some of the competitors who will be desperate for a shot at Sabalenka and Swiatek, having proved their ability to tussle with the elite. However, Sabalenka and Swiatek are the two best players in the world for a reason and will chase historic achievements of their own.Not even Swiatek imaginedshe would win Wimbledonlast year, yet that victory has put her in position to chase her own career grand slam in Australia, where the 2022 semi-final remains her best result. Sabalenka, meanwhile, has established an outlandish record in Australia, last week’s triumph in Brisbane improving her record to 40 wins in her last 42 matches. Having reached the past three finals in Melbourne, the Belarusian will begin as the favourite to win her third title. A strong group of challengers are solidifying their positions at the top of the sport, and over the next fortnight the world’s two best players face the colossal challenge of holding them all off.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Carlos AlcarazIga SwiatekAryna SabalenkaCoco GauffJannik SinnerTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, wrote an open letter to fans on Saturday morning, the tone of which was supportive, the overriding message being a call for patience.But the drama of the West Ham game, when Spurs fell to a stoppage-time winner from the substitute Callum Wilson, has led the club to wonder whether they can persist with Frank.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The mood inside the stadium was toxic, with fans booing at various points of the game, including half-time and full-time. They jeered Frank for his decision to substitute the winger Mathys Tel in the 62nd minute as they trailed 1-0, although Cristian Romero equalised straight after that. The “sacked in the morning” chant followed Wilson’s winner.Romero pulled no punches with his post-match assessment. “At this moment this is a disaster for us,” he said. “We played sometimes good, sometimes bad. We must work hard and go again. It’s a difficult moment for us. We are not the best on the pitch.”View image in fullscreenCristian Romero equalised for Tottenham but was left dejected by West Ham’s late winner.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersSpurs brought the former Ajax manager John Heitinga on to Frank’s coaching staff this week to replace the assistant Matt Wells, who left before Christmas to become the head coach at the Colorado Rapids. Frank said he had driven the appointment, despite the suggestion that Heitinga could potentially replace him on a caretaker basis if results did not improve.Frank said after the West Ham game that he retained the faith of the hierarchy and would turn around what he described as a “supertanker” of a club. He did not sugar-coat the blow but said he had taken heart from Venkatesham’s letter. The defeat kept Spurs 14th in the Premier League. Frank’s team have won just three of their past 15 matches in the competition.“I have seen the letter and I took six to eight positive things out of it,” Frank said. “What I take out of that letter is that we are a club and an executive team with Vinai on top that are aligned and know this is a big transitional phase.“It’s a supertanker we’re turning in the right direction and there are a lot of good signs behind the scenes and also in some of the performances. But, of course, when you lose last-minute to one of your rivals, it is very emotional and there will be noise. That noise we need to keep out there and get our head down and keep walking, keep doing the right thing.“Of course, I’ve probably had better times. But I understand [the chant]. I’m the man in charge. So the blame will go to me. That’s fair, no problem in that sense. If you’re not winning enough, we know you will not get enough support from the fans. But when we’re winning, it will change … when we start winning again. Which we will do. I’m not in doubt of that.“It seems to be the perfect storm at the moment in many ways. We have a last-minute defeat when everyone feels that everyone has given everything, including the fans, to back the team. You get a sucker punch in injury time and it’s unbelievably tough to take. You have to keep going. You can’t feel sorry for yourself.”After Romero’s goal, it looked as though Spurs might go on to win. But Frank was left to lament the biggest single failing of his tenure – the lack of cutting edge from the attacking players.Wilson’s last-gasp West Ham winner deepens Frank’s Tottenham crisisRead more“It’s a sign that the goal is scored by Cuti, our captain and centre-back,” he said. “And we didn’t have enough chances or the cutting edge from the offensive players. That, of course, is no criticism, it’s just reality. We didn’t have the cutting edge, the perfect weighted pass, the sharp finish. We need to keep working on that.”Frank did say the players were still fighting, despite three defeats in a row. “Let’s say the previous two games – against Bournemouth in the league and Aston Villa in the FA Cup – and now the game here. If the players stop running or stop doing anything or are not working hard and we are not the team that’s closest to winning … then you can say: ‘OK’. But the team is working very hard. And I still think, and I know it sounds a little bit crazy, that we are closer to something very good, than further away.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Coveted talent like Antoine Semenyo and now Marc Guéhi opt for blue when a generation ago, Old Trafford was the destination of dreams.United’s myth and legend becomes increasingly sepia-tinged but there may be life in it yet. The list of Sir Alex Ferguson’s boys able to take the reins in times of emergency is being exhausted but Michael Carrick,on his second turn, found a way to feed off it. He has just 17 games though there is a tantalising prize on offer. A return to the Champions League looks possible. Rather than embracing the void, Carrick’s United reminded that sporting directors, analytic departments and strategic reviews may have their place in the eventual restoration of power, but dogged spirit, wanting it more, can win the day.Carrick has dream start as Mbeumo and Dorgu give Manchester United derby delightRead moreOn Fergie’s face a broad smile, while a haunted, defeated Pep Guardiola, City’s chances of reclaiming the title dwindling to dust, rocking back into his cushioned seat, was delicious for United followers. As was the sullen departure of Erling Haaland, loping off with 10 minutes left, finally rid of Lisandro Martínez and Harry Maguire checking his every move. As City fans of a certain age will recall, the failures of rivals can be almost as sweet as sustained success. Your team actually delivering mortal blows is sweeter still.Ruben Amorim was the manager who never appeared to remotely believe in the United legend. Reliving former glories is not nearly enough, as the past 13 years have shown, but snotting City will do fine for now. And perhaps the players for whom Amorim showed such distaste have more to offer than he was prepared to admit. Free at last from three-at-the-back – Bruno Fernandes asked to supply key passes instead of ratting round midfield – who would have thought that United’s players might find a way to express themselves?A Stretford End flag day showed the United legacy still burns among the die-hards. In response, and until their team began to malfunction, those in the City end showed the braggadocio success will bring, all smirks and jibes. Where, until 2011, a ticker counting back the years since City had won a trophy - it reached 35 - the number 115 was brandished in the stand’s lower reaches. That United fans hope to wipe away their lost decadevia a legal processthat shows no sign of reaching a conclusion is a source of considerable amusement for those in blue.View image in fullscreenKobbie Mainoo, hampered by Antoine Semenyo, whose rejection by Amorim was a key indicator the former manager had little interest in club traditions, showed flashes of his old magic.Photograph: Neal Simpson/Getty Images/AllstarBeyond the institutional stuff, the company law, the political economy of nation states and petrochemical billionaires, how about some actual football? Old Trafford crackled as of old from the early stages, the rafters shaking when Maguire nodded against the crossbar. Guardiola scratching his cranium distractedly was a positive sign, as was Gianluigi Donnarumma twice having to bail out dozing City defenders. Alongside him, with hands behind his back, clad in the type of black overcoat his old boss once wore, Carrick paced calmly, far less demonstrative than an opposite number becoming ever more anxious.“Use the energy of the people” had been Carrick’s advice to his players, words he would have heard many times as a United player. Such a rallying call will not work every time, there will be occasions the crowd cannot provide the fuel, but a Manchester derby was just the place to employ it.‘A version of normal’: Carrick asks for consistency after Manchester derby triumphRead moreIt undoubtedly helped United that this is not the City team of three years ago, despite almost £500m being spent on renovations in the last calendar year. In a frantic first half, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, both making welcome returns from Morocco, were the outlets for a series of wildcat counters. Kobbie Mainoo, whose rejection by Amorim was a key indicator the former manager had little interest nor understanding of club traditions, showed flashes, too, digging in with Casemiro against City’s old firm of Rodri, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva. The trio’s class became lost amid the frenzy.United pressed hard, stayed compact as a unit, and by doing so, occasioned on the better chances. Abdukodir Khusanov and Max Alleyne in central defence, callow to say the least, suggested just whyGuéhi has been signed. Nico O’Reilly, the substitute only 30 Premier League games into his career, approaches positive veteran status.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola shows his frustration as City’s title ambitions slip away at Old Trafford.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesGuardiola, who offered a manly embrace to Khusanov after a touchline tackle, clearly enjoys his role in establishing the next generation for a time beyond his tenure but, for all those players’ bright futures, City are struggling to live in the present. Rico Lewis was horribly culpable for United’s second, beaten soundly to the punch by Patrick Dorgu.City are struggling with the discipline of attempting to stay successful while in a rebuilding process. Not every City signing has paid off, there has been significant wastage. At least Donnarumma, the keeper who was not supposed to suit the Guardiola doctrines, has been a palpable hit. Without him, City’s defeat would have come far earlier.Donnarumma’s second-half double save from Amad and then Casemiro reminded that for all the high-minded ideals of a ball-playing keeper, making saves will always be the most important part of the job. That the Italian was celebrating his stops so demonstratively was evidence of the increasing pressure and emotional energy City eventually collapsed underneath.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedManchester CityMichael CarrickanalysisShareReuse this content"

That’s how it feels like right now.“We played quite well and I think my players left their hearts on the pitch but I couldn’t support them from the bench,” said Glasner who failed to make a single substitution as his side were sunk by goals from Enzo Le Fée and Brian Brobbey after Yéremy Pino had given them the lead against the run of play.“We feel that we’re being abandoned. There’s no support. Everybody’s disappointed. We’ve been playing with 12 to 13 players for weeks now. On the bench I had just kids. They had never played in a stadium with an atmosphere like this.“Why I’m saying this is not to protect myself but to protect them. They need protecting. I made no substitutions because it would have been unfair. I see them in training every day. That’s where we are. The [senior] players need support.”Glasner suggested that the slenderness of a squad he believes is in urgent need of reinforcement is responsible for a disastrous run that last week saw Palacebow out of the FA Cup to non-league Macclesfield.“We’ve known we’re in this situation for weeks, for months now,” he said. “What are we doing? We’re selling our captain [Guéhi] one day before a game. One day before a game, the first time I heard about it was 10.30am yesterday. All the set pieces, everything was prepared for Guéhi playing.“Then, we had to change everything. Nobody told us. So then I have to stand in front of the group and tell them, ‘oh, the captain doesn’t play tomorrow’.“I think the players did well in the circumstances. I’m so direct today because I feel I have to protect them.”Glasner at least believes relegation can be avoided this season. “I feel we will get these few more points we will need to not get relegated,” he said. “But I know the players are not happy and satisfied. I don’t need support butCrystal Palaceneeds it.”Asked how he could stay on while this unhappy, Palace’s manager replied. “Because the players deserve it. The players and the fans deserve it 100%. For me it’s now about fighting with these players to get the results back. But they deserve Oliver Glasner now to be their leader.“But to protect them I have to say this in public. Saying these things behind closed doors makes no sense. And this is maybe the last try to get things done that have to get done. And, if we continue doing this, Crystal Palace, not Oliver Glasner will get the bill. If you’re fine with that continue.”Questioned as to whether he expected a “reaction” from the board he said: “I don’t know. It’s their club.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

The 41-year-old’s hoarse tones after this hard-fought west London derby summed up the qualities Chelsea’s players showed to win the game – resilience, determination and indifference to the fact they were far from their best.Cole Palmer scored the decisive goal from the penalty spot with 14 minutes remaining after Caoimhín Kelleher had brought down the substitute Liam Delap, adding to a video assistant referee-assisted first-half goal from João Pedro, to leave Rosenior waxing lyrically, if gruffly.Nottingham Forest v Arsenal: Premier League – liveRead more“I’m passionate so this will probably get worse,” he said with a smile. “What pleased me most was the players’ willingness to battle and fight. That attitude got us the goals and won us the game. By hook or by crook we did the basics of football.”Rosenior looked as calm as the ice-cold Palmer as he smashed his penalty past Kelleher, with the manager briefly exchanging low fives with his coaching staff on the bench, but for most of the game he paced the technical area barking instructions. The preceding 75 minutes had been far from straightforward for Chelsea and with better finishingBrentfordcould have extended their unbeaten Premier League run to seven matches.“We deserved at least a point on the balance of play, but sometimes the game isn’t fair,” said their manager, Keith Andrews. “You have to take opportunities when they come and we didn’t do that.”Given Chelsea’s tumultuous start to the year this was one of those games when only the result mattered, as Rosenior acknowledged afterwards. As in Wednesday’s3-2 defeat to Arsenalin the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final, Chelsea looked vulnerable at the back and open in midfield for long periods, but dug in despite several players also suffering from a virus that led to Estêvão Willian being ruled out.“There were a other few players complaining about their chests, but they played and I’m so proud of them,” Rosenior said. “Cole and Reece [James] haven’t trained, but they put themselves up to play.”View image in fullscreenCole Palmer doubles Chelsea’s lead from the penalty spot.Photograph: Ian Stephen/Every Second Media/ShutterstockChelsea started slowly in a becalmed atmosphere, enabling the visitors to take the initiative. Mathias Jensen twice got in behind Marc Cucurella in the opening exchanges, with one deflected shot bringing a good save from Robert Sánchez while Kevin Schade should have given Brentford the lead in the 21st minute, but opted to square the ball to Mikkel Damsgaard when he was in a good position to shoot, allowing Tosin Adarabioyo to make a scrambled clearance. Adarabioyo was later withdrawn due to a hamstring problem, with Chelsea’s injury crisis mounting.Chelsea’s attacking efforts by midway through the first half had been limited to João Pedro appealing for a penalty after slight contact from Michael Kayode, which was waived away by John Brooks, a decision upheld by the VAR, Stuart Attwell.Chelsea secured a crucial call in their favour from Attwell shortly afterwards, however, taking the lead against the balance of play in the 26th minute with a goal that contained two elements of fortune. Kayode’s clearance was deflected off Enzo Fernández into the path of João Pedro, who beat Kelleher with a smart left-foot finish only to be ruled offside.A relatively brief review by recent standards established the Brazilian was narrowly onside, with the 24-year-old claiming his eighth goal of the season.Brentford spurned two further chances before half-time, with Schade heading wide from Vitaly Janelt’s corner and Jansen hitting the post with a left-foot volley. They survived a major let-off with Alejandao Garnacho shooting wide at the far post from Pedro Neto’s cross when Kelleher was beaten.The second half followed a similar pattern, Igor Thiago missing a good chance with a header, before Nathan Collins’s poor back pass to Kelleher ended the contest. The Republic of Ireland goalkeeper did his best to salvage the situation, but clearly caught Delap as he stretched to clear from his penalty area and could not stop Palmer’s spot-kick.Chelsea’s first win in six Premier League games was sorely needed, both to keep them on Manchester United’s heels after theirimpressive win against Cityand to build faith among players and fans in Rosenior’s methods.While the players appear onside on this evidence, the subdued atmosphere suggests many fans remain to be convinced.This article was amended on 17 January 2026. An earlier version had mistakenly referred to Caoimhín Kelleher as “the Northern Ireland goalkeeper”, when Republic of Ireland was meant.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They dominated most of the possession thereafter and the arrival of one of Sweden’s greatest players, Kosovare Asllani, from the bench only added to their control.Quick GuideChelsea 5-0 Crystal Palace: Kerr off the mark in Cup with doubleShowSam Kerr scored her first goals in the Women's FA Cup since 2023 as she scored twice in Chelsea's 5-0 victory over Crystal Palace.Millie Bright opened the scoring in the 13th minute when she nodded home from Erin Cuthbert's corner and Kerr doubled the lead nine minutes later. Things were threatening to get away from Palace when Guro Reiten tucked away a penalty after she was brought down inside the area.Chelsea showed no mercy in the second half and scored twice more through Kerr five minutes after the break before Alyssa Thompson rounded off the scoring with 20 minutes to play.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It followed an away victory for another of the WSL’s London clubs, West Ham, away at Newcastle on Friday, with Rita Guarino’s side claiming a 3-0 win thanks to goals from Viviane Asseyi, Riko Ueki and Sarah Brasero-Carreira. So it was over to Sunderland to try their best.Here, in theory, the scene was set for a quintessential cup upset as the dark outline of an unwelcoming-looking row of deciduous trees flanked one side of the ground stood under a low cloud, with fans leaning on the side of railings as they held steaming cups of coffee and a Ha’way the Lasses’ flag hanging from a brick wall behind one goal and a queue for a cafe winding behind the other.View image in fullscreenRhiannon Roberts shoots at goal during a rare Sunderland attack.Photograph: Molly Darlington/The FA/Getty ImagesSunderland, 5-1 winners at Derby in the third round in December, were hosting a side whose new head coach, Eder Maestre, was taking charge of his second game in English football after a goalless draw at Liverpool in his WSL managerial debut. The slight bobbles in the pitch awill have felt a world away from his previous job managing in Tenerife.Sunderland battled and set pieces offered them some glimmers, but Rhiannon Roberts’s blocked shot was perhaps as close as they came while at the other end their goalkeeper, Grace Moloney, did well to punch the ball clear when Isobel Goodwin looked set to head home. In the middle the class of Geyoro was obvious, making the pitch look like a carpet.To their credit the home side defended well to keep the scoreline at 1-0 but the visitors were rarely troubled as Maestre got his first win in charge.Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupSunderland WomenLondon City LionessesWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Wisely, Arne Slot chose not to dispute it. TheLiverpoolhead coach got almost everything he wished for against Burnley – more creativity and more chances in particular – but the failure to kill off a relegation-threatened opponent who scored from their only shot on target brought familiar torment.Liverpool had 32 attempts on Martin Dubravka’s goal, including one from the penalty spot, with 11 on target. Two were cleared off the line by the Burnley defender Bashir Humphreys. Slot had asked for dominant ball possession to yield more opportunities and here was the response, of sorts. Only Florian Wirtz converted, however, and the champions were held to afourth successive Premier League drawwhen Marcus Edwards rewarded Burnley’s improved second half showing with a fine equaliser. More missed chances followed from Liverpool before a chorus of condemnation greeted the final whistle.Spurs v West Ham, Chelsea v Brentford, Liverpool v Burnley, and more: football – liveRead moreAsked whether he understood the home crowd’s reaction, Slot replied: “Yes. In my head there wasn’t booing but there was frustration as well. You have to give credit toBurnleyfor doing everything to prevent us scoring but if, as Liverpool, you are not disappointed by drawing at home to Burnley then something is wrong. I completely understand the frustration. I have the same frustrations and the players definitely have the same frustrations as the fans.”Scott Parker and his players merited the credit that Slot offered. The first half resembled a training exercise of attack versus defence as Liverpool constantly probed their deep, five-man defence. Armando Broja was so isolated in the Burnley attack he operated in a different postcode to his teammates. They conceded a soft penalty, missed by Dominik Szoboszlai, and fell behind shortly before the interval when Wirtz lashed home his fourth goal in six games. But the visitors’ concentration never wavered. A braver, more enterprising second half resulted in Edwards sweeping home his first goal of the season and sparking pandemonium in the away section.View image in fullscreenMarcus Edwards scores Burnley’s equaliser at Anfield.Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesIt was a far cry from Parker’s last appearance at Anfield –the 9-0 defeat with Bournemouthin 2022 and the angry post-match reaction that prompted his sacking as manager. “The key for us was getting in at half-time still in the game so we could fix a few things,” he admitted.Liverpool had more answers than of late against a low block but found Dubravka in commanding form in the Burnley goal. The keeper produced three good, and similar, saves to deny Hugo Ekitiké, Cody Gakpo and Wirtz in the first half.Slot’s team were gifted a chance to take the lead when awarded a soft penalty by the referee Andrew Madley. Receiving Curtis Jones’ pass inside the area, Gakpo turned on to his favoured right foot and straight into Florentino Luís before going down under the challenge. The Burnley midfielder could do little about the collision but caught Gakpo with his knee. The visitors raged against the decision and would consider justice done when Szoboszlai smacked the spot-kick against the crossbar.View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai hits the bar from his first-half penalty.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPALiverpool broke the deadlock when Dubravka saved at his near post from Ekitiké and Jones had the presence of mind to locate Wirtz inside a crowded penalty area. The German playmaker fired an emphatic finish into the top corner through a pack of incoming defenders. Ekitiké’s part in the breakthrough must be singled out for praise. The forward controlled Virgil van Dijk’s cross-field ball exquisitely before spinning away from both Kyle Walker and Axel Tuanzebe and testing Dubravka from a tight angle. Tuanzebe played despite knowing his wife had gone into labour. “It was touch and go whether he would play as it was going on for about 16 hours,” said Parker. “But we had a car outside with the engine running and he’s with her now.”Burnley had to show more adventure in the second half. And they delivered. The visitors served notice of newfound intent when Edwards broke free and attempted to find Jaidon Anthony unmarked in front of goal. Ibrahima Konaté, lunging to intercept, almost converted into his own net but Alisson reacted sharply to scoop clear. Moments later, and to Anfield’s general astonishment. Burnley were level. Luís prised open a static Liverpool defence with a fine pass into Edwards who, in space on the left of the area, rifled a powerful finish into the far corner.“They both came in the same five-minute period,” lamented Slot. “They were the only moments when we struggled.” But Liverpool’s struggles in front of goal continued. Dubravka saved from Wirtz, Humphreys made two vital goalline clearances from Gakpo, Ekitiké had a goal disallowed when coming back from an offside position to convert a Van Dijk header and Alexis Mac Allister sliced badly wide seconds after his introduction from the bench. Jones was in despair when he dragged a shot across the face of goal and Ekitiké just failed to apply the finishing touch. The feeling was soon shared across Anfield.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolBurnleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Everyone wanted to turn the situation around,” Asencio told RMTV. “What happened in Albacete shouldn’t have happened. We felt guilty and wanted to make up for it.

Piotr Zielinski’s ball into the box was backheeled to Martínez by Pio Esposito and the Inter striker twisted and turned, making enough space to drive his shot into the bottom corner.The game, like all Serie A fixtures this weekend, was preceded by a minute’s silence in memory of the Fiorentina owner, Rocco Commisso, whose death was announced on Saturday.Inter moved to 49 points, six ahead of Milan – who play Lecce at home on Sunday – andNapoli, who ended a run of three consecutive draws by beatingSassuolo1-0 at home.

They completed their turnaround with the Bundesliga’s leading scorer Harry Kane finding enough space at the far post to put them in front with his 21st league goal and the Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer did well to deny Yan Diomande, palming his shot wide.Bayern scored three more times late in the game, with Jonathan Tah’s 82nd-minute header and goals from Aleksandar Pavlovic in the 85th and Michael Olise three minutes later completing their comeback in style.Vincent Kompany, the Bayern coach, said: “Leipzig caused us many problems in the first half. They were clearly the better side. It felt like they were twice as good as we were.“But the second half, the lads delivered. We ran 6 kilometers more. It was old-school mentality. Winning one-on-ones, running, going forward.

Two of the quarter-finals were games of genuine quality and if the two semi-finals – one goal between them – fell into the sterile stereotype of the Cup of Nations, they were at least tense and meaningful.The problem was the last 16, in which half the games were essentially box-ticking exercises, and more especially a group stage in which the 16 qualifiers were known with six games still remaining. Having two-thirds of the third-placed sides going through destroys jeopardy, particularly when combined with separating teams level on points not by goal difference but by head-to-head. The World Cup will suffer from the same flaws.Quick GuideSalah and Marmoush fail in shootout as Nigeria beat EgyptShowMohamed Salah and Omar Marmoush failed from the spot as Egypt suffered a 4-2 penalty shootout defeat to Nigeria in the Africa Cup of Nations third-place playoff.The Liverpool forward Salah and the Manchester City striker Marmoush each saw their efforts saved by the Nigeria goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali before Ademola Lookman converted the winning penalty.Nigeria missed the opening kick of the shootout, with Fisayo Dele-Bashiru's effort kept out by Egypt's keeper Mostafa Shobeir after an uneventful bronze-medal encounter in Casablanca ended goalless.The Nigeria striker Paul Onuachu had a 36th-minute goal disallowed following a VAR review as he was adjudged to have caught the Egypt defender Hamdy Fathy with an elbow in the buildup.PA MediaPhotograph: Ulrik Pedersen/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.For only the second time this century, neither of the managers of the finalists is foreign. Although Senegal’s Pape Thiaw was playing in France for Saint-Étienne by the age of 17 and enjoyed a career that took him to Switzerland, Russia and Spain, he was born in Dakar and cut his teeth in management with Niarry Tally, the team of Senegal’s largest biscuit manufacturer. Walid Regragui was born in a suburb of Paris and spent most of his playing career in France, but he was capped 44 times by Morocco and coached in Rabat, Casablanca and Qatar before getting the national job.View image in fullscreenSenegal’s head coach, Pape Thiaw (left) and his Morocco counterpart, Walid Regragui. All of the semi-finalists were coached by Africans.Photograph: Sebastien Bozon,gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty ImagesFor a long time, an obvious area for development for African football was management and at last there has been a turn away from European journeymen towards local coaches, almost invariably using the experience they have gained playing for European clubs. All of the last four were coached by Africans, the first time that has happened since 1965.The most recent instance of a final with a pair of African coacheswas 2019, when Djamel Belmadi’s Algeria beat Aliou Cissé’s Senegal: the managers then had grown up in neighbouring districts of Paris. That trend of African football being developed in Europe has continued. Roughly a third of all players at this edition were born outside Africa. Only 14 members of Morocco’s 28-man squad were born in Morocco, and only 15 of Senegal’s squad in Senegal.This is a process that has been aided by two relatively recent changes in the regulations. In 2009 Algeria led a motion that lifted the prohibition on players changing footballing nationality after the age of 21 and, in 2020, Morocco pushed for a change that permitted players who had played three times or fewer for a country to switch allegiance.The Cup of Nations is increasingly a tournament of the many African diasporas. That is not to question any player’s affiliation to their country, nor to doubt the complexities of national identity in a globalised world, but it does highlight the effectiveness of the quasi-industrialised youth development systems of western Europe: 14 players across the finalists’ two squads were born in France, five in Spain, and three in each of the Netherlands and Belgium.Africa is now benefiting from whata piece on PlaytheGamedescribed as “a bug in the trajectory of the workforce flow in the world”. That said, Morocco has also invested in youth development with the Mohammed VI football academy opening in 2009. Four of its graduates, including Youssef En-Nesyri and Nayef Aguerd, were in the squad that reached the 2022 World Cup semi-finals, and the continuing success of the academy system was seen as Morocco won the Under-20 World Cup last year.View image in fullscreenMorocco fans with flags inside the stadium before the semi-final. The hosts have emerged as the modern heart of the African game, with impressive infrastructure.Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/ReutersThe test Senegal will face in the final will not be dissimilar to that of the previous two rounds. Morocco are nowhere near as cautious as the other north African giants but they will probably sit deep and allow Senegal the ball. As Sadio Mané stressed after thesemi-final win over Egypt, Senegal have been very effective in probing without overcommitting. They will, though, be without their captain, Kalidou Koulibaly, and the midfielder Habib Diarra for the final after they picked up their second yellow cards of the knockout stages.Like Senegal, Morocco are looking for their second Cup of Nations triumph but, 50 years after their previous success, there is real urgency about their quest. Morocco – two events into a three-tournament run of hosting, after the 2024 Women’s African Cup of Nations and as a co-host of the 2030 World Cup – hasemerged as the modern heart of the African game, with undeniably impressive infrastructure. But that brings with it expectation and there is little doubt that pressure has underlain some laboured displays, especially in the group stage.Although Achraf Hakimi is their obvious star and the goalkeeper Yassine Bounou has proved again hisproficiency in a penalty shootout, the two players who have really stood out have been the wide forwards Brahim Díaz, who is the tournament’s leading scorer with five, and, on the left, Ez Abde, without whom Morocco’s counterattacks would be nowhere near as penetrative. The battle between them and Senegal’s two full-backs, Krépin Diatta and El Hadji Malick Diouf, is likely to be decisive.View image in fullscreenMorocco star Achraf Hakimi celebrates reaching the final with the host nation’s mascot.Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/ReutersThe sense so far has been of a Cup of Nations that has been almost too slick, too polished. The reputation of a tournament is based not only on quality but on intrigue and drama, and, despite a few moans about refereeing, there has not yet been much of that. Predictability may speak of a tournament’s maturity, of smooth pitches and first-class facilities, but it will not live long in the mind of the neutral. That may yet be redeemed by a thrilling final but, with the World Cup and its inflated narratives looming, there is a risk that this becomes a forgotten Cup of Nations.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Inside footballMorocco football teamSenegal football teamAfrica Cup of NationscommentShareReuse this content"

Higgins gave Trump something to think about before the mid-session interval by clawing it back to 3-2, including a century break, but breaks of 70 and 57 by the world No 1 helped him move to within a frame of victory at 5-3.Higgins fought back for a second time and brought it back to 5-5 before his break of 70 in the decider meant Trump is still without a tournament win this season.Higgins, who at the age of 50 becomes the oldest triple crown finalist, told BBC Sport: “He is so tough to play against. I missed a couple of reds to put myself safe and then he did what he always does which is clear up.“Even at 5-3, I didn’t give up. It was the same against Zhao Xintong. Who knows, maybe my name is on the trophy? You just don’t know.“I think I’m a better player now than I’ve ever been. You play these great champions like Judd and I’ve lost the last few against him.”Higgins will face Kyren Wilson, who also battled through a last-frame decider, to beat China’s Wu Yize 6-5.Wu trailed 4-2 but breaks of 75, 87 and 81 put the 22-year-old 5-4 up and one frame from the final. But a nerveless clearance of 57 hauled Wilson level and the world No 2 got over the line with the first century of the match, a composed break of 116.“I wasn’t at the races at all today,” last year’s runner-up told the BBC. “I don’t know where I got those last two frames from.

At the other end the Dunfermline defender Nurudeen Abdulai looped a harmless header on to the roof of the net.The Hibs captain, Joe Newell, was handed his first start since December 2024 and the midfielder enjoyed plenty of the ball early on as he kept his team ticking over.

The team anyone would pay good money to watch. A collection of youngsters from Manchester were given the best seats in the house, as their magisterial hosts ran rings round them. This is Sale’s record defeat. This is Toulouse avenging theirdefeat to Saracens last week. Far older and uglier players than Sale could call on would have suffered similarly.Both teams thus qualify for the last 16.Toulouseleapfrog their visitors into second place, for now, which means a home tie. They will be cheering on Glasgow, who host Saracens in the last match of the pool stages on Sunday.Sale were missing 13 players and had already qualified. Toulouse were missing quite a few too, but there’s an injury-struck squad and there’s a Toulouse squad. Still they were able to send out international after international. Thomas Ramos ended the match with 27 points, a try in the second half and 11 conversions out of 11, the last from the wrong touchline, just to show off. He is the deadliest goal-kicker in the world, possibly in history.‘I was knocked for six’: Zander Fagerson on his Lions injury despair and Glasgow’s European questRead moreToulouse began the match outside the qualifying places, believe it or not, fifth out of six in Pool 1. There was never any question of them not qualifying, a win all but guaranteed against the travelling youngsters, but it was fun trying to imagine the aristos of this competition failing to make the last 16.That idle fancy did not last long. It says something that Sale played out of their skins for 40 minutes, nearly crossing the line themselves at one point, but they turned around 28-0 down, bonus-point fourth try conceded on the stroke of half-time. Toulouse had their first in the third minute, the monstrous Emmanuel Meafou not needing a lot of his 145kg to break through flailing arms off an attacking lineout.That was Toulouse resorting to muscle for their first score, and it is to Sale’s credit that they had to repeat the trick to score their second, a whole 20 minutes later. Which means until that point, Sale survived an avalanche of penalties and pressure to keep their hosts at bay. No stopping Julien Marchand, though, at the back of an advancing lineout and drive at the start of the second quarter.Then Toulouse showed us a flash of the kind of rugby for which they are better known. Blair Kinghorn, looking imperious at fly-half, released Dimitri Delibes and Léo Banos to combine down the right, before he did the same down the left for Ramos to put Matthis Lebel away. He found Antoine Dupont supporting on the inside, the maestro running home Toulouse’s third.Quick GuideRoundup: Leicester on the brink after Cape Town collapseShowLeicester's last-16 hopes were left in tatters after a 39-26 defeat byStormersin Cape Town. Early tries from Evan Roos and Andre-Hugo Venter put the hosts in control before George Pearson pulled one back.Some Will Wand magic hauled the Tigers back into the match at half-time and they led by six when Jamie Blamire went over early in the second half. However, tries from Leolin Zas and JD Schickerling edged the Stormers back in front before Tom Manz scored for Leicester.But Imad Khan denied the Tigers a losing bonus point when his late try (pictured) sent Stormers through. Instead, a losing bonus point against Harlequins on Sunday will be enough for La Rochelle to qualify from Pool 3 and knock out Leicester.Leinsterbattled to a 22-13 win atBayonnewhich secured home advantage in the last 16. Bayonne – who had lost their opening three Pool 3 games, including to Leicester and Harlequins – took an early lead at the Stade Jean Dauger through a breakaway try from Sireli Maqala in the 14th minute before Harry Byrne's penalty got Leinster, already qualified from Pool 3, on the board.After Joshua Kenny just failed to take the ball and go over in the corner, a long-range penalty from Joris Segonds put the French side further ahead. Thomas Clarkson then saw his 33rd-minute try disallowed for a double movement as Bayonne went into half-time 10-3 in front.Bayonne's Herschel Jantjies was shown a yellow card in the 49th minute for a deliberate knock-on. Leinster made the most of their advantage when Dan Sheehan slid over in the 56th minute and Byrne nailed the conversion to bring the visitors level at 10-10.Segonds kicked another penalty on the hour to swiftly restore Bayonne's lead, which looked to have been wiped out when Jimmy O'Brien charged on to a kick from Sam Prendergast and went down in the corner – only for his try to be ruled out by the television match official for failing to ground the ball as he was tackled over the line.Leinster produced a strong finish as Prendergast latched on to Byrne's chipped pass under the posts and then Max Deegan crossed in the corner to make sure of another hard-earned win to maintain their 100% record at the top of the group.Gloucester's Champions Cup hopes suffered a knockout blow asToulondumped them from the tournament by winning 31-14 at Kingsholm. The French side did not look back following early tries by wings Gael Drean and Mathis Ferte, with Gloucester never seriously threatening a meaningful fightback.The flanker Lewis Ludlam also crossed for the visitors during a one-sided opening half as they guaranteed themselves a home tie in the last 16, before Drean added an 80th-minute bonus-point clincher.Gloucester, despite touchdowns from Jack Clement and Tomos Williams, with George Barton converting both, were largely shut out, and the Toulon full-back Marius Domon's goal-kicking – four conversions and a penalty – kept his side in the driving seat. Gloucester's defeat meant Edinburgh progressed from Pool 2 alongside Toulon, Bath and Castres, with George Skivington's team having now lost 11 of their 13 Prem and Champions Cup games this season as even a Challenge Cup consolation place eluded them.PA MediaPhotograph: Gallo Images/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The young Sale side’s world caved in just before the break. First Alex Wills was shown yellow for a deliberate knock-on. From the subsequent attacking lineout, Kalvin Gourgues scored Toulouse’s fourth from Delibes’s inside ball, but the referee, a touch mercilessly, showed Sale another yellow, Sam Dugdale having sacked the lineout and manhandled Dupont in vain.So Sale faced the opening 10 minutes of the second half with a two-man disadvantage. They almost laughed at the prospect, scoring a fine try, their only one of the match, four minutes in, Tom Curtis looping his captain, Marius Louw, to scythe through, as if it were Toulouse who were down to 13.Quick GuideToulouse 77-7 Sale teams and scorersShowToulouseRamos; Delibes (Thomas 49), Gourgues, Chocobares, Lebel; Kinghorn (Graou 57), Dupont (capt); Baille (Neti 49), Marchand (Mauvaka 55), Aldegheri (Mallez 49), Flament, Meafou (Roumat 62), Banos, Willis (Cros 53), Jelonch (Brennan 49).TriesMeafou, Marchand, Dupont 2, Gourgues, Delibes, Lebel 2, Ramos, Graou, Brennan.ConsRamos 11.SaleDavies; Ene, Ma’asi-White (Bedlow 62), Louw (capt), Wills Grace 49; Curtis, Warr (Hanson 59); Rodd (McIntyre ht), Jibulu (Caine ht), Harper (Bell 45), Burrow (Hogg 70), Andrews, Gilmore, Woodman, Dugdale (Logan 51).Yellow cardsWills 40, Dugdale 40, Andrews 73.TryCurtis.ConCurtis.RefereeAndrew Brace (Ire).Att18,754.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.They had been allowed their fun. The tries rained down from then on, all one way, more than a few the sort you could hang on the wall. Let’s reserve special mention for Dupont’s second, in the final quarter, from Ramos’s cross-kick to the interplay between Gourgues and Lebel down the left and that maestro again supporting on the inside. We thought Dupont had finished another, even more outrageous move from their own 22 a few minutes later, but a forward pass earlier on did for the score.Alas, Sale suffered anyway, Hyron Andrews shown their third yellow of the night for a high tackle on Peato Mauvaka. Toulouse scored two more while Andrews was away and had another disallowed for Teddy Thomas’s simultaneous foot in touch as he dived for the line.That was the third try Toulouse had been disallowed.

Jordan James had opened the scoring for the visitors before Ellis Simms equalised shortly after half-time. Wright came off the bench to grab an 85th-minute winner as Coventry claimed a much-needed three points after a run of two victories in eight.“It was a massive win because it was a tough match,” said Lampard. “They’re a quality team, you can’t get fooled by their league position because if they turn up and play well they give you problems. They gave us problems in the first half which makes us happier that we had half-time, dealt tactically with the problems and the feeling of the game and owned it in the second half.“It was tense in the first half, they played well but we grabbed it back. Over the course of a season of course you’ll have games like this and full credit to the lads. We’ve set really high standards here and we’re used to having a lot of momentum in games and it’s normal that you don’t always have that.

Two goals in the opening 12 minutes set Ipswich on their way and they remain third in the table.Injury-hit Blackburn conceded an own goal from the debutant Eiran Cashin, while the midfielder Jack Taylor scored the second and Szmodics was on target in the 88th minute in a match where the hosts spurned a series of chances. Blackburn, who failed to have a shot on target, were left languishing in 20th spot, four points above the relegation zone.Blackburn’s manager, Valérien Ismaël, said: “The two goals in the first half just killed the momentum and everything in the game. In the first half Ipswich got nothing, just the two goals and apart from that it can’t be possible that we concede every time and come back into the game away against a strong team.”Femi Azeez returned to the club that once released him to inspireMillwallto a 2-0 victory overWatfordat Vicarage Road. Goals from Azeez, a Watford youth product until he was let go at the age of 14, and Josh Coburn kept Millwall in the playoff positions and brought a shuddering halt to Watford’s four-game winning run in theChampionship.

But most of all, I can’t wait to get started with the great players on this football team to see what we can accomplish together.”The 63-year-old coach was fired by the Baltimore Ravens over the phone last week,ending an 18-year partnershipafter the team missed the playoffs. Harbaugh moved quickly to the top of the Giants’ list and was at the team facility Wednesday for his only in-person interview.That visit followed an earlier meeting Sunday with Giants personnel executive Chris Mara, the son of co-chairman John Mara, who had lunch with Harbaugh at his home and described the conversation as informal. ESPN reported Harbaugh conducted extensive background work on the franchise during the process, including receiving assurances from former Giants coach Brian Daboll – who was fired in November – about the organization’s infrastructure.Harbaugh led the Ravens to the playoffs 12 times in 18 seasons, compiling a 180–113 regular-season record and a 13–11 mark in the postseason. He guided Baltimore to the Super Bowl title after the 2012 season, defeating the San Francisco 49ers, coached by his brother Jim.Baltimore finished 8–9 in 2025 and narrowly missed the playoffs after a last-second field-goal attempt sailed wide in the season finale against Pittsburgh. Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said this week that even if the kick had been made, Harbaugh may have only remained with the team for another week.Explore more on these topicsNew York GiantsNFLBaltimore RavensUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Trillions of dollars rest on the answer.The figures are staggering: an estimated $2.9tn (£2.2tn) beingspent on datacentres, the central nervous systems of AI tools; the more than $4tn stock market capitalisation of Nvidia, the company that makes the chips powering cutting-edge AI systems; and the $100m signing-on bonuses offered by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to top engineers at OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.These sky-high numbers are all propped up by investors who expect a return on their trillions. AGI, a theoretical state of AI where systems gain human levels of intelligence across an array of tasks and are able to replace humans in white-collar jobs such as accountancy and law, is a keystone of this financial promise.Google parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with AppleRead moreIt offers the prospect of computer systems carrying out profitable work without the associated cost of human labour – a hugely lucrative scenario for companies developing the technology and the customers who deploy it.There will be consequences if AI companies fall short: US stock markets, boosted heavily by the performance of tech stocks, could fall and cause damage to people’s personal wealth; debt markets wrapped up in the datacentre boom could suffer a jolt that ripples elsewhere; GDP growth in the US, which has benefited from the AI infrastructure, could falter, which would have knock-on effects for interlinked economies.David Cahn, a partner at one leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Sequoia Capital, says tech companies now have to deliver on AGI.“Nothing short of AGI will be enough to justify the investments now being proposed for the coming decade,”he wrote in a blog published in October.It means there is a lot hanging on progress towards advanced AI, and the trillions being poured into infrastructure and R&D to achieve it. One of the “godfathers” of modern AI, Yoshua Bengio, says the progress of AGI could stall and the outcome would be bad for investors.“There is a clear possibility that we will hit a wall, that there’s some difficulty that we don’t foresee right now, and we don’t find any solution quickly,” he says. “And that could be a real [financial] crash. A lot of the people who are putting trillions right now into AI are also expecting the advances to continue fairly regularly at the current pace.”But Bengio, a prominent voiceon the safety implications of AGI, is clear that continued progress towards a highly advanced state of AI is the more likely endgame.“Advances stalling is a minority scenario, like it’s an unlikely scenario. The more likely scenario is we continue to move forward,” he says.The pessimistic view is that investors are backing an unrealistic outcome – that AGI will not happen without further breakthroughs.David Bader, the director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, says trillions of dollars are being spent on scaling up – tech jargon for growing something quickly – the underlying technology for chatbots, known as transformers, in the expectation that increasing the amount of computing power behind current AI systems, by building more datacentres, will suffice.“If AGI requires a fundamentally different approach, perhaps something we haven’t yet conceived, then we’re optimising an architecture that can’t get us there no matter how large we make it. It’s like trying to reach the moon by building taller ladders,” he says.Nonetheless, big US tech companies such as Google’s parentAlphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are ploughing ahead with datacentre plans with the financial cushion of being able to fund their AGI ambitions through the cash generated by their hugely profitable day-to-day businesses. This at least gives them some protection if the wall outlined by Bengio and Bader comes into view.But there are other more worrying aspects to the boom. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimate that $2.9tn will be spent on datacentres between now and 2028, with half of that covered by the cashflow from “hyperscalers” such as Alphabet and Microsoft.The rest will have to be covered by alternative sources such as private credit, a corner of theshadow banking sectorthat isactivating alarm bells at the Bank of Englandand elsewhere. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has borrowed $29bn from the private credit market to finance a datacentre in Louisiana.AI-related sectors account for approximately 15% of investment grade debt in the US, which is even bigger than the banking sector, according to the investment bank JP Morgan.Oracle, which has signed a $300bn datacentre deal withOpenAI, has had an increase in credit default swaps, which are a form of insurance on a company defaulting on its debts. High-yield, or “junk debt”, which represents the higher-risk end of the borrowing market, is also appearing in the AI sector via datacentre operators CoreWeave and TeraWulf. Growth is also being funded by asset-backed securities – a form of debt underpinned by assets such as loans or credit card debt, but in this case rent paid by tech companies to datacentre owners – in a form of financing that has risen sharply in recent years.It is no wonder that JP Morgan says the AI infrastructure boom will require a contribution from all corners of the credit market.Bader says: “If AGI doesn’t materialise on expected timelines, we could see contagion across multiple debt markets simultaneously – investment-grade bonds, high-yield junk debt, private credit and securitised products – all of which are being tapped to fund this buildout.”Share prices linked to AI and tech are also playing an outsized role in US stock markets. The so-called “magnificent 7” of US tech stocks – Alphabet,Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia – account for more than a third of the value of the S&P 500 index, the biggest stock market index in the US, compared with 20% at the start of the decade.In October theBank of England warnedof “the risk of a sharp correction” in US and UK markets due to giddy valuations of AI-linked tech companies. Central bankers are concerned stock markets could slump if AI fails to reach the transformative heights investors are hoping for. At the same time the International Monetary Fund said valuations were heading towards dotcom bubble-levels.Even tech execs whose companies are benefiting from the boom are acknowledging the speculative nature of the frenzy. In November Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said there are “elements of irrationality” in the boom and that “no company is going to be immune” if the bubble bursts, while Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has said the AI industry is in a “kind of industrial bubble”, and OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said “there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.”All three, to be clear, are AI optimists and expect the technology to keep improving and benefit society.But when the numbers get this big there are obvious risks in a bubble bursting, as Pichai admits. Pension funds and anyone invested in the stock market will be affected by a share price collapse, while the debt markets will also take a hit. There is also a web of “circular” deals, such as OpenAI paying Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares. If these transactions unravel due to a lack of take-up of AI, or that wall being hit, then it could be messy.There are also optimists who argue that generative AI, the catch-all term for tools such as chatbots and video generators, will transform whole industries and justify the expenditure. Benedict Evans, a technology analyst, says the expenditure numbers are not outrageous in the context of other industries, such as oil and gas extraction which runs at $600bn a year.“These AI capex figures are a lot of money but it’s not an impossible amount of money,” he says.Evans adds: “You don’t have to believe in AGI to believe that generative AI is a big thing. And most of what is happening here is not, ‘oh wow they’re going to create God’. It’s ‘this is going to completely change how advertising, search, software and social networks – and everything else our business is based on – is going to work’. It’s going to be a huge opportunity.”Nonetheless, there is a multitrillion dollar expectation that AGI will be achieved. For many experts,the consequences of getting thereare alarming. The cost of not getting there could also be significant.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingStock marketsAmazonMetaGoogleOpenAIanalysisShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Juuso WesterlundHow would you feel if your therapist’s notes – your darkest thoughts and deepest feelings – were exposed to the world? For 33,000 Finnish people, that became a terrifying reality, with deadly consequencesByJenny KleemanSat 17 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTShareTiina Parikka was half-naked when she read the email. It was a Saturday in late October 2020, and Parikka had spent the morning sorting out plans for distance learning after a Covid outbreak at the school where she was headteacher. She had taken a sauna at her flat in Vantaa, just outside Finland’s capital, Helsinki, and when she came into her bedroom to get dressed, she idly checked her phone. There was a message that began with Parikka’s name and her social security number – the unique code used to identify Finnish people when they access healthcare, education and banking. “I knew then that this is not a game,” she says.The email was in Finnish. It was jarringly polite. “We are contacting you because you have used Vastaamo’s therapy and/or psychiatric services,” it read. “Unfortunately, we have to ask you to pay to keep your personal information safe.” The sender demanded €200 in bitcoin within 24 hours, otherwise the price would go up to €500 within 48 hours. “If we still do not receive our money after this, your information will be published for everyone to see, including your name, address, phone number, social security number and detailed records containing transcripts of your conversations with Vastaamo’s therapists or psychiatrists.”Parikka swallows hard as she relives this memory. “My heart was pounding. It was really difficult to breathe. I remember lying down on the bed and telling my spouse, ‘I think I’m going to have a heart attack.’”Someone had hacked into Vastaamo, the company through which Parikka had accessed psychotherapy. They’d got hold of therapy notes containing her most private, intimate feelings and darkest thoughts – and they were holding them to ransom. Parikka’s mind raced as she tried to recall everything she’d confided during three years of weekly therapy sessions. How would her family react if they knew what she’d been saying? What would her students say? The sense of exposure and violation was unfathomable: “It felt like a public rape.”Therapy had been Parikka’s lifeline. Now 62, she’d had three children by the time she was 25, including twins who had been born extremely prematurely in the 1980s, weighing only a few hundred grams each. One grew up with cerebral palsy; the other is blind. Parikka spent years juggling medical emergencies, surgeries and hospital stays with a demanding job and a crumbling marriage. “During those years, nobody ever asked me, the mother, ‘How are you?’”View image in fullscreen‘My heart was pounding. It was really difficult to breathe … It felt like a public rape’: Tiina Parikka.Photograph: Juuso Westerlund/The GuardianShe divorced in 2014 and met her current partner a year later. By then, her children were adults with independent lives. After decades of putting everyone’s else’s needs before her own, she should have been finally able to exhale. Instead, she had a breakdown. “I had full-scale anxiety running through my body all the time. I couldn’t sleep. I had panic attacks. I couldn’t eat.” Driving at high speed on the highway one day, dark thoughts descended. “I was thinking, I wouldn’t mind if this car crashed.”In search of urgent help, she went to Google, which led her to Vastaamo, Finland’s one-stop digital shop for people in search of psychotherapy. No doctor referral was necessary. She managed to book a session for the very next day. “It was that easy.”Being able to confide in a total stranger felt liberating. She told her therapist things she had never told another soul. “Trauma in relationships. The disappointment and tragedy of having disabled children, and the influence it had on my life,” she says. “Silly things, childish things. It’s very human to feel hate, anger, rage.”After Parikka read the email that left her struggling to breathe, she had no idea where to turn for help. She rang the emergency services, but the police told her to get off the line; they needed to keep it free for real emergencies. In her bathrobe, her phone still in her hand, she felt utterly alone.But Parikka was far from alone. Across Finland, 33,000 people who had used Vastaamo were discovering that a hacker had got hold of their therapy notes and was holding them to ransom. These were people who, by definition, were likely to be vulnerable, in need of help. Each was experiencing a very personal, individual terror. In a country of only 5.6 million people, everyone knows someone who was hacked.Some victims’ notes had already been cherrypicked for the world to see. Three days before the extortion emails were sent, someone using the handle ransom_man had left posts on the dark web, on r/Suomi, the Finnish-language subreddit, and on Ylilauta, Finland’s equivalent to4chan. This time, the post was in English.“Hello Finnish Colleagues,” it began. “We have hacked the psychotherapy clinic vastaamo.fi and taken tens of thousands of patient records including extremely sensitive session notes and social security numbers. We requested a small payment of 40 bitcoins (nothing for a company with yearly revenues close to 20 million euros) but the CEO has stopped responding to our emails. We are now starting to gradually release their patient records, 100 entries every day.”There was a link to the dark web, where 100 records were already on display. Directly below it, ransom_man had signed off the post with a single word: “Enjoy!”Lawyers know of cases where people took their own lives after they discovered their therapy notes had been hackedThe 100 records included those of politicians, police officers and prominent public figures. Their names appeared alongside therapy notes that contained details of adultery, suicide attempts, paedophilia and sexual violence. Some of the records belonged to children. And whoever was behind the hack was true to their word: the next day, 100 more patient records were uploaded.Some victims went searching on the dark web in a desperate attempt to see if their records were out there. Some paid the ransom, scrabbling to get hold of bitcoin while the clock ticked down. Lawyers representing the victims have told me they know of at least two cases where people took their own lives after they discovered their therapy notes had been hacked.But for all of them, it was already too late. At 2am on 23 October 2020 – the day before the emails began to arrive in tens of thousands of inboxes – ransom_man had uploaded a much larger file. It contained every record of every single patient on Vastaamo’s database. Everyone’s therapy notes had already been published, for free, for everyone in the world to see.Who was behind the biggest crime Finland had ever known? And might they have been motivated by something other than money? I have spent 18 months trying to answer these questions, following threads across Europe and the US. They culminated in a visit to a prison, and one of the most chilling conversations I have ever had.Finland has beenranked the happiest country on Earthby the UN for the last eight years in a row. A world leader inchildcareand education, Finland is also famously hi-tech: it’s themost digitalised countryin Europe, renowned for its communications sector (as the home of Nokia) and leading the way when it comes to cybersecurity and AI innovation. But Finland is also a place of extremes. It hasmore heavy metal bands per capitathan any other nation. In the far north, for the few days around the winter solstice, the sundoes not rise.Vastaamo had long been considered an example of how Finland was getting it right when it came to digital tech. Founded in 2008 by entrepreneur Ville Tapio and his mother, Nina, a psychotherapist, the aim was to open up therapy to the masses, removing the stigma of asking for help. The platform made it easy for people to see who was free, where, and what therapeutic approach they specialised in. The logo had the colour palette of a first-aid kit, with white lettering in a green speech bubble. Vastaamo means “a place for answers”.It was an attractive platform for therapists, too: they didn’t have to worry about marketing or billing – Vastaamo would take care of all of that. The company even provided a behind-the-scenes digital interface where therapists could make and store their notes. This formula, combined with the increasing demand for therapy services, meant Vastaamo grew fast. It opened its own network of around 20 clinics across Finland, employingmore than 220 psychotherapistsby 2018, leading some in Finland to refer to it as “the McDonald’s of therapy”. In the years before Zoom and Teams were part of our daily lives, the remote therapy also offered by Vastaamo was groundbreaking. In 2019, a private equity firm bought a majority stake in the company, earning the Tapio family a payout ofmore than €5m.Meri-Tuuli Auer, 30, describes using Vastaamo as “like Uber for therapy – convenient, accessible, relatively cheap”. She picked her therapist because he offered cognitive psychotherapy – and she liked his photo. “He looked nice. He looked approachable.”Auer’s home, on the outskirts of Helsinki, is a riot of pink. There are Barbie dolls, Barbie books and Barbie-themed handbags on her shelves, as well as a glittery open-top Barbie sports car. A pole-dancing pole takes pride of place in the centre of her living room.“I’m a mixed personality,” she tells me over tea in Moomin mugs. “I love being around people, but I get that inkling, that doubt: maybe they all think I’m full of shit and stupid and ugly and I have no idea what I’m doing.” Auer has struggled with depression for much of her life. When she was 18, she was in a secretive, difficult relationship with a man 29 years her senior, which made her self-esteem plummet further. She was drinking heavily. “If I hadn’t gone to therapy, I don’t know what would have become of me. Maybe there is another universe where I didn’t make it to 30.”View image in fullscreen‘I closed myself in at home, I didn’t want anyone to see me’: Meri-Tuuli Auer.Photograph: Juuso Westerlund/The GuardianMost of the cost of Auer’s treatment was covered by the Finnish healthcare system; she paid only about €25 for each weekly session. She was making great strides. “After going to therapy in 2018 and 2019, I had gained a basic sense of security. That was lost in 2020.”Vastaamo’s CEO knew the company’s patient registry was being held to ransom weeks before his customers found out. On 28 September 2020, Ville Tapio received an email demanding the bitcoin equivalent of €450,000 to keep it safe. Sample patient records attached to the email proved the extortionist wasn’t bluffing. Tapio called in a cybersecurity firm to investigate.Medical information is an obvious target for would-­be extortionists, says Antti Kurittu, the security specialist Tapio hired. But this was something else: “Whatever I tell a therapist is, by its very nature, a lot more private than what my blood pressure is,” he says, drily.Kurittu used to be a detective, investigating cybercrimes for the Finnish police; he says he insisted they be told about the ransom attempt so they could begin a parallel investigation. Meanwhile, he began inspecting Vastaamo’s server, looking for clues as to who might be behind the hack – and one of the first things he noticed was how lax security had been. “It was definitely unfit for purpose for storing this kind of information,” he says. He tells me that the patient records database was accessible via the internet; there was no firewall and, perhaps most egregiously, it was secured with a blank password, so anyone could just press enter and open it. Kurittu determined that whoever had hacked Vastaamo had probably just been scanning the internet in search of any badly secured databases that could be monetised. “They tried a bunch of bank vaults to see which ones were open, and just happened to stumble on this one.”Our worst secrets – things we might really, really not want to share with the entire world – they exist onlineFor a few weeks, the hacker and Vastaamo exchanged emails, but there was no question that Vastaamo would pay the ransom. If they did, they’d have to trust a criminal’s word that the records had been destroyed – plus, Kurittu says, it goes against the national character. “Finns are a bit of a belligerent bunch. We’re not known for paying ransom quietly or easily, which I take great national pride in.”After ransom_man started leaking patient records to put pressure on the company, Kurittu kept a close eye on the server being used to publish them. He had a hunch whoever was behind this was either Finnish, or had lived in Finland for a long time: they knew which famous names to flaunt from the patient records.When Auer learned about the hack, she downloaded a browser that would enable her to access the dark web, for the first time in her life. “I was thinking to myself, I just have to see if my records are there.” She found her name wasn’t among the first batch posted, and closed the file without reading anyone’s records. But she saw other people discussing what they’d seen. “People had already picked – in their opinion – the funniest parts from the patient records. They were laughing at these people’s misery. A 10-year-old child had gone to therapy, and people found it funny.”Auer began to spiral. “I closed myself in at home, I didn’t want to leave, I didn’t want anyone to see me,” she tells me. She had no hope that the hacker would ever be found. “It’s not that I don’t trust the police in Finland – it’s just that it seemed like an impossible task.”But the much larger file ransom_man had uploaded to the dark web – the one that contained every single one of Vastaamo’s patient records – also included vital clues to his identity. The first three batches of therapy notes had been posted manually, but when the hacker had tried to automate the process, he had not only accidentally uploaded all of the therapy notes, but also his entire home folder. It had appeared only briefly before it was taken down, along with a post that read “whoopsie :D”, but ransom_man had screwed up.“After spending several evenings with the file, I had the feeling I’d seen this kind of thing before,” Kurittu says. The data on the hacker’s home drive wasn’t systematically organised and arranged in folders, as you would expect from someone for whom extortion was a business. “It had that sort of chaotic, passionate hobby feeling to it.” And there was something about the childish way ransom_man had named some of the files that was eerily familiar (the one containing all the patient data was entitled “therapissed”).Kurittu’s mind went back to 2013 when he was a senior detective constable for the Helsinki police, and the file names he’d seen on a computer he’d seized from a 16-year-old boy. “It made me think of Julius Kivimäki.”Aleksanteri Kivimäki – who used to go by his middle name, Julius, or the online handle zeekill – had long been notorious among cybersecurity investigators. Not because of any particular talent as a hacker, but because he seemed prepared to go further than most who spend their time in the darkest parts of the internet.Aged 14, Kivimäki was involved with a group called Hack the Planet (named after the tagline of the 1995 movie Hackers). They would break into big companies and show off what they had managed to steal online. “It was for the LOLs,” says Blair Strater, a former hacker from Illinois who hung out with Kivimäki in internet relay chat forums at that time. “You notice that something is open and you just take it. It’s not targeted.”This kind of hacking was about impressing others – winning online clout, not extorting money. But some of those involved may have felt they were also serving a noble purpose: exposing security vulnerabilities in major corporations, or the hypocrisy of cybersecurity firms who claimed to be qualified to advise businesses while being unable to secure their own network.Strater found Kivimäki amusing, at first. “A lot of the things he did early on were objectively funny,” he tells me over Zoom from his home in Illinois. When I ask Strater whetherIwould find them funny, he clarifies that his humour was an acquired taste best suited to 4chan. But in 2010, when Strater was 17 and Kivimäki was 14, they fell out over which one of them was going to publish a report of a recent hack.Orders of pizzas and Chinese takeaway began arriving at the home Strater shared with his parents and younger sister on the outskirts of Chicago; when they opened the door, the delivery driver would ask for Julius Kivimäki. “Taxis were ordered. Hookers were ordered,” Strater says. “My father had to send away a big dump truck filled with gravel.” Strater received a blizzard of letters from credit card and insurance companies, and government agencies, including one from the department of social security confirming that an appointment with the welfare office had been created for him and his spouse – Julius Kivimäki.Then, at 2am one morning, police in body armour carrying guns with laser sights turned up outside the Straters’ home, responding to reports that Blair had beaten his mother to death in a drug-fuelled rage. When she answered the door, they took her blood pressure to verify that she was, in fact, alive. It was the first of dozens of so-called swatting attacks the family would endure. After a lull of a couple of months, Strater learned that someone using his name had emailed a bomb threat to a local police officer; it led to Strater spending three weeks over Christmas in a juvenile detention centre.Several years into their feud, in 2015, someonehacked Elon Musk and Tesla’s Twitter accounts,and tweeted that anyone who rang the Straters’ landline or showed up at their home would get a free car; their phone rang off the hook for days, and Blair’s father had to turn several disappointed people away from their porch. Someone using Blair’s mother’s name posted a threat to shoot up the elementary school where his 10-year-old sister was a pupil. His mother’s LinkedIn and Twitter accounts were hacked and filled with juvenile, racist posts, as well as antisemitic insults directed at the company where she worked as a healthcare statistician. Within months, she had lost her job.The campaign of terror lasted for many more years. Strater says it’s never going to be fully over. “It’s like having cancer: it’s never really cured, it goes into remission,” he says. “Every so often, someone would hit me up and say, ‘Hey, I was one of the people that helped Julius do these things.’ Sometimes they would say, ‘He made me do them. He was blackmailing me,’ which is something he does to an awful lot of people. I want to make this very clear: I am not the person zeekill fucked with the most.”Indeed, Kivimäki set his sights far beyond the Strater family. In August 2014 – days after his 17th birthday – he rang ina fake bomb threatthat grounded a flight carrying John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment, who oversaw PlayStation’s multiplayer network. A group calling themselves Lizard Squad claimed responsibility, posting almost nonsensically on Twitter that the attack was in sympathy with Islamic State. Lizard Squad struck again, on 25 December 2014, with a cyber-attack that shut down Xbox and PlayStation, and ruined Christmas morning for millions. Brazenly, Kivimäki gave interviews toBBC 5 LiveandSky Newsas a Lizard Squad spokesperson, claiming they did the hack both to amuse themselves and to expose Microsoft and Sony’s poor cybersecurity. He seemed to revel in the chaos and drama. He appeared on camera on Sky News; he used a fake name, but his boyish face – blond hair, blue eyes, plump cheeks – was visible for all to see.In July 2015, following Kurittu’s investigation with the Finnish police, Kivimäki was convicted of hacking into servers at MIT and Harvard universities, as well as money laundering and fraud. He wasfound guiltyof more than 50,000 data breaches, and received a two-year suspended sentence; he had his computer confiscated and was forced to pay back more than €6,000 obtained through his crimes. He never faced justice for any of the offences he perpetrated against Blair Strater and his family.Shortly after he received his suspended sentence, Kivimäki updated his Twitter bio to read “untouchable hacker god”.Kivimäki spent the next few years travelling the world. During lockdown, he lived in an air-conditioned apartment in Westminster, 20 metres away from the central London headquarters of MI5. There were trips to Dubai, Hong Kong, Barcelona and Paris. According to the images of himself he liked to post online, he was living the life of an international jetsetter. But he was not, in the end, untouchable.Police made a micropayment of 0.1 bitcoins to ransom_man. They were able to determine that, when it was laundered into real-world currency, it was transferred into Kivimäki’s bank account. The home folder ransom_man had accidentally uploaded had led the police to some servers, one of which had been paid for using a credit card linked to him – the same one he’d been using to pay for Apple services and an OnlyFans subscription.As investigators traced the history on ransom_man’s home folder, they were able to determine that, as well as looking for keywords such as rape, abuse and child molestation in the database of patient records, the hacker had also searched for Kivimäki’s home address, and the names of his family members. “Before publication, he ensured there was no harmful information about him, or people close to him,” Pasi Vainio, the lead prosecutor on the case, tells me. Those searches took place using an IP address linked to Kivimäki’s Westminster apartment. “He was in London when the crimes were committed.”But it was a drawn-out, arduous investigation. There were terabytes of data to comb through. The crime had so many victims that the police had to create an online portal for everyone to register and give their statements. That generated more than 21,000 criminal reports, all of which needed to be looked at individually. So it was October 2022 – two years after Parikka, Auer and the other victims had received their ransom demands – before Vainio signed an arrest warrant for Kivimäki. His face – chubby-cheeked and floppy-haired – was added to Europol’s list of most-wanted fugitives, alongside murderers and drug traffickers.On 3 February 2023, French police were alerted to a report of domestic violence taking place in a flat in a Paris suburb. Officers used a battering ram to enter the property and found a man and a woman inside. The man was pale and white-blond, but when asked to identify himself he handed over a Romanian passport that gave his name as Asan Amet. “We have a Scandinavian-looking guy, 195cm tall,” Vainio tells me with a smile. “I think the French police just thought something’s off.” They searched their databases and discovered Amet was one of Kivimäki’s known aliases. He was handed over to the Finnish authorities a few weeks later.View image in fullscreenAleksanteri Kivimäki photographed in prison in February 2024.Photograph: Juuso Westerlund“I don’t know what I had expected, but I was surprised to see that he looked so normal,” Auer says. “He looks like a regular Finnish young man. It did make me feel like it could have been anyone.”“I had heard that he was in a court hearing,” Parikka says. “We have a habit – every night at 8.30pm, I’ll lie here on the couch with my spouse and watch the main news. Without warning, Kivimäki was there on the screen. Kivimäki came to my living room.” She glances over to her couch, metres away from where we sit, and is overcome with tears.“I didn’t sleep the next night.”But when the trial began, in November 2023, Parikka was determined to watch Kivimäki face justice. The logistics of inviting more than 21,000 registered victims to court were impossible; instead, proceedings were relayed to public spaces such as cinemas so that the plaintiffs could watch in real time. In a case that was all about the right to privacy and anonymity, it sounds a profoundly awkward setup. “We were all sitting far away from each other,” Auer says. “It was dead silent.” Parikka had a similar experience. “We pretty much kept to ourselves.”On 30 April 2024, Kivimäki was found guilty of all charges – including 9,600 counts of aggravated invasion of privacy and more than 21,300 counts of attempted aggravated extortion – and sentenced to six years and three months in prison: a long stretch by Finnish standards, but shy of the seven-year maximum he could have received. His appeal against his sentence is currently under way.Even if his conviction is upheld, he will be a free man by the end of this year.“The sentencing scale is too low, in my opinion. But that’s the framework we have in Finland,” Vainio says. He tells me a colleague has tried to quantify the harm caused, using the conservative estimate that each person had endured a week of agony as a result of the hack. “When you multiply it with the number of victims of this case, you would have 635 years of suffering.”Now 28, Kivimäki has served much of his sentence in a spotless, bright but suitably austere facility in Turku, south-west Finland, a two-hour train ride from Helsinki. For months, he had refused to grant me an interview, but while I am in Finland reporting this story, he changes his mind. As I sit in silence in the prison’s visitor room for what feels like hours, watching the clock tick down behind a panel of reinforced glass, I wonder if Kivimäki is trolling me; if he has dragged me over here simply to derail the other interviews I already had scheduled, with no intention of ever leaving his cell. But after 40 minutes he appears. With his white-blond hair, ice-blue eyes and razor burn, and dressed in a black T-shirt and shorts, he looks like an overgrown teenage boy.He didn’t do it, he says; he’s simply a victim of his own notoriety. “They had to find somebody. They just chose somebody who was convenient for the story.” When I point out that there’s an enormous amount of circumstantial evidence linking him to the hack, Kivimäki is defiant. “The obvious answer is that it’s just somebody close to me.” He has an idea who it is, he continues, but he isn’t prepared to name names.Life after the Ashley Madison affairRead moreIt seems very selfless to do time for someone else’s crime, I say. I tell him Parikka says having her therapy notes held to ransom felt like a public rape. “I’m sure that’s how she felt,” he replies, blankly. “It’s quite remote to me. I’m involved, in that I was in court over this stuff, but I didn’t do it. It’s another story in the news.”As a fellow human being rather than the person convicted of the crime, I ask, what’s your response to people taking their lives after having their therapy notes stolen? “There’s a lot of terrible things going on in the world. I don’t really feel any differently about this. I turn on the news and there’s people dying in Gaza or wherever. It’s like, how do you feel aboutthat? I think the honest answer for most people is that they just …don’t.” You don’t have anything to say to the victims? “Not really,” he replies. “These are nameless, faceless people.”“There’s been just one question that I would ask Kivimäki,” Parikka says. “That would be: ‘Was there ever such a moment that you felt empathy?’ I don’t think he’s able to put himself into anybody else’s situation.” She pauses. “I think that he really needs therapy.”Vastaamo wasdeclared bankruptin February 2021. Days after patients received the ransom emails, the board announced that it had let the CEO, Ville Tapio, go. In April 2023, Tapio wasfound guiltyof criminal negligence in his handling of patient data. His conviction was overturned on appeal in December 2025. (He declined my requests to interview him.)“I have actually been more angry towards Ville Tapio than I have been towards Kivimäki,” Auer says. “As CEO of the company, he had the responsibility to make sure that it was prepared for all kinds of risks, and that they had sufficient information security. It seems like it was never a priority to him.” What was his priority?“Making money. He ran a very successful business.”“I believe that originally the Tapios were wanting to help people and make therapy available,” Parikka says. “There are now maybe thousands of people who will never use therapy again, because they can never trust. And that’s really bad.”Alongside more than 6,000 other plaintiffs, Auer and Parikka are part of a civil case suing Kivimäki for damages. Despite the lifestyle he projects online, he claims not to have the funds to pay damages; so far, no one has been able to find his assets. The government has agreed to pay compensation to victims – anything froma few hundred euros to a few thousand,depending on how many pages of their therapy notes Vastaamo had in its database, and how sensitive the information contained in those pages was – but the sum is likely to be symbolic. How can you ever repay the damage of being exposed in this way?Copies of the patient files have been circulating ever since they were first released in October 2020. At one point, someone created a special search engine for browsing the database. This doesn’t surprise Parikka. “Kivimäki isn’t just one of a kind,” she says. “I know human curiosity. People want to know.”Other people are as prepared as Kivimäki was to break moral and legal boundaries – for money, for online clout, out of ghoulish curiosity or simply for the LOLs. In May, Finnish policeannouncedthat there was a second suspect in the Vastaamo case, a US citizen living in Estonia – suspected of aiding and abetting Kivimäki, helping prepare the files. He has been charged with assisting in the attempted extortion.In an era when AI models aretrained on our Zoomconversations,emailsand status updates, it is naive to believe that anything can ever be fully secure. The human need to confide in others can be met in an extraordinary range of ways in the digital age. In a world of unparalleled connectivity, can our innermost secrets ever be truly safe?Kivimäki thinks we are all clinging on to analogue expectations about privacy in a digital world. “So many of our worst secrets – I meanworstof worst, things we might really, really not want to share with the entire world – they exist online. They’ll exist in the database of some company you used,” he tells me. “Everybody’s photos, everybody’s text-messaging histories.” He fixes me with his eyes. “You fundamentally want to believe in this privacy. But, on the other hand, I don’t know how you’re going to get there.”Intrigue: Ransom Man, Jenny Kleeman’s six-part series for BBC Radio 4, is availablenow on BBC Sounds.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeCyberbullyingCounselling and therapyInternetMental healthFinlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Department of Homeland Security justified the decision by claiming that immigrants from these countries are at “high risk” of reliance on welfare and becoming a “public charge”.As an immigration scholar, I was immediately struck by the falsehood of this economic justification. The vast majority of immigrants have beenlegally disqualifiedfrom cash welfare since 1996. Those who do qualify for benefits like Snap and Medicaid use them atmuch lower ratesthan non-immigrants. Through their taxes, immigrants arenet contributors– especiallyundocumented immigrantswho are excluded from federal benefits.I also noted a pattern uniting the countries on the list: nearly all were also restricted through the 1924 Immigration Act’sracial quotas.Abolished in 1965, due to the civil-rights movement’s demands for equality of all races under the law, racial quotas were at the heart of the1924 Immigration Act, also called the Johnson-Reed Act, which for four decades restricted immigration to the United States on the basis of nation of origin.Claudette Colvin’s life should teach us this: resistance is collective, and it never stops | Gary YoungeRead moreAlbert Johnson, its lead author, was a representative from Washington, and a eugenicist, whobelieved that“our capacity to maintain our cherished institutions stands diluted by a stream of alien blood”. Johnson, whoboasted about participatingin Ku Klux Klan violence against south Asians, wrote the Immigration Act to exclude anyone who was not a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.The 1924 law set a cap on total immigration to just a fifth of the pre-first world war number. It used the 1890 census to determine annual quotas for who could come from where, allocating nearly nine out of 10 slots to people from northern and western Europe, with the remaining largely set aside for people from southern and eastern Europe. Asians were totally barred, save for a few slots for people from the Levant, and total African admissions were capped at 1,200 people each year.The Immigration Actalso establishedthe category of “illegal alien” for the first time, as well as visa requirements. An accompanying act later that year allocated funds for the first border patrol.Trump’s rhetoric almost a century later bears a jarring resemblance to Johnson’s. The president has also claimed that immigrants are “poisoning the nation’s blood.” He too hassaid thathe prefers the “nice people” of Sweden, Norway and Denmark to people from “filthy, dirty, disgusting” countries like Somalia.The Johnson and Trump policies also developed in similar ways. Just as this administration is evoking the specter of immigrants becoming a “public charge”, and instructingconsular officersto test immigrant’s English through an interview, Johnson ushered through a bill in 1917, as a precursor to the 1924 Immigration Act, that excluded anyone who was a “public charge” and required a literacy test for immigrants. Both sets of policies demanded more stringent testing on immigrant health – Johnson was aproponentof sterilizing the mentally disabled.At the time, the Johnson-Reed Act was very popular. It passed withover 80%support in both houses of Congress. And it was signed into law by Calvin Coolidge, who believed that “America must be kept American”, echoing the mantra of the Ku Klux Klan, which was aproponent of the law.The Immigration Act achieved its goals of keeping America white and stopping migration. In the coming four decades, immigration to the United States would come to a screeching halt, dropping from 13% foreign-born in the 1920s to less than 5% in 1970. That year, the US was87.5% white.By contrast, today15%of people in the US are foreign-born, and the country is57.8% white. The concern that the United States could becomemajority non-whiteas of 2045 is likely a driving force for Project 2025’smass deportation visionthat Trump is enacting today.Then, like now, refugees were also denied. In one harrowing example, in 1939, more than 900 Jewish passengers aboard theSS St Louiswere forced to return to Europe, almost a quarter of whom later died in Nazi concentration camps. Even after the horrors of the Holocaust were fully revealed, it was not until 1948 that the United States took in Jewish refugees, and even then, just 200,000 people. Signing that bill into law, Harry Truman described himselfas reluctant, denouncing the bill’s restrictions as antisemitic and xenophobic.It is no surprise then that Adolf Hitler, who wrote about the Johnson-Reed Act in Mein Kampf, praised it, writing that the US was the “one state” that “simply excludes the immigration of certain races”.A century later, the 1924 Immigration Act still has fans. Stephen Miller, thearchitectof Trump’s mass deportation policy as the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser,has praisedCoolidge and the four decades of low immigration to the United States.With the return of immigration to the United States after the abolition of racial quotas in 1965 cameeconomic growth. New arrivals breathed life into US industryat all levels, injecting trillions of dollars into the economy, and filling key labor shortages. Yet, as the number of non-white people increased, pathways to admissions narrowed. The United States spent three times as much on the detention of immigrant detention as adjudicating immigrants’ claims. The idea that Trump is closing an open border belies the fact that $410bn has been spent on border securitization alone in the last two decades.None of these facts matter. The purpose of this immigration ban, like theother travel bansthis administration has passed, has nothing to do with economics. Just as the mass deportation agenda hasnothing to dowith immigrant criminality – which has longbeen a myth. The purpose of this latest immigration ban is to whiten the nation, period, just as was the purpose of the ban a century prior. This administration has said and has shown time and time again that there is “no price tag” on accomplishing this goal.But just as this latest immigration ban has precedent in US history, so too does the resistance to it. We can learn from the civil rights movement, from the Black led multiracial coalition that insisted that the rights of all people of color were deeply connected, that they needed to be treated equally under the law. We can recognize too that the work of that movement continues, that the white supremacy it fought is enduring, and that we need to organize and protest, and fight for a system that once and for all refuses enduring racist reasoning, and recognizes the humanity of all.Explore more on these topicsRaceOpinionUS immigrationDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The capture of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, dominated headlines for a while but it hasn’t stopped the ghost of Epstein from haunting Donald Trump.All the chest-beating around annexing Greenland doesn’t seem to be doing much to memory-hole the Epstein files either. During a visit to a Ford plant in Michigan this week, Trump was heckled by an autoworker who reportedly called the president a “pedophile protector”. And Shawn Ryan, an influential podcaster, who supported Trump’s 2024 run, also publicly accused the president of “protecting pedophiles” by not fully releasing the Epstein files. “I voted to get these damn files released, and it’s like a total 180 just happened,”Ryan complainedon a podcast released Thursday. Your first problem, sir, was ever believing a word the convicted felon said.The newest plan to take the heat off Trump’s Epstein connection? Judging by recent events, it seems to be to try and make us all focus on the Clintons’ Epstein links instead.While things escalated this week, the Trump administration has been slinging mud at Bill Clinton for a while. Which, to be fair, isn’t difficult to do, considering the Democratic former president’spersonal history, and his well-documented ties with Epstein. The disgraced financier visited the White Houseat least 17 timesduring the early years of Clinton’s presidency. The pair also travelled together. However, Clinton maintains that (unlike several other powerful people) he cut ties with Epstein in 2005, before the sex offender pleaded guilty to solicitation of a minor in Florida. Clinton has never been formally accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Trump administration, however, has done a lot of informal accusing. Last year the Department of Justice released a number of photos of Clinton alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, postedone photo on X in Decemberwith the caption“Oh my!”And, lastAugust, the House oversight committee issued subpoenas to Bill and Hillary Clinton, along with various others, demanding “testimony related to horrific crimes perpetrated byJeffrey Epstein”.“Given your past relationships with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, the Committee believes that you have information regarding their activities that is relevant to the Committee’s investigation,” the committee’s Republican chair, James Comer, wrote in a letter to Bill Clinton. A much vaguer version of this letter was issued toHillary Clinton.This week the Clintons made it clear they have no plans to cooperate with the committee’s investigation,announcingthey would not comply with the subpoena demanding testimony. Comersaid in responsethe committee would seek to hold both Clintons in criminal contempt of Congress.In a letter addressed to Comer, and posted onsocial mediaon Tuesday morning, the Clintons issued a scathing statement about the Trump administration and the contempt proceedings.“Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences,”the Clintons wrote. “For us, now is that time.”Oh, give me a break. I don’t doubt that the Trump Administration is going after the Clintons to create a sideshow, but isthisreally the moment when the power couple have decided that they’ve had enough? Spare me the sanctimony from two people who worked overtime tojustify(and deny) Israel’s genocide in Gaza. For many people in the US, seeing children in Gazaburned alivewith theirtaxpayer dollarswas when they stood up to fight for their principles, no matter theconsequences. For the Clintons, however, the moral red line seems to be harm to their personal brand. They are not fighting for the country here, they are fighting for themselves.This isn’t to say the Clintons should just quietly go along with this sham of an “investigation”. As the comedian Jon Stewart said this week, the Clintons should comply with the subpoenas, but only as part of a process where everyone is fully complying. “Why should [Clintons] comply if the Department of Justice is not complying with releasing the files?” Stewart said. “[But] do I personally think [the Clintons] should comply? Abso-fucking-lutely, absolutely. And if they’ve got something to hide nefarious, yes, we should know about all this. This is bonkers how long this is going on.” Quite.Anyway, here’s a little memo to Maga: focusing on the Clintons is not going to work for you. I’m sure the Clintons have some superfans but they don’t preside over a cult the way Trump does. If they have done anything immoral concerning Epstein, I think you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who thinks they should be shielded from consequences because they’re Democrats. The little stunt of holding the Clintons in contempt while theTrump administrationdrags its feet on releasing all the Epstein files just demonstrates the government’s contempt for the American public.California refuses to extradite doctor over abortion pillLouisiana officials have been trying to extradite a doctor in California who they claim sent abortion pills to the southern state. Medication abortion, to be clear,has been availablein the US since 2000 and decades of studies have shown it is safe and effective. However, Louisiana has banned almost all abortions and the state’s Republican attorney general has described sending abortion pills to the state as “illegal drug trafficking”. California has said there isno way an extraditionis happening.Renaming the Department of Defense the ‘Department of War’ could cost up to $125mThere always seems to be money fornonsense like thisand never any money for universal healthcare. Someone should create a “department of government efficiency” to look into this …Texas A&M University is banning Plato because of “gender ideology”The public research university has a new policy of restricting discussions of race and gender, which means around 200 courses have had to be revised. It turns out Plato’s Symposiumis problematicbecause of the “Myth of Androgyne,” in which Aristophanes describes three genders.Alabama library denied state funding because of inappropriate booksThe Fairhope public library will take a funding hit because it kept The Handmaid’s Tale and certain other booksin its teen section, rather than moving them to the adult section.How gender bias impacts math educationA new Rutgers University–New Brunswickstudyhas found that children are moreinclined to believeincorrect math information from men than accurate information from women. This plays into the well-documented “brilliance bias”: studies show girls as young as six think boys are more likely to be “really, really smart”.Mike Pompeo wants “to make sure history books don’t write about the victims of Gaza”The former US Secretary of Statereceived rapturous applauseat a pro-Israel conference on Tuesday after saying that “we need to make sure that the story [of October 7] is told properly so that when the history books write this, they don’t write about the victims of Gaza, right?” The good news for Pompeo is that journalism is supposed to be the first draft of history, and there is precious little journalism coming out of Gaza – by design. The international pressstillisn’tfreely allowed to report from Gaza, where babies are continuing tofreeze to death.The week in pawtriarchySome emu-sing news out of Florida, where police have been on the lookout for a runaway bird.

AI is putting others through my nightmareMara WilsonI was a child actor, exploited by strangers on the internet. Now millions of children face the same dangerSat 17 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 07.02 ESTShareWhen I was a little girl, there was nothing scarier than a stranger.In the late 1980s and early 1990s, kids were told, by our parents, by TV specials, by teachers, that there were strangers out there who wanted to hurt us. “Stranger Danger” was everywhere. It was a well-meaning lesson, but the risk was overblown:most child abuse and exploitation is perpetrated by people the children know. It’s much rarer for children to be abused or exploited by strangers.Rarer, but not impossible. I know, because I was sexually exploited by strangers.From ages five to 13, I was a child actor. And while as of late we’ve heard many horror stories about the abusive things that happened to child actors behind the scenes, I always felt safe while filming. Filmsets were highly regulated spaces where people wanted to get work done. I had supportive parents, and was surrounded by directors, actors, and studio teachers who understood and cared for children.The only way show businessdidendanger me was by putting me in the public eye. Any cruelty and exploitation I received as a child actor was at the hands of the public.“Hollywood throws you into the pool,” I always tell people, “but it’s the public that holds your head underwater.”Grok scandal highlights how AI industry is ‘too unconstrained’, tech pioneer saysRead moreBefore I was even in high school, my image had been used for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). I’d been featured on fetish websites and Photoshopped into pornography. Grown men sent me creepy letters. I wasn’t a beautiful girl – my awkward age lasted from about age 10 to about 25 – and I acted almost exclusively in family-friendly movies. But I was a public figure, so I was accessible. That’s what child sexual predators look for: access. And nothing made me more accessible than the internet.It didn’t matter that those images “weren’t me”, or that the fetish sites were “technically” legal. It was a painful, violating experience; a living nightmare I hoped no other child would have to go through. Once I was an adult, I worried about the other kids who had followed after me. Were similar things happening to the Disney stars, the Strangers Things cast, the preteens making TikTok dances and smiling in family vlogger YouTube channels? I wasn’t sure I wanted to know the answer.When generative AI started to pick up a few years ago, I feared the worst. I’d heard stories of “deepfakes”, and knew the technology was getting exponentially more realistic.Then it happened – or at least, the world noticed that it had happened. Generative AI has already been used many timesto create sexualized images of adult women without their consent.It happened to friends of mine. But recently, it was reported that X’s AI tool Grok had been used, quite openly,to generate undressed images of an underage actor. Weeks earlier, a girl was expelled from school for hitting a classmate who allegedly made deepfake porn of her,according to her family’s lawyers. She was 13, about the same age I was when people were making fake sexualized images of me.In July 2024,the Internet Watch Foundation found more than 3,500 images of AI-generated CSAM on a dark web forum. How many more thousands have been made in the year and a half since then?In order to stop the threat of a deepfake apocalypse, we need to look at how AI is trainedGenerative AI has reinvented Stranger Danger. And this time, the fear is justified. It is now infinitely easier for any child whose face has been posted on the internet to be sexually exploited. Millions of children could be forced to live my same nightmare.In order to stop the threat of a deepfake apocalypse, we need to look at how AI is trained.Generative AI “learns” by a repeated process of “look, make, compare, update, repeat”, says Patrick LaVictoire, a mathematician and former AI safety researcher. It creates models based on things it’s memorized, but it can’t memorize everything, so it has to look for patterns, and base its responses on that. “A connection that’s useful gets reinforced,” says LaVictoire. “One that’s less so, or actively unhelpful, gets pruned.”What generative AI can create depends on the materials the AI has been trained on. Astudy at Stanford Universityin 2023 showed that one of the most popular training datasets already contained more than 1,000 instances of CSAM. The links to CSAMhave since been removed from the dataset, but the researchers have emphasized that another threat is CSAM made by combining images of children with pornographic images, which is possible if both are in the training data.GoogleandOpenAIclaim to have safeguards in place to protect against the creation of CSAM: for instance, by taking care with the data they use to train their AI platforms. (It’s also worth noting that many adult film actors and sex workers have had their images scraped for AIwithout their consent.)Generative AI itself, says LaVictoire, has no way of distinguishing between innocuous and silly commands such as “make an image of a Jedi samurai” and harmful commands, such as “undress this celebrity”. So another safeguard incorporates a different kind of AI that acts similarly to a spam filter, which can block those queries from being answered. xAI, which runs Grok, seems to have been careless with that filter.And the worst may be yet to come:Metaandother companieshave proposed that future AI models be open source. “Open source” means anyone can access the code behind it, download it and edit it as they please. What is usually wonderful about open-source software – the freedom it gives users to create new things, prioritizing creativity and collaboration over profit – could be a disaster for children’s safety.Once someone downloaded an open-source AI platform and made it their own, there would be no safeguards, no AI bot saying that it couldn’t help with their request. Anyone could “fine-tune” their own personal image generator using explicit or illegal images, and make their own infinite CSAM and “revenge porn” generator.Meta seems to havestepped back from making its newer AI platforms open source. Perhaps Mark Zuckerberg remembered thathe wants to be like the Roman emperor Augustus, and that if he continued down this path, he might be remembered more as the Oppenheimer of CSAM.Some countries are already fighting against this. China was the first to enacta law that requires AI content to be labelled as such. Denmark is working on legislation that would give citizens the copyright to their appearances and voices, and would impose fines on AI platforms that don’t respect that. In other parts of Europe,and in the UK, people’s images may be protected by General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).The outlook in the United States seems much grimmer. Copyright claims aren’t going to help, because when a user uploads an image to a platform, they can use it however they see fit; it’s in nearly every Terms of Service agreement. Withexecutive orders against the regulation of generative AIand companies such as xAIsigning contracts with the US military, the US government has shown that making money with AI is far more important than keeping citizens safe.Therehasbeen some recent legislation “that makes a lot of this digital manipulation criminal”, says Akiva Cohen, a New York City litigator. “But also, a lot of those statutes are probably overly restrictive inwhatexactly they cover.”For example, while making a deepfake of someone that makes them appear nude or engaged in a sexual act could be grounds for criminal charges, using AI to put a woman – and likely even an underage girl – into a bikini probably would not.“A lot of this very consciously stays just on the ‘horrific, but legal’ side of the line,” says Cohen.Maybe it’s not criminal – that is to say, a crime against the state, but Cohen argues it could be a civil liability, a violation of another person’s rights, for which a victim requires restitution. He suggests that this falls under a “false light, invasion of privacy” tort, a civil wrong in which offensive claims are made about a person, showing them in a false light, “depicting someone in a way that shows them doing something they didn’t do”.“The way that you can really deter this type of conduct is by imposing liability on thecompaniesthat are enabling this,” Cohen says.There’s legal precedent for that: theRaise Actin New York, andSenate Bill 53in California, say that AI companies can be held accountable for harms they have done past a certain point. X, meanwhile,will now block Grokfrom making sexualized images of real people on the platform. But itappears that policy changedoesn’t apply to the stand-alone Grok app.But Josh Saviano, a former practicing attorney in New York, as well as a former child actor, believes more immediate actions need to be taken, in addition to legislation.“Lobbying efforts and our courts are eventually going to be the way that this is handled,” says Saviano. “But until that happens, there are two options: abstain entirely, which means take your entire digital footprint off the internet … or you need to find a technological solution. “Ensuring the safety of young people is of paramount importance to Saviano, who has known people who’ve had deepfakes of them,and – as a former child actor – knows a little about losing controlof one’s own narrative. Saviano and his team have been working on a tool that could detect and notify people when their images or creative work are being scraped. The team’s motto, he says, is: “Protect the babies.”Regardless of how it may happen, I believe that protection against this threat is going to take a lot of effort from the public.There are many who are starting to feel an affinity with their AI chatbots, but for most people, tech companies are nothing more than utilities. We may prefer one app over another for personal or political reasons, but few feel strong loyalty to tech brands. Tech companies, and especially social media platforms like Meta andX, would do well to remember that they are a means to an end. And if someone like me – who was on Twitter all day, everyday, for more than a decade – can quit it, anyone can.But boycotts aren’t enough. We need to be the ones demanding companies that allow the creation of CSAM be held accountable. We need to be demanding legislation and technological safeguards. We also need to examine our own actions: nobody wants to think that if they share photos of their child, those images could end up in CSAM. But it is a risk, one that parents need to protect their young children from, and warn their older children about.If our obsession with Stranger Danger showed anything, it’s that most of us want to prevent child endangerment and harassment. It’s time to prove it.Mara Wilson is a writer and actor living in Los AngelesExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)OpinionGrok AIXInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me … I don’t need international law.”Trump treats the spectacle as a reality TV show in which he is both the executive producer and the host who ultimately declares himself the winner. At his 3 January press conference on the day of Maduro’s seizure, Trump mentioned “oil” 27 times, “money” 13 times and “democracy” not once. He trashed the democratic opposition as lacking “respect” and “support”. The capture of Maduro was a decapitation, not regime change. Indeed, Trump served as a convenient agent of an internal coup of the existing powers, whom he declared “an ally”. “We have to fix the country first,” hesaid. “You can’t have an election.”Trump has dubbed his Venezuelan exploit as the “Donroe Doctrine”. It is of a piece with his rebranding of history, along with dropping mention of his impeachments from his picture caption at the National Portrait Gallery and coercing the Smithsonian not to focus on “how bad slavery was”. Hetoldthe Times that the civil rights movement of the 1960s resulted in “white people” being “very badly treated”. He presents himself anachronistically as the White Citizens’ Council president.His “Donroe Doctrine” runs against the intent of the author of the original Monroe Doctrine, the then secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, whostatedthat the United States “goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy … She might become the dictatress of the world. She would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.”Trump announced that he would “run” Venezuela, “money will be controlled by me” and he would control the oil industry there “indefinitely”. His White House released a photo imitating a Wikipedia page that depicted him as “The Acting President of Venezuela”.He invited CEOs of big oil companies to the White House to convince them to take the plunge into Venezuela, where the oil infrastructure is dilapidated and the oil resembles tar, difficult to extract and refine into usable products like gasoline. The ExxonMobil chieftoldTrump that realistically “it’s uninvestable” and that the country lacked a proper legal system.Trump interrupted his meeting to say, “We have many others that were not able to get in. I said, ‘If we had a ballroom, we’d have over a thousand people.’ I never knew you had that many people in your industry.” He got up to gaze from the East Room window at the gigantic hole in the ground he had made of the South Lawn, where his gargantuan ballroom is being constructed. “Wow! What a view. This is the door to the ballroom.” When he returned to his seat hecontinueddiscussing the ballroom. “I don’t think there’ll be anything like it in the world, actually.” Later, hesaidabout Venezuela, “I will probably be inclined to keep Exxon out.” Of course, Exxon did not want to go in. No matter. His foreign policy is like a vanity ballroom, or plastering “Trump” above the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Arts: schlock and awe.In the meantime, Trump has turned again to his dream of annexing, purchasing or invading Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, a Nato ally. The US has maintained military bases on Greenland under a separate agreement since 1951. “If we don’t do it the easy way, we’re going to do it the hard way,” said Trump. He told the Times that he must have “ownership”, which was “psychologically necessary for success”. The leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom issued a rebuke that Greenland “belongs to its people”. Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, would-be viceroy,declaredthat “nobody [is] going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.” Danish and Greenland officials told the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, there was a “fundamental disagreement”.Trump’s imperialism centers on his imperial self. Vladimir Lenin, in his determinist tract,Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism, published in 1917, saw finance capital driving colonialism in search of profits, leading to great power rivalry, the world war and “proletarian revolution”. Trump turns Lenin on his head. He drives the reluctant capitalists into freebooting imperialist adventures with uncertain consequences. Trump represents, in Leninist terms, the lowest stage of imperialism.His “Donroe” atavism fits with his other primitive throwback policies, from tariffs (recalling the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 that deepened the Great Depression) to immigration, racial discrimination and restriction (recalling the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924 excluding southern and eastern Europeans and barring Asians).While Trump strides across the stage posing as a world conqueror, the Quinnipiac pollshowshim to be an incredible shrinking man – 57% opposed to “running” Venezuela; 73% opposed to sending troops there; 55% opposed to taking over its oil sales; 86% opposed to militarily seizing Greenland; 55% opposed to buying it; and 70% against military action against Iran. According to the AP-NORCpoll, 61% disapprove of his foreign policy in general. The Reuters-Ipsospollshowed only 17% in favor of Trump acquiring Greenland and 4% in favor of military force.Public disapproval of Trump’s foreign policy now nearly equals thedisapprovalof his economic policy, on cost of living at minus 25 points. Trump has repeatedlyderidedthe reality of the “affordability crisis” as a “hoax”, “scam” or “con job”, lately on 13 January, as a “fake word”, as though he could magically make it vanish.The last thing that might occur to Trump is any historical lesson, especially a cautionary story about a president who was far more popular than he has ever been, achieved great military victories and yet was politically defeated.Shortly after President George HW Bush lost the election of 1992, I went to his White House to learn how the mighty had fallen from the pinnacle of victory in the Gulf war. I met with Richard Darman, one of the most thoughtful and capable people there, who had been at the center of both the Reagan and Bush administrations and was especially close to James Baker, who had left as secretary of state to take charge of Bush’s campaign at the end. Darman had been Reagan’s staff secretary, deputy secretary of the treasury to Baker, and under Bush the budget director. I had been speaking as a journalist with Darman since the start of the Reagan administration.Darman told me about the research that the Bush campaign had conducted that exposed the phenomenon of how the positive transformation of his image had become his undoing in public opinion. Darman’s story of a reversal of fortune casts an unexpected historical light on how the perception of Republicans in the forthcoming midterm elections as supine weaklings and Trump’s psychodrama as a strongman may combine to undermine them all. The performance of supreme power is not always what it seems.In October 1987, on the eve of the campaign when Bush would emerge from the vice-presidency,Newsweekpublished a cover story headlined, “Fighting the Wimp Factor”. “Bush suffers from a potentially crippling handicap – a perception that he isn’t strong enough or tough enough for the challenges of the Oval Office. That he is, in a single mean word, a wimp.” The story was wildly unfair to the college athlete, the second world war pilot who had been shot down and former CIA director, but it captured the awkward conundrum he faced as the Connecticut Yankee who donated to Planned Parenthood and ridiculed Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts as “voodoo economics” to remake himself into the Texas congressman opposed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and uncomfortably sought to assume Reagan’s mantle.Constrained by his belief that boastfulness was coarse, Bush’s overcompensation was embarrassing,half-jokinghe was a “pit bull”. On the eve of his invasion of Panama and seizure of its military dictator, Gen Manuel Noriega, Bush was subjected to scathing criticism. “Prudent Meets Timid”, ran the front-pageheadlinein the New York Times. The conservative columnist for the Washington Post, George Will, ripped “An Unserious Presidency”. A Democratic congressman stated, “There’s a resurgence of the wimp factor.” When Bush launched Operation Just Cause on 20 December 1989, he consulted with congressional leaders of both parties who gave their approval; Noriega, who had come to power through a coup, was removed; and the rightfully elected president took office. Bush’s popularity rose to 80% in the Gallup poll. Yet “the wimp factor” lingered.On 2 August 1990, Iraq’s dictator Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait to grab its vast oil reserves. The United Nations security council issued the ultimatum to withdraw or face “all necessary force”. In the Gulf war, a coalition of 43 countries led by the US defeated Saddam to restore Kuwait, but did not march to Baghdad or occupy Iraq. Bush’spopularitysoared to 89%, the highest of any president ever recorded. At last, he had vanquished “the wimp factor”.On 6 March 1990, Bushspoketo a joint session of the Congress, to proclaim “a victory for every country in the coalition, for the United Nations. A victory for unprecedented international cooperation and diplomacy … a victory for the rule of law.” The jubilant Republican members waved small American flags. The big-name potential Democratic presidential candidates declined to run.Darman explained to me that Bush’s Gulf war triumph had persuaded the public that he was not a “wimp”, but truly strong. They believed he was a leader with a steely core. When the recession deepened, they believed he was strong, but reasoned that he would not help them and became embittered against him. Enter Bill Clinton who felt their pain with his program of “Putting People First”.On its surface, Darman’s explanation seemed counterintuitive. Through a strange political alchemy, however, the stronger Bush appeared, the weaker he became. The greater his accomplishment loomed, the more he was diminished. His towering act was unquestioned, but led paradoxically to his political demise.When Bush lost, it was a commonplace that he had been a foreign policy president who neglected economic policy, that he was a patrician whose strained attempts to establish rapport with those falling into the vertigo of a recession – “Message: I care” – jangled as off-key. But it was not so simple. The metamorphosis of his image also propelled the dynamic.George W Bush remained a captive of his father’s dilemma, which he sought finally to dispel. His invasion of Iraq in an elusive quest to find and destroy weapons of mass destruction was widely understood at the time as “Unfinished Business”, asthe Economistput it, in part a reaction to his father’s war, followed by his political defeat, and the lingering smoke of the “wimp factor”.Donald Trump smashed the Bush legacy to gain control over the Republican party and recast it in his own image. Trump humiliated and shoved aside Jeb Bush, the family and party heir apparent, the brother of George W Bush and son of George HW Bush, and the former Florida governor, in a debate on 13 February 2016. “Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, all right?” Trumpsaid. He added, “They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction – there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.” Then Trump blamed the terrorist attack of September 11 on George W Bush. Jeb sputtered, “I am sick and tired of him going after my family.” Trumpsurgedto a two-to-one lead for the Republican nomination.After the death of Barbara Bush in early 2018, President Trump issued an official White Housestatementthat he would not attend her funeral. A frail George HW Bush was soon hospitalized. Trump trashed him at a rally, ridiculing Bush’s signature slogan for his program of voluntary civic engagement. “Thousand points of light,” Trumpsaid. “What does that mean? I know one thing. ‘Make America Great Again’ we understand. Putting America first we understand. Thousand points of light, I never quite got that one. What the hell is that? Has anyone ever figured that one out? It was put out by a Republican, wasn’t it?”Bush died a few months later. Trump’s insult was his imprimatur on his own Republican party that on bended knee pays him tribute or else. On 14 January, the Republican Senate, its internal dissenters crushed, blocked a resolution to require Trump to seek congressional approval for military force in Venezuela.So, the Republicans defer again to Trump, evade their constitutional role and careen heedlessly toward the midterm elections. They define themselves as weak and useless in service to his perceived unchallengeable strength. The more he struts, the more they falter; the more dramatically he postures, the weaker they are perceived. But the strongman, never thought to be a “wimp”, not only ignores the economic plight of the majority but displays open contempt.At the Detroit Economic Club on 13 January, Trump boasted that all is swell: “We’re the hottest country.” Trump has launched a criminal investigation of the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, whom he hasinsultedas “bonehead”, “low IQ”, “stupid”, “not a smart person”. Powell responded that the investigation was a “pretext” for political retaliation in Trump’s attempt to destroy the Fed’s independence and a threat to the economy’s stability.In Minneapolis, an ICE agent killed a US citizen, Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, driving away from a protest scene. Trump blamed her for her killing as “highly disrespectful of law enforcement”. A flood of ICE agents into the city has since fostered violent melees, which have provided the excuse for Trump to threaten to invoke the Insurrection Act. “Trump has made ICE a 70-30 issue – for Democrats,”statesthe pollster G Elliott Morris.Trump claims to stand above any and all restraints: “My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.” He has articulated his justification for his rapacious behavior from the intimacy of the Bergdorf Goodman dressing room to the icy expansive of Greenland. He is the Superman, theUbermensch.Trump’s brief words to frame his philosophy were better explained by Friedrich Nietzsche inBeyond Good and Evil, published in 1889, which later became an ur-text against the “slave-faith” of the Enlightenment and for Naziism and the cult of personality. Nietzsche contrasted the superior “master morality” with the “slave morality”. The “noble” and “aristocratic” master “does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: what is injurious to me is injurious in itself; he knows that it is he himself only who confers honor on things; he is a creator of values. He honors whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals self-glorification.” Nietzsche exalted this as the “DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER”. He wrote that “in real life it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.” He mocked the “enchained class of spirits” who spoke of “Equality of Rights” as well as the “Christian faith” as “self-mutilation”, leading to the “DETERIORATION OF THE EUROPEAN RACE”.It would be eminently safe to wager on the betting markets that Trump has never read Nietzsche or could offer the thinnest account of his work. Nonetheless, Trump has fashioned himself as a child of Nietzsche. A thousand points of light?

When we met, her message about the struggle was clearSat 17 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 07.06 ESTShare“In life, there’s the beginning and the end,” John Carlos, the African American sprinter who raised his fist in a black power salute from the podium of the 1968 Olympics, oncetold me. “The beginning don’t matter. The end don’t matter. All that matters is what you do in between – whether you’re prepared to do what it takes to make change. There has to be physical and material sacrifice. When all the dust settles and we’re getting ready to play down for the ninth inning, the greatest reward is to know that you did your job when you were here on the planet.”Claudette Colvin, whodied earlier this weekin a hospice in Texas, did her job while she was here on the planet, although it was several decades before her physical and material sacrifice was acknowledged. On 2 March 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, aged just 15, Colvin took a stand and refused to give up her bus seat to a white woman.The driver called the police, who kicked her a few times and then, when she still stayed put, took her to City Hall and charged her. Fred Gray, her lawyer, thought she would make a strong test case to end segregation in the city. But levels of hierarchy in the deep south did not stop at black and white. The church-led, male-dominated leadership considered Colvin a liability – not only was she young, rebellious and outspoken, she was dark-skinned in a world where shade mattered, and poor. “The black leadership in Montgomery at the time thought that we should wait,” said Gray.Nine months later, Rosa Parks suffered a similar fate after she too refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. Local leaders thought she was an ideal candidate: “I probably would’ve examined a dozen more before I got there if Rosa Parks hadn’t come along,” said a local leader, ED Nixon.In between the two arrests, Colvin fell pregnant and, for several decades, into the footnotes of history. When Iinterviewed herat her home in the Bronx 45 years later, she was working as a nurses’ aide in a care home in Manhattan, mostly unheard of and completely uncelebrated.“[There is] a system of power that is always deciding in the name of humanity who deserves to be remembered and who deserves to be forgotten,” the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano,once told me. “We are much more than we are told. We are much more beautiful.” Eventually, well into her 60s, Colvin’s story broke through that system. Her obituary this week appeared, among other places, in theNew York Times,the BBC,the Washington Post,Le Mondeand eventhe Telegraph.View image in fullscreenClaudette Colvin in Birmingham, Alabama, February 2021.Photograph: Tamika Moore/The GuardianThere are many lessons we might learn from Colvin’s life and brave actions, but for now I want to concentrate on just four that feel urgent and relevant. The first is that popular history is made by ordinary people, like Colvin, doing extraordinary things – but it is all too often written as though it were the work of saints in a crude morality play. This is not only untrue; it demeans everyone implicated, including the sanctified. In the case of the Montgomery bus boycott, Parks is depicted as a seamstress who just happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. “She was a victim of both the forces of history and the forces of destiny,” said Martin Luther King, who, as a young preacher in town, was chosen to lead the fightback. Parks wasnobody’s victim. She was a militant feminist and anti-racist who had a good personal relationship with Dr King, buther hero was Malcolm X. “I had almost a life history of being rebellious against being mistreated against my colour,” she said.Second, the fact that inequalities of race, class, gender and shade mean that some people are more likely to be honoured in history and promoted in politics, detracts not one iota from the bravery or salience of their actions.Last September, Silverio Villegas González was shot dead in Chicago by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent who claimed he feared for his life. Villegas González was an undocumented migrant and there is no video to contradict the ICE account. Renee Good, who was shot dead in Minneapolis last week by an ICE agent while peacefully protesting against an ICE raid, has beencommemorated around the world. The fact that Good was a white, US citizen of course plays a role in why she is remembered in a way that Villegas González and so many others are not. The challenge here is not to diminish her sacrifice and bravery, but to also call Villegas González’s name, as we should call Colvin’s. Colvin resented the fact that her protest left her vulnerable and she should have had more support. But she understood why they had championed Parks and not her. “They picked the right person,” she told me. “They needed someone who would bring together all the classes. They wouldn’t have followed me.”Third, that ultimately the story of Montgomery isn’t about Colvin or Parks, any more than the story of immigration rights is ultimately about Good or Villegas González. The struggle against segregation demanded organisation –most of it by women– and thousands working together, to make change. It was only after the black community boycotted the buses for 13 months that Montgomery’s local establishment finally relented. An individual may resist, butresistanceis collective.Finally, that resistance never stops. The very rights Colvin fought for are being rolled back today. Key elements ofcivil rightsandvoting rightsprotections are being reversed. Last weekDonald Trump saidhe thought civil rights had led to “white people [being] very badly treated”.When Colvin was asked if she would help promote the opening of the Rosa Parks museum on the grounds that it might bring her closure, she refused. “What closure can there be for me?” she asked me. “There is no closure. This does not belong in a museum, because this struggle is not over. We still don’t have all that we should have. And, personally, there can be no closure. They took away my life. If they want closure, they should give it to my grandchildren.”Gary Younge is a professor of sociology at the University of ManchesterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The war of words that laid waste to the 2026 Adelaide writers’ festivalRead moreThis is potentially even more dangerous than the implosion of the “international rules-based order”. It normalises heinous behaviour towards other human beings in a world that has never had greater capacity for self-destruction.You hear it everywhere. The tone is set when the US president declaressome people are scumor a Cameroonian “freedom fighter” succinctly says his opponents “don’t see us as human. Likewise we don’t see them as [human].”Australia, thanks to the work of Labor party leader Doc Evatt, was one of the midwives of the UN declaration of human rights. But Australia remains the only liberal democracy not to have adopted its own constitutional or statutory bill of rights. Instead there is a patchwork of local laws and international agreements.For all the talk about Australian values this absence is a telling reminder of the fragility of our rights as citizens and human beings.This has come into sharp focus in the debate after the Bondi attack, and the implosion of the Adelaide writers’ week.In the rush to blame, the principle is lost. When the threat feels existential, pluralism is attacked and tolerance as a virtue derided.The Australian commitment to human rights is always subject to political whim. Legislation protecting rights has been voided to allow racially charged laws to pass, including the Northern Territory intervention. States that have legislated to recognise rights, readily vacate the legislation to remove them from some groups – most frequentlyFirst Nations people.After years of work, legislation asserting the rights of artists – something that had been promised in the last South Australian election campaign – was introduced in 2025. But the parliament ran out of time to pass it. Among the principlesoutlined in the billwas that “all artists, makers and creatives in South Australia have the right to freedom of artistic and creative expression.” If this had been enacted, would it have changed the ground rules, and meant the conundrum played out differently?Last year, in recognition of the increasing fragility of the international commitment to human rights, the government appointed former attorney general and sitting MP Mark Dreyfus as an international human rights envoy.It would be good if he started his advocacyat home.Given the consensus is that Australian constitutional change is just too hard, a statutory bill of rights could have symbolic as well as practical impact. It would also strengthen Australian advocacy in a world where human rights are increasingly derided.This is not just a legal debate: human rights and empathy touch everything.In the tick-box world mediated by AI, it is likely to become even more pervasive. We know that the selection biases of technology are increasingly excluding people, ensuring the world order as it exists in the minds of technocrats is imposed on us all. They generally don’t do empathy or pay attention to people not like them.Much of the time we can work around this, but sometimes it is accentuated.Over the summer break I had two experiences that threw this into stark relief. Not the grand infringements of human rights that capture the headlines, but mundane encounters that point to the banal cruelty of a data-driven world in which empathy has evaporated and shades of grey no longer exist.In response to one of those slightly threatening robodebt-inflected Centrelink letters, I waited until I had the time to sit on a call (last time it took three hours) and was pleasantly surprised that after 38 minutesa human answered.I provided the required case number and then said, “But the person has died.”The operator proceeded: “Can you spell his name again … and the birth date … the reference number.” I did this, and then added: “I know you are working to a script, but when someone tells you the client has died, it would be appropriate to pass on your condolences.”Australia’s confidence in Trump’s US has evaporated. What will it take for the alliance to rupture?Read more“Oh yes,” he replied, “You are right. I am working to a script, we don’t have that option.”“Well in the interests of training and quality control I hope this call is recorded and that is fixed,” I said.“I’m sorry,” the operator replied, and without missing a beat we continued to populate the form with the details the script required.A few weeks earlier a brilliant young colleague, educated to the highest level in the Stem disciplines, said with unnerving clarity when discussing whether to appeal a questionable driving fine: “I don’t like to rely on human intervention.”If we give up on human intervention, the technocrats have won. There will be even less room for human rights in the world they are crafting in the name of efficiency and profit, under a cover of bombastic rhetoric. It’s not a fight we can afford to lose.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsHuman rightsOpinionAustralian politicsAustralian lawAustralian foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

There’s something magical about being able to access the past in tangible, physical waysSat 17 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 20.36 ESTShareIt’s important to state that I am the most insufferably sentimental person I know.There are old birthday cards collecting dust in my jam-packed cupboards, stuffed toys – their colours long-faded – sitting in my bedroom despite their prime cuddling years over, while gifts handmade by friends I no longer talk to take up real estate on my cluttered shelves. You couldn’t pay me to part with any of them.My apartment is chock-full of these nostalgic knick-knacks – which makes dusting incredibly labour-intensive. I can even pinpoint exactly when and where I got each one.The hot-pink alpaca teddy on my bookshelf? I won it in an arcade game in Japan a decade ago – first try! There’s a coffee-stained print of Matisse’s Blue Nude II I found on the side of the road with my first roommate, still hanging proudly on my wall. A One Direction T-shirt I bought as a teenager at one of their last concerts remains in my weekly pyjama rotation, despite it no longer fitting my adult body.‘What the hell, Mum?’ The parents who keep their children’s baby teethRead moreThere are some recent additions, such as my tiny collection of Sylvanian Family critters gifted to me by a friend last Christmas. Or beloved hand-me-downs, including a ceramic ram that belonged to my grandma.I would describe my interior style choices as sentimental maximalism. Others might say I have the early signs of a hoarding problem.The era of trinket collecting is in full swing within my generation. Spurred on by economic instability and the dreaded inevitability of “proper” adulthood replacing the remaining strands of adolescence, I am one of many who are ditching minimalism in favour of mementoes. It’s impossible to be sad when your home is filled with so much saccharine!Whimsy and nostalgia have been transformed into lifelines, but are we simply digging our claws deeper into a reality that no longer exists?After all, not all my trinkets bring positive emotions. I feel the twang of heartache whenever I see an object associated with someone no longer in my life. It’s not a fun experience when I’m just trying to make my morning coffee.There are also items scattered across my home that bring me unadulterated cringe. Dusty anime figurines from a bygone era of nerdy teenagehood, diaries from my early 20s filled with melodramatic angst, a framed picture of Lana Del Rey I made when I was in the depths of my stan Twitter phase. I could go on forever (but please don’t make me).They are humiliating, but I have a soft spot in my heart for them all.All the trinkets I own reflect the person I was, who I am now and the people who were by my side along the way. It might be easier to go on a social media stalk whenever I get a hankering to wander down memory lane – my apartment would be a hell of a lot tidier too – but there’s something magical about being able to access the past in tangible, physical ways. If you’ve ever mattered to me at any time in my life, odds are a part of you will always have a place in my home.My mum keeps a small amber-coloured glass bird on her dresser, gifted to her by a friend in the 70s who passed unexpectedly. She tells me she has kept it all these years (even surviving multiple international moves) because it acts as a tether to the memory of her friend. Remembering keeps her alive.I can relate. In my birthday card cupboard, there’s a special one from my 16th. It’s decorated with Hello Kitty’s image, and written by a close friend that reads: “I wish you the best for the rest of this week, and the next, and the next, and the rest of forever!”She was killed the following year, and I reread it whenever the pain of her loss hits me at random. A small part of her remains in my life.It’s easy to dismiss trinkets as dust-collecting novelties, but they are so much more meaningful. To me, they aren’t just things. They represent the always-growing mosaic of our lives, and all the people we have ever loved during it.Explore more on these topicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Keep it cheeky, cheap and – crucially – enjoyableSat 17 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 12.44 ESTShareAstag or hen do should be a straightforward, fun night celebrating a good friend moving into a new chapter of their life. Instead, thanks to films such as The Hangover and Bridesmaids, as well as the general Americanisation of what a “bachelor” or “bachelorette” party should be, we’ve ended up with too many overindulgent, wildly inconvenient and quite frankly underwhelming send-offs to our friends who are getting married.Somewhere along the way, they’ve morphed into three-day tests of stamina and disposable income. Groomsmen bankrupting themselves on long weekends in Vegas that are billed as obligatory for anyone who wants to keep calling themselves a friend. Injuries sustained during ill-advised human pyramids on Spanish beaches. Weddings called off after drunken lapses of judgments in strip clubs. To add insult to injury, in 2023,a survey by Avivafound the average person spends £779 attending a stag or hen in the UK – and that goes up to £1,208 when it’s held abroad. Consequently, they’ve become gruelling and – crucially – not even fun any more.View image in fullscreenA scene from The Hangover Part II (2011).Photograph: Courtesy Warner Bros PicturesFirst, let’s address the elephant in the room: are stag and hen dos even necessary in this age of equality and frugality? Some would argue that they are archaic rites rooted in fragile ideas of masculinity and femininity and it’s time to do away with such debased ideas of fun. To that I say: boringggg. Now put on the pink cowboy hat, take a sip from the phallic-shaped straw, and embrace the ritual. I’ve come up with a five-step formula that respects tradition, but modernises some aspects, and makes for an actually enjoyable stag do or hen party. My credentials? I’ve been a best man a couple of times, thrown a hen do, and officiated a wedding.1Keep it to just one day/night.People always drink too much on the first night (and why shouldn’t they?), meaning that whatever activity is planned for the next day is scuppered by huge hangovers. At best, that means everyone is tired and has a headache; at worst, vomiting inside go-kart helmets or paintball masks. Booking a multi-night bender where friends need to deplete their savings and use precious annual leave is also a big no-no.2. Forget thedivision of the sexes.When I was planning a stag a few years ago, the groom considered not inviting his best friend of 25 years because she happened to be a woman. Barmy. But what if it’s awkward? Definitely no more awkward than inviting your future father or mother-in-law to partake in group fancy dress or slam shots in an All Bar One.View image in fullscreenA scene from Bridesmaids (2011).Photograph: Universal Pictures/Allstar3.Offer some kind of non-alcoholic icebreaker activity.First, this means there’s something for the ever-increasing number of people who don’t drink. Second, if you’re bringing together friends from childhood, adulthood and family, sometimes axe-throwing, a murder mystery or a spa is required to give attendees at least some common ground before commencing a night on the lash.4. Cheeky fun is a must. Simply tradition.It doesn’t have to be someone getting their kit off and frolicking around for entertainment, but a low-level hum of rudeness sets apart the sacrality of a stag or hen from any other night on the town. And if you can’t laugh at Magic Mike Live or some mildly obscene cake, you may have mistaken the occasion for corporate away day.5. Prioritise real friends.Make the nearly-wed pick a close group of friends to choose the date. Only add other contacts after this. I was once added to a 20-person stag do group chat where dates were polled, and the winning one worked for people the groom hadn’t seen since school, but not his best mates. Great news for Matt from year 9 Duke of Edinburgh, bad news for the people you really want to see there.In short, the perfect stag or hen doesn’t need be a logistical endurance test, followed by months of chasing a friend of a friend to bank transfer you their airfare. It should be a well-curated night with the people that matter to the bride or groom. If the best man or woman can provide that, you won’t just be sending your friend into married life, you’ll be giving them one last, genuinely great night out before the seating plan arguments begin. And you’re guaranteed to stay a friend long after the speeches are over.Liam Pape is a writer and live comedy producerExplore more on these topicsWedding, honeymoon and stag tripsThe hill I will die onWeddingsFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Slipping on ice, I fell and broke my right wrist, so now I can’t hold a pen with my writing hand. But my experience of theNHSwas a good reminder of a few facts.Heading to the nearest A&E, I expected one of those 12-hour waits and corridors lined with trolleys of the near-dead, rowdy with drunken and psychotic mayhem.The Guardian recently foundthat violent incidents recorded by 212 NHS trusts in England rose from 91,175 in 2022-23 to 104,079 in 2024-25, the equivalent of about 285 cases reported every day. So I was ready for whatever. Notices warned that there would be zero tolerance of abuse of staff.But the place was unexpectedly hushed, with about 25 people waiting – some very old, one a young child, some glum, most calm, with only one swaying and moaning under her breath. Names were called, consulting room doors opened and shut. Sicker patients lay on trolleys in bays with curtains. I was lucky, I reckoned, to be here on a day and at a time when the atmosphere was bustling, but without any mayhem. I settled in for many hours, my fingers swollen like fat sausages, but not in howling agony, not an emergency. How long would it take?After half an hour I was sent for an X-ray. Less than an hour later, a tousle-haired doctor in scrubs told me that, yes, it was broken and needed a cast. He phoned specialists in thumb, hand and wrist care, took their guidance and set to work. I asked about his day: they’d had 71 patients in this fracture clinic, and my plaster cast was the 19th and last of his shift, the length of which – 12 hours – I wouldn’t have guessed from his patience. He booked a follow-up appointment and even wrote it in my diary as, of course, I couldn’t write.How lucky I was. But then I think a bit more. All my working life I have written about the ups and downs of NHS statistics – some of thebest ever in 2010, some of the worst ever since then. How bad are A&E waiting times? The Nuffield Trust and Health FoundationNHS dashboardshows the95% targetfor treatment within four hours has beenbadly missed for years. The latest figures show a slight improvement: 26.1% of peoplein Englandwaited for more than four hours. But that means 73.9% of patients didn’t wait too long. So, statistically, I was not especially fortunate, but quite ordinary.View image in fullscreen‘Painfully slowly, NHS statistics do improve: waiting numbers fall and many more people were treated last year.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAs for the disorderly reputation of emergency departments, I hadn’t been all that lucky, either, to find relative calm. ARoyal College of Nursing (RCN) reportlast August found that “during a typical working day in England, A&E staff are now being attacked every hour”. That’s appalling. How could people behave like that? But thinking about the RCN figures, there were 4,054 incidents in the 89 trusts that replied. Multiply that by two to get close to the 200 or so trusts in the UK overall. But then put that number into the context of6.7 million people attending A&Ein the second quarter of 2024-25 in England alone. Many violent incidents against NHS staff were classed by trusts as “unintentional”, the result of delirium or mental health problems, according to a Guardian investigation.Awful things do happen, with a new RCN investigation into the ongoing scourge of corridor care in the NHS calling it “a type of torture” that leads to patient deaths.I fell victim to the “I’ve been lucky” syndrome monitored over decades by the pollster Ipsos, which has tracked attitudes to public services.Many more peoplethink their local NHS provides a good service than think the NHS nationally does well. That applies to most things – crime, immigration, council services: “It’s terrible out there, but I’m lucky in my home patch.” How dispiriting for politicians that dismal news reports carry more weight than the evidence of people’s own eyes.Painfully slowly, NHS statistics are improving. Waiting numbers fell in 2025 despite it being the NHS’s busiest year – but more of the ageing population joined the queue. Few people will have noted Labour’s focus on health inequality:waiting lists are fallingthree times faster in areas with thehighest joblessness.Ipsos’s annual report,The Perils of Perception, shows how wildly people overestimate social ills. Since ancient times, humans have thought the present worse than imaginary golden ages. But the current pessimism and declinism have a genuine cause, as living standards have flatlined and reckless austerity has diminished public services, in a world where there are more wars and fewer democracies than 20 years ago.Even when things improve, politicians can expect scant credit: the best they get is public concern moving elsewhere, says Gideon Skinner, an Ipsos senior director. It’s for them, he says, to offer words of hope that things will get better. So far, this government has failed to project a belief that we are back on the path of progress. But it only takes a click of a mouse – or a trip to A&E – to find out the facts that will tell you things are usually not as bad as you fear. I should have known better – I certainly do now.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsA&EOpinionNHSHospitalsHealthPublic services policycommentShareReuse this content"

France’s politicians, of all stripes, are too cowardly to defend a good dealSat 17 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 17 Jan 2026 12.44 ESTShareOnce again, France’s farmers have beenblocking motorwayswith their tractors in protest, this time at an impending EU trade agreementwith a group of South American countriesin a common market known as Mercosur, which has been 25 years in the making.The tragedy is that while the EU can finally claim an important victory in its strategy of sealing rules-based free-trade pacts with key regions and countries worldwide to counter aggressive US trade protectionism, in so doing it is helping the Eurosceptic far right to electoral victory in France. Losing the support of France, a founding member, for European integration if the far right wins power, would have a more damaging impact on the long-term stability of the EU than any trade boost with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.This bind is not the fault of “Brussels bureaucrats” – the easy target for all grievances around Europe. The European Commission has bent over backwards to craft safeguard clauses and emergency brakes in case of a sudden surge in food imports. It hasbrought forwardplanned future agricultural spending to assuage farming countries such as France, Poland, Ireland and Italy. Farmers fear that cheap South American beef, not produced to strict EU standards, willflood their markets.It’s mostly down to the collective cowardice of France’s political leaders, starting with the president, Emmanuel Macron. Macronvoted againstthe Mercosur deal despitesecuring protectionsin case European markets were swamped with steak from the Pampas. He and French politicians across the spectrum would rather pander to the farm lobby, whichrepresentsless than 4% of GDP and 2.5% of the workforce, than tell voters the truth – that the crisis of cattle rearers has nothing to do with Mercosur, and that other sectors, including wine and cheese makers as well as other industries, stand to profit from the deal.View image in fullscreenFarmers protest against the Mercosur deal in front of the National Assembly in Paris, 13 January 2026.Photograph: Prezat Denis/ABACA/ShutterstockMacron was elected in 2017 as a pro-European liberal reformer, determined to make France more attractive to domestic and foreign investors, boost the tech sector andmodernisethe generous welfare and pension systems to make them sustainable. Now a lame duck without a parliamentary majority, he has chosen to appease French farmers in an attempt to get them off the streets, rather than stand by his European convictions.Macron’s surrender to the beef producers legitimises their claims that the Mercosur deal will kill French agriculture. This is baloney. They said the same about the EU-Canada trade pact known as Cetaa few years ago, yet French exports to Canada (including wine and cheese)have flourishedand there has been no flood of hormone-fed beef imports. The awkward truth is that French cattle farmers are hurting mostly because their costs have risen faster thanthe pricesthey get from the big supermarket chains that dominate the meat market, and they are drowning in regulatory paperwork.Macron was cornered by the political timing. He is trying to avoid his desperately weak minority government being toppled by a parliamentary censure motion. Sébastien Lecornu, his fifth prime minister in two turbulent years, isstruggling to push a budget through a parliamentseething with rebellion ahead of municipal elections in March and a presidential election next year. The electoral calendar is driving each party to oppose the unpopular president and refuse to take responsibility for painful spending cuts to reduce the swollen deficit.“Brussels” is a convenient scapegoat to deflect blame for the tractors inconveniently blocking roads and their driversstriking posesin front of the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. But the impact on French public opinion is to legitimise the far-right and extreme-left narrative that the EU is to blame for France’s economic woes and the decline of its influence. Opinion polls show the agrarian revolt hasnearly 80% public support. A rightwing farmers’ union,Coordination Rurale, which has grown to be the second-largest French agricultural union and is close to the hard-right National Rally (RN) in its hostility to EU agricultural policy and environmental regulations, has spearheaded the anti-Mercosur movement. The RN is gaining ground among rural voters who traditionally voted for the mainstream conservative Gaullists.Macron looks weak and ineffective on the European stage because hefailed to rally a blocking minorityto prevent the Mercosur deal being approved in a majority vote. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, was to sign it in Paraguay on Saturday. France is pushing for the European parliament to send the deal to the European court of justice for legal scrutiny or vote it down when it comes up for ratification in the next few weeks. Neither manoeuvre seems likely to succeed.The more profound impact of the failure of French political leaders to defend the economic benefits of the Mercosur deal, and of free trade agreements in general, is to reinforce public fears that Europe is ignoring and doing downFrance. That plays into the RN’s campaign themes of wrenching back power from Brussels and cutting France’s payment to the EU.While RN leaderMarine Le Penhas dropped her past policies of advocating withdrawal from the euro or the EU, which proved a vote-loser after French voters saw the damage wreaked by Brexit, a less radical brand of Euroscepticism could help propel Le Pen’s popular young protege, Jordan Bardella, into the Élysée Palace next year. That would set Paris on a collision course with the EU and with Germany, which Bardella and radical-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon depict as the evil force behind Brussels’ free trade drive.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionEuropean UnionMarine Le PenEmmanuel MacronAgricultureEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

When she was a 13-year-old girl living in Poland in the late 1930s, on the brink of the Nazi occupation, her mother told her she was pulled away from her mother and put on a boat to Palestine where she spent the rest of the second world war. As a teenager in that country, she said she became part of a radical Jewish underground group for whom she acted as a spy and a saboteur, smuggling bombs and guns which they used against the British army who ran the country at the time and who they very much wanted to force out. “I was a hero,” her mother would often boast, “never a victim.”Stories like those both dazzled and horrified the young Fox, but by the time she was nine she began to realize that certain parts of the tale didn’t add up. “I would say to her: ‘Wait a minute, if you were born in 1935 and [the second world war] started in 1939, you would have been four, not 13,’” Fox said. “Whenever I would say that, she would say: ‘No more questions.’”Fox never got any clearer answers from her mother before she died of colon cancer in 1993. A college student at the time, Fox not only felt loss but also bafflement. It wasn’t until 2010 that she received her first glimpse of the truth. She was having tea with an elderly great-aunt who, by then, was suffering from dementia, a condition which, Fox believes, made her inadvertently blurt out: “Your mother had a hidden identity,” after which she darkly added: “You’re not going to be happy with what you find.”AI, Salman Rushdie and Elon Musk: the most anticipated documentaries of 2026Read moreThat tidbit fired a mission in Fox to finally uncover the true story of her mother, a tale that turned out to be even more dramatic, troubling and sad than the one she had always been fed. That’s the story that’s finally being told in a revelatory new documentary directed and written by Fox, titled My Underground Mother. Through relentless sleuthing over a 15-year period during which she tracked down sources from around the world, Fox discovered that her mother had lied to her, as well as to her father, her siblings and everyone else in her adult life about key information including her true age, her real name, as well as the fact that she had actually lived in Poland for the entire duration of the war.Talking to Fox in her New York apartment as she traces her mother’s complex story has an eerie resonance since they share a number of physical features. “We even wear our hair the same way,” she said.That’s the reason, she now believes, her mother was so shaken when Fox entered adolescence. “When she saw my body changing, and she saw the male gaze coming into view, she became protective in a way that went beyond the normal pale of Jewish mothers,” Fox said. “She was always nervously trying to tell me to cover up. And I didn’t understand it. Her relationship with me began to change and harden.”View image in fullscreenHela Hocherman, the real name of Marisa Fox’s mother, in Israel in 1948.Photograph: Courtesy of Marisa FoxFox believes her mother was triggered by her budding womanhood due to the specific circumstances of the secret part of her history. When the Nazis began their reign of terror in Poland, her mother was actually about 14 and living in a small town near the German border. Her birth mother wound up being sent to Auschwitz while she, and hundreds of the other teenage girls in the area, were taken to a forced labor camp named Gabersdorf. There, they were imprisoned and made to work back-breaking shifts to provide free labor and assets that the Nazis used to help finance the war. The first-hand testimonies Fox offers in the film couldn’t be more moving, drawn from scores of women who had been at Gabersdorf who she tracked down in countries from Sweden and Australia to the US and Israel. The way she accomplished that forms the movie’s main plot, creating an edge-of-your-seat experience for the viewer. The scores of women Fox found, 18 of whom made the film’s final cut, were by then in their 80s and 90s. Since filming began, all but three of those women have died. “Whenever I would hear about somebody relevant to the story, I would hop on a plane to speak to them,” Fox said. “There was no time to waste.”Tracking them down was one thing, but getting them to speak about their most traumatic experiences became a psychological challenge. “I had to earn their trust,” the director said. “A lot of them asked: ‘Do you love your mother?’ because they wanted to make sure I wasn’t out to tell some salacious story. Then, there was a tension between their loyalty to my mother and however much they felt she had abandoned them by lying about her past. They didn’t understand how she could do like that. These women had been everything to each other and, after the war, my mother cut them off.”In the end, the women’s role as witnesses to history, as well as their earlier connection to Fox’s mother, won them over. “They were curious to find out what the hell happened to their friend and why she did what she did,” the director said.The stories the women told Fox about Gabersdorf paint a picture of a harrowing place that grew exponentially worse as the war slogged on. In a coup, Fox not only had the women’s riveting testimony but also a journal they created at the time, to which 60 of the girls contributed. Lines written by Fox’s mother in the journal when she was a teen are among the most eloquent, imagining a defiant future beyond the camp, a sign of her deep survival instincts. “My mother was a badass, even at a young age,” Fox said.Crushing and depressing as their workload and their isolation was, Fox found some fascinating nuances in the lives of certain girls through their relationships with some British PoWs who were later brought to the camp. While the Jewish girls were barely sustained, the PoWs were allowed to receive Red Cross packages, including food and chocolate which they used to entice the girls into sex. With striking honesty, the journal reveals the flings that went on between the PoWs and some of the girls. “The Diary of Anne Frank this wasn’t,” Fox quips in the film.Tellingly, the women who speak on that subject only talk about relations experienced by other girls, never themselves. “These girls were so young, so they had no sexual experience before this,” Fox said. “Their life was completely uprooted, and they were utterly dehumanized right when they were beginning to feel those raging hormones. When all of a sudden, a guy wants you, in that context it becomes exciting. Of course, sexual bartering is a war crime and perhaps some of the girls reported their agreement to the sex just to prove they had agency, but there could also be love and lust. Several of the women later married those PoWs.”Two years into their imprisonment, however, the sexual aspect of life in the camp took a far darker turn. In 1943, when the killing apparatus of the Nazis went into overdrive, SS men and women took over the camp. They instituted practices like nude inspections in which the guards would select certain women to be trafficked as sex slaves for Nazi soldiers on the eastern front. “Those women who were taken from the camp were never heard from again,” Fox says.Other girls at the camp were raped right there, turning the place into a kind of corollary to the “Joy Division” brothels at places like Auschwitz, a grotesque practice later alluded to the 1953 novella House of Dolls by the novelist and camp survivor credited as Ka-Tzetnik 135633, as well as in the name for the dark, post-punk band led by Ian Curtis in the late 1970s. In the film, Fox reveals the horrors certain girls experienced at Gabersdorf, including one who was murdered for becoming pregnant from a rape.View image in fullscreenMarisa holding a picture of her mother.Photograph: Marisa FoxNo record of sexual crimes by the Nazis was kept, a striking feature given the fact that the Germans left incredibly detailed documentation of their other crimes, a key reason we know so much about them. One reason the Nazis omitted sex crimes, Fox believes, was because it was illegal there for non-Jews to have sexual relations with Jews. “It was considered ‘racial defilement’,” she said.In 1945, when the war finally ended, the incidents of rape didn’t cease. The Russian liberators at Gabersdorf violated the girls as well. Even after Fox’s mother made it to Italy on her way to Palestine, one man tried to use sexual coercion as payment for his aid.Given her mother’s treatment in Poland, when she finally got to Palestine, she wanted to remake herself and she joined an insurrectionist movement that, eventually, had a hand in the creation of the state of Israel. Though her mother always saw herself as a freedom fighter, Fox says it wouldn’t be unfair to consider her a terrorist. “These people were taking the law into their own hands,” she said.After Israel was established, survivors of theHolocaustwere often looked upon in the country with suspicion and condescension or seen as damaged goods. For that reason and others, Fox’s mother came to the US hoping to create a life far removed from both her time at a camp and as a bomb-carrying subversive. After getting financial help from an American uncle to emigrate, she married in the 1950s and raised a family in New York. While she would often talk proudly to her daughter about her time as an outlaw in Palestine, not a syllable was ever spoken about the great drama that came before, a decision that could be seen by some fellow survivors as its own kind of Holocaust denial. In a similar way, when her mother was told she had cancer in the 1990s, she ordered her family never to tell a soul. “One of her biggest worries was to be seen as a figure of pity,” Fox said. “She never wanted to be seen as a victim of any kind.”As to why she sustained her lies throughout her life, even to her husband, Fox can only speculate. “There were probably many layers of shame in her,” she said. “Shame about having survived the camp, shame about whatever sexual abuse she experienced, which I can never know for sure, and shame about discovering at one point that she had been a love child, which was why she had changed her name.”Fox admits to having experienced doubts about revealing secrets her mother fought her whole life to conceal. “My brothers said: ‘Doesn’t mom have a right to retain her privacy?’” she said. “But at the end of the day, who wants to hide from themselves? You only do that because you feel bad about something that happened to you, something so horrific that you feel that people won’t understand. Clearly, she never came to peace with that, but I feel like deep down my mother would have liked to have told me. Don’t we all want to be at peace with who we are?”Beyond her own story, Fox believes her mother’s saga can also help others. “I made this film so women who survive these horrific experiences during war don’t feel guilty,” she said. “Shame needs to change sides. The shame doesn’t belong to the women. It belongs to the men who did this to them.”My Underground Mother is screening at the New York Jewish film festival on 19 and 20 January before a wider release later this yearExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsSecond world warHolocaustNazismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His death, at 55, was as sudden as it was not. For years, alcoholism had been changing the shape of his heart.He died less than a mile from his old office; top law firm, equity partner. Four miles from our once tight-knit home in a leafy neighbourhood. He had lost both his family and his job in 2019. Raised in Barry, working class, he had been proud of the beautiful life he had built for us. Others thought he “had it all”. He was widely adored, but drinking made him volatile. He was homeless and often behind bars in his final two years.I saw my dad for the last time in the spring of 2019, just before I moved to Australia. I was no longer able to bear the distress and chaos caused by his addiction. From then on I saw him only in photos: an article about homeless people getting Christmas dinner; the police’s missing-person appeals. Wherehadmy caring, clever dad gone?I never spoke about his drinking. It seemed disloyal, then gloomy, then futile. He had been one of my closest friends. It was only after losing him for good that I realised I wanted others to know him. This came through writing, which I began compulsively the morning after the news. It’s what I do to keep my mind steady. I was five when my dad sat me down to write about an event that had shaken me: my brother’s first epileptic seizure in 1999. It was a lesson in how finding the words could help in the face of unthinkable things.My memoir,Long Going, came out last summer. It’s the story of my life with and without the lightning-strike man who raised me. Our story resonates, it turns out. Readers say they found it surprisingly uplifting. I feel lighter since writing it.At events, I’m often asked about my relationship with alcohol. My response is evolving. Like my dad, I never suffered hangovers. I could drink to oblivion with friends and wake up fine. Nowadays I’m vigilant. Since becoming a parent myself, I count myself among therising numberof sober-curious people. I know what’s at stake.In June I was on a Tŷ Newydd writing course with Amy Liptrot, whose memoirThe Outrunis an invigorating account of recovering from alcoholism in Orkney (the film adaptation, starring Saoirse Ronan, was released in 2024). Amy suggested to us that memoirs could be windows on to different worlds, or mirrors of our own worlds. Or sometimes, I wonder, both? Even writing my own book, my dad’s pencilled notes gave me a window into his world of prison cells and leaky tents.Over the past year, I’ve been drawn towards other memoirs about addiction. Either I hadn’t realised these books existed or I avoided them. I’m not sure which is true, but I wish I had read them sooner.View image in fullscreenBack on top … Ashley Walters in Adolescence.Photograph: NetflixTakeAlways Winningby Top Boy star Ashley Walters. Raised in Peckham, with his dad circling between prison and binges, Walters ended up in a young offender institution at 20. He ultimately managed to turn his life around, and forged a stellar acting career, most recently starring in hit show Adolescence. His reading of the audiobook is revealing, particularly on how he confronted his alcoholism and broke cycles by going into rehab. I saw my dad in Walters’ recollections of his arrogance. I saw myself in his memories of loved ones treading on eggshells, unsure which version of him to expect.Alcoholism is known as a family disease, whether that means lurking in genes or spilling consequences on to those around the addict. A powerful testament to this isIn the Blood, co-written by Arabella Byrne and her mother, Julia Hamilton. With admirable honesty, they reflect on what brought them to Alcoholics Anonymous nine months apart. Arabella and I held an event at Blackwell’s in Oxford during my book tour. Her mother was in the front row. My baby daughter was on my lap. It felt like we were breaking cycles together.Thankfully, there is no shortage of memoirs about recovery. We need them. Haunted by his dad’s addiction, Jesse Thistle’sFrom the Ashesis a gritty, gripping book about his own long struggle with addiction and homelessness before he went into rehab, found love and became a scholar. Octavia Bright’sThis Ragged Gracebeautifully articulates her journey into sobriety, alongside her dad’s descent into Alzheimer’s.My dad once said he’d rather die than go soberIn reading these books, I inevitably look for explanations. Why didn’t my dad recover? What else could I have done? I won’t pretend to know the unknowable, but something does keep coming up. Each writer describes a moment of clarity that life would be better without alcohol. This simple inner conviction – rather than external pressure – takes them to AA or rehab. Here, ego and destructive patterns are exchanged for community and healthy habits. A day at a time, they continue to choose this better life, embraced again by loved ones.I was told that my dad once said he’d rather die than go sober. Some things can’t be explained. He had so much to live for. He deserved to enjoy retirement and time with grandkids. Had he recovered, he’d have been an incredible presence in my daughter’s life – just as he had been in mine.This month I’m marking his birthday with three events – from a bookshop in Chester, where he attended law college, to the homeless shelter that fed him on Christmas Day, to Bristol with Nacoa, the charity for children of alcoholics. I can’t change how my dad’s story ended, but I can pass on what he taught me about finding the words. Here’s to more windows opening, and fewer unthinkable things.Long Going by Sophie Calon is published by Honno Welsh Women’s Press. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Psychiatrist Amir Levine gives us a set of tools to help us feel more secure in all our relationships, not just romantic ones, but with colleagues, friends, family and even with ourselves. This is not a fanciful book but is grounded in research and neuroscience. I believe if you follow its principles, you will in time become more secure. But any psychological work is not like rubbing on cream – it wouldn’t be enough just to read the book. You’d have to do the work and then keep up the practice. Secure can help you know yourself better, and self‑awareness is the first step towards positive change, in this case becoming more open and relaxed in all your relationships. If you can’t wait until April, my runner-up is his first book, Attached, written with Rachel Heller.Philippa Perry is a clinical psychologist. Her latest book is The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read.View image in fullscreenHave better conversationsChosen byHannah CritchlowEmily and Laurence Alison’sRapportis fantastic at helping us to understand other people, and showing how we can work with them to increase our own cognitive power. There’s evidence that a huge part of our species’ success has been due to our ability to cooperate. We constantly take shortcuts in our information processing, accumulate biases throughout our lifetimes, and have genetic predispositions to seeing the world in different ways. But when you get a group of people together and allow them to communicate freely, it can balance out biases so they can start to see the world more accurately. And from that, we can start to solve problems and move forward in a positive way.The authors draw on their own experiences as forensic psychologists, working in dangerous, hostile situations, and set out four personality categories – monkey, T rex, lion or mouse – each with communicative strengths and weaknesses. This provides a roadmap to understand yourself and others too. I think it’s incredibly important in the modern world that we continue to build these interpersonal skills, creating rapport even with those who think differently to us, as opposed to just hiding behind our screens.Hannah Critchlow is a neuroscientist at Magdalene College, Cambridge University. Her new book, The 21st-Century Brain, will be publishedinApril.Sustain a long-term relationshipChosen byOrna GuralnikStephen Mitchell was, in a way, the founder of the relational school of psychoanalysis, which is a more contemporary school of psychoanalysis – andCan Love Last?is a very useful book for couples to read. He talks openly, in accessible language, about the underlying unconscious dilemmas that love poses, the risks of vulnerability, dependency and unpredictability and the ways in which we try to avoid risk and dampen love to feel safer. It helps people get in touch with their more fundamental motivations, allowing them to be more courageous in their loving.Rather than offering “three things you can do tomorrow”, it goes deeper. Mitchell gives engaging examples. I love that he speaks intelligently about this intense experience that we all go through; forming relationships, falling in love, struggling with it when often we feel like we don’t understand what’s happening to us. And he speaks beautifully to the tension between the need for safety and the need for adventure.Orna Guralnik is a New York-based clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst, best known for the television showCouples Therapy.View image in fullscreenStop being a people pleaserChosen byAlex CurmiThe Courage to Be Dislikedby Ichiro Kishimi is different from any other self-help book I’ve ever read, with the format of a philosopher talking to a young, frustrated student really drawing you in. Everyone can relate to being that young person trying to figure things out. And I think everyone feels like they have that older, wiser person in them somewhere too. The book is intended to introduce readers to the work of Austrian psychoanalyst Alfred Adler. He felt that at any point you can decide to change your life.People pleasers often unconsciously take on the responsibilities of not just their own life but of other people’s, because they feel if they don’t put in that extra effort, other people are going to dislike them. Kishimi introduces the Adlerian idea of the separation of tasks, where you decide which tasks you are responsible for and then let other people get on with their own tasks.That’s extremely liberating. Of course, the huge irony is that when you live without fear of dislike, people tend to like you much more because they intuit that you have a lot more self respect and you’re being more genuine, and genuineness and authenticity are very appealing.Dr Alex Curmi is a consultant psychiatrist and host of the Thinking Mind Podcast.View image in fullscreenBe happierChosen byPaul DolanI first encountered Oliver Burkeman’s writing when he wrote a series for the Guardian calledThis Column Will Change Your Life. He doesn’t take himself too seriously and I admire his self-deprecation. You can be serious and say things that are important and robust and also have some levity.Four Thousand Weeksis enjoyable to read and consistent with what I’ve always said about one of the key ways to be happier or live better, which is just to get over ourselves about stuff. Burkeman talks about the fact that we’ve got a limited amount of time, hence the title. So, never mind next week. What are you going to do this week to make it just that little bit better? Focus on the small stuff, not the big stuff, do things now rather than later, stop worrying about making next week perfect.It’s fundamentally about happiness, because that is the ultimate achievement. It’s interesting when people say they want to be successful. What is the point of success? It’s a cliched thing to say, but it’s about the journey.Paul Dolan is professor of behavioural science at London School of Economics. His latest book is Beliefism: How to Stop Hating People We Disagree With.View image in fullscreenNavigate traumaChosen byLisa Feldman-BarrettGeorge Bonanno has studied trauma in many forms for over three decades, and inThe End of Traumahe challenges some conventional, outdated beliefs. Stories and case studies show that trauma is personal: it varies across people and contexts. It’s not a feature of an event, but an experience. Adverse events can happen to people and they might not be traumatised, but equally, something that would not be traumatic for many can authentically be traumatic for you. Trauma doesn’t mean “I feel really, really bad”. It means “I’m having intrusive thoughts and can’t connect with the pleasures of the moment. I’m feeling so bad that I can’t function.” Still, most people are surprisingly resilient and do not develop PTSD – even after terrible events such as 9/11, rape or war. People are distressed, they get angry, they grieve, but most can function in their everyday lives.Bonanno also shows that resilience to trauma is rooted in how flexibly you cope. Sometimes it helps to talk about your experience, but other times it helps to distract yourself. Sometimes you should seek company, but other times it’s better to take a hot bath and go to bed, hoping tomorrow will be a better day. It’s always possible to look at the event from different angles, which ultimately gives you more choice in how to feel. Flexibility is a skill that can be learned and practised like any other. Ultimately, you have agency over how you deal with the slings and arrows you encounter in life. With agency there is hope.Lisa Feldman-Barrett is a neuroscientistand a professor at Northeastern University. Her latest book isSeven and a Half Lessons About the Brain.Handle stressChosen byRobert SapolskyI’d recommendDopamine Nationby a colleague of mine, Anna Lembke (a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University). I don’t recall if the word “stress” appears in the book, but it’s ultimately about that in a very meaningful way. Her focus is the biology and psychology of why our cultures leave us so empty and prone to addiction, why the more we eat, the hungrier we get. She emphasises how we, in our privileged lives in the west, have been led to believe that we should never feel pain, failure, defeat, discouragement: “everyone’s a winner”. What this does, for one thing, is make us pathetic and unprepared when it comes to really tough circumstances. She has a model according to which, in the absence of any capacity to tolerate pain and being hypersensitised to the kinds of pain that are inevitable in any life, we get a hypersensitised craving for reward that leads to addiction. The take-home message for me is to remember the consequences of having the goal of a pain-free life with no setbacks or adversity.Robert Sapolsky is professor of biology, neuroscience and neurosurgery at Stanford University. His latest book is Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will.Tackle narcissismChosen byLinda BlairToday we tend to want to label everything, and I don’t think that’s always the most effective way to create change and wellbeing. Narcissism is a term that people love to throw around as an insult: “They’re such a narcissist.” What they actually mean is, “I don’t think they value me enough, and I don’t think they see my point of view, and for that reason they’re annoying me.” Well, guess what? That is narcissism, too. And by focusing on it, either in yourself or in others, you are simply making it worse.To treat a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, the most important thing is working on deepening and strengthening your relationships. What that comes back to is not just thinking about other people’s point of view, but getting more realistic about your own. So – like the Dalai Lama – try to think of everybody as being equally important, including yourself, and spend your time trying to understand them rather than judge. In the blink of an eye, you’ve begun to solve narcissism, either in yourself or in your tendency to call it out in others, and you will emerge happier.The Art of Happinessis a dialogue between a western psychiatrist, Howard Cutler, and the Dalai Lama and I think it’s a winner. It may have been published in 1998 but the wisdom isn’t dated and the Dalai Lama, of course, is still going strong.Linda Blair is a clinical psychologist. Her latest book isSiblings.View image in fullscreenBecome a better parentChosen byEmily OsterThomas Phelan’s1-2-3-Magicis an older book but it is fundamentally sensible and I think it would help a lot of people enormously. It’s a bit of a corrective to some of the more intense and exhausting parenting books we have had lately.The intention is to give you a system, and tell you how to implement it – so it’s very no-nonsense, with a lot of worked-up examples. It feels like good, sensible advice, structured so you can be successful. The crux of it is that, when thinking about behaviour change, kids respond well to a consistently implemented system of rewards and punishments. And – maybe more importantly – if you get to a better place, family life will be easier and there will be more space for fun.Emily Oster is professor of economics at Brown University. Her latest book is The Unexpected: Navigating Pregnancy During and After Complications.View image in fullscreenUnderstand neurodiversityChosen byAlmuth McDowallApproaching Autistic Adulthoodby Grace Liu is one of my favourite books. Grace is mixed race and a lesbian, and beautifully illuminates the intersectional perspective. She does a great job of describing her journey to adulthood and the difficulties she has experienced without sugar‑coating or judging others. Some of it makes me laugh out loud, such as her description of “neurotypical‑splaining”, as in when people who are not autistic try and tell autistic people what it is like. The book gives real-life insight into the autistic mind. It’s a great read for autistic people (“You are not alone! Here are some things for you to think about to navigate life better”) and for people who come in contact with autistic people, which given population prevalence means all of us at some point (“This is how you can respond appropriately, without patronising or belittling people”).It’s an easy and poignant read with many anecdotes. Grace’s approach is also evidence based – she tries to address the double empathy problem: that autistic people understand each other, and neurodivergent people understand each other, but communication across the two neurotypes often results in misunderstanding. She debunks some of the myths and is honest and authentic in her writing.Almuth McDowall is a psychology professor at Birkbeck College, London, specialising in neurodivergence research.View image in fullscreenMaintain focusChosen byOliver BurkemanHow to Focusby John Cassian, translated by Jamie Kreiner,is from a series published by Princeton called Ancient Wisdom for Modern Readers. Cassian was a fourth-century Christian monk but the translation is informal, refreshing and modern. It’s about the problem of concentration and distraction, which they figured was partly because of demons but also because of the vagaries of how human attention works, which they could do something about.First, know that distraction is a perpetual challenge, and it makes a lot more sense to just accept that. Second, prioritise having interesting things to focus on instead of the other tempting distractions that lure you away. So it’s not a self-punishing, “I will not spend an hour doomscrolling”, it’s, “how can I make sure that I am spending some of my time and my life on things that naturally draw me to them, and I prefer to do than spending all that time doomscrolling?”The most borrowable solution offered is the idea of making a daily practice, something that you can keep coming back to, and learning to forgive yourself when your focus is less than what you would have it be. You’re still working the muscle of concentration.There is something profound about any opportunity to glimpse that whatever torments us today might actually, in some way, be a timeless part of the human condition. I feel lifted up or supported somehow by these people. We’re all just chipping away at it and that’s why you don’t need to beat yourself up for not having done more than that.Oliver Burkeman is a writer. His latest book is Meditations for Mortals.Explore more on these topicsBooksSelf and wellbeingHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its two lead characters have the making of a classic comic double actRhik SamadderSat 17 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTShareTheGame of Thronesfranchise has fruited again, like an abundant oak. Where’s left to go? A startling opening, in which a lumbering oaf takes a dump behind a tree, gives us a clue. Chronologically, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Monday 19 January, 9pm, Sky Atlantic) sits between the juggernaut original and its courtly prequel, House of the Dragon. Tonally, it’s in a world of its own.That oaf eventually gets a name: Dunk. Contrary to expectation, Dunk is a knight. Specifically, a “hedge knight”, a lower-status category whose kind cannot afford their keep and must sleep under trees. “Any knight can make a knight” we are reminded, by simply dubbing them. This lack of gatekeeping has resulted in a class system in which highborn valiants scorn their ignoble brethren. They are knights in name only, and only just. Of course, there’s nothing just about this.My jaw was agape for much of the first episode, as I wondered what game HBO were playing. It takes place largely on a featureless moor, following Dunk in his meaningless solitude, apart from three horses whom he speaks to as equals. He is demonstrably dim-witted, penniless and naive. He misses his father figure – a recently deceased, geriatric, alcoholic knight who beat him. There’s a Beckettian bleakness to this vision. Like much of Beckett, it’s also a comedy.This is, on the surface, a simple tale. Dunk makes a journey to a “tourney” – a jousting competition where he hopes to prove himself. We follow his attempts to get on the ballot, given his nondescript lineage. He falls for a girl, takes part in a tug-of-war. He is hampered as much as assisted by his new squire, Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell) – a bald, pubescent boy who latches on to him at an inn.With six short episodes, the creators aren’t pumping hot air into George RR Martin’s source novella. (They avoidthe mistake ofthe prequelHobbit films, which stretched their story, and audience patience, into what felt like 200 hours of numbing dragon-tease.) Since we’re talking size, we need to talk about Dunk. This fella looks like Paul Mescal had a baby with Reacher. I had to buy a bigger TV to fit him on the screen. He’s played, with great heart, by Peter Claffey, a former rugby union player from Galway. Paired with the fragile figure of Egg, you have the equation for a classic comedy double act.There’s a joy to being wrongfooted, especially in a high-stakes project. I was reminded of Rian Johnson’sThe Last Jedi(though it’s more closely akin to the Heath Ledger filmA Knight’s Tale). The creators wilfully subvert expectations of grandeur or heroism. Scenes are punctuated by our hero Dunk being called big or thick or out of place, by his superiors, children and random minor characters. He walks into a door frame at one point, twice. Asserting himself by bossing Egg around, he is verbally outmatched. “Don’t run away or I’ll hunt you down with dogs,” he commands. “Where will you get the dogs?” comes the faux-innocent reply.But like its main characters, this is a tale full of surprises. I barked with laughter, before a series of revelations upended the tone again. The series reveals the deeper game it has been playing, judging deftly when to show its hand. Details would spoil the journey but, as you’d expect, Claffey has his Ugly Betty moment. He grows into a towering moral compass.A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms may not be a sprawling, dynastic myth but it is concerned with family and inheritance. Of course Westeros fans, like Omaze players, get excited by great houses. They’ll be thrilled by Daniel Ings, chewing scenery as Lyonel Baratheon. The Targaryens, too, slither into town in crisis, having misplaced a few sons on their way to Ashford – presumably not the ex-Eurostar station in Kent.This is Game of Thrones at its best. A rich, politically complex meal, with sides of bone-snapping violence. Its boldness has stayed with me, as what started in coarse slapstick becomes a moving exploration of true nobility, survivor’s guilt and goodness. The oaf has moral fibre in his diet. No wonder he needed that dump.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherGeorge RR MartinGame of ThronesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the Monaro highway, it’s about six hours’ drive from Sydney and three from Canberra.I live in the main town of Jindabyne, which everyone calls “Jindy”. I moved all over Australia and settled here 10 years ago because I think it’s the most beautiful place in the country with its mountains, lakes, rivers and alpine vegetation.A local’s guide to Queenstown and Arrowtown: ‘Like walking on to a film set’Read moreMount Kosciuszko (most easily accessed after taking the Kosciuszko Express chairlift from Thredbo) is Australia’s highest point. Perisher and Thredbo are the two main ski resorts; both are around half an hour’s drive from Jindabyne.Most people still think of the Snowies as a winter destination, but in summer it transforms into an adventure playground with world-class mountain biking, horse riding, hiking, lake sports and whitewater rafting. The weather is perfect, there are fewer tourists and it has a family-friendly country-town feel.FoodView image in fullscreenPicnics in the sun on the grounds of Shut the Gate Cellar Door.Photograph: Divya GordonScenic picnics with excellent provisions are my favourite eating style. In Berridale (about 25 minutes from Jindabyne),The Little Grocerat Shut the Gate wines stocks excellent regional produce. I fill my basket with wine, cheese, cured meat and bread. You can picnic on the winery grounds, too, and it does live music at the cellar door on the first Friday of every month.There’s currently a wood-fired pizza war happening.Out of Boundsoperates from a van on a property in Berridale and has been the local favourite for years. When the excellentStacks Pizzaopened in Jindy recently, it caused ripples in the community. The pepperoni topping is my go-to.View image in fullscreenWood-fired pizza from Out Of Bounds.Photograph: Dominic KielerWe have a big Japanese influence as many seasonal ski workers travel from Japan for the Australian winter. The izakaya-styleTakayama Restaurant Barhas the best food in Jindabyne. It’s a fun group night out, but also great if you’re solo and starving and just want a ramen topped with a juicy slice of pork. Book in advance.About 20 minutes from Jindabyne,Perrotta’sItalian restaurant opened at Lake Crackenback Resort & Spa in 2024. The pasta is delicious; my go-to is the rigatoni with vodka sauce. They often get seafood from the far south coast of New South Wales, which in my opinion has Australia’s best oysters. It’s an intimate-sized restaurant that’s great for a date as they do wine pairings and it’s a scenic area with alpine vegetation.The community meets atESS Board Store, which serves Allpress coffee. Head toBirchwood Jindabynefor specialty coffees and an all-day menu with Indian and Japanese-influenced lunches. Tea drinkers should head toThe Market Jindabyneto create their own tea blend. It’s an excellent spot for working in a private nook, and the deli sells great picnic supplies.NatureView image in fullscreenThe view towards Jindabyne over Lion and Cub islands in Lake Jindabyne on a sunny summer day.Photograph: imageBROKER.com/AlamyMy number one thing to do – that most people miss – is canoeing 10 minutes across Lake Jindabyne toLion Island nature reserve. It’s a secluded beach with a mountain view and the snow-melt water is crisp on a blazing hot day. You can hire canoes fromSacred Rideand, unless it’s windy, the lake is calm.Mountain biking is the biggest sport here in summer. TheThredbo Valley trackin Kosciuszko national park is a bonanza for bikers. It has experienced, intermediate and beginner sections and bikes can be hired fromHarro’s.View image in fullscreenMills Creek trail with Jindabyne lake and town in the background.Photograph: Steve CuffFloating a lilo down Thredbo River is a must-do. Start your float atGaden trout hatcheryand pop out atThredbo River picnic area. There’s big oak trees by the river and it’s especially lush in springtime with the fresh snowmelt. There’s aneasy hikefrom the hatchery to the picnic area too.View image in fullscreenHikers at Blue Lake, Kosciuszko national park.Photograph: Andrew Bain/AlamyHead toBullocks trackin the national park for your best chance to see a platypus in the pools around the Thredbo River. Towards summer they exit their burrows in the late afternoon and frolic in the water. But be quiet – they’re shy!TheMain Range walkin Kosciusko national park takes you to five lakes including my favourite, Lake Albina.The Blue Lakeis Australia’s largest glacial lake and a beautiful sight. It’s got that Scottish highlands feeling and many hikes branch off from there.Jindabyne nightlifeThe young and hip go toHolly’sfor the great atmosphere and dancing vibes. DJs play regular sets in the beer garden and there’s a food truck. For a more intimate feelBar Lulaserves European-style small plates and has acoustic live music. First dates often happen at Bar Lula.The lakesideBanjo Paterson Inn(known as “the Banj”) has every demographic covered. There’s accommodation upstairs and a brewery downstairs where cyclists and hikers come by for a beer after their outdoor activities. The restaurant serves good family meals such as burgers, pizza and ice-cream. It’s also the late-night kick-on spot.InspirationThe Snowies become theQueenstownof Australia in summer. Our culture here is being outdoors and we have some fantastic tour providers to get you among it.View image in fullscreenThe walking and biking trails along the Thredbo River near Bullocks Hut at Lake Crackenback.Photograph: imagebroker.com/AlamyCochran Horse Treksrun for three to seven days and are customised to suit guests’ horseback abilities. Peter Cochran is a fifth-generation mountain horseman with deep knowledge of the area. Treks feature packhorses, billy tea, campfires and camp oven-cooked dinners.Whitewater rafting on the lower Snowy River is sensational. You might see wild brumbies running through the landscape. The company I guide for,Venture OutdoorsCo, does excellent guided trips.Thredbo Resort runsnew moon stargazing hikes. You start the walk at dusk, go past rocky granite outcrops, running rivers and the scenic Lake Cootapatamba. Guides set up a hot chocolate experience at Mount Kosciuszko and point out the constellations and current astronomical events.Snowy Mountains accommodationThe dog-friendlyBig Yard Farm(25 minutes’ drive from Jindabyne; from $750 a night) sleeps up to six people. It has private access to trout fishing along the Mowamba River, which is also home to wombats, kangaroos and platypus. There are open fireplaces and a well-equipped kitchen for home cooks.View image in fullscreenCrafters luxury cabins in Thredbo Valley.Photograph: supplied by CraftersElsewhere, I suggest getting off the beaten path of the ski resorts and opting for a private cabin in the bush.Big Yard Escapes(from $179 a night) are tiny houses close to Thredbo and Perisher with big windows framing the alpine outlook.Crafterscabins (from $490 per night) are in the bushland beneath Crackenback Peak. They’re fully off-grid with rainwater, solar power and heat from thermal mass walls. Close to Jindabyne, the design-ledCommon Kosci(from $300 a night) is a contemporary update on the Aussie bush shack with hammocks, comfy sofas, floor to ceiling windows, outdoor hot tubs and underfloor heating.For car campers,Thredbo Diggingsin Kosciuszko national park is great. For hikers, Wilkinson’s Creek is a beautiful place to camp.

The recipe is based on (but not authentic to) the Turkish dishmenemen. There is much to love about these eggs, not least how magnificently delicious they are and how fun it is to scoop them up with hot flatbread. On a practical note, meanwhile, they can be eaten at any mealtime and, if not finished, reheated later. Which, if you love eggs and leftovers as much as I do, is a (small) dream come true.Turk-ish eggs with lemon yoghurtPrep10 minCook45 minServes440g pine nuts200g greek yoghurt1 lemon, zest finely grated, then juiced to get 1½ tbsp1¾ tsp fine sea salt3½ tbsp rose harissa pasteExtra-virgin olive oil1 brown onion, peeled and finely chopped2 green peppers(400g), stalks, pith and seeds discarded, flesh very finely chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced2 tbsp sun-dried tomato paste2400g tins chopped tomatoes30g flat-leaf parsley, leaves and tender stems only, finely chopped6 large eggsFlatbreads, warmed, to servePut the pine nuts in a wide pan for which you have a lid, turn on the heat to low and stir every now and then until they turn nut brown all over. Transfer to a plate.Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the yoghurt with the lemon zest and juice, and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. In another small bowl, make a harissa oil to dress the eggs with by mixing a tablespoon of the harissa with four tablespoons of olive oil.Put four tablespoons of olive oil in the empty pine nut pan on a medium heat. When hot, add the onion, peppers and a teaspoon and a half of salt, then cook, stirring often, for 18-20 minutes, until very soft. Stir in the garlic, sun-dried tomato paste and the remaining two and a half tablespoons of harissa, then add the chopped tomatoes and let everything bubble and blip away for 10 minutes.Fold the parsley through the sauce, then crack the eggs into the tomato mixture and cover with a lid for a minute. Gently break up the eggs, so they marble through the sauce (don’t overmix), pop the lid back on for another minute, or until the yolks and whites are just set, then take off the heat.To serve, scoop a quarter of the egg and tomato mixture into each of four shallow bowls. Top with a generous spoonful of yoghurt and a spoonful of harissa oil, followed by a good sprinkling of pine nuts, then serve straight away with warmed flatbreads.Explore more on these topicsTurkish food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodEggsMain courseTomatoesBrunchrecipesShareReuse this content"
