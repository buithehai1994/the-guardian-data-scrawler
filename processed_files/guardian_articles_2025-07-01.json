Labour MPs will demand itRafael BehrThe anti-Tory energy that won the PM a majority last year has gone. He needs to give his old supporters new reasons to keep him in officeTue 1 Jul 2025 14.51 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 19.08 EDTShareWhen politicians can’t admit they are losing, they say they are listening. Your anger has been heard, says the contrite minister after a byelection drubbing. We are addressing the concerns, says the government spokesperson on theeve of a backbench rebellion. Sometimes, it is even true. Usually, it is too late.The optimal time for Downing Street to have started paying attention toLabourMPs’ complaints about disability benefit cuts was before the uprising threatened to torpedo a flagship government bill.It wasnot, in the end, sunk, but it is listing low in the water. A humiliating Commons defeat was averted on Tuesday night byrolling concessions, diluting and deferring the policy with mounting, chaotic urgency as the vote drew near.49 Labour MPsstill voted to kill the bill anyway.Serious engagement on the substance of the rebels’ complaints only began once it became clear they were legion and resistant to the conventional whips’ arsenal of threats, pleas and career-advancing inducements. By that stage, relations between No 10 and the backbenches were befogged with suspicion and resentment.Withdrawing financial support from people with disabilities was always going to be a hard sell to Labour MPs. Blurring the line between reform and fiscal parsimony didn’t help. It is hard to persuade sceptics that the Department for Work and Pensions will prioritise compassion when cost-cutting under Treasury duress clearly dictates the pace and scope of policy. That mistrust aggravates misgiving about Keir Starmer’s strategy and the faultiness of his political antennae.Internal anxiety about Labour’s purpose has grown as the party’s popularity has shrivelled. There are many reasons for the steep collapse in support since the election. Two of the most commonly cited are lack of rigorous policy preparation in opposition and Starmer’s struggle to inspire audiences with a clear sense of what he wants from power.Those might be the same problem. Vagueness on substance, ruthless message discipline and a horror of loose leftish talk that might spook swing voters were vital components in a campaign for ousting the Tories.Last year’s election-winning strategy neutralised potential concerns about the prospect of a Labour government, but without generating enthusiasm for the idea. Starmer was the instrument of a broad but incoherent anti-Conservative coalition that lost its galvanising energy as soon as the exit poll was published.Arguably, the dissipation happened even earlier. The sense of an imminent Labour landslide, with weeks of headlines forecasting Tory annihilation, may have depressed turnout and encouraged left-leaning voters to prefer independents and Greens, safe in the knowledge that they wouldn’t wake up on 5 July to find Rishi Sunak still in charge.Labour could find the money it wants without raising taxes. This is austerity by amnesia | Randeep RameshRead moreTo a new government with a majority of 174, that looked like negligible voter attrition at the margins. The scale of the victory seemed to promise at least two terms in power. The official opposition was still the Tories, althoughReform UKwere already making menacing noises in the wings.Downing Street strategists were not worried about an exposed left flank. They could see frustration on that side of the spectrum where many had hoped Starmer’s pre-election insipidity was a feint, but the more pressing concern was an ongoing mission to persuade voters in Labour’s “red wall” heartlands that the party really was for them. That focus intensified onceReform started topping opinion polls.But messages calibrated to Nigel Farage’s potential recruits – reluctance to speak ill of Brexit; apugnacious tone on immigration– failed to seduce the target audience whiledriving defections to the Lib Dems and Greens. MPs started warning that this would cost Labour seats. Downing Street didn’t listen.That may now be changing. The rebellion on benefit cuts, coinciding with the first anniversary of the election, demands some strategic introspection.No one can pretend things are going well. Steps the government has taken that ought to be popular with the party’s base – big cash infusions for the NHS, transport, social housing; expanding provision of free school meals – haven’t registered amid the rage against cuts elsewhere.Farage has seized the mantle of radical changemaker, at least in that corner of the political market where change implies tearing down institutions and breaking rules without much thought (or honesty from the leader) about what might replace them.Starmer can’t compete in a game of system-smashing. He is a pragmatic fixer by nature and also prime minister – the apex of the system being targeted. While he also can’t ignore the concerns of Reform voters, polling evidence suggests they are a smaller, less biddable component of Labour’s potential electorate than the liberal-left defectors.Arecent poll commissioned by Stanley Greenberg, a veteran US Democratic party strategist with close ties to Labour, found that almost 15% of current Lib Dem voters and 10% of Greens say there is a fair chance they could back Starmer. The equivalent numbers for Tory and Reform are 3% and 1% respectively.The same poll looks at issues that animate swing voters and the messages that might appeal to them. Unsurprisingly, the NHS and cost of living crisis are top of everyone’s list. Immigration is also crucial. There is no path to a second term that doesn’t include credible reassurance that the nation’s borders are securely managed.But there are also fruitful areas where Starmer could lean more to the liberal-left in terms that retain mass appeal. One is urgency around the climate crisis (as long as it is made clear that consumers won’t be overburdened but will benefit from lower energy bills). Another is greater clarity about the destabilising effects of Donald Trump’s misrule in the US, and the necessary mitigation through closer strategic alignment with Europe. Trump is reviled by supporters of every UK party, including Reform. The only foreign leader who beats him at repelling British voters is Vladimir Putin. Farage has publicly admired them both.Given Greenberg’s connections, it is safe to assume his polling and the strategic avenues they illuminate have been seen and taken seriously in Downing Street. The core observation will come as no surprise to Starmer’s team. Local elections earlier this year had already revealed the fractious condition of British politics. Also, amid the volatility, a pattern of coalescence into two blocs – a liberal-progressive constellation of Labour, Lib Dem and Greens facing a populist-nationalist insurgency motored by Reform,with the Tories in a sidecar.Recognition of that dynamic explains Starmer’s tendency to name Farage as his main rival and treat Kemi Badenoch as an irrelevance. On one level, that is just a description of facts as they appear from current polling. But it also anticipates a general election campaign, where Labour maximises tactical support from Lib Dems and Greens. The assumption is that a litany of grudges against the prime minister will be set aside once the task in hand is blocking Farage’s entry into No 10.It is a plausible bet but not a certain one. If Labour continues to aggravate its former supporters at the current rate there is a serious risk of them casting a protest ballot elsewhere or staying at home when the anti-Reform clarion summons them to action.Four years remain before that call goes out. There is still time for Starmer to position himself as the candidate of a mainstream majority that doesn’t want Britain to follow the US down the path of bigoted venality, climate denialism and democratic decay. But if the prime minister really does envisage the next election as a head-to-head battle for the soul of British politics, he needs to get cannier at picking fights he can win, while also giving his longsuffering supporters something to cheer. His current method seems likely to do neither.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Raf Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government, its current policies and plans for the next four yearsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Video by Saminda SidhuTue 1 Jul 2025 04.09 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 04.58 EDTShareIn the weeks leading up to Israel’s war with Iran,which it launched on 13 June, there had been little let-up in its offensive in Gaza. A tenuous ceasefire had broken down in March, and a wave of airstrikes followed, as well as an 11-week blockade on all aid. Though some humanitarian assistance was allowed in from late May, military action intensified at the same time.Growing numbers of desperate Palestinians were being killed as they sought scarce food either from looted aid convoys or from distribution hubs set up by the new, secretive Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a group backed byIsraeland the US as an alternative to the existing, much more comprehensive UN-led system. Rolling IDF “evacuation orders” covered much of the territory.map 114 JuneOn the second day of the Israel-Iran conflict, at least 20 Palestinianswere killed by Israeli strikesin Gaza, according to local health officials, and another 11 near food distribution points run by the GHF. Palestinian witnesses said Israeli forces fired on the crowds, while the Israeli military said it fired warning shots near people it described as suspects who approached its forces.Footage filmed inGazaCity showed people pleading for food at a soup kitchen distribution point.Gaza City soup kitchen 14 June.A day later, eight more Palestinians were killed as they sought aid.16 JuneBefore dawn, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of hungry Palestinians heading for two hubs managed by the GHF. At least 37 people died, mainly while trying to reach the GHF centre near the southern city of Rafah, which has largely been razed by the Israeli military, and close to a second GHF site in central Gaza.Most of the casualties were taken to the Nasser hospital, which received more than 300 injured people. More than 200 patients were take to a Red Cross field hospital – the highest number received by the facility in one single mass casualty incident to date.17 JuneOn the bloodiest day for weeks in Gaza, witnesses described scenes like “a horror movie” after Israeli forces fired towards a crowd waiting for UN trucks loaded with flour near Khan Younis in the south, killing at least 59 Palestinians and injuring hundreds more.Gaza death graphicFootage showed people carrying flour bags away from the scene before the IDF began shooting.People carrying flour at food distribution site.A short time later injured Palestinians were seen arriving at a hospital in Khan Younis.View image in fullscreenPalestinians carry the bodies of loved ones killed when the IDF opened fire near Khan Younis on 17 June.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockThe incident led to a temporary suspension of such convoys, exacerbating an acute lack of food in the devastated territory. Fuel, clean water, medical supplies and much else is also in short supply, with dire humanitarian consequences. An Israeli military spokesperson said troops followed international law and took feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.18 JuneOnce again, vast crowdsgathered to “self-distribute”flour loaded on to aid convoys in central Gaza, and once again they were fired on by Israeli troops.

This one comprises two episodes and is entitled To Catch a Stalker.It comes from the corporation’s most youth-oriented arm,BBC Three, which mandates a telegenic presenter better versed in sympathy with the programme’s interviewees than interrogation of wider issues, and who has usually come up through the ranks of reality TV rather than journalism. Here, it’s Zara McDermott (Love Island, Made in Chelsea, The X Factor: Celebrity), who previously fronted entries in the infinite series on “revenge porn”, rape culture and eating disorders.We meet survivors (although this suggests their ordeals are at an end, which for none of them is the case – but to call them victims would be to diminish what McDermott rightly emphasises as their extraordinary strength and endurance) of different forms of stalking.Jen has endured the obsessive attentions of a man with whom she briefly crossed professional paths during her work for a recruitment company. It began with a few friendly texts and rapidly escalated to bombardment at all hours with insistent messages about their imminent relationship (“I am the guy you’re looking for. You just don’t recognise it”), naked pictures of himself and – as Jen continued not to respond to this stranger – fury. He repeatedly parked in places she was likely to pass and when the police eventually became involved – which has led to four convictions and three prison sentences for the man – they found multiple searches on his computer for pornographic lookalikes of Jen. She is now counting down the days until he is released from his latest stint in jail with dread. As McDermott says: “I don’t know how she sleeps at night.” It’s likely that she doesn’t. Jen shakes with nerves and has a terrible hunted look about her – because that is exactly what is happening to her. She is the prey of a predator who apparently cannot be stopped.No more, it seems, than any of them can with the current paltry tools at the law’s disposal – presuming you can find someone willing to wield them in the first place. All the women interviewed speak of police reluctance to take their experiences seriously.Twenty-year-old Isabel, who has moved five times to try to escape the terrifying attentions of her ex-boyfriend, no longer bothers to call the police when she sees a man, whom she assumes to be him, watching her from the alleyway behind her latest home, because they dropped her case when the original investigating officer left. “If you don’t help me, he’s going to kill me,” she told them. Apparently it fell on closed ears. Maybe they thought she was hysterical. Maybe I’m being unfair. Maybe you can think of a good enough reason for ignoring a young woman and her toddler trapped in their home because a man has decided he will not let her go. “He knows what he’s done,” she says. “And he knows he’s got away with it. So what is he going to do next?” The best safety plan a charity has been able to give her if he forces his way into her home is to drop from her balcony to the car park roof below and from there to the ground – she will not be able to take her son with her – then contact a neighbour or flag down a passing car.Victims’ (sufferers’, survivors’) family members attest to the fear and anxiety that stalkers induce in them all. Next week, the remit expands to consider the effects of cyberstalking (“Just ignore it” seems to be the most popular recommendation), and continues to document more women’s experiences with the flesh-and-blood kind of stalker, who message their targets 500 times a day and draw their fingers across throats from afar (far enough that they do not get returned to prison for breaching non-molestation orders), and so on and appallingly on.It is a documentary designed to raise awareness rather than provide answers, but you do long for a little examination of context; for someone to ask whether this would be so prevalent without, say, an existing culture of male entitlement, or within a society that valued women’s lives and freedom as highly as anyone else’s. If we didn’t have a police force known to be as riddled with bad apples and systemic sexism as it is. If, if, if.To Catch a Stalker aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionBBC ThreeDocumentaryFactual TVWomenSexual harassmentreviewsShareReuse this content"

Who has really thought, you know what, it’s great that existing claimants can get to keep their benefits but anyone after November 2026 who finds themselves in need of help can do without. It’s a question of morality. Either you think no one deserves the full personal independence payments or that everyone does. It’s that binary.Yet here we were again. On Monday,Liz Kendallhad laid out her measures to try to mitigate the rebellion on her own backbenches that could have sunk the welfare bill at second reading.The Labour benches had been rammed. Those whose minds could not be changed. Those who were looking for a reason to believe in any olive branch because they were desperate not to vote against their own government. Something with which to salve their conscience. A pat on the back for doing the right thing. A faint hope they could make a difference later. The Conservative benches were almost empty.Welfareisn’t really their thing.Welfare bill passes after Keir Starmer offers late concessionRead moreTuesday was groundhog day. Many of the same faces sitting in the same places. Labour MPs wrestling with their consciences. Tory MPs feet up watching the tennis at Wimbledon. Reform nowhere to be seen. Yet again, this was an entirely domestic dispute within the Labour party. Those who had not come into politics to tip another 150,000 into poverty. Those who could live with that. Collateral damage en route to a brighter, more glorious future.There was one difference, though. Liz Kendall, herself. The previous day she had sounded committed to her pet project. Regardless of the fact that it appeared to have been hijacked by the chancellor as a means to save £5bn. Regardless of the fact that the only bit of the welfare system her bill would really change were the payments to those that genuinely needed it. It was a bill that seemed totally arse about tit. There were plenty of reforms to be made. Just not the ones the government had in mind.After her mauling the day before, though, this was a more downbeat Liz. A broken butterfly. A Liz that no longer really believed in what she was saying. As if even she couldn’t face down the surge of reality. She had tried denial but it no longer worked for her. She was on her knees. Though not yet ready to admit outright defeat. Liz still believes in Liz. Sort of. She believes in her own career. Can’t bear to think of life after secretary of state for work and pensions. That this might be the hill on which she dies.In the opening speech, there was a resignation. A numbness. As if she was bored with going through the same nonsense over and over again. Trying to convince people who were never going to be convinced. Even if they voted with the government they would be doing it under duress. Trying to convince herself. Though the longer she went on the closer she looked to rebelling against herself.Leading Labour rebel backs welfare bill amid sustained defianceRead moreMerely saying the system was broken wasn’t enough. A truism that got you nowhere. Liz had no answer to why it was fine for people to not get the same Pip benefits if they became disabled after November 2026. Other than to suggest that people should make sure they get their disabilities in early. August next year, say. Book now while the sale is on. No answer to why the changes were due to come into place before the Timms report was published. Timms was no more than a Potemkin village. A diversion. Almost the definition of insanity.Still, all was not lost to Liz. Because, for reasons best known to herself, Kemi Badenoch had strong-armed the shadow work and pensions secretary, Helen Whately, out of the way and chosen to reply on behalf of the opposition. Now Whately is no star at the dispatch box – her efforts on Monday had been spectacularly dismal – but Kemi is guaranteed to be a whole lot worse.Kemi has no trouble living in her own reality. It’s just not one where the rest of us live. Worse still, she can’t help but be shouty and angry. Her arrogance is a real political turn-off. It’s as though she thinks she is doing the rest of us a massive favour by just breathing.Everything was better under the Tories, she said, before going on to moan about the Labour party having done nothing in opposition to plan for a system that wasn’t working. No idea of the contradictions in what she was saying. Just the certainty she was right. Thanks to her, several wavering Labour MPs would now be rowing in behind the government.Next up was Rachael Maskell to speak in favour of her reasoned amendment. Content to merely reiterate the obvious flaws while calling the government’s attitude Dickensian. We would also get to hear George Orwell and Nelson Mandela quoted. Maskell begged the government to have another think. It was a matter of basic decency. Liz left the building the moment Rachael sat down. Her conscience had had enough.The one Labour MP to speak in favour of the bill was Meg Hillier. A former welfare refusenik. She was keen to bank the concessions. Try not to think about the consequences. Live entirely in the present.Disabilityas we know it could effectively end in November 2026. This cut no ice with Marie Tidball, the only visibly disabled MP in the house. She made the speech of the day. Passionate. Just the right side of angry. Labour was meant to be on the side of vulnerable people.Midway through the afternoon, rumours began to emerge. The Labour whips were worried. The disability minister, Stephen Timms, was due to make further, er, measures to see off therebels. His review wouldn’t be a placebo after all. The new four-point rules for claimants after November next year would not come into force until after Timms had consulted with disability groups. A climbdown that should have been made days ago. In the interests of logic as much as conscience. The bill would pass. But at a massive cost to Liz and Keir Starmer’s authority. Not to mention the autumn budget.And so it came to pass. Round about 5.30pm, Timms begged to be allowed a few words. “Um, er,” he mumbled quietly. Everything had changed. Everything that Liz had said was wrong. Though he couldn’t quite bring himself to say that the recommendations of his review would be implemented. But, baby steps and all that. It was enough. Maskell’s amendment was defeated and the bill passed comfortably enough. Though it was now a bill in name only. Signifying nothing, with all reforms and cost savings ripped out. Liz’s reputation in tatters. Finita. Starmer nowhere to be seen. And everyone asking if the whole sorry business had really been worth it.Explore more on these topicsWelfareThe politics sketchBenefitsLiz KendallDisabilityLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Spain will win out on the night. England know the ropes and cannot be ruled out but their path to glory looks complicated.Nick AmesI am going England-Spain, a rerun of the2023 World Cup final.It would mean England finish second in Group D to go in the other half of the draw. Between those two, head says Spain; heart, of course, says England.Sophie DowneyView image in fullscreenWill England and Spain meet in the final of another major tournament?Photograph: Bagu Blanco/ShutterstockSpain against Germany is the most logical final. Although England could disrupt that if they click, my instinct says Spain-Germany. Spain should get the job done and win their first Euros. They have never reached the final but have the strongest squad, in terms of technical skill, a relatively kind group draw and more days to rest and recover than their rivals in Groups C and D, so this should be Spain’s year.Tom GarryI’ll go for Spain to win it, and it’ll be Germany, England or the Netherlands. Those are the four best teams in the tournament.Emma HayesSpain to beat Sweden in a disappointingly mid-paced final that feels like something of an anticlimax after their all-time classic against Germany in the semis.Jonathan LiewFrance and Italy with the former winning. France are serial underachievers but they have been in hot form under Laurent Bonadei and, combining technical excellence with pace-suffused fluidity, are more dynamic than many rivals. They possess the weapons to win a first major tournament. Italy – much improved under Andrea Soncin’s management – look classic dark horses.Louise TaylorDon’t make me do this. I have a terrible feeling England will finish second in the group and face Germany in the quarter-finals. That will be a tricky test but I’d back them to get past it and go all the way to the final, where they would meet Spain and lose to the world champions.Suzanne WrackWho will be top scorer?Lea Schüller remains a formidable spearhead for Germany and, in a side who have carved recent opponents wide open, should add healthily to her tally in Switzerland. Alessia Russo could challenge her but may find England’s assignments too nip-and-tuck.NAView image in fullscreenLea Schüller will aim to add to her 52 international goals.Photograph: Stuart Franklin/Getty ImagesClàudia Pina – one of the most natural strikers in the competition. This is the 23-year-old’s time to shine on the back of a brilliant season for Barcelona, where she finished as the top goalscorer in the Champions League.SDPina could blow defences away. Even if she isn’t chosen to start every game, she could be even more lethal coming off the bench against tiring defences. A tally of five or six goals may be enough for the Golden Boot and I would back Pina to notch at least four during the group stage on the form she displayed towards the end of the club season.TGI’m going to say Alessia Russo. I think Alessia is in a great place and I think since Renée Slegers has taken Arsenal on, she and Kelly Smith deserve huge credit for the development of Alessia.EHAlessia Russo.Sandy Baltimore: bit left-field (pun intended), but hear me out. Played as a wing-back for much of her career but now adding goals to her game: five for France and a brace in the FA Cup final. France’s stacked frontline will allow her plenty of space to operate and she could easily go on a run.JLMarie-Antoinette Katoto. The Lyon striker – she joins from PSG on Tuesday – has 38 goals in 55 appearances for France and combines precision finishing with often unplayable physicality. After rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in the group stage of Euro 2022, then missing the 2023 World Cup, this could finally be the 26-year-old’s moment in the sun.LTMarie-Antoinette KatotoIf you’re predicting Spain to win then it’s hard not to predict Pina to pick up the Golden Boot. She’s been in formidable form and, although goals can come from a variety of Spain players, I think Pina will do very well. Were the Netherlands not drawn in such a tricky group I’d have fancied Vivianne Miedema.SWWho will be the surprise team?Iceland look strong, reliable and more than well placed to compete seriously in a winnable Group A. They have a habit of staying in games and, if they were to avoid Spain in the last eight, could travel far. It is also worth watching out for a hugely improved Italy.NAItaly are my dark horses. Andrea Soncin has overseen something of a rebuild and refresh since he took over in 2023. They have been in steady form since, taking the scalps of Spain and Germany among others. Roma’s playmaker Manuela Giugliano is one to watch.SDView image in fullscreenItaly are fancied to go deep in the tournament.Photograph: Anders Wiklund/TT NEWS AGENCY/AFP/Getty ImagesAt least one of the seven teams in Group A and B who are not Spain will reach the semi-finals. That’s guaranteed, so while that won’t be a “surprise”, whoever makes it from that relatively low-ranking set will be an unlikely name for a semi-finalist. There is little between the seven but I am leaning towards Italy, who have recorded some excellent results since the World Cup.TGYou have to talk about the French, while Italy are a good side and Belgium have the qualities to be disruptive.EHItaly have claimed some big scalps in the past 12 months and if they escape a tough group the draw could easily open out for them.JLWales. The NWSL title in the United States is notoriously hard to win but the Wales coach, Rhian Wilkinson, pulled that feat off at Portland Thorns in 2022. Wilkinson has turned a highly motivated Wales into extremely awkward opponents and, with Jess Fishlock and Sophie Ingle in a high-calibre midfield, they look capable of reaching the quarter-finals of their first major tournament.LTskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The draw has certainly helped them and if they top the group that should give them momentum going into the knockouts. I don’t expect them to go far, but with Ada Hegerberg, Guro Reiten, Caroline Graham Hansen, Frida Maanum, etc the quality is there.SWWho will be the breakthrough player?Nobody with any handle on the England setup is blind to the prodigious talent of Aggie Beever-Jones. Now Europe should discover the Chelsea striker’s gifts first-hand. She has made a flying start at international level and should prove an explosive option from the bench.NABeever-Jones will bring the impact from the bench. The 21-year-old is playing in her first major tournament and has just enjoyed the season of her young career. If the Lionesses need a goal, they know they have someone in the ranks with an instinctive eye for one.SDView image in fullscreenAggie Beever-Jones could be the surprise package for the Lionesses.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesFor the viewer who may not be a women’s football diehard, this should be the tournament when Cláudia Pina breaks into the mainstream and receives wider recognition. Meanwhile, England’s Michelle Agyemang can go into this tournament with no fear and if she gets a chance off the bench she can show she is a future superstar.TGPina is someone who has got huge, huge potential. For England, we could talk about Grace Clinton for example, but I’m always going to say Beever-Jones, because if England need a different type of goalscorer in another moment in a game, I think she’s capable of delivering on that front. For Germany, watch out for Jule Brand; she is so exciting to watch.EHClaudia Pina.Vicky López. Still only 18 but long regarded as one of Europe’s most promising talents, López went to last summer’s Olympics for Spain but didn’t play. Has featured more often for Barcelona this season and this could be the tournament that puts her name in lights.JLManuela Giugliano. The Roma playmaker says she models her game on that of Andrea Pirlo but, at 27, is still to see her lofty domestic standing transposed on to the international stage. That could be about to change for a dead-ball wizard blessed with superior vision, a stellar passing range and a knack of making impeccable defensive interceptions.LTLauren James has had an injury-hit season for Chelsea but when fit she has looked sublime. The forward seems to have matured her all-round game, her defensive work rate as impressive as her attacking, and this could be the tournament where she really stamps her name on the international stage. In training she has looked phenomenal and her assist against Jamaica on Sunday, after coming on for her first minutes in three months, showed her importance to England from a creativity point of view.SWWhat are you most looking forward to?Further evidence that standards at the game’s elite level continue to reach new heights – in a country that should be perfectly set up to host a smooth, joyful summer tournament.NAI think the next month will be the best illustration of how far European football has continued to develop over the past three years. Any of five or six teams could win it and no side are infallible. In terms of the tournament, I am looking forward to seeing everything that Switzerland has to offer. This is a huge moment in their women’s football journey and I am sure they will seize it.SDThe three group matches between England, France and the Netherlands – all three of whom are capable of going all the way – should make for blockbuster viewing. The pressure riding on those early fixtures will be immense; they are akin to semi-finals, in terms of standard, but they are going to be entertaining us inside the first 11 days. I’m also looking forward to the mountainous scenery from the window seat of a Swiss train. It is a beautiful country.TGView image in fullscreenThe Dutch fans light up any tournament.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockNowadays players have got more access to the support they need to be the best versions of themselves, so the quality is going to be so much higher. There may be a bit of a shifting of the order, too; this may be a tournament where we talk about a Belgium or an Italy and not a Sweden and a Norway. That’s not to say that will happen, but there could be a shift.EHThe Dutch fans. Obviously.JLYou mean apart from the Swiss chocolate museum in Lucerne? Watching Wales and their 38-year-old, but still world-class, midfielder Jess Fishlock at their first major tournament. The final Group B game between Italy and Spain in Berne looks intriguing, too. Off the pitch, seeing Lake Lucerne, the Alps and the Abbey Library in St Gallen, said to be one of the world’s oldest and most beautiful.LTA cheese fondue. Does that need elaboration? It’s all I’ve been thinking about for months. On the pitch, Spain are obviously the favourites but the fact any one of several teams (Spain, England, Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands …) could win this tournament makes it hugely exciting. Set against the backdrop of stunning Switzerland, it will be memorable.SWExplore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The universal credit and personal independence payment bill passed it second reading on Tuesday by 335 votes to 260, a majority of 75.How No 10 went from bullish to badly damaged as rebels forced further welfare bill concessionsRead moreMPs were particularly concerned that the government’s own poverty analysis showed that, even after a series of concessions, 150,000 of the most vulnerable people would end up in relative poverty as a result. Officials said the modelling did not take into account the changes being made to the NHS and back-to-work schemes.The bulk of the rebels were from the left of the party, and none of them were the select committee chairs who spearheaded the rebellion last week, but it was a sizeable rebellion given the scale of concessions already made.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, and government whips warned Downing Street on Tuesday that further movement was needed after meetings with Labour MPs already unhappy over the substance of the bill and Starmer’s approach after he dismissed criticism as “noises off”.As a result, the government confirmed the changes to disability payments will only take place after Stephen Timms, the welfare minister, has reported the findings of his review into the system, due to conclude in autumn 2026. Originally, the Pip changes were due to come in from November 2026.Government insiders suggested that resignations could follow the chaotic scenes, although at a cabinet meeting before the vote Starmer defended his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who has been credited for winning Labour’s 165 working majority, but faced some internal criticism over the row.“We will learn from our mistakes, but we will not turn on each other,” Starmer told his ministers. “We will not resile from our record of achievements and we will not turn on our staff – including our chief of staff, without whom none of us would be sitting around this cabinet table.”The process left Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, badly humiliated with the U-turn coming just hours after she had told the Commons the new Pip four-point threshold would apply from November 2026 and emphasised the need for the Timms review to take its time.Asked if her position was untenable after the series of concessions left the bill a hollowed-out version of the original proposals, Kendall insisted that despite what she called “a bumpy time” with the vote, the broader policy was on track.“I think listening is actually a strength in politics, as indeed it is in life, and I’ll continue to listen to colleagues,” she said. “What was very interesting was how much support there was for the principle of reforming the welfare state.”She insisted the Labour party was “100%” behind the Starmer, but added: “There are definitely lessons to learn from this process. I certainly will do that, and I’m sure my colleagues will too, but we have agreed on the principles of reform here.”The removal of an entire clause of the bill means there will be no immediate changes to Pip, the most contentious part of the changes, and where ministers hoped to make the bulk of savings. The Timms review will be “co-produced” with disabled people, leaving open the possibility that they will never happen.However, plans to increase the standard rate of universal credit, to incentivise more people back into work and extra protections for the most severely ill and disabled will go ahead. Separate plans for back-to-work schemes will also proceed.Last week, 126 Labour MPs, led by the Treasury select committee chair, Meg Hillier, signed an amendment designed to blow up the bill. Ministers said that no current claimant would be affected by the changes to UC and Pip. Rebels were also promised the Timms review of the criteria would heavily involve disability groups.But the terms of reference of the review made clear that there would still be a higher bar for obtaining Pip – new claimants would need a high score of four in at least one of the daily living categories for assessment to qualify.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/30/who-are-the-key-labour-rebels-in-the-revolt-against-starmers-welfare-billSubstantial numbers of the rebels fell into line after the government’s initial concessions, however 42 Labour MPsbackeda separate wrecking amendment, which did not pass, tabled by the backbencher Rachael Maskell.The chancellor will now have to find another £5bn in savings at her budget as a direct result of all the concessions on the welfare bill, as well as £1.25bn to cover the cost of the winter fuel U-turn, all raising the likelihood of her being forced to put up taxes.Ruth Curtice, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “The government originally hoped to save £4.8bn from its welfare reforms in the crucial year of 29-30. The upshot of all the concessions this week is it will now not make any net savings in that year.“The changes to universal credit are nonetheless important for recipients and their work incentives, and are expected to save money in the longer term.”Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, posted on social media: “This is an utter capitulation. Labour’s welfare bill is now a TOTAL waste of time. It effectively saves £0, helps no one into work, and does NOT control spending. It’s pointless. They should bin it, do their homework, and come back with something serious.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsLabourHouse of CommonsDisabilityKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

If you decide you are done for the day, send me another note and I’ll bring you back out to end the day,” Arun Subramanian told jurors after 5pm on Tuesday.Shortly after, the jurors sent the court a note saying that they had concluded for the day, and would resume deliberations on Wednesday morning.Combs, 55, wasarrested in Septemberand faces five felony counts: one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and denies all of the accusations against him.If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.Late on Tuesday afternoon, jurors sent their sixth note to the court. They indicated to the judge that they had reached a verdict on four of the counts but were unable to reach a consensus on the racketeering charge due to some jurors with “unpersuadable views”.In response, both prosecutors and Combs’s defense team asked jurors to keep deliberating on the remaining charge. There was discussion on whether to read jurors anAllen charge, more colloquially known as a “dynamite charge”, which is further instruction to encourage those in the minority to reconsider their position.Of the charges Combs faces, racketeering conspiracy is the most complicated because the jury must decide whether Combs ran a “racketeering enterprise” and also whether he was involved in committing some or all of various types of offenses, like kidnapping and arson, according to the Associated Press.The 12-member jury – composed of eight men and four women –began deliberating on Mondayfollowing closing arguments, which concluded last week, and detailed instructions from the judge.Roughly an hour into deliberations on Monday, jurors sent a note to the court raising concerns about one of the jurors – Juror 25 – stating that they believed that the juror “cannot follow your honor’s instructions”.Fake, AI-generated videos about the Diddy trial are raking in millions of views on YouTubeRead moreSubramanian, who is overseeing the case, responded to the jurors with a note reminding them of their duty to deliberate and obligation to follow his instructions on the law. He also instructed them to refrain from sharing any details about their discussions in future notes.Before adjourning for the day, the jury sent another note to the court, this time requesting clarification on what qualifies as drug distribution – an allegation tied to the racketeering conspiracy charge.The jurors asked whether giving drugs to someone who asked for them qualifies as distributing controlled substances. The judge said that he would respond on Tuesday morning.The jury deliberated for five-and-a-half hours on Monday without reaching a verdict, and adjourned at 5pm ET.On Tuesday morning, the judge conferred with both sides and sent the jury a note pointing to a passage in the charging document.The passage reads: “The word ‘distribution’ means actual, constructive, or attempted transfer. To distribute simply means to deliver, to pass over, or to hand over something to another person, or to cause it to be delivered, passed on, or handed over to another. Distribution does not require a sale.”About 10.30am ET on Tuesday, the jury submitted another note to the court, this time asking for transcripts of testimony given by two witnesses: Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, one of Combs’s former girlfriends and the government’s key witness in this case, and Daniel Phillip, who testified that he was hired to participate in the so-called “freak offs”.The judge ordered the excerpts of transcripts to be sent to the jury by 1pm ET.Central to the government’s case are accusations that Combs used violence, intimidation, money, threats and power to force and coerce two of his former girlfriends into participating in highly orchestrated drug-fueled sex marathons with hired male escorts, known as “freak-offs”.Prosecutors allege that for more than two decades, Combs led a criminal enterprise – aided by employees and associates – that engaged in and worked to cover up a range of crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, drug distribution, arson and bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice.Throughout the seven-week trial, the defense maintained thatall sexual encounters were consensual and part of what they described as a “swingers lifestyle”. They argued that no criminal conspiracy existed and that Combs was being unfairly prosecuted for his “private” and “personal” sex life.His lawyers have acknowledged past instances of domestic violence, but they have denied any acts of sex trafficking or coercion.The trial beganon 12 May, and jurors heard testimony from 34 witnesses, includingtwo of Combs’s former girlfriends, multipleformer employeesand assistants, several male escorts, stylists, hotel workers, law enforcement agents and well-known figures such as therapper Kid Cudiandsinger Dawn Richard, among others.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsUS crimeNew YorkLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

What’s more, the total of seven British men into round two is the best at any grand slam event since Wimbledon 1997.Another searingly hot day began with a check through the history books to find out the highest number of British first-round winners in the Open era, which was 13, in 1968. That always looked out of reach but Pinnington Jones’s brilliant 7-6 (4), 6-3, 7-5 win over Tomás Martín Etcheverry, the world No 53 from Argentina, took the tally into double figures.Jack Draper coolly handles Wimbledon pressure by marching past Sebastián BáezRead moreYet another product of Texas Christian University, where Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley studied, Pinnington Jones played stunning tennis on his Wimbledon debut, winning five straight games from 5-2 down in the third set for victory.Evans saw off another British player in Jay Clarke, a 6-1, 7-5, 6-2 win setting up a clash with Novak Djokovic, the seven-time champion. “I’ve got a lot of respect for Novak, he’s a great champion,” Evans said. “He’s done pretty much everything in the game. But it’s also my chance to win the match.“I have to be competitive, I have to play my game, I have to be myself. I can’t go into my shell and have too much respect. I’m looking forward to it.”View image in fullscreenBritain’s Jodie Burrage battles against Caty McNally but went down 6-3, 6-1.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersOf the six British players to lose, only Jodie Burrage was truly gutted by her performance, an ankle injury – picked up, she said, in an accident by the media centre on Friday – hampering her in a 6-3, 6-1 defeat against Caty McNally, of the US. Breaking her bracelet when she banged her racket into her left hand did not help her mood. “At least it wasn’t the expensive stuff but yeah, that was tough,” she said, forcing a smile. “It’s completely done. I’ve got another one at home, so you’ll see that one in the next few days.”George Loffhagen and Fran Jones also won sets but could not convert them into victories, while Johannus Monday was outplayed, not surprisingly, by the No 13 seed, Tommy Paul. “It was a very difficult match,” said the 6ft 6in Monday. “I felt a lot of pressure. I just tried to savour the moment.”Heather Watson, appearing at Wimbledon for the 15th time, went down 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 to the No 23 seed, Clara Tauson, a clear missed opportunity. “I let that slip through my fingers,” she said.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

She had reportedly suffered from a heart condition.A 70-year-old man was reported to have drowned at a tourist resort close to Turin as intense heat gave way to storms and flash floods.Admissions to hospital emergency units in parts ofItalyhave risen by 15-20% in recent days. The majority of patients are elderly people suffering from dehydration.The heatwave, which has forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from their homes inTurkey due to wildfires, has also forced the closure of schools in parts of France – as education unions warned the classrooms were dangerously hot for children and teachers.View image in fullscreenThe top of the Eiffel Tower was closed to tourists amid the high temperatures in Paris.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/ReutersTourists, meanwhile, were confronted with closures of some of Europe’s popular attractions. The top of the Eiffel Tower was shut as temperatures in Paris were poised to hit 38C (100.4F). In Brussels, the Atomium monument, famed for its giant stainless steel balls, closed early as temperatures inched towards 37C.In Italy, Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, two industrial hubs, announced they were stopping open-air work between 12.30pm and 4pm, joining 11 other regions – stretching from Liguria in the north-west to Calabria and Sicily in the south – that have imposed similar bans in recent days.Local authorities were heeding advice from trade unions after the death of Brahim Ait El Hajjam, a 47-year-old construction worker, who collapsed and died while working on a building site close to Bologna, the capital of Emilia-Romagna, on Monday.Europe swelters under heatwave – in picturesRead moreTwo workers fell ill on Tuesday on a construction site near Vicenza in Veneto. One is reportedly in a coma.The CGIL Bologna and Fillea CGIL unions said in a statement: “While we wait to learn the actual cause of death, it is essential, during this terrible period, to promote a culture of safety.“The climate emergency has clearly worsened the conditions for those who work outside every day and companies must give absolute priority to the protection of workers.”The French national rail operator SNCF said train travel betweenFranceand Italy had been suspended for “at least several days” after violent storms on Monday, AFP reported.Cogne, a town in Italy’s Aosta Valley that suffered severe flooding in June last year, has been cut off by a landslide.The Spanish state meteorological agency, Aemet,said in a social media update that“June 2025 smashed records” when it came to high temperature, with an average temperature of 23.6C, 0.8C above the previous hottest June in 2017.The monthly average was also 3.5C higher than the average over the period from 1991 to 2020, it said.View image in fullscreenA man drinks from a fountain during hot weather in Naples.Photograph: Ansa/Ciro Fusco/EPAThe agency’s comments come just days after Spain’s highest ever June temperature of 46C was recorded in the Huelva province of Andalucía.InPortugal, temperatures hit 46.6C in Mora, a town in the Évora district, in recent days, making it the highest June temperature ever recorded in the country, according to the Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere.In France, the prime minister, François Bayrou, tried to calm anger at the heatwave crisis in French schools. More than 1,896 schools across the country were fully or partially closed on Tuesday.InParis, which was on maximum heatwave alert, parents were advised to keep their children at home on Tuesday and Wednesday. Some other towns, including Troyes and Melun, closed all their schools.Bayrou said the education ministry would open talks with mayors on how to adapt school buildings, most of which are extremely poorly insulated.As temperatures rose on Tuesday, some Paris teachers had nothing more than a water spray on their desk to repeatedly spritz children in classrooms in the hope of keeping cool.View image in fullscreenSeveral Spanish regions, including Barcelona, were on alert for exceptionally high temperatures as the first heatwave of the summer hit the country.Photograph: Alejandro García/EPABayrou, who is facing a vote of no confidence on Tuesday, which he is expected to survive, has cancelled his meetings to monitor the situation in real time.The hot weather front known inGermanyas Bettina is expected to have nearly the entire country in its grip by Wednesday, with temperatures shooting toward the 40C mark and only the coasts and Alpine peaks spared the scorching temperatures.Industry groups warned that schools, elderly care homes and hospitals were ill-prepared for the heatwave – an urgent issue they said must be addressed as the frequency of life-threatening weather increases.Other cities across Europe are also experiencing higher than usual temperatures, including Zaragoza (39C), Rome (37C), Madrid (37C), Athens (37C), Brussels (36C), Frankfurt (36C), Tirana (35C) and London (33C).Turkey’s forestry minister, İbrahim Yumaklı, said firefighters had been called out to 263 wildfires across the country in recent days.

The US president responded: “Well, then, we’ll have to arrest him,”Axios reported.Mamdaniposteda statement on X in response. “The President of the United States just threatened to have me arrested, stripped of my citizenship, put in a detention camp and deported. Not because I have broken any law but because I will refuse to let Ice terrorize our city,” he wrote.He continued: “His statements don’t just represent an attack on our democracy but an attempt to send a message to every New Yorker who refuses to hide in the shadows: if you speak up, they will come for you. We will not accept this intimidation.”Controversy over his immigration status follows a chorus of Islamophobic attacks on his Muslim faith following his victory in last week’s New York mayoral primary, when he finished first in a field that included Andrew Cuomo, the former New York state governor and favored candidate of the Democratic establishment.It also comes after theTrump administration instructed attorneys to prioritize denaturalizing foreign-born US citizenswho had committed specified crimes. A justice department memo instructs lawyers to institute proceedings against naturalized citizens who ares suspected of having “illegally procured” naturalization or having done so by “concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation”.Ogles wroteto Pam Bondi, the attorney general, calling for an investigation into Mamdani after his Democratic mayoral primary victory on the grounds that “he may have procured US citizenship through willful misrepresentation or concealment of material support for terrorism”.As evidence, he cited a rap song by Mamdani, entitled my love to the Holy Land five, in which he called members of a foundation convicted of supporting Hamas “my guys”. He also referred to Mamdani’s refusal to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada”.In an accompanying post on X, Ogles wrote: “Zohran ‘little muhammad’ Mamdani is an antisemitic, socialist, communist who will destroy the great City of New York. He needs to be deported.”Asked about Ogles’s call,Leavitt said: “I have not seen those claims, but surely if they are true, it’s something that should be investigated.”The justice department has confirmed receiving Ogles’s letter but has not commented further.Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator for Connecticut who has become one of the Trump administration’s most effective critics, called the demand to denaturalize Mamdani “racist bullshit”.“Trump will stop at nothing to protect billionaires and price gouging corporations, even racist bullshit like this,”he wrote.“Zohran won because he ran a campaign laser focused on putting power back in the hands of working people. And that’s a threat to the Mar-a-Lago crowd.”Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, has had his social media posts and previous political activism fiercely scrutinized since last week’s election victory, which was accompanied by promises of leftwing populist policies for New York if he is eventually elected mayor.Amid a chorus of rightwing vitriol,Donald Trump has called him “a pure communist”and has threatened to cut off funds to New York if Mamdani becomes mayor and “doesn’t behave himself”.At a news conference at the official unveiling of a new detention centre for immigrants in Florida’s Everglades, Trump reiterated his communist remark and referred to allegations that Mamdani had obtained his citizenship “illegally”.“We don’t need a communist in this country, but if we have one, I’m going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation. We send him money, we send him all the things that he needs to run a government,” Trump said.“We’re going to be watching that very carefully. A lot of people are saying, he’s here illegally. We’re going to look at everything, but ideally, he’s going to turn out to be much less than a communist. Right now he’s a communist, that’s not a socialist.”Mamdani also commented on the fact that Trump praisedEric Adams, the current New York City mayor who is struggling in his re-election campaign and switched from representing the Democratic party to running again as an independent. Trump said Adams was a “good person” whom he had “helped out a little bit”, referring to the US justice department in Aprildismissinga federal corruption case against Adams.Mamdani said in his post: “That Trump included praise for Adams in his authoritarian threats is unsurprising.”Joanna Walters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniTrump administrationNew YorkUS politicsDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

The religious group blends Islamic theology with conspiracy theories about the Illuminati and aliens secretly controlling US presidents.AROPL says it is a peaceful, open and transparent religious movement derived from Shia Islam that has faced persecution around the world owing to its belief in equality and human rights.Quick GuideContact Maeve McClenaghan about this storyShowIf you have something to share about the Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light (AROPL), or other issues raised in this story, you can contact Maeve using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The group was previously based in Sweden. The members were in effect barred from the country after a slew of businesses linked to the organisation were found to be providing sham visas.About 100 followers are said to live at the Crewe headquarters, including families with children who are home schooled on site. During a recent visit on a weekday afternoon, a reporter saw more than a dozen young children playing in a yard. Elsewhere, adults in black beanie hats sat eating lunch or walking large guard dogs. (Hashem and his followers routinely wear black beanies, even in hot weather.)View image in fullscreenA man in a black beanie is one of those providing security at the former orphanage.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianView image in fullscreenThe Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light is registered as a charity in the US and has applied for charitable status in the UK.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe Guardian has reviewed court judgments, company filings, religious scriptures and videos and hundreds of pages of official documents about the group and its members, and interviewed several former members.Some, including former residents of the headquarters at Crewe, expressed concern about the wellbeing and education of the children there. Cheshire East council’s social services twice made inquiries relating to the group or the children. There is no evidence action was deemed necessary.‘Duty’ to donate salaryHashem, an Egyptian-American raised in Indiana, first made a name for himself making films in which he infiltrated and debunked cults in the US.In 2008, he and his partner were sued after filming an undercover documentary about a Switzerland-based UFO religion. “We’re really building up our reputation for debunking the false prophet, UFO phenomenon,” Hashem told reporters while promoting his documentary.Seven years later, he founded AROPL,declaring himself the Mahdi, a saviour figure from Islamic doomsday prophecy. He alsoclaims to be the rightful pope, as well as the successor to the prophet Muhammad and Jesus.Hashem’s scriptures are contained in his book, The Goal of the Wise. It declares his followers have a “duty” to donate their entire salary – keeping only deductions for basic living – and sell their houses or land to fund his mission to create a “divine” state.Former members said they felt pressured to sever ties with people outside the group, and were encouraged to sell their properties to fund its activities. One woman said she handed over all the money she had received for her wedding; another follower said he donated about £33,000.View image in fullscreenWebb House in Crewe has Grade II status.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHashem’s scripture promotes a number of unusual beliefs, such as his claim that epilepsy can be cured by placing a bird of paradise on a patient’s genitals.A lawyer for AROPL and Hashem said no practices involving birds of paradise were conducted. They said that “in common with other religious orders” AROPL expected permanent residents to sell assets to help sustain themselves and the movement, and denied that members were encouraged to ostracise relatives or tightly controlled. The lawyer said members could join and leave AROPL as they wished.The group has faced harassment and persecution, particularly in Algeria, Malaysia and Turkey, where many of its claims, such as the Qur’an having been corrupted or tolerance for LGBT people, are considered heresies. Amnesty International and other human rights groups havecriticisedalleged mistreatment of AROPL members, whichUN expertshave called “a persecuted religious minority”.View image in fullscreenSupporters surround Abdullah Hashem in a video on the group’s YouTube channel.Photograph: The Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light/YouTubeSlick media operationFor those in Crewe, regular gatherings take place in the “basilica”, a room with a raised wooden dais and walls covered with illustrations of the supporters Hashem has declared are reincarnations of religious figures.The group operates a slick-media operation, and regularly produces and circulates videos about its activities. On one TikTok channel a large group of men, many wearing black beanies,declare they are “soldiers” for Hashemand will fight and die for him. One is holding a guard dog on a chain.Some videos feature children. In one, a boy who says he is 16, describes Hashem as his “dad, imam, God”. In another video, which shows the apparently primary school-aged girl claiming Hashem miraculously cured her stomach pains, the child’s mother says she considered conventional medical advice before turning to her religious leader.View image in fullscreenMembers of the group call themselves ‘soldiers’ for Hashem.Photograph: Tiktok/Soldiers of the Qaim“It reached a point that I was thinking, OK, now I feel I have to take her to the doctor,” she said. However, after seeing a video showing Hashem supposedly curing a man of stomach pains with his hands, she instead asked the religious leader to give her daughter the same treatment.The video then shows the girl saying that Hashem placed his hand on her stomach: “He told me to close my eyes, and then he said some words, I don’t know which words,” she said. She added that Hashem then stepped away “and it actually worked … it feels good for my stomach and it’s really healed”.AROPL’s lawyer, asked about the video, said Hashem and the group fully supported the NHS as the solution to all medical issues in the UK.Two relatives of a teenager living at the Crewe premises told the Guardian he had previously told them that he was unhappy there and wanted to leave. They also expressed concerns about his lack of formal education.It is legal in England to home school, although any group of more than five children must be registered with Ofsted, the UK government’s education inspectorate.AROPL’s lawyer said the organisation was not involved in home schooling, which was led by parents. The group had considered setting up a formal school, the lawyer said, but had shelved the idea and “dismantled the classrooms”.Hashem has warned his followers about the corrupting influence of mainstream education on children, and encouraged them to “take advantage of laws” in countries that enable home schooling.Herecently told followers: “You can’t fully control what’s going on with your child so long as they are mingling on the outside with people that you don’t know.”AROPL has applied for charitable status in the UK, with the Charity Commission currently considering the application. It has charitable status in the US, and has several hundred supporters around the world, who are asked to pledge allegiance to the group via social media.View image in fullscreenThe colouring book of a child whose family is part of the group.Deportations from SwedenThe group was previously based in Egypt and Germany, before moving to Sweden, where 69 members had their residency permits revoked.The Swedish Migration Agency concluded that AROPL members had created businesses that were “rogue employers”, intended primarily to obtain residency permits. The companies’ supposed staff received very low wages, which the agency suspected were then immediately paid into other AROPL businesses, leaving the workers without real payment.In a series of rulings in 2022 an immigration court upheld the agency’s findings and ordered the deportation of dozens of the group’s members, although most had moved to the UK by the time the judgments were handed down.In a statement, Hashem claimed followers served with deportation notices werevictims of racist and religious persecution, and complained about “the spewing of racism for the sake of rallying a Nazi base of supporters to stand behind the fascist Swedish government”.In Germany, where AROPL had been based before moving to Sweden, an investigation is continuing into the disappearance of a German member of the group.Lisa Wiese disappeared while visiting India in 2019. She had travelled there with another member of AROPL, vanishing shortly after arrival, and has not been seen since. A lawyer for AROPL said the group did not have any information about the disappearance of Wiese, a mother of two.Explore more on these topicsReligionChildrenHome schoolingCheshireSwedenIslamEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dozens of them were still planning to vote against the government, and one of Keir Starmer’s major economic policies hung in the balance.The prime minister agreed to Rayner’s proposal to make the biggest concession available to the government without withdrawing the bill altogether.The planned cuts to personal independence payments (Pips) would be shelved, Starmer agreed, and any future changes to the system would be implemented only after a review by the welfare minister Stephen Timms, in conjunction with disability groups.Welfare bill passes after Keir Starmer offers late concessionRead moreThe prime minister relayed his message to a handful of potential Labour rebels, and directly to the Commons chamber, where MPs had been debating the measures for more than three hours. In huddled conversations on the frontbench, the U-turn was communicated to the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, and then hastilyannounced by Timms.This capped the most tumultuous 24 hours of Keir Starmer’s premiership: one that has underlined how badly damaged the prime minister has been by his first year in power and which could define the rest of his time in Downing Street.Ministers began the week in bullish mood. TheU-turns announced on Friday– including limiting the Pip changes to new claimants only – appeared to have won the support of leading rebels including Meg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury select committee.Kendall went to the Commons to outline the concessions to MPs. But despite her confident tone, some MPs felt she had tripped on some of the finer details and even contradicted herself at times.Rebels had been particularly upset by one important clarification Kendall offered: the Timms review would not be ready in time to forestall the new four-point system. That system would be imposed as planned in November 2026, with any changes recommended by Timms coming into force at a later stage.View image in fullscreenStephen Timms next to Liz Kendall in the Commons. Timms announced the U-turn in the chamber, where MPs had been debating the bill more for than three hours.Photograph: Parliament TV“We were already worried about a two-tier system,” said one waveringLabourMP. “Now the government was telling us it was going to be a three-tier system.”What made it worse was the unexpected publication of a new impact assessment, showing that even after the government’s changes the bill would push 150,000 people into relative poverty.Whips spent much of Monday calling prospective rebels, focusing particularly on those first elected in 2024 whom they deemed most likely to change their minds.The tactics showed some signs of success, but also created anger among many longer-serving Labour backbenchers.“They’re focusing only on the 2024 intake,” said one person who signed Hillier’s amendment. “They seem to have forgotten the rest of us exist.”Complaints about the behaviour of Labour whips have plagued the bill throughout the negotiations and became louder over Monday and Tuesday.“Once they thought they had it in the bag, we never heard again from a single minister,” one MP said.Downbeat Liz Kendall acts as if even she no longer believes in welfare reforms | John CraceRead moreAnother added: “It has been student politics throughout. They were laughing that the rebels didn’t have the numbers, then got angry when they realised they did and started threatening deselection instead.”By Monday evening it wasclear the government was still in trouble. A new wrecking amendment was published by the Labour MP Rachael Maskell, complete with the signatures of 39 MPs.Many Labour MPs did not want to join forces with Maskell, whom they considered an imperfect leader of the rebellion.“Rachael called me to ask me to sign the amendment and I asked her what the political strategy was after laying it,” said one. “She didn’t seem to have one.”Another added that Maskell had alienated some moderates by ostentatiously sitting next to Jeremy Corbyn during Monday’s heated Commons debate. “We fought Corbyn for five years,” said the MP. “And there she is cosying up to him. It was not a great look for someone looking to win over colleagues to her cause.”These concerns did not change the fact that many MPs were still planning to rebel – many more than the 39 who signed Maskell’s amendment.Ministers knew this, and at one point on Monday evening Kendall came close to making further U-turns on the timing of the Timms review and a promise to address the potential “three-tier” system.Late on Monday that offer was hastily withdrawn amid disagreement between Kendall’s department and No 10 on how to respond. The Treasury insisted they could not release any more money.At one point negotiations over the concessions became so fraught that when one rebel MP asked if the government could include lifting the two-child benefit limit, a furious aide told them: “You’ve just spent the money for that!”Tuesday began with the prime minister on the front foot.Starmer opened his weekly cabinet meeting with a warning shot to those who had been anonymously blaming his advisers for the chaos surrounding the welfare bill.The briefing wars must stop, he said, giving a full-throated defence of his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. He said without his master strategist “none of us would be sitting around this cabinet table”.For most of the rest of the day, ministers continued to defend their plans. Having agreed concessions with Labour rebels days earlier, the government was determined to stay the course.Opening the debate on Tuesday afternoon, Kendall reinforced this message, with no sign of the concession to come. “This bill and our wider welfare reforms seek to fix the broken benefits system that we inherited from the Conservatives and deliver a better life for millions of people across our country,” she told the Commons.The truth was, however, that ministers were still unsure even at this late stage whether they could get the bill through the Commons.As they huddled in corners of the parliamentary estate on Tuesday morning, Labour MPs admitted to each other that they were still uncertain how to vote.“What are you going to do?” asked one. Their colleague replied: “I don’t know, I’ll probably make my mind up during the debate.”Sitting at tables in the atrium of Portcullis House, a number of worried new MPs were war-gaming what would happen if the government were to lose. Several asked journalists if they knew what it would mean.“It would unleash something a lot of colleagues don’t intend to,” one supportive MP said. “I think only this morning was the time they are really grappling with that. I think it’s the PM’s only hope to be honest. Do you really want to completely destroy this government’s authority?”Several MPs said they were thinking of rebelling even though they had not signed Maskell’s amendment. “I didn’t want the whips pestering me all night,” one said.Even those loyal to Starmer admit the lead-up to the vote had been badly handled, but said that in the final reckoning many MPs had decided the consequences of rebelling would be too severe.“People have started to think about what the alternative is,” one Labour MP said. “The alternative is maybe not to bring down the government, but it would get pretty close.”Meanwhile, Rayner, who led the negotiations for the government throughout last week, was engaged in shuttle diplomacy, crossing the floor of Portcullis House on multiple occasions as she carried messages between rebels and the whips’ office.The final message was clear: Labour was heading for a possible defeat on one of its most important economic policies. Ministers could gut the bill, withdraw it, or lose.Timms’ dramatic announcement on Tuesday evening may have staved off the threat of a ministerial resignation but it leaves Starmer badly damaged and his chancellor having to find nearly £5bn of extra cuts in the budget this year.MPs are particularly irritated that the issue of welfare cuts has tripped up another Labour leader, as it did with Tony Blair, Ed Miliband and Harriet Harman.Many potential rebels cited the experience in 2015 when Harman as interim leader whipped her MPs to abstain on government benefits cuts, a decision which helped propel Jeremy Corbyn to office in the subsequent leadership election.“Many of us were thinking of abstaining at second reading and then using the extra time to push for more concessions,” said one MP. “But the problem is this was the tactic Harriet used in 2015, and that backfired badly.”Conservatives were gleeful. “While we’ve been here debating it, the bill has more or less disintegrated,” said Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary. “Describing this as chaos now feels like an understatement.”Many Labour MPs agreed. “I’m absolutely amazed at what’s happened even this afternoon,” Ian Lavery told the Commons during Tuesday’s debate. “This is crazy. This is outrageous.”As they reflect on a bruising 48 hours, some government officials are contrite. “It is clear we failed to take people with us,” said one Downing Street aide.Others were more defiant. “It’s the Brexiteers all over again,” said one government official, likening the Labour rebels to the Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs who caused such problems for a succession of Tory MPs. “They don’t know when to take yes for an answer.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsDisabilityLabourKeir StarmerLiz KendallnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the wooden slatted roof, seated at plastic chairs and tables, were dozens of Palestinians seeking respite from the relentless 20-month war that has devastated much of the bustling, vibrant town.On one side was the Mediterranean, blue and calm to the horizon. On the other, battered apartment blocks, wrecked hotels and the close-packed tents of displaced families.Witnesses describe grim aftermath of Israeli strike on busy Gaza cafeRead moreFounded almost 40 years ago, the family-run al-Baqa was for many in Gaza City a reminder of better, more peaceful times. It had long been a place to escape the claustrophobic strictures of life in the crowded territory, to talk freely, laugh and dream.Among those sipping coffee, tea and soft drinks in the cafe was a young artist – Amna al-Salmi – and her friend Ismail Abu Hatab, a 32-year-old photographer and film-maker. Others included another journalist and at least one family with young children, including a four-year-old child, and a mother and her two daughters.Then, at about 3pm, the peaceful scene at the al-Baqa cafe was transformed.Witnesses described a huge roaring explosion, flames, aplume of ash-grey smokerising fast into the air. No one needed to ask what had happened.In recent days, theIsraelDefense Forces (IDF) has escalated its offensive across all of Gaza but focused much of its firepower on the territory’s north, where Hamas remain relatively entrenched despite multiple military assaults.Tanks have advanced into neighbourhoods to the east of Gaza City, so-called “evacuation orders” have forced thousands from makeshift shelters and airstrikes have killed dozens.When the dust and smoke cleared at the al-Baqa cafe, scenes of carnage were revealed.View image in fullscreenPeople and emergency services gathered at the scene at al-Baqa cafe.Photograph: Seham Tantesh/The Guardian“I stepped outside briefly to get something to eat, and when I returned – just as I was close – a missile struck,” said Abu al-Nour, 60.“Shrapnel flew everywhere, and the place filled with smoke and the smell of cordite. I couldn’t see anything. I ran toward the cafe and found it destroyed. I went inside and saw bodies lying on the ground. All the cafe workers were killed.”Adam, 21, was working nearby, renting out chairs and tables on the small promenade.“When I reached the site, the scenes were beyond anything imaginable. I knew all the workers at the place. It was full of customers of all ages,” he told the Guardian.Other witnesses described seeing a dead child, an elderly man with both legs severed and many others with serious injuries.Israel launches waves of Gaza airstrikes after new displacement ordersRead moreAll said they had been surprised by the extent of the damage, which wrecked the entire cafe, warping concrete columns and scattering debris. A deck of cards and a giant stuffed toy animal could be seen amid the wreckage.Even hours later, the air “smelled of blood”, one witness said.Many expressed surprise that the cafe could be targeted at all. A 55-year-old sports teacher who lives nearby described the cafe as the “nicest in Gaza” and a place that “should have been the safest of anywhere” in the Palestinian territory.An IDF spokesperson said the attack was under review, adding that the Israeli military had “struck several Hamas terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip” and that “prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians using aerial surveillance”.In a separate statement on Tuesday, the IDF said Israel’s air force had attacked more than 140“terror targets”in Gaza over the previous day, including “terrorists, anti-tank missile launch posts, weapons storage facilities and other terrorist infrastructure”.Medical and other officials said that between 24 and 36 Palestinians were killed in the attack on the cafe, with dozens more injured.1:17Israeli airstrike on popular Gaza beachside cafe leaves at least 30 dead – video reportAmong the dead was 35-year-old Nour al-Huda al-Husari, who had gone with her two daughters “to get some fresh air and try to lift their spirits”.“When I heard there had been a strike, I tried to call … I kept calling, but there was no answer,” said Mohammed al-Husari, her husband.“Then about an hour and a half after the strike I heard she had been killed. My first thought was: what happened to my daughters? I felt like I was dreaming … I couldn’t believe it.”The couple’s eight-year-old had been hurled many metres by the blast but was found standing stunned and alone, completely unharmed. But her older sister, aged 12, was badly hurt, suffering a skull fracture and internal bleeding, and could die.“The hospital was completely full of the wounded and the dead – because the cafe was crowded with women, children and the young. It was not a suspicious or military place,” Husari said.“If it had been, my wife would never have gone … she was always careful not to go anywhere risky or questionable, out of fear that something might happen nearby. The truth is there is no safe place in Gaza.”Fatalities included Salmi, the artist, who was involved ininitiativesto bring art by Palestinians in Gaza to a wider international audience and to support the most needy among the displaced in the territory.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian man checks an area near the cafe that was damaged.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APAbu Hatebwas also killed. The film-maker was badly injured early in the war and in an interview last year described how his work “haunted” him, bringing insomnia and depression.“I have seen many martyrs, their meals still in front of them, unable to finish eating because they were killed. I think about that moment they must have felt just before death,” he said.In addition to casualties from airstrikes, hundreds have died in recent weeks while seeking aid.Those with savings or salaries can buy enough to survive on in local markets and even pay for drinks or a snack at venues where they can also use reliable wifi. The vast majority of the 2.3 million population suffer acutely,with growing malnutritionand a continuing threat of famine.The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas militants into Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250, of whom 50 are still held by the militant Islamist organisation.The ensuing Israeli offensive has so far killed 56,500, mostly civilians, and reduced much of the Palestinian territory to ruins.Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If someone was previously a permanent resident, for example, they will be classified as such again, which can open the door to deportation efforts.The memo, published on 11 June, instructed the justice department’s civil division to “prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence”. Immigration matters are civil matters, meaning that immigrants – whether they are naturalized citizens or not – do not have the right to an attorney in such cases.Muzaffar Chishti from the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan thinktank, explained that much of immigration law was based on discretion by government officials. To revoke a person’s citizenship, US officials must demonstrate that they are not of “good moral character” – a subjective and broad term with little defined parameters.Now, the recent memo lists a broad range of categories of people who should be stripped of their naturalized citizenship status, providing further guidance as to who is not of good “moral character”. This included “those with a nexus to terrorism” and espionage, war criminals and those who were found to have lied in their naturalization process. Officials still need to prove their case, Chisthi explained.“[The administration] can’t, on their own, denaturalize people, they still have to go to a federal district court,” said Chisthi. “Denaturalization finally does belong to federal district courts – but they are obviously keen on finding every way they can to denaturalize people they think did not deserve to be naturalized.”However, the justice department’s memo is not solely confined to those expanded categories. It gives more discretion to officials to pursue these cases, prompting a fear for analysts and attorneys that the directive by theTrump administrationis overly broad.For Jorge Loweree, director of policy for the American Immigration Council, a new category in the memo stood out to him: individuals accused of being gang and cartel members.Loweree is concerned “because of the way that the administration has treated people that it deems to be gang members”, he said. “ It wasn’t that long ago that the administration flew hundreds of people from the US to a prison in El Salvador on, in most instances, flimsy evidence.”Although the memo marks an escalation by the Trump administration it is not entirely news, and in recent decades, other nations have also engaged in seeking to strip citizenship from certain people.Denaturalization in the US has a long history. Throughout the 20th century, those seen by the US government as potential enemies to US interests were stripped of their citizenship. Journalists, activists and labor leaders, accused of being anarchists and communists, were frequently targeted.Politically driven denaturalization fell off in the late 1960s, when the US supreme court ruled that denaturalization could only take place if someone was found to have committed fraud or “willful misrepresentation”, as USA Todayexplainedearlier this year, leading to a lull in denaturalization cases. Denaturalization categories were narrowed, with cases focusing mostly on former war criminals, such as Nazis, who had lied in their documents to gain status in the US.In recent decades, starting under the Obama administration, the US government escalated its denaturalization efforts. Matthew Hoppock, an immigration attorney based in Kansas who follows and analyzes immigration policies closely, said that the Obama-era enforcement efforts were limited to specific cases. The operation, called Operation Janus, began reviewing fingerprint cards to determine whether naturalized citizens had lied during their citizenship process.Through 2017, Hoppock, who accessed denaturalization data, found “it’s about 10 to 15 cases a year that they bring nationwide,” adding that “those were typically human rights abusers, Nazi guards, and cases like that.”The first Trump administration marked a significant uptick in denaturalization efforts. The Department of Homeland Security at the timestood on the shoulders of the Obama-era operation, supercharging it to strip citizenship from people accused of cheating in the process of applying for citizenship as a foreign-born individual. The administration’s goal at the time was to examine 700,000 files but, as Hoppock states, due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of the cases, the administration barely made a dent.But as Chisthi further explains, much about the first Trump administration’s anti-immigration agenda was only a “dress rehearsal” for policies being pursued this year. Now, under the second Trump administration, denaturalizing people has risen up the priority list.Meanwhile, the terrorist attacks on the US on September 11, 2001 radically changed how many countries dealt with national security efforts and other countries also began to explore the denaturalization of certain people.According to research from the analysis organization Global Citizenship Observatory, or Globalcit, based in Italy, and the Institute of Statelessness and Inclusion (ISI), based in the Netherlands, between 2000 and 2020, citizenship revocation expanded dramatically in some countries, especially in Europe, and especially for minority groups. During this period, 18 countries in Europe,researchers found, expanded their denaturalization powers in the name of national security and counter-terrorism.Areport from the European University Institute’s Global Citizenship Observatory, published this year, highlighted certain countries with broad and ambiguous denaturalization laws. In Bulgaria, for example, a person’s citizenship could be stripped for “serious crimes against the country.” And in Vietnam, acts that “harm the country’s prestige” are also grounds for revocation.There have been recent shifts in certain countries, related to denaturalization cases. In Latvia, citizenship can be revoked if the person serves in the security or armed forces of another country. However, in 2022, amid the war caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an exception was introduced to allow Latvians to fight for Ukraine.Just this year, the report says, the Swedish government recommended a constitutional shift that could revoke a person’s citizenship due to “threatening national security”. In Germany, some political parties discussed the push to revoke citizenship for “supporters of terrorism, antisemites, and extremists”. And Hungary introduced a constitutional amendment to allow the temporary suspension of citizenship on “security grounds”.As the European University Institute’s report highlighted, last year, Kuwait introduced amendments that would revoke citizenship of people who were involved in fraudulent conduct, crimes involving “moral turpitude” or where the state’s interests are deemed at risk. more than 42,000 people reportedly lost their citizenship, the report says.“We’ve seen dictators use the taking-away-of-citizenship as a way to control a population or bend people to their will,” Hoppock said. “I don’t know if the Trump administration is going to use it this way. This memo is pretty milquetoast – it just says we don’t really have any priorities any more.”But, Hoppock added, the new memo is a huge departure from past efforts. “Unfortunately it could be abused by a system that likes to go after its adversaries,” he said.All experts told the Guardian that resources will be a major factor in the Trump administration’s push to revoke some people’s citizenship. Already, the federal government’s resources are stretched thin, for a variety of reasons.“The most important thing is: how much resources is the administration going to put into it, to target prosecutions?” Chisthi asks. “And that will determine whether this will mostly be an exercise in getting a lot of people anxious or actually producing outcomes of denaturalizations.”Loweree is wary.“Resource constraints would be a significant limiting factor in this type of thing,” he said. “But we have seen the administration do anything and everything it can to pursue its immigration agenda, in all instances,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

The RSC’s production serves its own tennis-court lust, flagrant philandering, poisonous gossip and fabulous fashion.In Maugham’s play, 36-year-old Constance responds to her surgeon-husband John’s affair with her best friend, Marie-Louise, by gaining economic independence through her new career as an interior decorator. Wade retains the 1920s Harley Street setting, trims the list of characters and gives space to Constance’s maternal concerns. She also seamlessly integrates some extremely funny one-liners alongside Maugham’s while gaining extra gags from riffing on his dated expressions such as “you’re a brick”. The play remains the same drawing-room comedy but plumped up, stylishly rearranged and with a fresh coat of paint (we’ll get to Anna Fleischle and Cat Fuller’s sumptuous designs later).One of Wade’s principal changes is to explode the play’s straightforward chronology of three acts separated by the passing of a fortnight and a year respectively. She brings forward the moment in which Marie-Louise’s husband Mortimer bursts in to expose her affair and, in a lengthy flashback, adds a new scene to show Constance catching them in the act when she returns from dropping off their daughter at a Yorkshire boarding school brilliantly referred to as “Wuthering Gymslips”. Witnessing that discovery, and her mutual confidences with the butler Bentley (given a deepened character), heightens empathy for Constance who was rather more crisply calculated as written by Maugham.In the lead role, Game of Thrones’Rose Leslie– back on stage after a nine-year absence – arrives like a summer breeze in cool blue sailor chic. Leslie captures what Maugham called Constance’s “alert mind” and succeeds in the tricky balance of composed resolve with rawer emotion.Despite the innuendo, some choice double-takes and the frantic cover-ups, Tamara Harvey’s poised and perfectly cast production finds more humour in a raised eyebrow or pursed lip than anything farcical. The more larkily handled scene changes, with swerving fireplace and slo-mo cast moves, have not yet quite gelled with the rest of the evening. Jamie Cullum’s original jazz compositions, alternately bristling and velvety, complement both mood and milieu while bringing their own comic notes accentuated by Ryan Day’s perky lighting design.Fleischle’s set, with its elegant curves, screens and geometric patterns, is adorned with a chaise longue and painted in shades that evoke Fortnum & Mason’s lavish confectionery. Fleischle and Fuller’s costumes heighten the imperiousness of Constance’s mother (Kate Burton) as much as the shrewdness of her sister, Martha (Amy Morgan, in a role gaining elements of the excised character Barbara).View image in fullscreenBrilliant … Emma McDonald’s Marie-Louise in The Constant Wife at the Swan theatre.Photograph: Johan PerssonWade astutely reckons with the double standards and hypocrisies at play and frankly considers the financial and emotional investments of marriage and the ways in which marital harmony is sustained after the first flush of romance. While the play’s take on generational shifts in feminism recalls Wade’sHome, I’m Darling– and these 1920s debates feel apt today – there is also a meta playfulness, never overdone, akin to her comedyThe Watsons.Some choice observations about theatre match a clever self-awareness in the staging. In one scene, Constance recognises the audience as another set of neighbours waiting to judge her reaction as “the wronged woman”. When Martha tells her sister that her next move could become a blueprint for others it is almost as if she is speaking to Ibsen’s Nora.Somerset Maugham: a wily playwright of light dramas and weighty moralsRead moreEmma McDonaldis ridiculously good as the calculating Marie-Louise, grovelling towards Constance on her knees for forgiveness, even if as in Maugham’s play you never believe their friendship in the first place. John (Luke Norris), Mortimer (Daniel Millar) and Constance’s puppyishly devoted Bernard (Raj Bajaj) remain more purely comical as in the original but Mark Meadows’ devotion as Bentley cuts deeper.It’s a roundly well-acted and sophisticated evening that offers plenty of light delight while seriously considering a marriage rerouted not by a seven-year itch but a 15-year switch.At theSwan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 2 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreLaura WadeComedyRoyal Shakespeare CompanySomerset MaughamJamie CullumreviewsShareReuse this content"

In one scene, she wanders off stage and on to an outward-facing balcony to sing a magnetic reprise of Don’t Cry for Me Argentina to the gathered crowd outside the theatre.What are these grumps complaining about? Not long ago, Lloyd stagedRomeo and Julietin the West End, but here is a balcony scene like no other. It makes for a sensational moment, when Perón triumphantly addresses the crowd on her husband Juan’s election victory. It is 360-degree theatre, for the rich inside (who see it on a video feed) and for the “hoi polloi” outside – very fitting for Perón given her disdain for the wealthy.‘My heart is pounding’: experiencing Rachel Zegler’s Evita balcony scene from the humble pavementRead moreIt is no less than the director’s biggest coup de theatre: the public itself is enlisted for his mise en scene of populist rallies, crowd hypnotism and authoritarian charm. The crowd might represent late 1940s Buenos Aires – or mid 2020s America under the spell of becoming “great again”. Never mind complaints of a free show – maybe Lloyd should be paying them.Lloydpreviously staged this Andrew Lloyd Webber musical(with lyrics by Tim Rice) at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre in 2019. Then, it seemed like a dark high school musical, with stairs like bleachers and actors resembling flinty-eyed teens. This iteration has a streak of that but is bolder, more polished and pumped up.View image in fullscreenCrowd hypnotism … the balcony scene, with Zegler on video screen and James Olivas as Juan Perón.Photograph: Marc BrennerZegler, in herWest Enddebut, is phenomenal. Stripped to undergarments, she is an indifferently exposed Perón, conniving, deliciously villainous, pocket-sized yet steely in the extreme: a consummate ice queen. She strides with hands on hips, louche in her unstoppable ambition.There is comedy in her relationship with singer Agustín Magaldi (Aaron Lee Lambert, who sings On This Night of a Thousand Stars in a brilliant, barrel-like baritone), whom she swiftly, slickly disposes of once she has met Juan Perón (James Olivas). The new couple are well suited, their chemistry apparent in the duet I’d Be Surprisingly Good for You.If a successful musical is simply about the singing, dancing and spectacle, this one soars. The choreography by Fabian Aloise, who has previously worked on three other Lloyd shows, is out-of-this-world imaginative. The ensemble mesmerise with their sexual energy and charismatic aggression. A sinister military figure body-pops and balloons burst every time a gun is fired and detractors are popped off, one by one.These moves, this mood and this conspicuous melodrama would not look out of place in a Lady Gaga or Beyoncé stadium show. Nor would Jon Clark’s lighting design and Adam Fisher’s sound design: they are thunderous and pulsating.View image in fullscreenThe pulsating sound and light designs would not be out of place at a stadium rock show.Photograph: Marc BrennerIt’s hypnotic but the narrative takes a backseat for this rock musical, which is almost entirely sung through, with what feels like thin connective tissue in its story. You see Perónism slipping into authoritarianism but don’t quite understand how. In Lloyd’s previous staging, the character of Che (Diego Andres Rodriguez, also the singing narrator) wore a Che Guevara T-shirt to let the audience know who he was. Now he is in black, and for those who are new to this story he might remain anonymous.There is an approximation to the characters as a whole, with very little focus on Perón’s interiority. Maybe that is not the point, but how then can the audience feel the tragedy of her untimely death – which takes up so much time in the second half of the musical – if they cannot connect with it emotionally?Everybody’s talking about Jamie Lloyd: the explosive rise of superstar director masterminding EvitaRead moreThe tone changes after the balcony scene, moving from blingy and bombastic to a quieter, more mournful register. For the first time you glimpse Perón’s private emotion, after her great public display, as she sits in her dressing room in tears. It is an illuminating moment but this glimmer is not carried through into something more affecting. So the end bears a vacancy once the spectacle has abated – as if the real show finished some time ago. Don’t Cry for Me Argentina, she sings, and you find yourself dry-eyed, although Zegler is a vocal powerhouse, as are the other performers.If you feel denied of the subtleties of story, character and commentary on populist power, you will still have an eye-popping night out. And the balcony scene is a stroke of genius.AtLondon Palladiumuntil 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicalsWest EndTheatreJamie LloydAndrew Lloyd WebberTim RicereviewsShareReuse this content"

As Mountainhead takes him into new territory, he talks about his nuanced view of the world’s richest man – and why a bonnet drama may be nextTue 1 Jul 2025 11.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 16.54 EDTShareWhen he gets to his London office on the morning this piece is published,Jesse Armstrongwill read it in print, or not at all. Though the building has wifi, he doesn’t use it. “If you’re a procrastinator, which most writers are, it’s just a killer.” Online rabbit holes swallow whole days. “In the end, it’s better to be left with the inadequacies of your thoughts.” He gives himself a mock pep talk. “‘It’s just you and me now, brain.’”Today, the showrunner of Succession and co-creator of Peep Show is back at home, in walking distance of his workspace. He could be any London dad: 54, salt-and-pepper beard, summer striped T-shirt. But staying offline could feel like a statement too, given Armstrong is also the writer-director ofMountainhead, a film about tech bros. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Open AI’s Sam Altman, guru financiers Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen: all these and more are mixed up in the movie’s characters, sharing a comic hang in a ski mansion. Outside, an AI launched by one of the group has sparked global chaos. Inside, there is snippy friction about the intra-billionaire pecking order.It must be delightful to really believe it’s all going to be fine, that AI’s going to cure cancerMountainhead feels like a pulled-back curtain. But Armstrong also resisted another rabbit hole: spending time in Silicon Valley for research. He tried that kind of thing before. Contrary to rumour,Successionnever did involve backdoor chats with the children of Rupert Murdoch. Once the show became a phenomenon, though, he did meet with masters of finance and corporate media, picking their brains for insights at luxe New York restaurants. “And they’d be charismatic, and namedrop the 20 most famous people in the world, and I’d feel this buzz of excitement by association. Then later I’d look at my notes, and what they’d actually said read like complete inane bullshit. ‘Make the move!’ ‘Be the balls!’”View image in fullscreenSki mansion schemers … from left, Cory Michael Smith, Steve Carell, Ramy Youssef and Jason Schwartzman in Mountainhead.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All Rights Reserved.So Armstrong returned to his office and, more generally, his kind. “I’m a writer,” he says, “and a writer type. And I’m happy with other writer types.” In America, when Succession exploded, you could sense an assumption the mind behind it must be an English Aaron Sorkin: a slick character as glamorous as the world he wrote about. Instead, here was the dry figure who compares making Mountainhead to an early job at budget supermarket Kwik Save. (Both, he says, boiled down to managing workload.)Rather than stalk Sam Altman, he read biographies and hoovered up podcasts. Amid the oligarchs’ tales of favourite Roman emperors, he kept finding a common thread: a wilful positivity about their own effect on the world. “And it must be delightful to really believe, ‘You know what? It’s going to befine. AI’s going to cure cancer, and don’t worry about burning up the planet powering the AI to do it, because we’ll just fix that too.’”Part of the trick, he says, is perspective. At a certain level, money and power give life the feel of an eternal view from a private plane. “Whereas reality is standing in the road, dodging cars, thinking ‘Oh God! This is fucking terrifying!’”Success and Succession have not made Armstrong an optimist. But they did give him the professional heft to direct Mountainhead as well as write it, and to do so at unprecedented pace. Film and TV move achingly slowly; it was last November that he decided he wanted to make a movie about the junction of AI, crypto and libertarian politics. By May, he was preparing for it to come out.He says now he wanted Mountainhead to be “a bobsleigh run. Short, and slightly bitter, and once you’re on, you’re on.” His voice quickens recalling a first meeting with Steve Carell, who he wanted to play Randall, “the group’s dark money Gandalf”. This was January. Without a script, Armstrong could only tell the actor the story he’d loosely planned. Carell sat in silence. “I thought, ‘Well, this has gone very badly.’” Then he said yes. “At which point it was like, ‘Fuck. This is actually going to happen. Now I have to write it.’”View image in fullscreenCocooned world … Succession.Photograph: Home Box Office/Graeme HunterBy March, the film was being shot in a 21,000 sq ft mansion in Deer Valley, Utah, then on the market for $65m. Carell aside, the cast included Cory Michael Smith, Ramy Youssef and Jason Schwartzman. For Armstrong, directing his first feature on a berserk turnaround was made easier by a deep fondness for actors. Standing in front of a camera, he says, paralyses him with self-consciousness. “So I honestly find what they do magical.”His own lack of talent as a performer proved important to the younger Armstrong. Between 1995 and 1997, he worked as an assistant to Labour MP Doug Henderson. It was an interesting time to have the job, with Tony Blair about to enter Downing Street. Is there a Sliding Doors world where a rising star assistant becomes an MP himself? One where, by now, Jesse Armstrong is home secretary?He shakes his head for several seconds. “I just wasn’t good at the job. Fundamentally, I didn’t understand politics.” He knows it sounds odd, having later written for insidery Westminster comedy The Thick of It. “But I couldn’t do the acting. I didn’t get it. I always thought like a writer, so in meetings where I should have been building my career, I’d just be thinking, ‘That’sweird.That’sfunny. Why did you saythat?’” (Armstrong once wrote for the Guardianabout a meeting with then Conservative minister Ann Widdecombe, in which she sat under two posters: one a lurid anti-abortion message, the other Garfield.)You can see Super Hans arriving at Mountainhead on a scooter, delivering the ketamineInstead, he segued into comedy, and soon after Peep Show, the beloved squirm of a sitcom co-written with Sam Bain. At first glance, Succession is the obvious prequel to Mountainhead, a former newspaper empire giving way to tech superpower. But Armstrong sees a closer link between his new film and Peep Show: “Because it’s about men, and male hierarchies, and the pathos of men trying to connect.”He is tickled by the thought of his own story world, in which characters from different projects collide. “You can see Super Hans arriving at Mountainhead on a scooter, delivering the ketamine.” Then he pauses, suddenly anxious. Could he make sure I’ll mention Bain if I talk about Peep Show? “Because it was always Sam’s show as well.” And Hans owed so much to actor Matt King too, he says, “and then, of course, there’s David Mitchell and Robert Webb.”Mountainhead review – tech bros face off in Jesse Armstrong’s post-Succession uber-wealth satireRead moreShould Armstrong ever make an Oscar acceptance speech, we will be there a while. Making sure due credit is given is of a piece with his near-pathological modesty. (He is a keen footballer. Which position? “Terrible.”) Being fair-minded matters too. He adds a postscript to his memory of leaving Westminster. “I’d also say I don’t in any way feel superior to people who do make a career in politics. I still believe we need good, professional politicians.”Turning back to Mountainhead, his even-handedness reaches a kind of event horizon. Armstrong, it transpires, feels sorry for Elon Musk. “Musk has done huge damage in the world, particularly with Doge, but I have a lot of sympathy for him.”The owner of X was brutally bullied as a schoolboy and according to a 2023 biography, had a difficult relationship with his father. “This is a traumatised human being,” says Armstrong. Still, not every bullied child ends up making apparent Nazi salutes onstage. “Yeah. That wasn’t great.”View image in fullscreenIvory tower … with Steve Carell on the Mountainhead shoot.Photograph: Macall Polay/PRBut there are other sides to Armstrong. For all the hints of bumble and awkwardness, he has also had the discipline to build a stellar career. And the more measured he is in person, the more Mountainhead feels like the work of a grinning Id, rising up to take a scalpel to his subjects, with their pretensions to philosophy, and dark indifference to life. (“I’m so excited about these atrocities,” a character beams as the world goes violently awry.) But his sympathy has its limits. “I do think the cocoon they’re in makes it hard for them to remember other people are actually real. But they’ve also been quick to give up trying. And some definitely feel the superior person shouldn’t have to try anyway.”More to the point, though, Armstrong finds the tech moguls funny. Much of the grimness of a Musk or Thiel is also brilliantly ridiculous: the epic lack of self-knowledge, the thinness of skin. Having studied them as he has, would he expect his real-life models to be enraged by the film?“Oh no. They’d instantly dismantle it in a way that would be 50% completely fair, and 50% totally facile. But they wouldn’t see any truth to it.”Still, Mountainhead is something very rare: a movie that feels as contemporary as TikTok. For Armstrong, after Succession and now this, you might think stories about the moment had become addictive. He frowns. Is a period piece next, in fact? Victorian bonnets? “Maybe. Genuinely maybe. Because I’m not actually that drawn to ripped-from-the-headlines ideas.” The frown deepens. “Am I not? I don’t know. I’m losing faith in my own answer, because I evidently am. I mean, I’m not going to claim I don’t like writing about right now. But honestly, at the same time – I’d be pleased to get out of it.”Mountainhead is available to own digitally nowExplore more on these topicsMountainheadJesse ArmstrongSuccessionTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

It sounds almost nothing like the original – what would Cilla Black think?Stuart HeritageTue 1 Jul 2025 06.55 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 07.30 EDTShareGood news: Blind Date is returning to our screens. Weird news: it won’t be on television, you probably won’t watch it and it may not technically count as Blind Date. But let’s concentrate on the good news first.On Monday, Disney+ announced three new unscripted TV shows. One is a sort of Made in Chelsea spin-off about parenthood, another sounds like The Kardashians except it has Wayne and Coleen Rooney in it, and the third is the return of Blind Date, which Disney calls the “ultimate dating series”.No host or release date has been revealed yet, but that doesn’t matter. It’s Blind Date, for crying out loud. Everyone knows Blind Date. A person has to pick the most desirable option from a panel of three strangers who are hidden from view. Once they have matched, they go on holiday and then report back. And that’s it, over and over again.If that seems slightly staid, that’s because it is. Even in its day, there was something uncomfortably robotic about Blind Date. The dates were chosen through a stilted exchange of scripted lines, and the contestants themselves were so relentlessly chaste you might as well have been watching footage of toddlers visiting a zoo. It was a classic of the terrestrial-era form: “Was it good or was it the only thing on?”View image in fullscreenBlind Date 1999 … Cilla introduces ‘the girls’, Sally, Sabrina and Rachel.Photograph: ITV/Rex ShutterstockIt is also a good example of the changing television landscape. In its prime, when it was presented by the now late Cilla Black, Blind Date was watched by 18.2 million viewers. When that run ended in 2003, the figure had plummeted to 5 million. That was still 3 million more than the number who tuned in for the 2017 revival on Channel 5, hosted by Paul O’Grady. If the new Disney version gets even a quarter of that figure, it will probably be deemed a success.More pressingly, we now live in a firmly post-Blind Date world. In the years since Cilla ruled the airwaves, the dating show spectrum has burst into a dazzling kaleidoscope. Simply having a brief verbal exchange with some strangers, then spending a long weekend in Benidorm will no longer cut it. In the last 15 years alone, we have had karaoke-based dating shows (Sing Date), sensorily deprived dating shows (Dating in the Dark), neurodiverse dating shows (Love on the Spectrum), dating shows for exhibitionists (Naked Attraction) and dating shows for people who wish that the human-trafficking scene from Taken was a fully immersive entertainment experience (Take Me Out).This is only the tip of the iceberg. For decades, the format has adopted reality TV with The Bachelor, Love Island and countless others. There is even Married at First Sight, which seems less designed for singletons than for all their judgmentally dismissive friends.View image in fullscreenBlind Date 1997 … Kevin and Sarah with Cilla.Photograph: ITV/Rex ShutterstockIn this landscape, Blind Date looks woefully outdated. Perhaps this is why the new iteration is promising a fleet of changes. To quote the press release: “Our daters will see if for ever love can truly grow as they spend the summer living together, but potential new partners are always lurking behind the wall.” Which does sound like a comprehensive overhaul, dragging the show into the 21st century by lingering on the relationships rather than the very first interaction. It also – almost! – hints that the contestants might be sexually attracted to each other this time around, which will make a change from the Cilla era, which tended to vault from polite conversation straight to marriage.Strangers marrying on TV? I think it’s fair to say I’m hookedRead moreThen again, this new format has an air ofShip of Theseusabout it. What Disney seems to be making has so little in common with the original Blind Date that it doesn’t seem much like Blind Date at all. It sounds a bit like Frankenstein’s monster, with so many ungainly new elements bolted on that it is destined to rise up one day and murder its oppressors. It goes without saying that the new version may be exactly what the current television landscape requires – and that it could end up running as long as the original. But still, what would Cilla think?Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDatingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But I went out looking for a human connectionDylan B JonesTue 1 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 12.29 EDTShareIam lucky enough to have some wonderful friends. But recently many of them have moved away because they can’t afford, or simply can’t be bothered, to live in a huge city like London any more. And when you’re in your 30s, meaningfully connecting with new people is no mean feat.I’m not alone in feeling a little lonely: in 2023, the World Health Organization said that social isolation was becoming a“global public health concern”. From the decline of the office to the rise of single-occupancy flats, our social lives are being leached away from us. Meanwhile, streaming services and food-delivery apps discourageus from going out, their ads extolling the safety and convenience of staying home and not seeing or talking to another human. It’s almost as if they want to keep us single and friendless, with nothing to spend our money on but a disappointing chicken burger with a side ofDeadpool & Wolverine.It wasn’t always like this.Look at photosof city life in the 90s or 00s and you’ll see cafes and nightclubs and buses and trains thronging with life and conversation. People danced with each other and looked at each other and spoke to each other and touched and kissed each other – in public!I’ve been wondering if I could bring at least some of that fun back into my own life. Here’s what happened when I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried to make some new friends.Make an effort with strangersIf you go to a busy public place in the US – a bus, a restaurant, a bar, a sports event – it is an absolute cacophony. They talk to one another. Loudly, brashly and proudly, they talk. So I think: what better way to make social connections than to adopt Americans’ wonderful, fearless way of socialising? That means striking up conversation at any given opportunity, rather thanavoidingit, as many of us in the UK are prone to do. I try it out on everyone I meet, from neighbours and shopkeepers to hospitality workers and groups of strangers in cafes and pubs.The first person I get properly chatting to is a fellow resident of my little crescent. Let’s call him Graham. A doorman at one of London’s glossier hotels, he is as twinkly and kind as he is rough around the edges; if I were a casting director tasked with finding a quintessential London “old boy”, I would pick him immediately.The 10 rules of friendship: show up, go beyond banter, learn the boring detailsRead moreWe get chatting one day, while he is smoking on his doorstep, and when I tell him I am a writer, he says: “My parents once told me, and I’ll always remember this” – he pauses, taking a long drag on his rollie – “words are to the mind what exercise is to the body.” Wise words indeed. Even just that brief chat has opened a channel and we still exchange friendly small talk every time I see him.The rest of my interaction experiments don’t go so well. Lured into one of Gail’s bakeries by the strong wifi and flaky treats, I walk over to the baker, who is in the corner shovelling croissants in and out of ovens. He has caught my eye a couple of times, although it’s unclear whether in flirty interest or because he thinks I’m up to no good. I point upwards.“Are you guys responsible for this playlist?” (You Oughta Know by Alanis Morissette is playing.)“Yes.”“Ah, great, love it!”He smiles thinly, shovelling his croissants.“Wow, they’re quite intricate, aren’t they?” I say, leaning over the counter a bit. “Layered.”He smiles thinly again and nods a polite “goodbye”, which everyone knows means: “GO AWAY IMMEDIATELY, PLEASE.”Reconnect with an exWhen I was 15, I fell in love on a riverboat in Paris. I was on holiday from Devon with my parents; Marc was on holiday from Menlo Park, California. I ran over to him as the boat was pulling in to our stop and got his phone number, which he wrote on a crumpled bit of paper.We had a date the next day, on the steps of Sacré-Coeur, and dated long-distance for the next two years, with the help of Skype and two sets of remarkably open-minded parents. All of this sounds like a total lie. My friends at school certainly thought so, until, with great satisfaction at their dropped jaws, I introduced them all to my glossy-haired, gleaming-toothed, band-T-shirt-wearing, living, breathing American boyfriend when he came to visit one Christmas.We’re completely different people now and there is a comfortable, affectionate lack of romance. We were children when it started and we look back on it with the same loving, nonsexual 00s nostalgia as you might T4 on the Beach or the Goosebumps books. But we still click.He and his boyfriend are visiting London, so I ask if they want to go for a drink. Anyone who has a significant ex will know this is not as simple and casual as it sounds. It takes a bit of mental gymnastics. It takes a bit of guts. I’m not going to lie: I pick my outfit out very carefully, desperately trying to look like I’m not trying.View image in fullscreenDylan (left) and Marc, on a trip to Tuscany in 2007.Photograph: Courtesy of Dylan B JonesWe have fish and chips at the Hawley Arms, the pub Amy Winehouse used to frequent and pull pints in. I choose it shamelessly, knowing it’s just the right kind of touristy for cultured millennial Americans.I realise immediately that we have both grown up. We speak eruditely about our jobs, about the world and about politics. A change from the last time we had seen each other in person, when our main gripe had been about Megavideo no longer streaming our favourite TV show at the time, Weeds.The worst of our similarities have fallen away and the best remain. It feels a little like that epiphany you have, perhaps about 22 or 23 years old, when you realise you’re an adult. We are both grownups and it is a rewarding and powerful conversation.I can certainly see that reconnecting with an ex might not be for everyone – God knows, there are some exes that absolutely shouldnotbe reconnected with. But if you grew apart for reasons geographical and practical, it might be worth dropping them a message. After all, there was something that drew you to them in the first place. Maybe that thing is still there, in a much more casual, unromantic, but still meaningful way.Join a clubBook clubs aren’t for me, and neither are film clubs. I get enough (often unsolicited) opinions about what to read or watch from my friends and family and strangers on social media, thank you very much.In the end, I plunge for the only exercise I have ever enjoyed – water sports. I grew up in Devon on the banks of the River Dart; it’s one of the most lushly wending waterways in Europe. Locals are fond of saying that if you squint when the sun’s out, it could be the Amazon.Regent’s Canal could never be the Amazon, even if you were wearing a VR headset, but it isone of the capital’s most precious assets – paddling or strolling along it takes you past sites including a floating Chinese restaurant, world-class wall art, floating bookshops and, as you pass through the zoo, warthogs, colobus monkeys and African hunting dogs.View image in fullscreenDylan’s new kayaking friends … from left, Laura, Ruth and Alex.Photograph: Courtesy of Dylan B JonesRegents Canoe Clubcosts £90 for a year’s membership, meeting on Monday and Thursday nights to strike out on to the canal in kayaks and canoes. Equipment is provided and, once you are a member, there is no need to book ahead – you just show up. In this economy, in one of the most expensive cities in the world, that’s pretty good.I rock up to the induction evening wearing Ed Hardy jeans, a sparkly unicorn T-shirt and lots of jewellery and immediately feel like Cameron Diaz in heels dragging her suitcase down that snowy country lane inThe Holiday. The rest of the group are mostly affable, confident, outdoorsy women sporting sturdy shoes, thick leggings and chic haircuts.Ruth, a longtime member, shows me a video on her phone of her roiling over rapids on the Zambezi. “We didn’t worry about crocodiles,” she says breezily. “The big ones don’t come near the rapids, so it’s just the little ones.”“This is the most fun you can have while sitting down,” says Alex, after helping Ruth give us a comprehensive but entertaining health-and-safety induction. I open my mouth to make an off‑colour joke, then remembered I’m not in my usual company of easily amused gay men.As we clatter the kayaks out of their racks, I get a surge of serotonin, fuelled by nostalgia – the sounds and the smells evoking childhood – and a feeling of discovering the holy grail: a cheap, non-alcohol-focused, low-stress, low-effort social activity in London. Perhaps my unicorn T-shirt was appropriate after all.Solidify acquaintancesThere are always those ships in the night you met once or twice. Perhaps they are a friend of a friend, someone you encountered in passing at a party or a festival, a visiting colleague from another section of your company … you clicked, both thought: “We’re going to be the best of friends,” then never saw each other again.It’s time to pluck up the courage to contact them. Shrug off that fear of rejection, stop overthinking that cringe thing you may or may not have said, that they may or may not have misinterpreted, and just bloodymessage them.A wonderful advantage – arguably the only advantage – of social media is that this is now possible. In the 90s, you would just have never seen them again, but now, as long as you’ve got their first name and a vague notion of where they live or what they do for a job, the chances are you can track them down.View image in fullscreenFrom left … Dylan, Elliot and Amber.Photograph: Courtesy of Dylan B JonesI don’t even have to do this – I had exchanged details with Amber and Elliot in the short time we were together. It was when I was in Oxford for the weekend a few years ago. One night, thinking I didn’t go to gay bars by myself enough, I decided to check out the delightful Jolly Farmers, which describes itself as “Oxford’s oldest and oddest LGBTQ+ venue”. It certainly matched the description, with its heady melange of a few old timers almost literally propping up a slightly lopsided bar, bubbly cob walls and disco lights.Amber and Elliot were sitting in a corner playing Guess Who? and they beckoned me over so immediately and beamingly that at first I thought we already knew each other. They were wearing matching dangly earrings in the shape of poppers bottles and were about 5,000 times cooler than anyone in a 10-mile radius. Within minutes of meeting them, I would have died for them.Guess Who? quickly forgotten, we talked and talked about their experiences as queer Oxford students, pop music, my life in London and more. The next thing I knew, I was at a halls party drinking something aniseedy from a cracked plastic cup. We said our goodbyes under some strobe-lit brick arches at about 4am and stayed in touch, laugh-reacting to the odd shared meme.Now, about three years after we met, I see that Amber has moved to London. I message her asking if she would like to get together for a drink. Elliot is in town, too, and we all meet at an insultingly chic pub in Stoke Newington and reminisce about our mad night in Oxford. We also, just like everyone else in the crowded beer garden, lament our jobs and lambast life. Next, it’s time for a flat party, where I bring my boyfriend and we play what I’m fairly sure was Murder in the Dark (but can’t quite remember).It teaches me that you don’t necessarily need complicated tactics or new hobbies or psychological instruction to improve your social life. Sometimes, like Italian food, it’s best to keep it simple: quality ingredients and quick, easy techniques are all you need to craft that most elusive of dishes – a beautiful new friendship.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Anyone a bit more recent I mighthave heard of?Charli xcxis definitely cool, and her Glastonbury set at the weekend proved it.What about Sir Rod Stewart, also at Glasto. Is he cool?Hmmm, less so. He supports Reform for starters, and Reform definitely isn’t cool.Surely it’s subjective?Not entirely.Next you are going to tell me there’s astudy. Yes,a studyhas just been published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General.Catchy title.Anyway, go on.It surveyed nearly 6,000 people about their understanding of what cool is …But thatsurelydepends on where these people are.Maybe in Papua New Guinea, Rod Stewart is theepitome of cool.Papua New Guinea wasn’t part of the study, but data was collected from countries including the US, Chile, China, Germany, India, Nigeria and Turkey, and participants’ ideas about what “cool” is were similar, regardless of where they were.No Cool Britannia?No. But participants did have to recognise the word “cool” in English …Doesn’t that mean they were alreadyinfluenced byideas of what cool is from rich English-speakingcountries?Stop trying to discredit the study –that’s very uncool of you.What about differences in age, gender, educationand wealth?Again, not so important. Coolness means pretty much the same to everyone.And what does it meanto pretty much everyone?The researchers from three US universities identified six “cool” traits.Which are?Cool people tend to be extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open and autonomous.I’m definitely seeing Charlixcx. But maybe also a tiny bit of Sir Rodney, no?“I am sailing, I am sailing / Home again, ’cross the sea”. Need I say more?Stop! You’re right.And that was before any mention of Reform. Plus, he likes model trains.Not cool?Extroverted, hedonistic, adventurous … hmmm, don’t think so.Who cares about being cool anyway?Funny you ask:research suggestsit’s most important for adolescents to be seen to be cool. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to be cool when you get on a bit.Go on, then: name one cool personover 60.Easy, without even leaving Glastonbury. Extroverted, tick. Hedonistic, tick.

Perhaps we should build a special one for all the people we keep criminally investigating for saying, rather than doing, bad things. I’m pretty sure they have a few of those types of prisons in other countries. Although, it must be said that those are normally countries run by people we consider bad. Confusing! But look, maybe we’re becoming the sort of country where we imprison lots of people for saying awful things. I don’t …lovethis look for us, I have to say. But no doubt someone has thought it all through very, very carefully.If so, they could put the two nasty idiots from Bob Vylan in it. Obviously all of Kneecap, too. Maybe those guys would have their cell on the same landing as Lucy Connolly, thewoman who was imprisonedfor two years and seven months for a repulsive tweet in the wake of the Southport child killings. They could be joined by whoever at theBBC didn’t pull the Glastonbury live streamon Saturday after Bob Vylan started their repulsive chants, given that Conservative frontbencher Chris Philp is now officially calling for thecorporation to be “urgently” investigated. I see Chris is also calling for the BBC to be prosecuted – so I guess he’s already done the police investigation for them, and all at the same time as absolutely aceing his brief as shadow home secretary for where-are-they-now political outfit the Conservative party.In terms of Spewing Hate Into The Nation’s Living RoomsTM, it must be said that the footage of Bob Vylan’s offending set is still embedded into multiple stories on the MailOnline website, all containing an exhortation to “watch the full video”. Should whoever is leaving the videos up on MailOnline also be investigated and prosecuted? Perhaps Chris Philp could adjudicate. Either way, let’s keep a cell or five for them in the special new prison. After all, why on earth shouldn’t we imprison a few journalists, too? In for a penny, and so on.Listen closely to the Kneecap furore. You’ll hear hypocrisy from all sides | Dorian LynskeyRead moreNeedless to say, embattled prime ministerKeir Starmer has made timeto have plenty of official views not just on the behaviour of the two bands, but on any future decisions to book them. If all you have is a hammer, everything is a nail – and if your big job before politics was being director of public prosecutions, then I’m sure everything looks like a prosecutable offence.It certainly did to the prime minister after last summer’s riots in the wake of the Southport murders, when Starmer seemed to relish the response happening the best way he knew how: by rushing it through the courts. Connolly was one of those prosecuted, in her case for a manifestly revolting and racist but also clearly tossed-off post responding to a false rumour the killer was an asylum seeker, saying people could set fire to asylum hotels “for all I care”. She admitted inciting racial hatred in court, but has since becomesomething of a cause celebrefor the fact that she is a mother with an otherwise clean record (and one who had lost a young child herself), and that she has got a harsher sentence for this tweet that she later deleted than some convicted rapists.I wrotein the immediate wake of the riots that it was clear that something big had happened in the UK – though it wasn’t yet precisely clear what. Unfortunately, the prime minister seemed to think it was fairly simple. “Let me also say to large social media companies and those who run them,”he said, albeit to some reporters instead, “violent disorder clearly whipped up online: that is also a crime. It’s happening on your premises, and the law must be upheld everywhere.”Sadiq Khan seemed to thinkit was something to do with the Online Safety Act not being “fit for purpose”.View image in fullscreenLucy Connolly was jailed as a result of her tweet about asylum-seekers in the wake of last summer’s Southport murders.Photograph: Northamptonshire Police/PAIn more successful hot takes, it was also the moment that Elon Musk test-drove his epithet “two-tier Keir”. That one has stuck, and it will stick even harder if, for example, sublebrity band Bob Vylan don’t get the book thrown at them in the same way that no-mark Lucy Connolly did. To be clear, I don’t think any of the aforementioned lot ought to be in prison, however vile and unacceptable their behaviour was. But if you don’t deal with them in pretty much the same way, then people are going to be talking far more loudly about two-tier justice again.This type of talk has already reached all the way into the Oval Office where, in February, vice-presidentJD Vance suggested to Starmerthat the UK had a free speech problem. You might have seen that Bob Vylan have just promptlyhad their US visas revokedfor what the deputy secretary of state called “their hateful tirade”. But we can’t expect consistency from the Trump administration.What we expect of our own country is infinitely more important. I used to think masses of legislation around what horrible things people could or couldn’t say was a niche-application civilisational advance, but I have changed my view, and now fear we are sleepwalking towards a society where half the people will think certain incarcerated miscreants are political prisoners, and the other half will think a different bunch of incarcerated miscreants are political prisoners. I am very much for living in a country where we don’t think we have political prisoners at all. Getting there isn’t simple – but stopping travelling in the wrong direction would be a good start.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On Saturday, Bobby Vylan, the frontman of the rap-punk duo Bob Vylan, chanted “death, death to the IDF” – referring to the Israel Defense Forces – from the West Holts stage at Glastonbury, and members of the crowd joined in. The performance was livestreamed by the BBC.A day earlier,the Israeli newspaper Haaretz revealedthat Israeli soldiers and officers had confessed that they had been ordered to shoot at unarmed Palestinians as they queued for aid. Last month, about 600 desperately hungry Palestinians, including many children,were killed this way.Five words on one hand. Six hundred killed on the other. Which story is dominating the front pages of British newspapers, leading news bulletins, provoking relentless push notifications by theBBCand causing the prime minister and an endless parade of frontbenchers to condemn such an outrage? It is, of course, more than anything else Vylan said, those five words. How morally lost is a society in which a chant against a genocidal foreign army provokes a political and media firestorm, but the intentionally starved, unarmed human beings being mowed down on the orders of the IDF high command do not?There is a genocide happening in Gaza: that is the consensus of genocide scholars, including those in Israel. This one word, genocide, can only go so far in conveying what is happening in Gaza. Genocide means wiping out the pillars of civilisation – from homes to schools to agriculture – and forcibly driving people from their land. It means food, water and healthcare being denied. It means entire families being wiped out by indiscriminate bombing. It means babies being burned alive and suffocating under rubble.If we must focus our fury at words, look to the genocidal statements proudly delivered by Israeli politicians. The Israeli finance minister declaring in May that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed”. Or this weekend, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir,demanding a permanent endto all aid to Gaza, which in practice means death to Palestinian civilians. These statements are underpinned by firepower and they mean actual fatalities. Britain continues to provide crucial parts to the Israeli military, which acts on these words.And that’s what this is really about: a campaign of deflection from Britain’s complicity in the crime of the century. Facilitators of genocide are presented as the morally upstanding moderates, while opponents of genocide are labelled as hateful, dangerous extremists. That’s why British citizens serving in the IDF are not under criminal investigation for war crimes committed in Gaza, while the government has begun the process ofproscribing Palestine Action, which would place it in the same legal bracket as Islamic State and violent neo-Nazis,after its activists threw paint at military planes.Avon and Somerset policehave announced a criminal investigationinto the Glastonbury performances of Bob Vylan and Kneecap. Welcome to Britain in 2025, where musicians angry at genocide are dragged through the justice system, while politicians facilitating genocide walk free. Meanwhile, the government minister Lisa Nandydelivered an outraged statementto the House of Commons about Bob Vylan and the BBC’s decision to livestream their set – deemed a better use of parliamentary time than how the people of Gaza can be saved from what the head of the Red Cross has called “worse than hell on Earth”.The BBC and Glastonbury have issued statementsdeclaring Vylan’s chant to be antisemitic. It seems to me far more offensive to conflate Jewish people as a whole with an army whose actions have led the international criminal court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister for war crimes and crimes against humanity.Bobby Vylan has just releaseda statement making clear he is opposed to “the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people”. Instead, he makes clear “death to the IDF” means “the dismantling of a violent military machine”. Amen: the IDF should be dismantled. An army that commits genocide has forfeited its right to exist. It should be replaced with a force capable of protecting the security of all people who live between the river and the sea, whatever their ethnicity or religion, which probably means an international peacekeeping force.I also believe people shouldn’t die. The war in Gaza, which has led to the murder of tens of thousands of Palestinians, has also resulted in hundreds of IDF soldiers being killed. Ask those who joined in with Vylan’s chant if they supported sending the IDF into Gaza, and you will hear a unanimous “no”. If they had been listened to, as well as preventing genocide, those Israeli soldiers would still be alive.Millions of people have watched the livestreaming of obscenities in Gaza. They expect, quite rationally, their politicians to share their outrage: instead, they note that their politicians continue to arm the perpetrators. They expect their media to hold power to account, at home and abroad: instead, they see the whitewashing of horrors. What underpinned the chant was revulsion at crimes against humanity and frustration at politicians.You really can only turn the world on its head for so long. In the end this crime is too obscene, too documented, too unapologetic to get away with. One day there will be a reckoning, and those who facilitated the annihilation of Gaza will find themselves being made to account for what they said and did, rather than those who stood against it.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There was no alternativeNils PratleyInfamous former owner of Thames Water coughs up more capital in bid to turn around badly performing utilitySouthern Water owners to invest up to £1.2bn in troubled utilityTue 1 Jul 2025 13.03 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 17.16 EDTShareMany took the view in 2021 that Macquarie should have been run out of town, rather than be allowed to own another English water company.The giant Australian financial outfit’s former outing, remember, was at Thames Water from 2006 to 2017, which was when the absurd games of financial leverage began at the UK’s biggest water company. The then-chair of Ofwat later told MPshe asked himself the question“What do we do here, with that reputation?” when Macquarie made the best financial offer to rescue Southern Water.The deal was done eventually with Ofwat’s blessing. Macquarie-managed funds injected £1bn to take control and its infrastructure boss declared inan open letterthat the firm would be “a responsible long-term steward of Southern Water and believes it can help the company deliver the transformation it requires”.Part of that statement – the bit about being in it for the long term – is clearly true. Macquarie is now rescuing Southern for a third time, in effect. An extra £550m was injected in 2023. Now its consortium (of which it and its managed funds are about 90%) is putting in up to £1.2bn in equity to recapitalise Southern’s operating company.Thames Water’s creditors are being too greedy | Nils PratleyRead moreThe process is convoluted since only £655m is binding; a further £245m is intended to follow by the end of the year and the balance of £300m depends of the outcome of Southern’s appeal to try to secure bigger bill increases than the 53% allowed by Ofwat. But, in the shoes of the regulator or a fearful secretary of state, Steve Reed, you’d be breathing a sigh of relief. Their nightmare was the thought that the current refinancing crisis at Thames would spill over to Southern, the next most stressed operator. Instead, Southern should now have sufficient capital to get it through the current five-year regulatory period.Unlike at Thames, the fisticuffs with bondholders took place behind closed doors. Lenders are taking a write-down from £865m to £415m across the complicated holding company group structure in what is a mini debt-for-equity swap to supplement the new capital. Macquarie’s approach to transparency didn’t extend to giving a leverage ratio for the regulated entity in recapitalised form – a critical metric – but the ratio is obviously lower than it was before the deal.Yet the Australian attempt at watery redemption is not quite the upbeat tale of emerging success presented in Tuesday’s announcement. The claimed “good progress” with Southern’s transformation plan requires a large helping of context.Yes, pollution incidents may be down by 40%, but the top executives are still on Reed’s banned list for bonuses on account of spills. Meanwhile, the company got a two-star rating inthe Environment Agency’s last assessment report– better than the one star Macquarie inherited, but still equal bottom-of-the-table.Ofwat’s separate performance scorecardnoted that in 2023-24 Southern “reported the largest percentage net underperformance payment for a fourth consecutive year”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Thursday Aberdeen Group plc terminated its Financial Fairness Trust without notice and sacked the CEO, Mubin Haq, the chair and all the trustees, leaving eight staff dangling. The company tells me it plans to move in a different direction. That dreaded phrase marks the end of 16 remarkable years, during which the trust sponsored some of the most influential research into inequality and its financial causes.Aberdeen is a wealth management and investment company. I admired its willingness to fund research not in its own immediate interest, but for the sake of social improvement, as a sign that decent capitalism was possible. Now that’s over. The mood has changed. Wildfires started by President Trump are engulfing global companies as his administration attempts tobar asset and retirement plan managersfrom considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investment decisions and targets private sector diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiativeswith executive orders. Companies doing good are at risk. I ask Aberdeen if that’s why it has shut down the trust. It denies it strongly, saying it is just a “natural evolution”.Expect an explosive backlash. Just look at the list of research organisations it has previously given funding to but is now casting off: the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the Resolution Foundation, the Royal United Services Institute, Bright Blue, the New Economics Foundation, the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation (CenTax), the Child Poverty Action Group, the High Pay Centre and Transport for All. It has also funded funeral poverty research by Quaker Social Action and consumer research by Which?. The trust has £3.6m of grants promised, in a field where small sums for social research projects can profoundly affect policy and politics. Paul Johnson, the outgoing IFS director, says this money is “a crucial part of the UK’s research funding infrastructure focused on improving the financial security of those on lower incomes”. He talks ruefully of billions of pounds for scientific research but a pittance for social research. “We have no Large Hadron Colliders.”Aberdeen should beware the swathe of distinguished economists, researchers, academics, public servants, public thinkers and charitable entrepreneurs it has unthinkingly cut off in this political assault. The trust was founded in 2009, using unclaimed assets after the demutualisation of Standard Life, which later merged withAberdeen Asset Management. Last week, its website shut down instantly, with the misleading notice “Please bear with us and we will aim to resume normal service as quickly as we can”. There will be no normal service.David Norgrove, the summarily sacked chair, is not going quietly. Neither is he someone to be treated so high-handedly. He is a former chair of the UK Statistics Authority, the Pensions Regulator, the Low Pay Commission, the M&S pension fund, the Family Justice Review and more. He is outraged at how the trust was cancelled in a day. “Shoddy behaviour,” he says to me, then adds: “Abrupt, rude, ungracious.” This will, he says, “be damaging to them”.Aberdeen did lose£5bn in net outflowsin the first quarter of this year – its share price has somewhat revived since – but says all the funds will still go to charity. I ask if there is a guarantee that the latest £3.6m of grant funding letters will be honoured. The reply is weaselly: “The various funding relationships will be under review and that will include looking at what contractual commitments are in place, so it’s too early to be definitive.” CenTax is a grant recipient left in limbo over the future of its promised three years of funding. This week the trust was about to start on another £2m round: due for grants were the Living Pension Foundation, to sign up 500 companies to join Aviva, L&G and others pledging more livable pensions. The Child Poverty Action Group will now get no funds for an annual forensic review of child poverty strategy, nor will the High Pay Centre receive money for research into remuneration committees that focuses on entire workforces, not just top executives.Why is Aberdeen trashing its reputation? Because times have changed. Doing good is not fashionable in the business world. Johnson says: “I presume some of the trust’s funding is not compatible with Aberdeen. It’s an overreaction to our research on pension tax relief, or the Resolution Foundation’s work in wealth tax reliefs.” Most social research is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Nuffield Foundation, but he says after the trust, there are “no significant others”. Aberdeen says the only reason for the change is to divert its funds to a conventional charitable foundation that supports individuals, such as young unemployed people – although this is funding that won’t lead to a larger questioning of social, financial or tax systems.The company is already famous for idiocy – it abolished the Es in its name in 2021 to become the unpronounceable “Abrdn”, claiming it was a “modern, agile, digitally-enabled brand”.Mocked for “irritable vowel syndrome”, it joined disaster rebrands such as Royal Mail’s Consignia and PwC Consulting’s Monday. It makes you question any decisions their boards make.But this is serious. It’s a symptom of darkening business attitudes.Research this month showsthat 56% of senior financial professionals in the UK now “believe their leadership will place less focus on ESG principles over the next five years”. WPP, one of the largest media companies in the world,removed all mentions of DEIfrom its latest annual report. Research by the Observer found that mentions of ESGdeclined by 22%in last year’s annual reports from FTSE 100 companies. Amazon is scaling back its DEI policy, calling this civilisational regression an “evolution”.Former trustees suggest Aberdeen may have had complaints from clients who hate research about poverty and wealth that exposes unjust tax reliefs for the rich. When I ask, its press officer does admit he sometimes has to tell journalists from the Telegraph and others that Aberdeen Group plc is not responsible for the research its trust may fund: every trust-funded report has a disclaimer saying the trust is entirely independent of the company. This turns out, sadly, not to be true, since Aberdeen can cancel it at whim.This week will mark the launch in Westminster of a trust-funded two-year commission into pensions by the IFS, with the former minister David Gauke chairing its advisory committee and Torsten Bell, the pensions minister and former head of the Resolution Foundation, speaking. The chair of Aberdeen Group, Douglas Flint, who is due to attend, may find himself less in favour than when he was invited to join Labour’s City advisers as part of a financial services review. He lobbies forless regulation of banks, calling the post-financial-crash restrictions ”disproportionate”. If I were him, I wouldn’t dare turn up.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsResearch fundingOpinionAberdeen Asset ManagementcommentShareReuse this content"

That war is over – it seems ours will never endHassan Abo QamarFor two years, we’ve waited for a final ceasefire that has never come. Peace will be delayed as long as our lives are considered disposableTue 1 Jul 2025 06.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 06.23 EDTShareLast Tuesday night, Donald Trump announced on social media that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire, ending what he called a “12-day war”. It was the second war this year, after India and Pakistan’s four-day conflict, tostart and end under Trump’s watch. They followed another, earlier conflict betweenLebanon and Israelduring President Joe Biden’s term.Here in Gaza, all eyes were fixed on the Iran-Israel conflict. Even cut off from the internet, people found ways to follow the news – on the radio, or by catching weak phone signals by climbing to high rooftops or walking near the sea, or just by staying up all night watching the sky, where some of the missiles launched from Iran could be seen from Gaza. Many wondered if Trump, the man who once promised to stop “endless wars”, would seize the moment to stop not only war on Iran but also the genocide in Gaza.For 12 days, we finally witnessed a real power in the world enter a war with Israel, the same country that has starved us, bombed us and killed us. But does that really make any difference for us in Gaza? Even if Israel were bombed byIranuntil the last day of our lives, nothing would bring back our beloved ones, our homes, our warm city.Two years of our lives have passed like decades. But in just 12 days, that war was over. Trump declared the strikes a complete success against a “nuclear threat”, even asinternational inspectors disagreed. The assault on Iran has ended. The assault on Gaza, the tiny coastal strip with no army and no air force, hasn’t.Trump has brought no change for us. No relief. Only escalation. In just six months, he has failed – or rather, never even tried – to end the war in Gaza. On the contrary, he has become one of its main enablers, sending Israel all the weapons it needs to keep it going. And yet, he offersstatements of optimism, claiming that “I think great progress is being made on Gaza” and that his special envoy Steve Witkoff had told him “Gaza is very close.”Similar optimism was expressed one month ago, when Witkoff spoke of having “very good feelings” about the chances for reaching a temporary ceasefire. A ceasefire that, ultimately, never materialised.I remember the early months of the war when my little sister asked: “Why do their wars end so quickly? Why isGazathe exception?” These questions echo through every household in Gaza. Back then, we believed it was just a matter of time; that international law would step in. But over more than 600 days we have seen the same pattern repeat again and again – destruction, death, then negotiations, ceasefire talks, “breakthroughs”, then more deaths. Delegations fly to Doha and return empty-handed. This isn’t because peace is impossible. This is because the genocide in Gaza doesn’t inflict real political or economic costs on those in power. Unlike Iran, Gaza poses no strategic threat; it cannot block trade routes such as the strait of Hormuz, nor does it have the means to inflict meaningful damage on Israel. The international pressure is weak, mostly limited to statements rather than sanctions, and thus easily ignored.For Israel’s leadership, peace in Gaza simply isn’t profitable. In fact, continued assault serves political interests, especially those of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who isdoing everything he canto avoid early elections while he faces corruption charges, which he denies.We’ve come to understand the bitter truth: our lives are conditional. Our dreams, our futures – all worthless unless they serve geopolitical interests. Our suffering is tolerated. Our justice, indefinitely delayed.Famine and malnutrition are now widespread. Electricity has been cut for nearly two years. Generations of students have lost access to education. Municipalities have collapsed. The healthcare system is overwhelmed. Daily life has disintegrated. Gaza’s streets, once calm, are now haunted by fear. Bombings are no longer the only threat: at night, people face theft, assault or even murder. Lawlessness is growing. Gangs operate openly. Israel shows no interest in restoring order. Chaos serves it better.Look into people’s eyes. In everyone, from the smallest child to the oldest grandparent, you’ll see blank stares, hollow gazes. Eyes stripped of light. Waiting. Not necessarily for death, but for something to end.Gaza longs for what all people long for – to breathe, to live, for peace. Butrealpeace cannot be declared from podiums while bombs fall from planes. It cannot be promised in speeches while crossings stay closed. It cannot exist without an immediate, unbroken ceasefire.A ceasefire that would allow Gaza’s sky at sunset to be dotted with children’s kites floating gently over the rubble. For a moment, they would watch them fly and think: maybe not everything up there means death. Maybe, just maybe, there’s an angel, too.All we want is what all people want: for this nightmare to end. For warplanes to leave. For tents to become safe, warm homes again. For the soft coastal breeze to blow away the smell of blood.And maybe justice is not scheduled for today.But I still believe: one day, we will see it.Hassan Abo Qamar is a Palestinian writer and journalist based in GazaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Whether in Primark, Urban Outfitters or H&M, the crowd is always the same: some teens are in gangs and they are having a fine old time; others, sometimes in sibling pairs, are with their mum, presumably because they have yet to find a way to detach her from her credit card. It’s like that bit in an action movie where you need a guy’s fingerprint to open a vault, so you cut off his arm, except, regrettably, in this case, they have to take the entire body.Some of us are too hot; others are too embarrassing to be believed and have been told that multiple times between each clothes rack. But the main thing we have in common is that we are all incredibly bored. It’s one of those things about youth that I don’t miss at all, along with paralysing social anxiety and blackheads: the ability to parse the difference between one T-shirt and another for hours; to look at the same pair of jeans for 15 minutes straight, your imagination running riot over what they might look like across every jumper combination and landscape. This is not a spectator sport, yet spectate you must, because ultimately you will have to give a view, so that, whatever you say, they can do the opposite.Last time, I tried on a load of stuff myself, just to be subversive – a velvet revolution, if you like, except whatever that highly flammable material was, I don’t think it was velvet. What I really want to do is amass the mums and create a norm of spontaneous chat, some cross between a salon and the earliest days of the trade union movement. It’s so obvious from looking around how much we would find to talk about. We don’t want to be mean about our kids, obviously – we want to talk about ideas, describe our feminist awakenings, swap recipes; maybe someone could bring finger food.

From the French government’s decision to close schools to thebans in most of Italyon outdoor work at the hottest time of day, the immediate priority is to protect people from extreme heat – and to recognise that a heatwave can take a higher toll than a violent storm.People who are already vulnerable, due to age or illness or poor housing, face the greatest risks from heatwaves. As well as changes to rules and routines, public health warnings are vital, especially where records are being broken and people are unfamiliar with the conditions. In the scorching European summer of 2022, an estimated68,000 people dieddue to heat. Health, welfare and emergency systems must respond to those needing help.Less direct harms include losses in agriculture. In the UK, the British Retail Consortium has blamed reduced crop yields, due to hot weather, forrising food price inflation. Wildfires – such as the one in Chios,Greece, last week – menace buildings, landscapes and wildlife as well as human lives.Last year, the UK government faced strong criticism from the advisory Climate Change Committee forinadequate adaptation plans. Apart from an increase in spending on flood defences, Labour has so far donelittle to rectify this. The current heatwave ought to change that. With a heat dome that draws in and traps warm air affecting almost all of France, as well as countries further south, the need to prepare is obvious.Good information enables sensible planning; this includes reliable forecasting as well as attribution studies that explain how global heating makes destructive weather more likely.Recent extreme weather in the US, as well as in Europe, highlights the folly of Donald Trump’s cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.By withdrawing from the Paris agreement, Mr Trump has made the US a global outlier. But while the EU remains committed to net zero by 2050 – and states are due to discuss aninterim target for 2040this week –support for net zero policieshas been eroded in some European countries too over the last few years, particularly where far-right populist leaders have targeted them.Could the current dangerous heat help to refocus minds? Portugal and Spain both recorded new records at the weekend, withtemperatures over 46C. This week, scientists at a conference in Exeter are gathering to discuss climate tipping points. Generally this term refers to the passing of dangerous limits – such as melted ice sheets – after which catastrophe becomes much harder to prevent. ButProf Timothy Lentonpoints out that it can also be used positively. Two examples are the accelerating uptake of solar power and electric vehicles.As well as supporting people to cope with the heat, and promoting adaptations of various kinds (for example, in building and urban design), European leaders should use current conditions to remind the public how much is at stake, and reinforce the importance of ambitious, achievable targets. Climate despair is deadly, but the anxiety produced by recognition of the risks can be harnessed to positive effect. As well as a problem to be dealt with, the heatwave could be viewed as a teachable moment – when the public becomes more receptive to the pressing case for change.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

AsUSAIDwas formally shut down on Monday, a once-in-a-decade development financing conference was kicking off in Seville. But while initially intended to move the world closer to its ambitious 2030 sustainable development goals, it now looks more like an attempt to prevent a reversal of the progress already made.A studypublished in the Lancetpredicted that Donald Trump’s aid cuts could claim more than 14 million lives by 2030, a third of them among children. For many poor countries, the scale of the shock would be similar to that of a major war, the authors found. More than four-fifths of the US agency’s programmes have been cut, with surviving projects folded into the state department.The US was by far the world’s largest donor to global development – though its contributions were a fraction of the G7 target of 0.7% of GDP. Yet the damage does not end there. Its move encouraged others to follow suit. The UK, Germany and France are slashing their aid budgets to spend more on defence. Oxfam says that the collective retrenchment by G7 nations isthe biggest aid cut since 1960, with spending 26% lower in 2026 than it was last year. Don’t expect China or the Gulf states to fill this gaping hole.It is not just grim news for aid recipients. It bodes ill for all. It would be naive to imagine that aid is a high‑mindedly altruistic endeavour. Just as conflict breeds hunger and poverty, so injustice and deprivation breed instability and a more dangerous world. Slashing health budgets also increases the risks of another global pandemic.Developing countries hoped that the UN- and Spanish-hosted International Conference on Financing for Development would at least see a willingness to tackle an international financial system stacked against the global majority. Instead, the US, UK, EU and others shamefullyacted as blockers, watering down the language on a UN intergovernmental process to tackle the debt crisis. The US reportedly proposed 400 amendments across a multitude of issues to the conference’s outcome document beforepulling outentirely. Others will need to be held to their too-limited commitments.More thantwo-fifths of the global populationlive in low income countries whichare in debt distress or close to it. Many poor African nations are spending more on debt financing than they do on health or education. Contrary to popular perception – and any sense of justice and decency – wealth is flowing from them to developed nations. The UN says that servicing debt cost developing countries $847bn last year, rising to $947bn this year.Yet developed countries are choosing to shore up an unfair global financial system. The keenness of the UK and others to focus on private sector‑oriented solutions looks like better news for the City than developing nations. The promise that private finance would turn “billions to trillions” was enthusiastically promoted a decade ago, yet largely failed to materialise.Despite the enduring inequality, the last few decades saw extraordinary progress in areas such as cuttingchild mortality. For all their flaws, USAID-funded programmes alonesaved almost 92 million livesover 20 years. We know that remarkable leaps in human wellbeing are possible. We will all regret it if, in this time of conflict and crisis, we slam the door shut on such advances and block out the call of justice.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In fairness Wimbledon’s big Tuesday best-of-British event did feel a bit like this. Less an act of white-hot sporting drama, more just, like, a really cool thing happening.Jack Draper coolly handles Wimbledon pressure by marching past Sebastián BáezRead moreAn hour and 13 minutes into this first-round match Sebastián Báez would retire with a knee injury at 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 down. There will be far tougher opponents than the world No 38 who barely left an imprint on the Wimbledon turf, and whose only obvious victory plan was to keep bunting the ball back until one of you dies of heat exhaustion. There was no chance of that on the Wimbledon grass. Instead this was the tennis equivalent of watching a man being run over by a truck, albeit a very elegant, high-end, luxury-spec truck.And so Draper has now progressed to the second round, and also taken a step along another significant pathway. For Draper this Wimbledon is a kind of coming out event, a society debut. Not in any sport-related sense. He’s No 4 in the world. He has already vaulted through every level placed in front of him, from the nepo-baby jibes of the junior tennis circuit, a place that makes even the drowned world of kids cricket seem insufficiently neurotic, to proving himself as a genuine elite presence on tour.But this is also Draper’s first post-Murray summer, his first as the Big Thing, the key domestic TV event at this arena of swoons, flushes and also hunger. It would emerge later that the handbag-biting man was in fact part of a team of influencers sent by Draper’s fashion sponsor to create their own sub-spectacle, amplify the brand, influence.View image in fullscreenJack Draper cools off on Court No 1.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe All England Club can hardly complain. Wimbledon and Draper is also essentially a brand partnership. British star power has been vital to this place’s transformation into a hugely potent financial engine, spawned out of the appearance of sporting mania as a feature in public life in the mid-90s. Wimbledon entwined itself around this, the corporate hospitality dollar, the pink trouser pound. The industry is real. It needs meat. So Draper must head into the grinder, a deeply mannered kind of grinder, but a grinder nonetheless.Court No 1 was viciously hot and humid in late afternoon, the kind of heat that sits on every surface like heavy gravity. There was a slow wave of whoops and whistles as the players walked out, Draper picturesquely vast next to Báez. There are still questions to be answered here. What are the shapes, the sounds, the iconography of the Draper fandom?Henman Energy was fevered and oddly sexless, with a vague sense of cheering for a minor royal cousin. The Murray years were more nuanced, a deeper bond, a higher ceiling, a sense of greatness to be touched. Draper is something else, a product off the high-end factory line, a machine made to hit and stretch and win.You can see why elite players consider him elite. There are no weaknesses in his physical toolbox. Tall but good feet. Power but still whippy and light in his shoulders. And yes we will objectify him, because this is tennis, a relentless elite sport, but also basically a country-house flirtation that got out of hand. The jaw, the shoulders, the sculpted lines. This thing is rangy, classical, elite-athlete handsome. We have one of these now. How is it going to feel?“Come on Drapes” lone voices shouted in the crowd, trying it out, as he hit long in the opening game, searching for timing in that full-rotation forehand. But with 20 minutes gone it was already 5-1. The second set was if anything even easier. And outside on the big-screen slope beyond Court No 1 the vibe was equally comfortable.View image in fullscreenDraper’s first-round match was scheduled for primetime TV in the UK.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThere are issues to be settled here. What will we call this space now, given it seems to need to be called something? Henman Hill always sounded like a bottle of bad English wine. Does it have to be a hill? Jackatoa? The Jackerhorn? Jackstock? Is there a Jackstonbury angle?All of this fluff has a hard commercial edge. Sport must be sold to people who don’t like sport. Eyeballs must be harvested. But it is a shame, because Draper is interesting in his own right. He has taken time to find his best self, struggled with nerves, and spoken recently about the influence of his breathing coach, which is very Big Sport kind of thing, a place where often the real interest is the challenge of simply surviving in this world, existing on that lighted stage.Draper has spent a lot of time working out how to be alone, waiting better, being in hotels better, remembering to breathe, learning to win, as here, without taking a bite out of himself. On this evidence it might just be an unusually comfortable reboot.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Jack DraperWimbledonTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sport newspaper, sadly, will be unable to chronicle the event, having folded in 1999. Life moves on you pretty fast.Women’s Euro 2025: Guardian writers’ predictions for the tournamentRead moreThe narrative arc of women’s football in Switzerland is one that will be familiar to the game’s pioneers across the continent: an agonising and incremental journey from apathy to hostility to mockery to inertia to change. Women were not allowed to play organised 11-a-side football until the late 1960s. Women’s leagues were not fully integrated into the Swiss football association until 1993. This, by the way, was three years after the north-eastern canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden became the last Swiss province to give women the vote.And so of course the opening nightof Switzerland’s summer partyis a moment to sense the sheer scale of progress, to salute the countless women who toiled in anonymity to make it possible, to admire the view from what the official Uefa branding so wittily describes as the “Summit of Emotions”. Switzerland has never been one of Europe’s major women’s football nations. And yet, without the benefit of a Wembley or Old Trafford, a land of 9 million people has ensured that ticket sales will surpass those of Euro 2022 before a ball has even been kicked.For a country where even the tournament organiser, Doris Keller, admits that “women’s football is not very developed”, where grassroots teams still fight for space amid the small pockets of usable terrain, where the term “men’s football” still draws raised eyebrows in a way it no longer does in Britain, this is an achievement in itself, whatever Pia Sundhage’s team achieve on the pitch. But of course England and the Netherlands cantestify to the transformative effectof a strong home performance, the sheer rarity of these moments when a successful side can refresh the parts of society that would normally be out of reach to them.View image in fullscreenLia Wälti is one of Switzerland’s standout players but the hosts enter the tournament as one of the biggest unknowns.Photograph: Philipp Kresnik/SPP/ShutterstockFor all their exciting individual talent, embodied in Lia Wälti, Géraldine Reuteler and the exciting teenage playmaker Sydney Schertenleib, the Swiss go into the tournament as perhaps one of its biggest unknowns. Can they take advantage of a kind draw and surf the patriotic wave to the knockouts? Or will a leaky defence, an injury-hit squad and Sundhage’s awkward tactics implode in embarrassing fashion?In one sense Group A – by far the weakest of the four – holds the key to the tournament, giving teams such as Belgium and Italy in Group B a viable path to the semi-finals if they can get in the slipstream of Spain. The world champions are still favourites, even if they disappointed at last summer’s Olympics and are fretting on the health of Aitana Bonmatí. But if 2023 proved anything, it is that this group of players can play through even the fiercest adversity, a self-driving car that knows how to right itself in the toughest moments.And this is perhaps the one aspect in which Spain remain well clear of the pack. Unlike most of their rivals, Montse Tomé’s side have a clear playing identity, an established coaching tradition, basic principles that reach all the way down to grassroots level and the fiercely competitive regional junior tournaments that have provided a regular pipeline of talent to the academies. More than any other team in world football, Spain have an idea of how Spain should play.By contrast, what is the identity of Sarina Wiegman’s England, beyond a kind of hard-running swagger? Or Christian Wück’s Germany, a team still awkwardly transitioning from old to new? Laurent Bonadei has tried to curb France’s traditional reliance on gifted individuals by dropping several big names for the tournament. Many of the medium-sized nations remain disproportionately reliant on gifted individuals.View image in fullscreenSpain remain well clear of the pack and will not be short of support in Switzerland.Photograph: Gabriel Monnet/APWhich is no criticism of any of these teams: by and large this is still an emerging sport, still near the start of its creative cycle, sparsely staffed and unevenly resourced. But it is fair to say that the explosion of playing talent has – for understandable reasons – not been met by a commensurate rise in the quality of coaching or ideas. As such a good proportion of success at this tournament will be defined by fitness and physicality, bolts of individual quality, rapid shifts in momentum, the teams best equipped at harnessing the vibes.In this sense, the increasingly uncomfortable wealth gaps at European club level may work as a kind of leveller for the international game. Barcelona’s dominance of Liga F is great for the Spanish national side, but great too for players such as Poland’s Ewa Pajor and Portugal’s Kika Nazareth who have been able to develop their game at the very cutting edge of the sport. Wales would not be at this tournament without England’s WSL. Pretty much every team at this tournament have a gamechanging player who can steal the show in an instant. This is the depth Emma Hayes was referring toin her Guardian columnwhen she predicted the highest-quality Euros we have seen.The flip side is that there are fewer mysteries than ever. It was only two tournaments ago when a largely unknown Austria side shocked the world by coming within a penalty shootout of the final. These days virtually every player is a known quantity, their data points logged and loaded, their strengths and weaknesses neatly packaged for video. And here perhaps is one aspect in which European women’s football has stolen a decisive march on the rest of the world, recalibrating the gravity of a sport that once revolved around the US and its enviable talent system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the 2019 World Cup, 13 of Australia’s squad played in America; by 2023 that was down to two. A third of Hayes’s US squad for the SheBelieves Cup this year was drawn from abroad.View image in fullscreenNorway train before facing Switzerland on the first night of the tournament.Photograph: Georgios Kefalas/APAnd when the NWSL became the first American major sporting league to abolish the player draft this year, it was a recognition of the increasingly fraught competition from European clubs for the best talent. Crystal Dunn (to Paris Saint-Germain) andNaomi Girma (to Chelsea)made the jump this year. Trinity Rodman says it will be “a matter of when” she plays abroad, and we can assume she is not envisioning a stint in the Liga MX Femenil.All of which is predicated on the presumption of permanent, inexorable growth. But there are no guarantees here. No growth is truly permanent. And as well as being a moment to savour the pace of progress, Euro 2025 comes at a critical juncture for the women’s game, an opportunity to forestall the inevitable tapering off.YouGov research published this week indicates that across major European nations, fewer people are intending to watch this tournament than the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand two years ago, despite the friendlier time zone. More than 80% of adults across the continent describe themselves as “not interested” in women’s football. In England,television audiences for the WSL fell 35%last season with no international tournament upon which to piggyback. All of which underlines the precarity of football’s brave new frontier. At what point does this thing hit its ceiling?Perhaps the major conclusion to draw from the WSL television figures is the continuing importance of international football in terms of driving interest. Arsenal’s players wererichly feted for beating Barcelonain May’s Champions League final, but for players such as Leah Williamson and Alessia Russo retaining the Euros would bring a different level of acclaim entirely. A first triumph since 2013 would transform the German game in a way no amount of Frauen Bundesliga marketing could ever manage.Over to the players, then. And of course every woman who ever kicked a ball in anger has always been aware on some level that they are playing for something larger: those who came before and those who will come after, those newly converted and those yet to be convinced, the imperative in a crowded marketplace to create not only competent sport but compelling product. Perhaps, as we reflect again on our wretched Swiss correspondent from seven decades ago, this event is part exhibition and part circus. But – and here’s the rub – it is also definitely about football.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was trying, and struggling, to put her finger on why she had become the most high profile casualty of a typically consequential first round at Wimbledon. “I don’t know, I just feel a little bit disappointed in how I showed up today.”The question before the tournament was whether Gauff could cement her standing at the top of the game by adding Wimbledon tothis year’s French Open titlefor a “Channel Slam”. The answer turned out to be a rather decisive “no”. The second seed was knocked out in less than two hours on Tuesday evening, with the biggest shock how easily she was dispatched by the Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska.Wimbledon’s rampant British players deliver joint-best performance 1976Read moreThe 21-year-old was at first outpunched and ultimately outplayed, but in the middle came a collapse all of her own making. An inability to match up against Yastremska’s power in a series of fierce rallies only led to Gauff taking more risks, which rarely came off. When her serve began to depart her in the first set tie-break the writing was on the wall. Gauff said maybe a bit more practice on grass might have helped her efforts, but she couldn’t be certain.Yastremska seemed almost as nonplussed in victory as Gauff was in defeat. She said she went into the match without even a “small expectation” of winning. “I knew that [Gauff] would not give me one ball for free,” she said. “Today I think I’ve done most of the job. I was leading during the game, during the points. Obviously she plays much playing much better on clay court and hard court and I kind of felt [I have] a bit more priority on grass. But, well, in general, I don’t know!” At which point she burst into laughter.Gauff beat Venus Williams in her first match at the Championships on a run to the fourth round in 2019 as a 15-year-old. Shewon the hearts of SW19then, and the crowd were behind her here, but she is yet to go deeper in the competition and seemed very short on ideas of how to play her way out of the trouble Yastremska was inflicting on her.The Ukrainian has been the subject of media coverage reporting her apparent allergy to grass, but while an aversion to pollen may or may not have provided the animus, she approached the match with maximum intensity, forcing Gauff on to the back foot from the off with her forehand, a weapon that was as fast as it was precise and stayed consistently low.Gauff had the bigger serve, but it failed to rattle Yastremska on the defensive and the Ukrainian broke serve for 4-2 in the first set. In response Gauff simply put more power into her strokes, producing some mesmerising exchanges but also increasing the errors. Only rarely did she think instead to switch up her shot selection, with Yastremska much more vulnerable when forced to change her angles of approach before booming her drives.View image in fullscreenDayana Yastremska celebrates victory over Coco Gauff.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAGauff broke back at 4-5 and dragged the first set to a tie-break but any hopes of a revival were soon extinguished. In the break she served two double faults and in apparent slow motion, one even after a let of serve. It was like watching her match plans literally fall down around her, not to mention any sense of impregnability that she may have attempted to convey to her opponent. From there things only got worse.Broken at the first attempt in the second set, Gauff tried once again to plug herself into the mains but the outcome was even wilder. Yastremska broke again for 3-1 and then for 5-1 and a call from the stands of “Don’t worry Coco, don’t worry!” had a distinctly forlorn tone to it. For Yastremska, meanwhile, there was nothing but delight.The second day of competition atWimbledonsaw other high profile departures from the women’s draw too, including the world No 3 Jessica Pegula who was beaten in straight sets – 6-2, 6-3 – by Elisabetta Cocciaretto in just 58 minutes.Pegula praised her opponent: “She played absolutely incredible tennis,” she said, but she too was at a loss to explain her defeat. “Do I think I played the best match ever? No. But I definitely don’t think I was playing bad. I haven’t lost first round of a slam in a very long time, so that sucks.”Elsewhere, the two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova bade farewell to Wimbledon following a 6-3 6-1 loss to the 10th seed Emma Navarro. The 35-year-old wildcard, who returned to the tour in February following the birth of son Petr last summer, intends to retire after this year’s US Open. “I never dreamed of winning Wimbledon and I did it twice so this is something very special,” she told a grateful crowd.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Coco GauffWimbledonTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But while the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami chanted the Frenchman’s name, roaring as he made his way to the halfway line, and stood to hand him an ovation when he entered the fray, the excitement overflowing, it was the kid heading in the other direction for whom Rita Hayworth is family but most of them had not heard of a month ago, who had taken Real Madrid into the quarter-final.For all the focus on the most famous names, for all that this month, this experimental event, needs them, every tournament has its revelation: this World Cup has a 21-year-oldmadrileño. “I knew this competition was the opportunity of my life,” Gonzalo García said after he again showed that it is one he is determined, and equipped, to take hold of. TheReal Madridacademy striker, who had never started a game before arriving in the United States, scored his third goal here with a superb thumping header from a delicious Trent Alexander-Arnold delivery, doing what no one else could over 90 minutes here: beating the Juventus goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio.Football Daily | Al-Hilal and the trouble with underdog stories at the Club World CupRead moreA family of rugby players, bullfighters, and perhaps the most famous actor there ever was – García’s grandfather was Heyworth’s cousin – has a footballer too, and he looks like being some player. Good enough, says the Spain Under-17s coach, Hernán Pérez, to be Madrid’s striker for a decade to come. With the permission of Mbappé, of course. Xabi Alonso likes him, that’s for sure, even if he admitted that he never expected three goals from him, and García has been superb stateside. On a wet but mercifully lightning-free afternoon in Miami where a Madrid team that are progressing well kept hitting a wall, he was decisive once more, setting up a meeting with Borussia Dortmund – hi Jude, hi Jobe – or Monterrey – hi, Sergio Ramos – in the next round.In the end, Madrid deserved it, far the better side, Alonso praising his team’s ability to understand “when to speed up, when to slow down, how to control the game”. That said, it did take a while to gain control and the early moments of illumination came mostly from another kid, Juventus’s Kenan Yildiz, who combined often with Andrea Cambiaso and Randal Kolo Muani. The 20-year-old – left footed, small, socks half down, backside low – has been described by Kolo Muani as “magic” and there were moments he left his mark here.View image in fullscreenGonzalo García heads in Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross for the winner.Photograph: Marta Lavandier/APHe played a key part in what might have been the opener after six minutes, combining with Kolo Muani on a move that began way back by the Juventus penalty area and reached Madrid’s. There, alone before ThibautCourtois, Kolo Muani scooped over him but fractionally over the bar too. Next a neat turn saw Yildiz’s shot deflected wide, there was the time he slipped the ball between Alexander-Arnold’s legs, and smart footwork later took him away from the former Liverpool defender and Antonio Rüdiger for Cambiaso to cross. From another Cambiaso delivery, Francisco Conceição headed Juve’s second chance at Courtois.Madrid, playing with three central defenders, had control if not a huge amount of incision in those early phases. As the half went on though, openings appeared and increasingly often. In the middle of it all, Fede Valverde, as ever, was everywhere firing off shots. By the time he was withdrawn, exhausted, to applause in the 89th minute, the Uruguayan had racked up seven. “He makes life easier,” Alonso said.From one of them in the first half, Di Gregorio dived full length to save and the keeper would have a busy afternoon, sticking out a leg when Valverde got deep into the area and pulled back soon after. Next Arda Guler, growing into this in the playmaker role that looks increasingly like becoming his permanent place, lifted over his marker and almost got the ball across. Just before the break, Alexander-Arnold did, but his delivery raced right though the six-yard box.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And although Antonio Rüdiger and Courtois kicked each other as they swiped at a clearance, Alonso’s side got on top, soon dominating entirely. Trent fired over, Manuel Locatelli blocked Vinícius Júnior, and Bellingham and Dean Huijsen drew saves from Di Gregorio. Then the goal came, Alexander-Arnold’s lovely soft-shoed cross meeting García’s leap. Turning his neck, he thudded past Di Gregorio who could not fling up his arms fast enough.Madrid kept coming but the Italian pushed away Valverde’s overhead kick and stuck out a leg to stop Guler’s shot after Vinícius and Mbappé had opened up Juventus. When he reached Aurélien Tchouaméni’s late low drive, it took him into double figures but there was no reward. The one time he was beaten was enough, Madrid’s revelation there again.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Real MadridJuventusClub World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was here where Flintoff wrote his name into Ashes folklore, igniting the afterburners for England’s statement first innings, rescuing the second with a six-laden counterattack, and thensending down a famous overon the third evening that vaporised Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting.As well as driving England to that famous two-run victory, 141 runs and seven wickets across the four days made it Flintoff’s statistical peak as a fast-bowling all-rounder – the only time he went north of 100 runs and five wickets in the same Test. People often underestimate the physical and mental demands that the dual role places on those hardy enough to even attempt it; expecting both facets of their game to deliver consistently is unrealistic save for a handful of freakish greats.India keep England guessing over Jasprit Bumrah before second TestRead moreAll of which is a segue into where Ben Stokes finds himself before this second instalment against India, albeit 1-0 up and buoyed bylast week’s Headingley heist. With everything crossed and wood being touched, the hamstring surgery at the start of the year can be deemed a success. This summer – albeit across a small sample size of two Tests – the 34-year-old has been England’s most potent bowler. His pace is up, good movement has been extracted from a couple of flat surfaces, and taking eight wickets at 20 apiece has made for an invaluable return from a fourth seamer.Stokes is now two wickets away from overtaking Flintoff’s 219 in Test cricket, after which only Ian Botham’s tally of 383 sits higher among English all-rounders. And while Stokes has taken a bit longer to get here – 112 caps won compared with Flintoff’s 78 – he has long since scorched past him with the bat, 13 hundreds to the Lancastrian’s five, 6,781 Test runs to his 3,845. Add dynamism in the field – Flintoff’s bucket hands at slip notwithstanding – plus his aptitude as captain and it is fair to say Stokes has gone past the all-rounder he says he looked up to as a kid.But while the bowler of old has seemingly been restored of late, Stokes the batter has been light on impact for a little while now. The 155 that he ransacked on thatfebrile final day at Lord’sduring the 2023 Ashes – an innings powered in part by indignation over the controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow by Alex Carey – is his most recent Test century. A run of 31 innings in the two years since has just become the longest three-figure drought of his England career.View image in fullscreenAndrew Flintoff celebrating dismissing Ricky Ponting for a duck at Edgbaston in 2005.Photograph: Rui Vieira/PANone of which is to question Stokes’ centrality to a team that live and breathe his every word – not least given the earlier point about sustaining all-round returns, though it is fair to say he’s due a score. It may simply be that Stokes has instinctively moved to bolster the area where the team need him most. The bowling attack has suffered a significant drop-off in experience since theretirements of Jimmy Andersonand Stuart Broad, hard-working though it is, whereas the top seven are beginning truly to blossom around the enduring, unflappable class of Joe Root.Quick GuideEngland v India second Test lineupsShowEdgbaston, 2-6 JulyEngland (confirmed)Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue, Shoaib BashirIndia (possible)Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Rishabh Pant (wk), Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The mystery of whether they will face Jasprit Bumrah in this second Test felt no closer to being solved a day out from the toss, with the captain, Shubman Gill, the latest from the India camp to grapple with the mental gymnastics of his prized asset’s predetermined workload. At 1-0 down and after a week’s break, it feels like a no-brainer for India, but the decision will apparently be made as late as possible. Save for a couple of dismissals that left his jaw on the ground, Stokes has an excellent head-to-head record against Bumrah, averaging 58.5 from 11 Test encounters. On a personal level, he should be relaxed either way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Against Kuldeep Yadav he averages just six runs for his three dismissals and that battle may be about to resume. On a dry surface that is expected to produce runs, the left-arm wrist-spinner would ask fresh questions of England as a whole, even if Washington Sundar’s greater prowess with the bat may yet mean he gets the nod.View image in fullscreenShubman Gill may be without his prized fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah at EdgbastonPhotograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersOne thing that can be guaranteed is that Edgbaston and Birmingham’s Manhattan-esque skyline will deliver a mighty backdrop for the match, the ground sold out for the first four days and the Hollies Stand no doubt set to be in full voice. A week on from folks leaving Headingley slightly baffled by the ground’s exclusion from the 2027 Ashes, it is worth noting that Edgbaston will be frozen out four years later.

While immersion in adelirious 87,000 Wembleycrowd at the final three years ago sparked some regrets that Switzerland cannot offer a similar theatre, one of the organisers’ priorities was to avoid the oscillations seen back then.This time there will be no attendance higher than the 35,689 able to fill St Jakob-Park, the Basel venue whose assignments include the final and Switzerland’s opening game against Norway on Wednesday, but nor should there be any analogue of the 3,859 who watched Belgium draw with Iceland at Manchester City’s Academy Stadium. It is unlikely any grounds will be less than one third full, as St Mary’s was when Northern Ireland faced Austria and Norway. The idea goes that this will be an event less given to sweeping statements, instead oozing sustainability and speaking confidently on its own terms of the standards on display.View image in fullscreenSwitzerland head coach Pia Sundhage brings a wealth of experience.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/APIf there are fewer extremes felt in the stands, those seeking different barometers of progress will expect similar from the matches. Thrashings help nobody. Uefa insiders are particularly keen to see evidence of the tighter competitive balance they believe has been facilitated by increased investment and a successful Nations League, so there is particular interest in how the newcomersWalesandPolandfare among what is otherwise a familiar lineup.Should they, as a minimum, keep scorelines respectable in fiendish groups, it will be tempting to wonder how those who fell just short might have fared. Can women’s football make a convincing claim to follow the men in expanding to a 24-team tournament? The surfeit of regular qualifiers is a valid criticism but Uefa requires confidence that others are ready to step up. Its “Unstoppable” strategy, which has catalysed investment across the continent, launched last year and now federations must do their bit. As one seasoned figure in the sport puts it: if Portugal can replicate their over-productivity in the men’s game with a competitive women’s programme, then what is stopping Croatia?These may be macro questions when the action is so close, but the sense of an inflection point is inescapable. Lise Klaveness, the Norwegian football federation’s president, put it well last month when emphasising the need “not to let the head move away from the body”. In other words, a top stratum that now regularly produces scintillating spectacles must not leave everyone else for dead. A €41m (£35.2m) prize pot, far removed from the €16m on offer in 2022, speaks well of the authorities’ intentions and is testament to those voices who have lobbied hard for greater spoils; so does a doubling of the pot available to compensate clubs for releasing their players. The difficulty may lie in ensuring that money does not widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.It is a valid concern, especially in an era when external parties are happy to test the game’s fabric by ploughing millions into events such as the World Sevens tournament that debuted in May. Euro 2025 is essentially a loss leader for Uefa, which projects a net €20m-25m deficit. That cannot hold for ever and some figures question whether maximum value is being extracted from a sport whose investment potential appears nowhere near exhausted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She will be assessed over the next 48 hours to determine the extent of the injury.At Bristol it was a case of deja vu as England once again inserted India, conceded far too many runs for comfort, and failed to get within touching distance of their target after a tumble of early wickets.England v India: second women’s T20 cricket international – liveRead moreTammy Beaumont’s first T20i half-century since September 2021 brought a glimmer of hope to the chase, but she was run out by the bowler Radha Yadav in the 12th over and England were left with too much to do at the death, despite a late flurry of boundaries from Sophie Ecclestone who was run out for 35 off the final ball of the innings.Beaumont described her contribution as “bittersweet”. “I’m doing a new role, with Heather [Knight] out injured,” she said. “I’m loving having to think differently about batting in T20 cricket again. But for me it’s never as satisfying when we’re on the losing side.”Up top, Danni Wyatt-Hodge avoided the ignominy of a fourth successive duck thanks to a tickle off an inside-edge, but then plonked her next ball into the hands of mid-off, doing nothing to dispel the question marks hanging over her current place at the top of the order.The India captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, returning to the fray after missing the first T20 with a head injury, then held on to a fantastic catch running round from mid-on to see off Sciver-Brunt, leaving England three down in the first four overs.Earlier, the absence of Sciver-Brunt from the field meant the stand-in skipper, Sophia Dunkley, was tasked with the official responsibility of rotating the English bowlers and somehow stemming the Indian flow – although in practice, it appeared to be mostly Ecclestone who took charge.Despite the loss of three Indian wickets in the powerplay – including Saturday’s centurion Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet herself – India rampaged their way to 181 for four.View image in fullscreenIndia’s Jemimah Rodrigues on her way to a fine half century in Bristol.Photograph: Nigel French/PAThe huge acceleration between overs eight and 20 came courtesy of half-centuries from Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur. For the 25-year-old Amanjot, who scythed the English spinners with ease, this was a proud moment: her first 50 for her country.“It is the first of many,” Amanjot said. “I want to do it more for India. This is the new Indian team. Wherever we go, home or away, we are ready to dominate.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Richa Ghosh then flailed her way to 32 from 20 balls, helped by a let-off on 12 by Beaumont, who somehow stumbled at square leg and let the ball slip through her cupped hands.Earlier, after a rogue opening over from Alice Capsey which went for 11 runs courtesy of two beautiful cuts for four by Mandhana, England’s three quicks had dominated the powerplay, taking a wicket apiece.Shafali Verma departed after fending off a Filer bouncer, before Bell and Emily Arlott held on to catches at mid-on and short fine leg which were tougher than severalEngland put down on Saturday.“Compared to the last game, there were certainly signs of fight from the team. At times, we were really in the game,” Beaumont said. “It might take a little bit of time, but we know we’re putting the work in behind the scenes.

I don’t see any other places, to be honest.“In the past the relationship with the Silverstone promoters has been intense and they know that. Our approach is to find the best situation. I don’t see Silverstone not being able, if they want, to do what others have already done. We’ve done already last year a big step, never done before.”The meeting on Wednesday, to celebrate F1’s 75th anniversary, will include senior figures from F1, including drivers and team principals as well as apprentices and members of the all-female F1 Academy. It is hoped to be part of a developing relationship with the government to work better with the sport, notably in areas including infrastructure and over the effects of Brexit on F1, with seven of the 10 teams based in the UK.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton celebrates winning the 2024 British Grand Prix.

I’m saying that because I think that it’s relevant to keep the possibility for people to be attracted to work here.

The winners of the Saudi King’s Cup will receive just over £1m. Prize money for theSaudi Pro Leagueis not disclosed, but by the most recent available figures (for 2022-23) is in roughly the same area. Weekly attendances at the King Saud University Stadium, where top-tier ticket prices start at about £12, range between 10,000 and 25,000, although of course you also have to factor in pie and programme sales above that.And so you really have to applaud Al-Nassr’s ambition in handing an estimated £492m to Cristiano Ronaldoover the next two years. Even if they sweep the board at domestic level, if they fight their way past Istiklol of Tajikistan’s 1xBet Higher League and Al-Wehdat of the Jordanian Pro League, if they extract maximum value from merch and sponsorships, you still struggle to see how they can cover a basic salary that comes to £488,000 a day, even before the bonuses and blandishments that will push the total package well beyond that.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo celebrates scoring for Al-Nassr against Al-Wehda in May.Photograph: ReutersAccording to reports, the deal also involves Ronaldo taking a 15% ownership stake inAl-Nassr, extra incentives for winning the Pro League or the Golden Boot, a private jet allowance, 16 full-time staff including two chefs and three gardeners, and a bonus for every time he successfully presses an opposition player. Last one was a joke, obvs. And amid the stultifying assault of numbers, Ronaldo’s new contract – announced to great fanfare last week – marks a significant shift in the evolution of the superstar athlete, a further blurring of the lines between what we used to call “sport” and what we used to call “the other stuff”.The first question to put: what exactly is Saudi Arabia getting for its money? Because of course Al-Nassr are a majority fund-owned club, an arm of the Saudi state, which is funnelling untold riches into its domestic league free from the encumbrance of cost controls or financial fair play rules. Ronaldo himself is in effect a Saudi employee, albeit one who has enjoyed much better fortune then most migrant workers who have entered the country in recent years.'I belong to Saudi Arabia,' Ronaldo stated proudly on announcing his new contract last weekOn the pitch, Ronaldo’s influence has been highly visible: 99 goals in 111 games under four coaches. Give him a half chance in a tight space and even at the age of 40, there are still few players you would back over him. At the same time Al-Nassr have won no major trophies since his arrival and the club’s two other big attacking talents, Jhon Durán and Sadio Mané, have found themselves overshadowed to such an extent that both may leave this summer. Let’s charitably describe this one as: jury out.In recent months there was talk of Ronaldo getting a short-term deal to play in the Club World Cup, a competition that would seem perfect for him: based entirely around celebrity power, influencer fame and a distinct lack of running. Politically and commercially, there was literally no reason for this not to happen. And so we can conclude that whilemany clubs were interestedin his star wattage, none were prepared to pay the going rate to remould their entire system around a 40-year-old striker who lost his last half-yard of pace in about 2017.But of course these days what Ronaldo can do on a football pitch is but a fraction of his total appeal. In an age when power itself is being reimagined along the lines of social media clout, when the attention economy and the actual economy are rapidly converging into one and the same thing, the fact Ronaldo is the most followed person on Instagram – and the third-most followed on X behind Elon Musk and Barack Obama – matters. In a way Ronaldo’s fame renders him a kind of one-man city state, an influencer first and an athlete second, his goals and assists entirely tangential to the eyeballs he can garner in the process.What we have, in essence, is the professional athlete reimagined as a kind of plutocratic demigod, able to construct entire new realities around themselves. One in which the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia will be “the most beautiful ever”, or where the Saudi Pro League is “one of the top five leagues in the world”, as he recently put it. “It’s highly competitive, and those who don’t know that simply haven’t played here.” Fundamentally, this is not true on any measure:Opta ranks the Saudi Pro Leagueas the world’s 29th best. And of course by his own criteria, Ronaldo would have had to play in all the others in order to make a reasoned assessment. But when you have 659 million Instagram followers, perhaps whatever you say becomes true simply by saying it.Which is not to say the football is an irrelevance. Football is clearly still inherent to Ronaldo’s self-image, albeit these days more as an adjunct to his power than as the source of it. Ronaldo still plays football in the same way that Donald Trump plays golf: as part of a broader cult of personality, something to get photographed doing, content for the feed. A branding exercise stripped entirely of context or objective judgment, complete with massaged numbers and a coterie of obedient applauding acolytes. As is the continuing fixation on his physique, the positioning of Ronaldo as a kind ofÜbermensch, a transcendent individual, a higher form of biology, albeit one that still possesses an unerring ability to put free-kicks straight into the wall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What they’re buying is Ronaldo the spiritual leader, the attention machine, the aura, the abdominals, the soft-power influence. They’re buying a place on his grid, the opportunity to allow one of the world’s most famous men to do their bidding. Perhaps it helps to think of his new contract as a kind of trade deal, a strategic alliance between two cynical regimes drunk on their own power and with largely congruent social views.View image in fullscreenA billboard welcomes Cristiano Ronaldo to Saudi Arabia after he joined Al-Nassr at the end of December 2022.Photograph: Amr Nabil/AP“I belong to Saudi Arabia,” Ronaldo stated proudly on announcing his new contract last week. And of course many star athletes in many sports have succumbed to the lure of the Saudi riyal, and will continue to do so. But there is a tonal difference between taking the money of a rogue state and actively advocating for them on the broadest possible stage. For years we have spoken of Saudi investment as a kind of moral dilemma, a fine balance of pecuniary motives, reputational concerns and human rights. For Ronaldo, it is clear that no such dilemma exists.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Some definitive selection calls will soon have to be made and this week’s games, against the Queensland Reds in Brisbane on Wednesday and the New South Wales Waratahs in Sydney on Saturday, will be pivotal for certain individuals. The Breakdown takes a look at the five main areas of debate.Front rowDan Sheehan, as expected, has emerged as the Lions’ Test hooker in waiting. The moment he was asked to leadthe side in Perth, taking over from the tour captain, Maro Itoje, it was a sure indicator of how highly Andy Farrell rates him. Ronan Kelleher and Luke Cowan-Dickie are probably contesting the bench spot; some consistent lineout darts from the former against the Reds on Saturday could go a long way towards securing it.At loosehead prop, this is also a big game for Andrew Porter if he intends to start ahead of Ellis Genge. The latter was in rip-snorting modeagainst Argentinaand the Lions need powerful, unapologetic ball-carriers. Which leaves tighthead, still an area with a slight question hovering over it from Farrell’s perspective. Everyone knows how good Tadhg Furlong can be; the question is whether the big man can now replicate his past heroics. Finlay Bealham, only on the tour because of Zander Fagerson’s injury, took his chance against the Pumas but a commanding display by Will Stuart this week could yet help the Englishman book himself a starting role in the first Test back in Brisbane on 19 July.Second rowThe lock conversation is fascinating. Itoje, as captain, is the first name on the Lions team-sheet but big Joe McCarthy had such a high-class game in Perth that it will be tough to leave him out of the first Test, particularly with the Wallabies primed to come hard early on. Some people thrive in the rarefied air of a Lions tours and the 24-year-old McCarthy – right down to his Aussie-style mullet – is relishing the opportunity.But if Itoje and McCarthy end up starting, that would probably require the Lions to consider a third lineout option at No 6, almost certainly Tadhg Beirne. There is just one snag. Beirne, by his absurdly high standards, has yet to show the absolute best of himself in his two games. Does Farrell back him to come good or slide him back into the second row at the in-form McCarthy’s expense?View image in fullscreenTadhg Beirne is tackled during the Lions game against Western Force.Photograph: Richard Wainwright/AAPThe door remains fractionally open, consequently, for the combative Ollie Chessum if he has a barnstormer alongside Itoje against the Reds. Should Farrell opt for a 6-2 bench – and even if he doesn’t – Chessum could easily be in the Test squad conversation.Back rowThe blindside conundrum is further complicated by the presence of Tom Curry, the sort of relentless operator every coach loves to have. The Wallabies will have big Rob Valetini in that position and the Lions cannot afford to let him roam free. Should Beirne start at 6, though, that means deploying Curry either at 7 or 8 or else on the bench. Finding a slot at openside will be tricky given Josh van der Flier’s timely return to form; the Irishman is experienced, reliable and showed up well in Perth.Then there is Henry Pollock: the reason Farrell likes the 20-year-old is that he brings pace and dynamism few others possess. The Reds game is massive, accordingly, for Jack Conan, who was probably the narrow frontrunner for the No 8 shirt (in the absence of Caelan Doris) when the squad was unveiled.Ben Earl has had limited opportunity to show the form that has made him an England regular. The most compelling option of the lot? What a shame Jack Willis – brilliant again for Toulouse in the Top 14 final – is not here.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The full-back has impressed on tour.Photograph: Richard Wainwright/AAPMidfieldThe Test half-back pairing, barring injuries, is set to be Jamison Gibson-Park and Finn Russell, but the combination that will start outside them is less certain. On paper, Sione Tuipulotu would be the perfect foil for Russell at 12, but the Glasgow Warrior has not played much this year. Farrell has also mixed and matched, declining to use the all-Irish duo of Bundee Aki and Gary Ringrose or the Scottish combo of Tuipulotu and Huw Jones for the moment.The selection to watch, as a result, will be the side to face the Waratahs on Saturday; Farrell may well be tempted to trial his optimal backline against the Brumbies in Canberra the following Wednesday. If Aki and Ringrose are picked it could be good news for “Huwipulotu” as the regular Scottish partnership has become known.Back threeSimilarly it is easy to imagine Farrell being tempted to plump for two Ireland wingers who are used to dovetailing in a green jersey. James Lowe is such a smart footballer and helped to create a couple of stunning tries in Perth. Mack Hansen is a different type of player but his kick-chase ability and energy also make him an awkward opponent. Unless this week changes the narrative completely. Maybe the powerful Duhan van der Merwe will take the Reds to the cleaners? Perhaps Tommy Freeman will remind everyone of his aerial ability, a vital area against the Wallabies? Then there is the battle at full-back. Blair Kinghorn, last seen celebrating in his Toulouse budgie smugglers,has finally arrivedand will almost certainly feature against the Waratahs. In his absence, Elliot Daly has not put a foot wrong and Hugo Keenan has plenty of credit in the Bank of Farrell. A Test back-three of Kinghorn, Lowe and Hansen – with Daly on the bench – would not be a surprise but nothing is set in stone.This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Five years later, she moved to St Petersburg. The scandal revealed a dark truth about the ties between Vienna and MoscowByAmanda CoakleyTue 1 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 04.55 EDTShareThe trouble started with a dead cat. For years, the people of Seibersdorf had lived amicably alongside their most famous resident, more or less. True, there had been an incident when a neighbour complained about the smell of her horses. And yes, there had been rumblings about her lack of community spirit, that she was great at giving orders for neighbourhood events but never pitched in to fry a schnitzel or hang bunting. But for the most part, they got along.Karin Kneissl was a blow-in from Vienna, an hour north. She had lived in Seibersdorf for more than two decades, moving into a rickety old apartment before buying a house near the central square. She had arrived as a junior diplomat, then became a freelance journalist and later began lecturing on international relations at some of Austria’s most prestigious institutions. For a brief period, she also sat on the town’s parish council.Then, in 2017, Kneissl becameAustria’s foreign minister. It was a sudden appointment and it surprised everyone in town. But when the residents stopped to think about it, it made a certain amount of sense. Kneissl was a true eccentric, the kind of person who was always doing and saying unexpected things. You never quite knew where she would go next, so why not the Austrian foreign ministry?The cat incident took place just before Kneissl entered office, or at least that’s what Franz Püreschitz, the town’s deputy mayor, remembers. One day, seemingly out of the blue, Kneissl claimed that someone in the town had intentionally killed her beloved cat and, worse, left the poor creature’s remains outside her front door. This, Kneissl said, was evidence that all the townspeople had turned against her. Everyone knew about her love of animals. She had chickens, dogs, cats and a small stable of ponies. Nothing appeared to make her happier than spending time with them. Now one of them had been targeted, she said.Kneissl never spelled out her suspicions about the killer’s motive, but Püreschitz assumed she might have thought it was due to her recent association with the far-right Freedom party. If that was her thinking, it didn’t make much sense: many in Seibersdorf voted for Austria’s conservative and far-right parties. There was no conspiracy against her, said Püreschitz. “It was clearly an accident; we’re not cat killers,” he told me as we stood outside Kneissl’s old front door last year, an expression of disbelief on his face.Kneissl is not someone Püreschitz, or many other people in the town, relish being connected with. These days, she is best known for havinginvited Vladimir Putinto her wedding in 2018, where she proceeded to dance a waltz with him. Up to that point, during her year or so as foreign minister, Kneissl had been widely viewed as a rather marginal figure, given little power by the chancellor. Now, having been captured on cameradancing with an authoritarian leader, she was an international embarrassment.By the middle of the following year, she had left office, and soon after that, she moved to France, then to Lebanon, before finallysettling in Russia, where she now heads up the Geopolitical Observatory for Russia Key Issues (Gorki) at St Petersburg University. She regularly appears on Russian state media, where she has declared that the EU is suffering from “the collapse of all rule of law” and, recently, that Russia haswon the warin Ukraine. She is an admirer of Putin, who she described in a2023 interviewwith the BBC as “the most intelligent gentleman, with the focus on gentleman – and I’ve met a few”.View image in fullscreenThe Austrian market town of Seibersdorf, where Kneissl lived for more than two decades.Photograph: volkerpreusser/AlamyOne reason that Kneissl’s story is so embarrassing for Austria is that it draws attention to the country’s long-term, highly lucrative relationship with Russia – which, even three years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine,remains closerthan many outsiders might expect. The Alpine nation of 9 million, whose constitution commits it to neutrality in international affairs, likes to see itself as a mediator between east and west. To critics, this is an excuse for pursuing its own self-interest. “They do not understand why they should change anything, because everything works perfectly for them,” said Anton Shekhovtsov, director of the Centre for Democratic Integrity in Austria, which monitors the influence of authoritarian countries. “They are waiting for the war to end to go back to business as usual with the Russians.” While Austria has backed the EU’s sanctions, Russia remains itssecond largest supplierof foreign direct investment, according to data from 2024. Austrian enterprises, such as Raiffeisen Bank International, have only recently begun to reduce their operations in Russia, lagging behind competitors such as the UK’s HSBC and France’s Société Générale, who swiftly exited the Russian market in response to the invasion.Still, Kneissl’s move toRussiawas not inevitable, and seems to have as much to do with the peculiarities of her own character as it does with any deep ideological alignment with the Kremlin. Throughout her career, Kneissl has seen herself as a misunderstood, underappreciated figure who has been persecuted for her independence of mind. In Russia, she has found the respect that she seems to have long felt she is owed.A former friend of Kneissl’s told me that they still think of her with some sympathy, remembering the ambitious person she once was when they joined the foreign ministry together in 1990. “She seems a very sad person, someone not happy with how life has gone,” they told me. “She wanted to be a brilliant person who everyone likes, to be invited to give lectures at important universities. I don’t think she wanted to be an outcast.”When I approached sources in Austria and beyond for this story, most responded begrudgingly. “She makes us a laughing stock,” a former friend and foreign policy expert said. But when people got into the flow of conversation they often got swept up in their memories. Kneissl’s supreme confidence, her extraordinary belief in her own abilities and her inability to be embarrassed by her own behaviour still managed to take people’s breath away. (Kneissl declined to be interviewed for this article.)When she first set foot in the Austrian foreign ministry in March 1990 as a junior diplomat, Kneissl had grand ambitions. The daughter of a pilot, she had spent a part of her early childhood in Jordan, where her father flew for King Hussein. Back in Austria, she yearned for a future to be old enough to return to the region.These childhood years were not always easy for Kneissl, but she found solace in her love of animals. Not long ago, shespoke movinglyabout her childhood connection with a boxer dog that her father brought home. “I was the one who took care of the dog and the dog took care of me,” she said. “Because when I was 10, 11, 12, honestly, I wouldn’t have made it without this best friend. Whenever there was a problem at school I talked to him, and I knew he would not betray me.”Kneissl went on to study law and Arabic at the University of Vienna. In her book My Middle East, which was published in 2014, Kneissl wrote that she learned Arabic to understand Lebanon and “why there was a fire in the Middle East”. She wrote that her studies were so intense that people, it wasn’t specified who, told her that she was “much more Lebanese than the Lebanese themselves”. She went on to do a PhD on borders in the Middle East. Her thesis supervisor, Hanspeter Neuhold, remembered her as hardworking and intelligent, as well as somewhat intransigent. When he suggested changes to her work, he told me, “it was not a foregone conclusion that she would do it”.This unwavering self-belief also struck colleagues in the Foreign Office. Kneissl believed Austria could play a bigger role in brokering peace in the Middle East. Her understanding of regional politics, along with her knowledge of Arabic – how well Kneissl can actually speak the language is contested – quickly led to her being promoted to working on Middle East briefs. Although some colleagues found Kneissl self-important, others warmed to her. “She was interesting, well-travelled, funny and, like all of us young people in there, a bit odd,” another former friend who remains in the ministry told me. The former head of the department for the Middle East and Africa, and former ambassador, Alexander Christiani, was impressed by Kneissl’s intellect, and championed her as she quickly moved up to work with the then foreign minister.Yet this rapid rise through the ranks of the ministry was not enough for Kneissl. In 1998, she decided to leave the ministry. Walter Gehr, a more seasoned diplomat who would go on to become Kneissl’s chief of staff, said she was “frustrated with the low intellectual level of her work” and “uneasy with all the men around her bossing her around”.For the next few years, she guest lectured at some of Austria’s key academic institutes on Middle Eastern affairs and wrote commentary for Die Presse, an Austrian daily, though she parted with the paper after editors made corrections to her copy. The quality of her insights was sometimes questionable, but her critical take on the region – focusing on the dangers of political Islam – fitted easily into the conservative politics of the country. In 2007, she published a book, The Spiral of Violence: Why the Orient and the Occident Cannot Get Along, but it did not sell well. During these years, she struggled with money and had to borrow from friends.Kneissl’s fortunes changed in 2012, with the publication of her book Testosterone Makes Politics. The book argued that a “deep sexual frustration” in Arab men was one of the drivers of the Arab spring, the wave of protests that had challenged many autocratic regimes across the region. The book was not well received by former colleagues and angered some scholars. “Within the small group of Austrian Middle East experts, Kneissl was never taken that seriously,” said Thomas Schmidinger, a political scientist and anthropologist at the University of Vienna. “She explained everything through culture and religion, and in a very simplified way.” But, he said, this is what made her ideas popular. The book generated media attention, including abroad. In aninterview with Time magazine, Kneissl explained: “When it comes to international relations, the biological – or, when we talk about hormones, the biochemical – has so far been a little bit underestimated.”Kneissl’s next book, her 2014 memoir, did not assuage critics who believed her views of the Middle East were reductive. In the book, her commentary can be sweeping and her attitude towards the people she met on her travels is sometimes more reminiscent of a colonial-era adventurer than a modern scholar. Yet in 2015, when millions of people fleeing war and persecution arrived on Europe’s doorstep, and migration from the Middle East became a burning issue in Austrian politics, Kneissl became an increasingly prominent voice. She appeared regularly on the Austrian national public broadcaster, ORF, and became known for her criticisms of Angela Merkel’s decision to allow more than a million asylum seekers into Germany. For TV producers, who were expected to represent both sides of every issue, Kneissl was an ideal choice of pundit. Georg Renner, a former politics reporter in Vienna who interviewed Kneissl on a few occasions, put it this way: “Everybody knew her ideological bias, so you could quite nicely work with her.”It was around 2006 that Kneissl was introduced to Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the far-right Freedom party, by one of her former students, Johann Gudenus, who would go on to be the deputy leader of the party. Strache and Kneissl got along well and Kneissl began to speak at events alongside Freedom party members, always being sure to stress that she was an independent analyst and not a party member.Although the Freedom party has played a major role in Austrian politics since the 1980s and has formed part of coalition governments, it’s not hard to see why Kneissl would have wanted to distance herself from it. Founded in 1956, it began life as a political home for former Nazis, in a country notorious for its failure to reckon with its dark past. (“As late as 1990,” noted Tony Judt in his history of postwar Europe, “43% of Austrians thought Nazism ‘had good and bad sides’”.) The party’s leader from 1986 to 2000, Jörg Haider, was the child of two devoted national socialists and was notorious for statements that seemed to trivialise the crimes of the Nazis.From 2005, under Strache’s leadership, the Freedom party attempted to distance itself from its reputation for antisemitism – though it continued to belinked with antisemitic organisations– while campaigning on a similar set of issues to other far-right parties across Europe, attacking immigration, Islam and the EU. And like many European far-right leaders, Strache cultivated warm relations with Moscow. In 2016, he travelled to the Russian capital to sign a “cooperation pact” with the ruling party, United Russia. On that trip, Strache called for an end to international sanctions that had been imposed after Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.In the general election of 2017, Strache led the Freedom party to its second-best ever performance, winning 26% of the vote. However, the headlines that night were stolen bySebastian Kurz, the wonderkid with slicked-back hair who, at the age of 31, led the conservative People’s party to victory. The two parties agreed to form a coalition government, with Kurz as chancellor and Strache as vice-chancellor.Strache’s party would control several key portfolios, including the foreign ministry. His first choice for the top job was Kneissl. “She was not surprised by the offer but not 100% sure whether to accept it,” a close confidant of Kneissl’s at the time told me. Kneissl was uneasy with the more extremist side of the Freedom party, they said. In the end, they said, she took the job to leave her mark on Austrian foreign policy. (“Of course she took it, it was the first regular paycheck she had received in years,” claimed another former colleague.)In office, Kneissl did things differently. She sent round a memo declaring that the foreign ministry was now a pet-friendly zone, and her two slobbering boxer dogs often accompanied her to work. She would roam around the ministry chatting to everyone from interns to middle management. “She would get involved in parts of the bureaucratic process that a minister would never touch,” a serving diplomat who worked under Kneissl said. “She would get wrapped up in the details of a random memo and elevate it beyond what was necessary.” For some, Kneissl was a breath of fresh air and far more approachable than many of her colleagues. “Initially I was happy to have her back to break up the old boys’ network in the ministry,” an Austrian diplomat told me. Yet she could also be curt and critical towards colleagues. To the diplomat, she seemed different from the “open-minded, liberal” person she had once been. On her return to the ministry, they found her “narrow-minded”, and fixated on career-related grievances.View image in fullscreenKneissl with then-chancellor Sebastian Kurz in Vienna, 9 March 2018.Photograph: Leonhard Föger/ReutersKurz, the new chancellor, had little time for Kneissl. His inner circle knew that if they needed to lobby Washington or Brussels, they didn’t need an intermediary. Kneissl, in turn, resented being sidelined and proceeded to make moves that were likely to infuriate her boss. She threw herself into establishing better ties with Turkey, knowing that Kurz had been publicly critical of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.More than anything, Kneissl wanted to be taken seriously. After a decade of freelance work, short-term contracts and shoddy pay, Kneissl felt she had earned the right to be heard. She was disappointed by what she saw as the lack of intellectual rigour in government, and would often hold up Cabinet meetings by giving long lectures on policy, both domestic and international.Compounding this disappointment was Kneissl’s feeling that her political peers abroad did not respect her. On a diplomatic trip to France, the French foreign minister didn’t receive her. At gatherings in Brussels, she felt that people went out of their way to avoid her. The Americans would bypass her and go directly to Kurz. Gehr remembers these slights hurt Kneissl deeply. “There was no reason to be so unfriendly to her,” he said. “It was a great mistake by western countries.”The only place where Kneissl received the warmth she craved was in the east. On astate visit to Russiain April 2018, she discussed Russia’s involvement in Syria with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, a figure who Gehr said welcomed her with a mixture of kindness and firmness. The trip also included a meeting with Putin, which Kneissl kept hidden from the press corps, who she believed were out to get her.Back then, there was nothing unusual about an Austrian foreign minister meeting Putin. But Kneissl’s approach – sneaking around Moscow, leaving the Austrian ambassador to explain why his foreign minister was missing for a scheduled gala – was not. It seemed that she relished being the star of her own movie. Two months later, when Putin came to Austria on a state visit, Kneissl thrust something into his hands during an event at Vienna’s Museum of Art History. It was an invitation to her wedding.Kneissl’s move was irresponsible and embarrassing, her colleagues agreed, but no one expected the Russian president to actually attend – until, that is, the Russian ambassador came to Kneissl’s house in Seibersdorf to announce that Putin would be accepting the invitation. The timing was particularly awkward. Just a few months earlier, the former Russian spySergei Skripaland his daughter, Yulia, had been poisoned by Russian operatives in the town of Salisbury in England. While Germany, France and Poland hadexpelled Russian diplomatsin response, Austria had attracted criticism for refusing to do the same.The wedding took place on a hot August day in a mountain vineyard in southern Austria. The bride arrived by horse-drawn carriage and wore a traditional ivory dirndl; the groom, Austrian businessman Wolfgang Meilinger, wore a fetching green waistcoat. Putin was given pride of place at the civil ceremony, where he sat at the top table with the happy couple, and gave a toast in German. His wedding gifts included a Cossack choir, who he had flown in for the occasion.During the couple’s first dance, Meilinger handed over his new bride to Putin, who was waiting to receive her. Thepair dancedto a rendition of Engelbert Humperdinck’s The Last Waltz sung by Gehr, who, when he wasn’t Kneissl’s chief of cabinet, moonlighted as a jazz singer. Looking on, Kneissl’s government colleagues nervously spied the Austrian Press Agency photojournalist assigned to the event. “[The dance] was almost OK until the very end, but when she bowed, I was like, we’re completely fucked,” one of Kneissl’s former colleagues told me.Within hours, the photo was out on the news wires. Ukrainian politicians were furious, calling into question whether Austriashould continue to advocateas a neutral actor in peace talks with Russia. The Social Democratic party of Austriadecried the incidentas “likely to cause lasting damage to Austria’s foreign policy position”. Der Standard ranwith the headline: “Kneissl’s kneeling before Putin is a disgrace.”View image in fullscreenKneissl and Putin take part in a wreath laying ceremony at the Soviet second world war memorial in Vienna, Austria, 5 June 2018.Photograph: Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty ImagesKneissl was unapologetic. “Those who know me are very well aware that I’m not submissive to anyone,” shetold the BBC. Not for the first time, she had trouble understanding why others did not see things as she did. The event was private, she said. The bow, the natural course of action a lady takes at the end of a waltz. The €50,000 (£43,000) earrings Putingifted her, a generous token that she should of course be allowed to keep.Less than a year later, Kneissl was out of office, thanks to another scandal over Russian influence in Austria. This time, it concerned the leader of the Freedom party. In 2019, asecret video recordingof Strache was leaked to the press, which showed him sitting in a villa in Ibiza with a woman posing as the niece of a Russian oligarch. (Alongside Strache in the video was Gudenus, the former student of Kneissl, who introduced her to the party leader back in 2006.) In the recording, the woman claimed she was interested in buying Austria’s leading tabloid and using it to boost the Freedom party in the run-up to the country’s next elections. Strache listened receptively and said that, in exchange, he could offer her lucrative public contracts.The story was a major blow to Kurz’s government and Strachequickly resigned. When Kurz sacked the interior minister, who belonged to the Freedom party, to ensure a proper investigation of the scandal, all the government’s Freedom party ministers resigned. Kneissl, though appointed by the Freedom party, reiterated that she was, technically, independent. She briefly clung on, but a month later, a vote of no confidenceended Kurz’s governmentand Kneissl was out of a job.After the government’s collapse, Kneissl retreated into herself. “She became very isolated and increasingly sad,” said Margarete Schorn, one of Kneissl’s neighbours in Seibersdorf, who used to drop over her groceries during this period. Money was a problem. Kneissl’s association with the Freedom party and with Putin hindered her return to the world of teaching and journalism. Her short period in office also didn’t qualify Kneissl for a ministerial pension. By the time Covid hit, she was just about hanging on. She applied for Austria’s Covid hardship fund but received nothing, as her previous earnings were too high.Kneissl’s personal relationships began to fray. She had fallen out with Gehr in 2019 after he allegedly criticised her for being rude to the ministry drivers who ferried her to and from Seibersdorf every day. Her relationship with her husband had also broken down. According to media reports,Kneissl accused himof domestic violence, which he denied.Kneissl saw her misfortunes as the result of some faceless vendetta against her. In 2020, she left Austria for good, settling in Nîmes in southern France, before moving on again to Lebanon, where she got by with odd bits of lecturing. Eugene Richard Sensenig, an academic and friend of Kneissl’s, recalled her having a group of friends in Lebanon who admired her. However, she was preoccupied, returning often to the way she felt she had been ill treated. Sensenig felt for her. “Women who work hard and want to move up are called bitches, and men are called ambitious – and in her generation she was definitely considered a bitch,” he said. He noted that Kneissl seemed to be held to different standards in other ways: she had been ostracised for her decision to associate with the Freedom party, yet the centre-right People’s party, which continues to be considered part of the respectable mainstream, not only echoes the far right’s rhetoric on immigration and Islam, it has also has twice included it in governing coalitions.The year she left Austria, Kneissl began to write opinion columns for the state media outlet Russia Today, covering the Middle East, energy and international relations. A year later she was appointed to alucrative positionon the board of the Russian oil giant Rosneft. (There she joined another notable political figure on the board: the former German chancellorGerhard Schröder.) In 2022, when Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kneissl refused to step down from the Rosneft board, until she waslegally obliged to do sowhen Russia blocked EU citizens from holding executive or board positions.Her loyalty to Russia was soon rewarded. In 2023, she boarded a plane for St Petersburg after accepting an invitation to head up Gorki. Her new hosts even took the trouble todivert a military planefrom Syria to Lebanon to transport Kneissl’s ponies to Russia.Kneissl is far from the first Austrian politician to maintain a friendly relationship with Putin’s Russia, even after the annexation of Crimea. Asone writer quipped, “Austria has not one Gerhard Schröder but many.” The former Austrian chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel sat on the board of Russian energy giant Lukoil. Another former chancellor, Christian Kern, sat on the board of directors of Russian Railways. However, both Schüssel and Kern stepped down from their positions after the invasion of Ukraine. Kneissl, on the other hand, moved to Russia the following year.It’s easy to see Russia’s appeal to Kneissl: it offers a level of security and prestige she couldn’t find elsewhere. It’s harder to see what’s in it for Russia. “Many European politicians who become part of Russian structures bring with them a network of friendships or influence, but Kneissl was a nobody when she left office,” Shekhovtsov told me. “My hypothesis is that by supporting Kneissl the Russians sent a message to other European officials: even if you’re not very useful at home, there could be a place for you here.”View image in fullscreenOne of Kneissl’s new roles is as ambassador for the conservation of Siberian tigers.Photograph: Vladimir  Medvedev/WWFIn Russia, Kneissl has found a place for herself. In June 2024, shetold a state news agencythat the west had plans to break up Russia, “just as the Federation of Yugoslavia was divided”. While the statement was hardly noticed in Europe, in Russia, this was presented as a serious warning from a genuine political insider. “Former Austrian foreign minister Kneissl confirms west’s plans to split up Russia,” was the headline. Other recent headlines include “Putin was right about economy in 2023 – ex-Austrian FM” and, earlier this month, “Ex-Austrian FM tells Russians to drop romantic notions about western Europe”. Last summer,she appeared before the UNto warn against supplying arms to Ukraine.Former friends and colleagues are conscious that relations with Kneissl have a tendency to be volatile. “I wouldn’t be surprised if she fell out with the Russians and end up in Beijing, or Caracas, or somewhere else,” said one. For now, though, Kneissl seems content. In a recent email, she again declined to be interviewed, but said she has begun rebuilding her life.Towards the end of last year, she took up her latest role, as an ambassador for theconservation of Siberian tigers, a cause close to Putin’s heart – and to Kneissl’s. State media reported in December that she had spotted a tiger during her recent visit to a national park. In a brief interview, she took the opportunity to draw an unfavourable contrast between European and Russian attitudes to such predators. In Russia, “bears, wolves, tigers are not called ‘problem bears, problem wolves’,” she said. “They are part of life. This is what I call saying yes to life in Russia.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readAustriaVladimir PutinRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Similar questions were also submitted to the broadcaster by the Commons culture select committee.Davie has come under increased pressure since itemergedhe was at the festival on Saturday evening and was informed about the events that unfolded on stage. He decided the performance should not feature in any further BBC coverage, but it remained on the iPlayer service for several hours.It is understood that there were technical obstacles to removing the content from the platform once it had been broadcast, with no instant way of removing it.However, those sympathetic to Davie now fear a series of other problems could further destabilise the corporation. Nandy has already turned her fire on the BBC director general, stating that one editorial error was “something that must be gripped. When you have several, it becomes a problem of leadership.”View image in fullscreenBob Vylan frontman, Bobby Vylan, crowdsurfs during his performance on the West Holts stage, during the Glastonbury festival.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAOn Wednesday, Channel 4 will broadcast a documentary about the plight of medics inGazathat was dropped by the BBC, which said showing the film “risked creating a perception of partiality”. The film has significant support among BBC staff.Meanwhile, a report on the making of another Gaza documentary is expected within weeks. TheBBC pulled the programmeHow to Survive a Warzone in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.It is also awaiting the outcome of an inquiry intoallegations of inappropriate behaviourby the MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace.

Nevertheless, clips of the performance were soon widely shared on social media.There has been significant fallout for the band. Avon and Somerset policeare investigating their performance, as well as that of Irish rap group Kneecap, who appeared directly after Bob Vylan and led chants of “Free Palestine”.

The band said they had been “targeted for speaking up” over Gaza, adding: “Silence is not an option.”“Today, a good many people would have you believe a punk band is the number one threat to world peace,” they said in a statement online. “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people.“[We] are not the story. We are a distraction from the story. And whatever sanctions we receive will be a distraction.“The government doesn’t want us to ask why they remain silent in the face of this atrocity? To ask why they aren’t doing more to stop the killing? To feed the starving?”Sir Ephraim Mirvis, the UK’s chief rabbi, said the event was a “national shame”.He wrote on X: “The airing of vile Jew-hatred at Glastonbury and the BBC’s belated and mishandled response, brings confidence in our national broadcaster’s ability to treat antisemitism seriously to a new low.“It should trouble all decent people that now, one need only couch their outright incitement to violence and hatred as edgy political commentary, for ordinary people to not only fail to see it for what it is, but also to cheer it, chant it and celebrate it. Toxic Jew-hatred is a threat to our entire society.”Explore more on these topicsBBCTim DavieGlastonbury 2025GazaMusic festivalsFestivalsLisa NandynewsShareReuse this content"

Cervical cancer leads to approximately685 deaths a year in Englandalone.Now a large-scale observational study published in Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinical Medicine has found that older women are more likely to have HPV infections and to have abnormal cells in test results than younger women.Researchers in China analysed cervical cancer screening data for more than 2 million women between 2017 and 2023. Of the 2 million, 17,420 were aged 65 and above; the remainder were younger.The study found greater prevalence of high-risk HPV infections and abnormal cells among women aged 65 and over than in younger women. Nearly 14% of those 65 and over tested positive for high-risk HPV infection types, compared with 8% of those who were younger.Older women were also more likely to be infected with several different types of HPV and have abnormalities picked up on screening.While acknowledging limitations to the study, the findings indicate that “women [aged 65 and above] are a high-risk group for cervical cancer incidence and mortality, necessitating urgent attention from countries worldwide”, the authors conclude.“Most guidelines suggest stopping screening for those with adequate primary screening and no high-risk factors, particularly for women under 65,” they say. “However, the situation differs for those over 65, who may not have been vaccinated or thoroughly screened. With increasing life expectancy, the risk of cervical cancer in this demographic is significantly heightened.”Responding to the findings, Athena Lamnisos, chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said among people over 65, “there is a largely unvaccinated population who, if under-screened or if they have never attended screening, may well still be at high risk of cervical cancer”.“We would look to the National Screening Committee to examine the findings and see if there would be benefits in reviewing screening age.”Maxine Lenza, health information manager atCancerResearch UK, said: “Recent improvements to the test in the UK means it’s an extremely effective way of preventing cervical cancer and saving lives, so those over the age of 65 and up to date with their cervical screening will have a very low risk of developing the disease. However, women over 65 who have never had cervical screening can request a test with their GP practice.”An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS cervical screening programme in England follows expert recommendations on age and frequency of screening by the UK National Screening Committee, which are based on regular reviews of the best evidence globally.“Women with an HPV-positive screening result at the age of 65 are invited for additional screening to monitor their ongoing risk and we would encourage all women to attend appointments when invited to ensure they have the best protection against cervical cancer.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “The screening age brackets are based on robust scientific evidence and an expert recommendation from the UK National Screening Committee, however any women who are worried about their symptoms can speak to their GP who will decide the best course of action.“It is vital that we increase the number of women accepting their invitation for cervical cancer screening within the existing age bracket. As part of our 10-year health plan, those who are eligible will be offered convenient human papillomavirus self-sampling kits – breaking down barriers to healthcare as we shift from treatment to prevention.”Explore more on these topicsCervical cancerWorld Health OrganizationHealthCancerWomenVaccines and immunisationOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

They argued that Google collected information from idle phones running its Android operating system for company uses like targeted advertising, consuming Android users’ cellular data at their expense.Google told the court that no Android users were harmed by the data transfers and that users consented to them in the company’s terms of service and privacy policies.Another group filed a separate lawsuit in federal court in San Jose, bringing the same claims against Google on behalf of Android users in the other 49 states.

The university graduate, originally from Hereford, has been in custody since November 2020.Detectives are investigating whether hospital managers should have done more to act when concerns were raised between 2015 and 2016.Hughes added: “As part of our ongoing inquiries, on Monday 30 June three individuals who were part of the senior leadership team at the CoCH in 2015-16, were arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.“All three have subsequently been bailed pending further inquiries.”Police have faced mounting questions about Letby’s convictions after an international panel of experts announced in February that they had found no evidence of criminality against her after reviewing medical records and other documents.Mark McDonald, the barrister now representing Letby, handed two large dossiers of new expert reviews to the CCRC earlier this year.But on Tuesday Cheshire constabulary said its criminal investigation into the former nurse, hospital bosses and the hospital itself would continue.Hughes said: “Both the corporate manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter elements of the investigation are continuing and there are no set timescales for these.“Our investigation into the deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies at the neo-natal units of both the Countess of Chester hospital and the Liverpool women’s hospital between the period of 2012 to 2016 is also ongoing.”McDonald, barrister at Furnival Chambers, said:“Yet another press release from the police at a very sensitive time when the CCRC are looking at the case of Lucy Letby. Despite this the concerns many have raised will not go away, and we will continue to publicly discuss them.“The reality is that 26 internationally renowned experts have looked at this case and the lead expert has concluded that no crime was committed, no babies were murdered. What is needed is a proper and full public inquiry into the failings of the neonatal and paediatric medical care unit at the Countess of Chester hospital.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Websites for thenational assessmentsand theUS Global Change Research Programwere down Monday and Tuesday with no links, notes or referrals elsewhere. The White House, which was responsible for the assessments, said the information will be housed within Nasa to comply with the law, but gave no further details.Searches for the assessments on Nasa websites did not turn them up. Nasa did not respond to requests for information. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which coordinated the information in the assessments, did not respond to repeated inquiries.Trump’s ‘climate’ purge deleted a new extreme weather risk tool. We recreated itRead more“It’s critical for decision-makers across the country to know what the science in the National Climate Assessment is. That is the most reliable and well-reviewed source of information about climate that exists for the United States,” said Kathy Jacobs, a University of Arizona climate scientist, who coordinated the 2014 version of the report.“It’s a sad day for the United States if it is true that the National Climate Assessment is no longer available,” Jacobs added. “This is evidence of serious tampering with the facts and with people’s access to information, and it actually may increase the risk of people being harmed by climate-related impacts.”Harvard climate scientist John Holdren, who was Barack Obama’s science adviser and whose office directed the assessments, said that after the 2014 edition, he visited governors, mayors and other local officials who told him how useful the 841-page report had been. It helped them decide whether to raise roads, build seawalls and even move hospital generators from basements to roofs, he said.“This is a government resource paid for by the taxpayer to provide the information that really is the primary source of information for any city, state or federal agency who’s trying to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate,” said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who has been a volunteer author for several editions of the report.Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in Noaa’s library. Nasa’s open science data repository includes dead links to the assessment site.The most recent report, issued in 2023, includes an interactive atlas that zooms down to the county level. It found that climate change is affecting people’s security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority and Native American communities often disproportionately at risk.The 1990 Global Change Research Act requires a national climate assessment every four years and directs the president to establish an interagency United States Global Change Research Program. In the spring, theTrump administrationtold the volunteer authors of the next climate assessment that their services weren’t needed and ended the contract with the private firm that helps coordinate the website and report.Additionally, Noaa’s main climate.gov website was recently forwarded to a different Noaa website. Social media and blogs at Noaa and Nasa about climate impacts for the general public were cut or eliminated.“It’s part of a horrifying big picture,” Holdren said. “It’s just an appalling whole demolition of science infrastructure.”The national assessments are more useful than international climate reports put out by the UN every seven or so years because they are more localized and more detailed, Hayhoe and Jacobs said.The national reports are not only peer-reviewed by other scientists, but examined for accuracy by the National Academy of Sciences, federal agencies, the staff and the public.Hiding the reports would be censoring science, Jacobs said.It’s also dangerous for the country, Hayhoe said, comparing it to steering a car on a curving road by only looking through the rearview mirror: “And now, more than ever, we need to be looking ahead to do everything it takes to make it around that curve safely. It’s like our windshield’s being painted over.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisTrump administrationUS weatherUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They contain easy-to-maintain plants such as jasmine bushes, and useful features such as chess sets, benches and gravel pathways flanked by pollinator-friendly flowers.Judges said it was “astonishingly clever” to create gardens in such small public spaces. They said the garden creates a feeling of being cocooned away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.View image in fullscreenOne of the gardens, destined for Walton-on-Thames, features a chess set.Photograph: RHS/Neil HepworthThe designers say they are trying to move from a car-first urban design to creating “healthy streets for Surrey”. They have a £2m fund to study the impact of creating these mini-gardens across the county in place of parking spaces.Helen Currie, a place-making specialist at the council, said: “We are trying our hardest to encourage people to want one of these in their vicinity. Whilst we can get them built and installed, we then need volunteers to come and maintain them. Our budget only stretches so far, so we’re always looking for groups that will offer to maintain them once they’re in the ground – so, weeding and watering – and they’re all designed so that the plants we’ve chosen are there to come back year on year.”One of the parklets, which will be relocated to a street in Walton-on-Thames, contains planters with built-in seating and a table with a chess board. It has plants proven to soak up street pollution including cotoneaster, and trees including forest pansy and field maple for shade. They also created a rain garden, which will be relocated to Cranleigh, that contains kerbs with gaps allowing water to run off the road into the planted area. It contains water-loving plants such as sage and masterwort, as well as a birch tree which can handle wet conditions and dry spells alike.The third garden is designed for birds and people, with a birdbath that collects rainwater and built-in seating for pedestrians. It features jasmine canopies which provide shade. This will be relocated to Guildford town centre.Alex Baldock, from the council’s place-making team, said: “We work with community to develop a holistic solution that’s not just focused on one aspect: the car. A lot of our town centres are becoming more service oriented, rather than solely retail focused, and therefore it needs to be more inviting for people, and encourage people to interact with each other and spend time in nature.”View image in fullscreenThe gardens feature robust plants that the designers say will require minimal maintenance by volunteers.Photograph: RHS/Neil HepworthCurrie added that creating parklets among parking spaces was more inclusive: “It’s showing it’s not for just one person driving a car, but it also provides for somebody who might not be able to walk that far, who might be able to walk to one of these, sit down, rest, and then continue their journey on by foot, which environmentally is a much better message.”They said that people who are interested in using parking spaces in their local areas for these mini-gardens should get in touch with their local council, some of which have funding for these projects.Currie added: “There was definitely a period of time where we just wanted to look after the car, car drivers, whereas now, we’re probably never going to get rid of the cars, all of them, but let’s just make it a nicer place that people don’t have to drive, and they can walk, or they can cycle, or they can do a mixture of both, on the way to wherever they’re going.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentHampton Court Palace flower showLocal governmentGardensPlantsAccess to green spacenewsShareReuse this content"

They argue that the EU should meet its targets domestically.More than 130 groups wrote to express “extreme concern” over the proposalslast month.Gareth Redmond-King, the international lead at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “There is no need for them to use credits. If such a major emitter is not going as far as they demonstrably could with emissions cuts, then the overall global ambition is lower than it could be. This would risk undermining the EU’s reputation for climate leadership at a time when that leadership is most needed.”Wopke Hoekstra, the EU climate commissioner, told the Guardian that developing countries were keen to gain EU financing through carbon credits, for projects such as tree planting or forest restoration, and that it was possible to ensure that such offsets resulted in genuine emissions reductions. He said the possibility of allowing this was “potentially very attractive”.“The planet doesn’t care about where we take emissions out of the air,” he said. “You need to take action everywhere, but it certainly also helps to do that both here and elsewhere.”He said developing countries in Africa and Latin America were interested in carbon credit projects. “There is huge appetite from our friends in the global south,” he said.But such projects would have to be in addition to actions developing countries were already taking to meet their own emissions targets, rather than replacing them. “If it is additional, I think it is a great idea,” he said. “And what we will not have a shortage of is ambition to do stuff at the same time in Europe. There’s no one who doubts the very significant level of ambition [for emissions cuts within the EU].”Hoekstra acknowledged there had beenproblems in the past with carbon credits that were found to be worthless. “It all stands or falls with the integrity of such a system, where certification, verification [of carbon credits], is absolutely essential,” he said. “But humanity has solved more difficult problems.”Wednesday’s talks on a 2040 emissions target could also be derailed by a small number of member states, led by France,mooting “decoupling” the domestic target from the NDC. They argue that the NDC, with its 2035 emissions target, could be delivered in September without the 2040 figure being agreed, implying that a less ambitious 2040 goal could be agreed at a later date.Hoekstra was firm. “We will come up this Wednesday with our 2040 climate target, and from that we will derive an ambitious NDC,” he said. “And I am confident that we will deliver that exact number by September, as we were asked for by the secretary general of the UN.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

China’s NDC will be crucial, especially as Donald Trump has taken the US out of the Paris agreement.Hoekstra attacked China for planning to build new coal-fired power plants, which he said was “against what was agreed at Cop28”, whencountries resolved to “transition away from fossil fuels”. He said: “Building new ones is a very bad idea.”It is unlikely thatthe NDCs presented at Cop30 in Belémwill be sufficient to prevent temperatures breaching the vital threshold of 1.5C above preindustrial levels contained in the Paris agreement.The Brazilian hosts of the meeting have said NDCs will not be negotiated at Cop30. But Hoekstra said the summit must come up with an answer for how to bridge any gap between the commitments made and the 1.5C limit.“It’s difficult to leave that proverbial elephant in the room and not discuss it. We do need to have political space to discuss the impact of the NDCs and the way forward.”Explore more on these topicsCarbon offsettingEuropean UnionGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisGreen politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We need this data and now [the scientific community] will be forced to put together a record from a different instrument. We won’t have that continued context that we have had previously.”NSIDC has said it is working with alternative and higher-resolution instruments from a different satellite, but has warned that datamay not be directly comparable with the current instruments.Fraser said: “We are seeing records now year on year inAntarctica, so from that perspective this could not have come at a worse time.”Dr Walt Meier, a senior scientist at NSIDC, said there were other “passive microwave instruments” that could keep the long-term record going, but he said differences with older sensors created a “a challenge to make the long-term record consistent and there will some degradation in the consistency of the long-term record.”“I think we will end up with a robust and quality record that users can have confidence in,” Meier said, but said this would add to uncertainty to estimates of trends.Asked why the government was stopping the data, he said because “everything is old and resources are limited, my guess is that it is not worth the time and effort to upgrade the systems for such old sensors, which may fail at any time.”The research, published in the journalPNAS Nexus, found a link between increasing numbers of icebergs calving from floating ice shelves and the loss of sea ice.While the loss of sea ice does not directly raise sea levels, the research said it exposed more ice shelves to wave action, causing them to break apart and release icebergs faster.Glaciologist Dr Sue Cook, also from AAPP, said “like a cork in a bottle” those shelves help to slow down the advance of land-based ice that does raise sea levels if it breaks off into the ocean.She said the higher rates of iceberg calving seen in Antarctica were not accounted for in calculations of how quickly the ice sheet might break apart and contribute global sea levels.“If we shift to this state where summer sea ice is very low but we continue using models based on previous periods, then we will definitely underestimate how quickly Antarctica will contribute to sea level rise,” she said.The study also outlined other knock-on effects from the record low sea ice levels in the Antarctic, including the loss of more seals and penguins if trends continued.As many as7,000 emperor penguin chicks died in late 2022after the early break-up of the stable ice they used for shelter while they grow their waterproof plumage.A US Navy spokesperson confirmed the data processing from its defence meteorological satellite program (DMSP) would stop on 31 July “in accordance with Department of Defense policy.”DMSP is a joint program owned by the US Space Force, the spokesperson said, and was scheduled for discontinuation in September 2026.“The Navy is discontinuing contributions to DMSP given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisAntarcticaArcticnewsShareReuse this content"

The tie-up could see the TSB brand disappear, ending its 215-year run on the UK high street. Santander has not yet decided whether to scrap the brand.TSB serves 5 million customers through its 175 branches and 5,000 staff. Santander UK has about 14 million customers and 350 branches across the UK, with 18,000 staff.The purchase marks the third major ownership shake-up for TSB in 12 years, having been hived off from Lloyds in 2013 as part of efforts to increase competition following its £20.3bn government bailout in 2008.TSB floated on the UK stock exchange in 2014 and was bought by Sabadell a year later, marking one of thebiggest cross-border banking dealssince the financial crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had suffered catastrophic injuries.”The barrister described the attack as exhibiting “sheer brutality” with “hardly a part of his body spared”.He said: “In plain language, his head had been crushed so as to shatter his skull. He was badly bruised from head to toe, with deep scratches to his neck. He was found to have, amongst other injuries, a broken neck, a broken jaw, broken legs, broken ankles and broken wrists.”The prosecutor said one medical expert likened the injuries to those that might be found in a fall from a multi-storey building or in a “complex” road accident.Row said on occasion Gunter would be violent towards Staddon. She allegedly said he would shout in her face, had hurled cups and plates at her and had thrown her across a room.He allegedly controlled her finances, dictated who she could speak to and spend time with, what and how much she ate and when she smoked. She told one acquaintance that Gunter had said he did not want the baby, the court heard.Row said the authorities were worried about the couple and meetings had been held to decide whether Brendon should be taken into care when he was born.Staddon and Gunter looked after Brendon in hospital but nurses were concerned about how he handled the child. On the day before Brendon died, Staddon was upset because Gunter had allegedly said he wasn’t the father. Such was the concern from staff that security were alerted.At about 3.30am on 5 March a nurse looked in on the parents and Brendon and asked if the child was all right. Row said: “His [Gunter’s] reply did not seem natural. He seemed excited. His response was unusually animated.” The nurse could not see anything of Brendon as he was swaddled in a blanket.Just after 4am Staddon approached the nursing station and asked that Brendon be checked as he was cold. A nurse examined him and raised the alarm.Gunter and Staddon left at 4.40am to go outside for a cigarette. “They did not return, nor did they seek any update on their child’s condition,” Row said.When they were arrested, Gunter told police: “She’s my witness and I’m her witness.” As he was being led to a van, the court heard that Gunter said to Staddon: “Promise me, stick together, yeah.”The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Our government has stated that it is committed to respecting the rule of law: this must include the right to protest.“To use the Terrorism Act to ban Palestine Action from direct action would be an abuse of this legislation and an interference with the right to protest. Misusing terrorism legislation in this way against a protest group sets a dangerous precedent, threatens our democratic freedoms, and would be a terrifying blow to our civil liberties.”Signatories ofthe Haldane Society letter, which will be handed to Cooper before MPs vote on Wednesday, include Michael Mansfield KC and Imran Khan KC – who represented the family of Stephen Lawrence and victims of the Grenfell Tower fire – and the Labour peer John Hendy KC.It has been signed by thousands of people including the politicians Caroline Lucas, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, the actors Adeel Akhtar and Juliet Stevenson, teachers and vicars.The letter says: “It [a ban] would leave many ordinary members of the public vulnerable – for example, simply wearing a T-shirt saying ‘I support Palestine Action’ would be seen as violating the proscription and action would need to be taken.“There are many dangers to proscribing peaceful direct action groups, even if their objectives are those some of us may disagree with. Current and future governments may misuse this precedent to attack other interest groups in future, offering no avenues for peacefully venting dissent.”The prime minister, Keir Starmer, was a member of the Haldane Society but left when he became director of public prosecutions in 2008.The UN experts said: “Mere property damage, without endangering life, is not sufficiently serious to qualify as terrorism …Protestactions that are not genuinely ‘terrorist’, but which involve alleged property damage, should be properly investigated as ordinary crimes or other security offences.”The Home Office referred the Guardian toCooper’s statement last weekannouncing the proposed ban, and comments in a press release issued on Monday in which she said that Palestine Action’s acts “do not represent legitimate acts of protest and the level of seriousness of Palestine Action’s activity has met the test for proscription under the Terrorism Act 2000”.Explore more on these topicsProtestYvette CooperCounter-terrorism policyActivismFreedom of speechLabourHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the small rise means the downwards trend seen in recent years may have come to a halt.The largest increases in births were found in the West Midlands, up 3.4%, and London, up 1.8%, with five regions seeing a year-on-year fall, including a drop of 1.4% in the north-east.The ONS said there was a “notable increase” in live births to fathers aged 60 and over, which jumped by 14%, from 942 births in 2023 to 1,076 in 2024.Births to young mothers and fathers fell, continuing a long-term trend of the average age of parents rising steadily over the past 50 years.View image in fullscreenBridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has expressed concern over the falling birthrate.Photograph: Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThe largest increase in live births was for women aged 35 to 39 years, which grew by 2.7%, while the largest decrease was seen in those aged under 20, declining by 4.6%.Greg Ceely, the ONS’s head of population health monitoring, said: “The number of births to mothers under 30 fell, as people continue to put off having children until later in life.“The largest decrease is seen among those under 20 years old, which fell by almost 5%, while the number of mothers aged 35 to 39 grew the most.”On Monday, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson,called on Britons to consider having more childrenand having them sooner, describing the “worrying repercussions” posed by a decline in fertility rates.‘Rethink what we expect from parents’: Norway’s grapple with falling birthrateRead more“A generation of young people have been thinking twice about starting a family, worried not only about rising mortgage and rent repayments, wary not only of the price of fuel and food, but also put off by a childcare system simultaneously lacking in places and ruinously expensive,” she wrote in the Daily Telegraph.The data also showed that 39.5% of live births in England and Wales last year had either one or both parents born outside the UK, up from 37.3% in 2023 and 32.5% a decade earlier in 2014.The ONS stressed the data did not give a full picture of a family’s ethnicity or migration history, or reflect any recent trends in immigration, as not all women born outside the UK would have arrived in the country in the past few years.Explore more on these topicsPopulationChildrenFamilyWomenHealthBridget PhillipsonOffice for National StatisticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Shrapnel flew everywhere, and the place filled with smoke and the smell of gunpowder. I couldn’t see anything. I ran toward the cafe and found it destroyed. I went inside and saw bodies lying on the ground. All the cafe workers were killed,” he told the Guardian.“There was a family there with their young children – why were they targeted? It was a place where people came to find some relief from the pressures of life.”View image in fullscreenAftermath of the Israeli airstrike at Al-Baqa cafeteria on Gaza’s seafront.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThe cafe and restaurant had so far survived more than 20 months of war and offered some respite from the relentless violence of the conflict.“There’s always a lot of people at that spot, which offers drinks, spaces for families and internet access,” said Ahmad al-Nayrab, 26, who was walking on the nearby beach when he heard a loud explosion. “It was a massacre,” he told AFP. “I saw bits of bodies flying everywhere, bodies mangled and burned. It was a bloodcurdling scene; everybody was screaming.”1:17Israeli airstrike on popular Gaza beachside cafe leaves at least 30 dead – video reportAdam, 21, was working nearby, renting chairs and tables on the small promenade. “When the strike happened, we dropped to the ground as shrapnel began falling on us,” he told the Guardian. “We started running, trying to understand what had happened, and we helped with the rescue efforts. When I reached the site, the scenes were beyond anything imaginable. I knew all the workers at the place. It was full of customers of all ages.”Other witnesses described seeing a dead four-year-old child, an elderly man with both legs severed and many others with severe injuries. Photographs showed pools of blood and flesh amid shattered concrete columns and roofing, as well as a deep crater suggesting the use of a powerful weapon by Israel.The IDF spokesperson said that “prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians using aerial surveillance”.View image in fullscreenThe cafe and restaurant had survived more than 20 months of war and offered some respite from the relentless violence of the conflict.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianTwo other strikes in Gaza City killed 15 people, according to al-Shifa hospital, which received the casualties, and there were also reports from witnesses, hospitals, and Gaza’s health ministry that Israeli forces killed 11 people who had been seeking food in the south of the territory.Dozens of international charities and non-governmental organizations, including Oxfam, Save the Children and Amnesty, called on Tuesday for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – an Israeli and US-backed logistics group – to disband after repeated incidents of chaos and deadly violence against Palestinians heading toward its sites.“Palestinians in Gaza face an impossible choice: starve or risk being shot while trying desperately to reach food to feed their families,” they said.GHF started distributing aid on 26 May after a nearly three-month Israeli blockade that has pushed Gaza’s population of more than 2 million people to the brink of famine. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed around the chaotic and controversial aid distribution programme over the past month.In a statement, GHF said said it had delivered 53m meals in Gaza and was working tirelessly to feed as many innocent people as possible, adding: “Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza.”Israel has ramped upits offensive in Gazain recent days, with multiple waves of airstrikes and new “evacuation orders” which have forced tens of thousands of people to leave makeshift homes across a swath of the north of the devastated territory.The orders warned of impending assaults and told Palestinians to head south to overcrowded coastal zones where there are few facilities and a limited supply of water. About 80% of the territory is now covered by such orders or controlled by Israeli forces.The IDF has signalled that it plans to advance into the centre of Gaza City, the most densely populated part of Gaza, to fight Hamas militants based there.The war began when Hamas-led militants launched an attack into southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages back to Gaza.Israel’s subsequent military offensive has killed more than 56,500 Palestinians, mostly civilians, displacing almost the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza and reducing much of the territory to rubble.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Investigators said they believed the suspect had been planning a terrorist attack against the site.During last month’s 12-day war between Iran and Israel, Germany’s chancellor Friedrich Merz, a staunch supporter of Israel, said the country was prepared for possible Iranian attacks against Israeli or Jewish targets on German soil.Germany’s relations with Iran have been historically tense although it isone of three European powers engaged in diplomacy with Tehran over its nuclear programme.Explore more on these topicsGermanyIranJudaismnewsShareReuse this content"

Four cartoonists were arrested on Monday over the illustration.It was criticised by religious conservatives and by Erdoğan’s ruling party, which called it an “Islamophobic hate crime,” even as the magazine that published it, LeMan, apologised to readers who felt offended and said the drawing had been misunderstood.“We will not allow anyone to speak against our sacred values,” Erdoğan said in televised remarks, adding that the authorities would closely follow the legal process.“Those who show disrespect to our prophet and other prophets will be held accountable before the law,” he said.Erdoğan and his Islamic-rooted AK Party regularly criticise what they call Islamophobic acts in broadly secularTurkeyand across Europe. Devout Muslims regard depictions of the prophet Muhammad as blasphemous.In a statement on X, LeMan said: “The work does not refer to the Prophet Muhammad in any way.”View image in fullscreenA crowd amasses in central Istanbul to protest against the cartoon published in LeMan magazine.Photograph: Dilara Senkaya/ReutersThe cartoonist, Dogan Pehlevan, had sought to highlight “the suffering of a Muslim man killed in Israeli attacks”, it said, adding there had been no intent to insult Islam or its prophet.The magazine urged authorities to counter what it called a smear campaign, and to protect freedom of expression.Several civil society groups condemned the detentions of the four cartoonists as a violation of freedom of thought and expression.Turkey’s freedom of expression ranking is low, due to restrictions on media and public discourse. Reporters Without Borders ranked it 158th out of 180 countries in its 2024 Press Freedom Index.More than 200 peoplerallied against LeMan in central Istanbulon Tuesday, despite a ban on gatherings and a heavy police presence.One protester, public servant Muhammed Emin Necipsoy, said the magazine’s defence seemed insincere. “There is a subtle emphasis there on both the prophet [Muhammad] and the prophet Moses,” he said.Turkey’s interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, shared a video on X showing police officers detaining Pehlevan, with his hands cuffed behind his back as he was dragged up a flight of stairs.He also shared videos of three other men being removed from their homes and put into vans, one of them barefoot.“The individual who drew this vile image, D.P., has been apprehended and taken into custody. These shameless people will be held accountable before the law,” Yerlikaya wrote.The Turkish government said an inquiry had been launched under a law that criminalises incitement to hatred and enmity.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanIslamCharlie HebdoReligionNewspapers & magazinesMagazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Andy Ferguson, one half of dance duo Bicep, walks around in its towering shadow recording these eerie sounds. “Everyone comes back changed,” he says ofGreenland. “Seeing first-hand climate change happening like this.”It’s April 2023 and, in the wake ofBicep’s second album Islescementing them as one of the leading electronic acts globally, Ferguson has travelled to Greenland as part of a project to collaborate with Indigenous musicians and bring the momentous struggle of this region – and even the planet – into focus.The project will take two years to come to fruition but next month sees the release of Bicep’s first soundtrack and accompanying filmTakkuuk, pronounced tuck-kook. It’s an Inuktitut word that came from throat singing duo Silla, one of the Indigenous collaborators: “It translates to literally ‘look’ but has the connotation that you’re urging someone to look at something closely,” says Silla’s Charlotte Qamaniq. “The Arctic climate is changing rapidly so in the context of the project it’s: ‘look, the adverse effects of climate change are obvious.’ But it’s also: ‘hey, look how cool Inuit culture is!’”View image in fullscreenA member of the expedition team dwarfed by an Arctic glacier.Photograph: Charlie MillerI join Ferguson on this first trip along with representatives from EarthSonic, a non-profit organisation dedicated to raising awareness about the climate crisis through art projects. Ferguson’sBiceppartner Matt McBriar stays home ahead of the birth of his first child.When we land at Kangerlussuaq airport, first opened as a US airbase in the second world war, it’s -10C, bright and crisp. Ferguson is staying with our driver Evald who, on learning that Ferguson and I are Man United fans, exclaims: “Manchester United is my religion! Old Trafford is my church!” His home has a huge Lego model of the stadium. Across the next week we see the northern lights – in Inuit myth, it’s dead souls playing ball with a walrus’s head – and ride dogsleds and snowmobiles, but there’s a sobering tone to the beauty and adventure.Russell glacier is a 20km journey by four-wheel drive on a rough dirt road. The ice sheet covers 80% of the country, but loss of ice from Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has quadrupled since the 90s due to climate change, and is the principal driver of rising sea levels. Scientists predict if the world continues on a course towards 2.5C heating it will take us beyond a tipping point for both ice sheets, resulting ina catastrophic sea level rise of 12 metres. Standing under a vast glacier that is hundreds of thousands of years old, but which could disappear within my daughters’ lifetime, is discombobulating.View image in fullscreenBicep performing at Sonar festival in June.Photograph: Alejandro García/EPANext morning it’s on to Sisimiut forArcticSounds, a showcase for music from across the Arctic region and beyond. Sisimiut is Greenland’s second city, home to 5,000, and a thriving metropolis compared with Kangerlussuaq. Rock and metal are the most popular music, alongside rap and other Indigenous music and the standout acts include an incendiary performance by Greenlandic rapper Tarrak. “Seeing Tarrak perform was so powerful,” Ferguson says, with “everyone chanting in this language I’d never heard before. It felt punk. It’s rare to see that nowadays when everything is so homogenised.”The project is allowing Bicep to flex different musical muscles. Playing a simultaneously melancholic and euphoric style of tech-house and electronica, Bicep broke through in the mid-2010s. Their track Glue became a ubiquitous rave anthem among gen Z, and led to the success of Isles, which reached No 2 in the UK charts and earned them two Brit award nominations. Everything was rosy, but it was, in Ferguson’s words, “all sugar, no sour”, so they created alter egos Chroma and Dove to show their harder, headier side. The Arctic was an opportunity to challenge themselves again.After Ferguson returned from Greenland, the first thing Bicep did was construct a drum kit from ice samples and other field recordings of local sounds including husky chains, then created demos, “really just chord structures we know we can write around” and sent them to the Indigenous artists. They didn’t expect to get almost full songs in return, but on hearing what came back, the duo realised “we needed to step back and not be the focal point”. A gig on a glacier had been one initial mooted idea, but the Greenland trip made it obvious such a gig would be “tone deaf”, says Ferguson. Through conversations with Indigenous artists, “it became clear this needed to be us shining a light on them”.At times, progress seemed suitably glacial, but eventually a collection of Indigenous artists from Greenland and the wider Arctic region recorded their contributions at Iceland Airwaves festival in Reykjavík in November 2023, where many of them were in town performing, including Tarrak, Silla, vocalist Katarina Barruk and more.View image in fullscreenA still from the Takkuuk film and installation project.Photograph: EarthSonic / BICEPWhen I catch up with Ferguson and meet his Bicep-mate McBriar in late 2024, they’re buzzing about the results, and by late May, I’m finally able to hear the full thing in their Shoreditch studio. From the first bars of opener Sikorsuit, featuring Greenlandic indie band Nuija, it’s clear the duo have managed to pull myriad styles and dialect into a cohesive whole. “It doesn’t sound anything like us – and it doesn’t sound like them,” McBriar says. “That’s what you hope to achieve from a collaboration.”Tarrak collaboration Taarsitillugu opens with a sparse breakbeat and becomes a full-on rave banger, while on her track Dárbbuo, Barruk sings in Ume Sámi, an endangered Uralic language spoken by fewer than 20 people. “I went in to the studio and just poured my heart out because of the tragic state the world is in,” she says, “then Matt and Andy worked their magic.”There was synchronicity, despite different languages. “It shows a strong connection between us Indigenous sister and brothers,” explains Barruk, who is Swedish. “Without me knowingtakkuukmeans look, I created lyrics which ask the other person tovuöjnniet, to see, so one doesn’t need to feel so alone. Alone in the fight for our lands, our ways of living, our language, culture and taking care of the Earth.”As the project developed it was clear it needed context, so Bicep asked Zak Norman, who designs their brilliant on-stage visuals, to create an immersive installation. Norman worked with Charlie Miller, a documentary film-maker who went on the original Greenland trip, on a film that introduces the artists and explores the displacement and marginalisation of their communities, cultures and language. Norman used adapted infrared cameras to give the footage otherworldly pink and purple hues, reminiscent of Richard Mosse’s 2013 video artwork The Enclave. The film is a series of vignettes for each track, and it certainly deepens the music, with eerie landscapes layered with interviews. The work will premiere on the giant wraparound screens at London’s Outernet next month, before touring venues and festivals across the world.View image in fullscreen‘We have to be aware of people trying to divide us’ … Tarrak.Photograph: Charlie MillerThe project has taken on yet another hue in the wake of Donald Trump’s recent expansionist proclamations. “It’s a circus,” says Tarrak. “The first time Trump asked to buy Greenland [during his first. term as president] we took it as a joke. Now I can see there’s some seriousness – but it’s still just weird, in 2025, to try and buy a country. I know they’re more interested in what’s under the ground than the people, but we have to be smart about it as Greenlanders, stick together and be aware of people trying to divide us.”Bicep experienced their own existential crisis whenMcBriar had to have surgery for a large tumouron his brain’s pituitary gland last year, from which he’s thankfully made a good recovery. They’re now deep into their third album proper, though it won’t see daylight from their basement studio for at least another year. “We wrote [Isles] pre-pandemic so it’s a complete different world now. With Chroma we wanted to get that aggression out and cleanse ourselves of what we wanted to do, just straight club tracks. Now I think we’re coming full circle.”How will you judge the success of Takkuuk, I ask. “You can’t quantify awareness,” says Ferguson. “If it starts people on a journey to learn more about Greenland then it’s achieved something.Andy Ferguson of Bicep’s listening diary: ‘I tend to let the algorithm start me off down a little wormhole’Read more“It’s easy to switch off with climate change, I switch off myself sometimes,” he continues. “But if you start telling the story in different ways, different narratives, ways people can visualise it, at least it’s a start. Because for the next generation it’s going to be the focal part of their life.”Takkuuk premieres at Outernet, London, 3 July, then tours.

Truthfully, Ms debuted months earlier, on 20 December 1971, as a 40-page insert in New York magazine, where founding editorGloria Steinemwas a staff writer. Suspecting this might be their only shot, its founders packed the issue with stories like The Black Family and Feminism, De-Sexing the English Language, and We Have Had Abortions, a list of 53 well-known American women’s signatures, including Anaïs Nin, Susan Sontag and Steinem herself. The 300,000 available copies sold out in eight days. The first US magazine founded and operated entirely by women was, naysayers be damned, a success.‘People didn’t like women in space’: how Sally Ride made history and paid the priceRead moreThe groundbreaking magazine’s history, and its impact on the discourse around second-wave feminism and women’s liberation, is detailed in theHBOdocumentary Dear Ms: A Revolution in Print, which premiered at this year’s Tribeca film festival. Packed with archival footage and interviews with original staff, contributors and other cultural icons, Dear Ms unfolds across three episodes, each directed by a different film-maker. Salima Koroma, Alice Gu and Cecilia Aldarondo deftly approach key topics explored by the magazine – domestic violence, workplace harassment, race, sexuality – with care, highlighting the challenges and criticisms that made Ms a polarizing but galvanizing voice of the women’s movement.Before Ms launched, the terms “domestic violence” and “sexual harassment” hadn’t entered the lexicon. Women’s legal rights were few, and female journalists were often limited to covering fashion and domesticity. But feminist organizations like Redstockings, the National Organization forWomenand New York Radical Women were forming; Steinem, by then an established writer, was reporting on the women’s liberation movement, of which she was a fundamental part. In part one of the documentary, Koroma’s A Magazine for All Women, Steinem recalls attending a women’s liberation meeting for New York magazine. Archival footage discloses what was shared there, and other meetings like it: “I had to be subservient to some men,” says one woman, “ … and I had to forget, very much, what I might have wanted to be if I had any other choice.”The response to Ms was unsurprising, its perspective so collectively needed. “A lot of these articles could still be relevant,” Steinem muses in part one. But, says the publication’s first editor, Suzanne Braun Levine, “I don’t think we all were prepared for the response. Letters, letters, letters – floods of letters.” Koroma unveils excerpts of those first letters to the editor, vulnerable and intimate: “How bolstering to find that I am not alone with my dissatisfaction that society had dictated roles for me to graduate from and into.” By the time Ms was in operation, the staff was publishing cover stories on Shirley Chisholm, unpaid domestic labor and workplace sexual harassment. “Who is it you’re trying to reach?” a journalist asks Steinem in an interview back then. She replies: “Everybody.”“They tried to be a magazine for all women,” explains Koroma in a recent interview, “and what happens then? You make mistakes, because of the importance of intersectionality.” In an archival audio clip, the writer and activist (and close friend of Steinem’s) Dorothy Pitman Hughes says: “White women have to understand … that sisterhood is almost impossible between us until you’ve understood how you also contribute to my oppression as a Black woman.” Marcia Ann Gillespie, the former editor in chief of Essence and later Ms’s editor in chief, confides to Koroma: “Some of the white women had a one-size-fits-all understanding of what feminism is, that our experiences are all the same. Well, no, they’re not.” Alice Walker, who became an associate editor, shared her own writing and championed others’, like Michele Wallace’s, in the publication’s pages before quitting in 1986, writing about the “swift alienation” she felt due to a lack of diversity.Wallace recounts her experience as a Ms cover girl, her braids removed, her face caked in make-up. She adds: “I want to critique [Ms], but they were very supportive of me. I don’t know what would’ve become of me if there hadn’t been a Ms magazine.” She left, too: “I was not comfortable with white women speaking for me.” Levine admits: “We made a mistake,” referring to featuring Black writers but having few Black cover stars and no Black founding staff.“The work still needs to be done. We’re always going to have to rethink things,” Koroma says. It’s a running thread in Dear Ms, one that creates a rich and ultimately loving picture of the magazine. “Ms is a complex and rich protagonist,” Aldarondo reflects. “If you only talk about the good things and not the shadow, that’s a very one-dimensional portrait. One of the things that makes Ms so interesting and admirable is that they wrestled with things in the pages of the magazine.” In part three, No Comment (named for Ms’s column that called out misogynistic advertising), Aldarondo chronicles its contentious coverage of pornography, which the staff primarily differentiated from erotica as inherently misogynistic, many of them aligning with the Women Against Pornography movement.In an episode that opens with unfurling flowers and the words of the delightful porn star, educator and artist Annie Sprinkle, Aldarondo depicts the violence of the era’s advertising and pornography, and the women who were making – or enjoying – pornography and sex work, proudly and on their own terms. In a response to the 1978 cover story Erotica and Pornography: Do You Know the Difference?, Sprinkle and her colleagues, the writers and adult film actors Veronica Vera and Gloria Leonard, led a protest outside the Ms office. The staff hadn’t “invited anyone from our community to come to the table”, says Sprinkle, despite adult film stars’ expertise about an exploitative industry they were choosing to reclaim. “To see these women as fallen women,” says Aldarondo, “completely misses the mark.”View image in fullscreenFrom left, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Gloria Steinem and Suzanne Braun Levine.Photograph: HBOBehind the scenes, the staff themselves were at odds. Former staff writer Lindsy Van Gelder states: “I knew perfectly good feminists who liked porn. Deal with it.” Contending with the marginalization faced by sex workers, Ms ran Mary Kay Blakely’s cover story, Is One Woman’s Sexuality Another Woman’s Pornography? in 1985. The entire issue was a response to activists Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon’s Model Antipornography Law, which framed pornography as a civil rights violation and which Carole S Vance, the co-founder of the Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force, describes in Dear Ms as “a toolkit for the right wing” that ultimately endangers sex workers. Dworkin, says Vance, refused a dialogue; instead, the magazine printed numerous materials, the words of opposing voices and the law itself to “reflect, not shape” readers’ views, says founding editor Letty Cottin Pogrebin. The hate mail was swift – including Dworkin’s, once a staff colleague: “I don’t want anything more to do with Ms – ever.”Gu reveals something far more frightening than hate mail, a horror that didn’t make its way into the film: death threats and bomb threats, which the staff received in response to their most controversial stories. “There was actionable change that happened because of what these women did,” says Gu. “The danger they put themselves in is not to be discounted. I get emotional every time I talk about it ... I have benefited largely from the work of these women, and I’m very grateful.”That actionable change refers to the legislative reforms prompted by Ms’s coverage of domestic violence and workplace harassment. In A Portable Friend, Gu examines the 1975 Men’s Issue, the 1976 Battered Wives Issue and the 1977 issue on workplace sexual assault. “Back then, there was no terminology if a woman was being hit by her partner,” says Gu. She spotlights heartbreaking archival footage of women sharing their experiences with abuse: “If it’d been a stranger, I would have run away.” Staff writer Van Gelder reflects on a former partner who hit her. “Did you tell anyone?” Gu asks.“Not really,” Van Gelder says.In an archival clip, Barbara Mikulski, former Maryland senator and representative, says: “The first legislation I introduced as a congresswoman was to help battered women. I got that idea listening to the problems of battered women and reading about it in Ms.” Adds Levine: “We brought it into the daylight. Then there was the opening for battered women’s shelters, for legislation, for a community that reassured and supported women.” The same idea applied to workplace sexual harassment: “If something doesn’t have a name, you can’t build a response,” Levine exclaims. “The minute it had a name, things took off and changed.”View image in fullscreenGloria Steinem (second from right) and staff.Photograph: Jill Freedman/HBOGu shared that while “there’s a little bit of questioning as to whether it was Ms who coined the term [domestic violence], they were certainly the first to bring the term into the public sphere and allow for a discussion”. The Working Women United Institute eventually collaborated with Ms on a speak-out on sexual harassment.Despite obstacles, the scholar Dr Lisa Coleman, featured in part one, describes the publication as one “that was learning”.“It’s easy to be critical at first,” says Koroma, “but after talking to the founders, you realize that these women come from a time when you couldn’t have a bank account. It’s so humbling to talk to the women who were there and who are a large part of the reason why I have what I have now.” Gu noted that the lens of the present day can be a foggy one through which to understand Ms – which, in truth, was “completely radical”, she says. “You weren’t going to read about abortion in Good Housekeeping. You have to plant yourself in the shoes of these women at that time.”Our elders endured different but no less tumultuous battles than the ones we face now, many of which feel like accelerated, intensified iterations of earlier struggles. “Talk to your moms, to your aunts and grandmas,” Koroma adds. Aldarondo agrees: “One of the great pleasures of this project, for all of us, was this intergenerational encounter and getting to hear from our elders. It’s very easy for younger people to simply dismiss what elders are saying. That’s a mistake. I felt like I already understood the issues, and then I learned so much from these women.”Dear Ms: A Revolution in Print premieres on HBO on 2 July and will be available on MaxExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsMagazinesFeminismHBONewspapers & magazinesGloria SteinemWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These glamorous 1930s capers starred the debonair duo of William Powell and Myrna Loy as frisky husband-and-wife sleuths Nick and Nora Charles, who solve crimes while cracking wise and necking cocktails, accompanied by their precocious wire fox terrier Asta. There were six films in the original run, starting with 1934’s The Thin Man, an adaptation of the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name, and ending in 1947. The perfect recipe for a new Thin Man film would comprise two charismatic movie stars with sizzling chemistry, the kind who look stunning in evening dress, but who can also ad lib their own gags, a cavalcade of plot twists and saucy co-stars, a happy ending, and of course a scene-stealing pooch. It’s good, old-fashioned fun, but that’s why it’s so timeless, and a formula that can run and run – until the ice bucket is empty.Pamela HutchinsonWild ThingsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cinetext/Columbia/AllstarWild Things is a movie Film Twitter might say they just couldn’t make any more, which is pretty much the best reason to give it a try. The gloriously trashy original, which spawned a series of straight-to-DVD sequels, starred Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, Matt Dillon and Kevin Bacon (shocking audiences by showing off all his meat) as exceptionally hot grifters using their sexual currency to break open trust funds. Wild Things was the neo-noir driftwood arriving after a wave of 90s erotic thrillers, when Girls Gone Wild was a thing and wet T-shirt competitions were peaking. That vibe is built into the movie’s lurid south Florida aesthetic, which was an ogle fest certainly, but also deceptively clever and sensational with its knowing high camp performances and over-the-top accumulation of double and triple crosses. Wild Things is exactly the franchise to revisit now that we’re in a moment when the erotic thriller is making a comeback (think Halina Reijn’s smart and subversive embrace in Babygirl). It’s got the room to improve and challenge what the original had to offer, but also embrace what it did well, showing a lot of skin but only revealing the true nature of its plot and appeal just when we thought the movie – and its moment – was over.Radheyan SimonpillaiTorchy BlaneView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Donaldson Collection/Getty ImagesLook, I frankly can’t conceive of a hunger for reviving any long-running franchise of the past half-century. Pretty much all of them have had their turn at this point. So let’s take it back a bit further and yield the floor to Torchy Blane. This lady reporter and de facto gumshoe was played mostly but not exclusively by Glenda Farrell and featured in nine feature films released between 1937 and 1939, starting with the aptly titled Smart Blonde. Feature films meant something a little different back then; these B-movie mysteries and light adventure thrillers hovered around the 60-minute mark. They’re also the kind of personality-driven plots that are more typically run into the ground by network TV. But wouldn’t it be fun to see a true big-screen star like Amy Adams, Emma Stone or Zoe Saldaña cracking cases every year or two without the TV commitment or the obligations of brainless spectacle? Hire Torchy at an imperiled publication and bring back the crisp, short, well-made mystery picture! If the execs need a craven superhero connection, consider this: Torchy supposedly helped inspire the comics character Lois Lane. Whaddaya need, a road map?Jesse HassengerA Nightmare on Elm StreetView image in fullscreenPhotograph: FlixPix/AlamyThere’s nothing official yet on the books for a return to Elm Street but given the unending churn of horror resurrections (Screamcontinues, Halloween is gettinganother do-over, Friday the 13th isheading to TV, Texas Chainsaw has inspired afrenzied auction), something must be edging closer. The delay might be down to how nightmarish the last attempt was – 2010’s drab and unscary retread, loathed by critics and disowned by lead Rooney Mara – but also how difficult it is to reinvent Freddy Krueger for a modern audience. A violent, sleepover-ruining villain had turned into a quippy, exhaustingly over-merchandised joke and those wishing to bring him back have surely been having sleepless nights trying to figure out the right balance. But there remains something terrifying, and endlessly inventive, about the engine at its core, allowing for a smart, visually ambitious film-maker to go wild on a new canvas. There’s also mileage in exploring, and potentially tweaking, Krueger’s cursed backstory for an even more divided small-town America (what if an outsider was framed for the wrongdoings of a corrupt community and returned with a vengeance?), finding nasty new ways to keep us up all night.Benjamin LeeAustin PowersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: New Line Cinema/Allstar“One million dollars!” In the ’90s, the Austin Powers franchise rightly achieved heavy cultural weight and widespread memeification for the way it hilariously dismantled spy thriller tropes while lambasting the uptight and power-hungry 1% – far before it was trendy to do so. But that was 20 years ago. As oligarchs today melt the ice caps to force-feed us self-driving cars and AI slop, and while Donald Trump amasses a Dr Evil–worthy group of sycophants in the executive branch, what could be more timely than a reboot of the Austin Powers series? In times of political upheaval and social unrest, comedy has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to speak necessary truths in a way that resonates broadly; even more importantly, mockery and laughter are proven deterrents against authoritarian regimes.Veronica EspositoThe GodfatherView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Paramount/Kobal/ShutterstockI can personally live without movie franchises: I lost interest in Star Wars halfway through Return of the Jedi, gave up on Alien after Resurrection, and actually fell asleep during Matrix Reloaded, it was such a letdown. Recapturing lightning in a bottle is a task seemingly beyond everyone except James Cameron (I’ll grant that Aliens and T2 are top-notch exceptions to the rule). The Godfather – not really a franchise as such, but in effect the inventor of the modern film series – is the biggest conundrum of them all. Godfathers 1 and 2 are both brilliant, which makes the awfulness of part III one of the most baffling disasters in cinema history. (Even more baffling, where did Sofia Coppola find the confidence to be such a great director herself after being so badly exposed as an actor, by her own dad.) Well, history records that Coppola – still then a film-maker to be reckoned with – only did part III to get out of a financial hole; and it also records he did discuss a fourth film with Mario Puzo, but it hit the buffers when the author died in 1999. So my vote is: if we can guarantee Godfather 4 is as good as 1 or 2, then please can we have it? If not, forget about it.Andrew PulverThe Brady BunchView image in fullscreenA still from the film, The Brady Bunch Movie.Photograph: Elliott Marks/taken from picture libraryThe most incisive movie franchises reflect the time they arrived. By that measure, this would be the ideal moment to resurrect The Brady Bunch series. The original TV version of the show, which aired between 1969 and 1974, couldn’t have been more popular, or more insipid, inspiring no fewer than five spin-off specials for the small screen, each dimmer than the next. In stark contrast, the movie series, which spawned three projects between 1995 and 2002, took a far more sophisticated and satirical approach, positioning the naivety and self-absorption of its ’70s characters as hilarious foils to the larger world they now found themselves in. Fast forward several decades to the reactionary age of Trump. In key ways, today’s climate echoes the Nixonian era of the original TV series, which had been conceived, in part, to reasserted “traditional values” in the wake of the 60s revolution. But there’s a built-in twist with this franchise: The Bradys were always kind people at heart, so placing them in the context of today’s cruel cultural backlash could open up a whole new layer of nuance, allowing the family to find a sweet and funny balance between their simplistic notion of “normalcy” and the complex world we actually live in.Jim FarberWayne’s WorldView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ronald GrantIt has been over 30 years since Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar partied on from the basement set of their public access show in Aurora, Illinois, and the Saturday Night Live stars who originated them, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey, are not exactly at the peak of their fame. But that’s exactly why a new Wayne’s World is a promising idea: Just as Wayne and Garth are on the wrong side of middle age, nostalgic for their brief time in the national spotlight, rock music itself has been on the decline, relegated mostly to legacy tours aimed at gen-Xers with deep pockets and bad backs. That may sound like a melancholy premise for a franchise built on silly banter and pop-culture references, but a YouTube-channel revival of Wayne’s World seems plausible, as does the hilarious disconnect between old guys looking to “party on” and a younger generation unaccustomed to guitars getting plugged into amplifiers.Scott TobiasSpeciesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto/AllstarIf the three intervening decades since the release of Species – a period of time that’s yielded Scarlett Johansson in Under the Skin, Sally Hawkins’s fishy fornication in The Shape of Water, and not one but two azure-skinned, kinda-nude Mystiques – have taught us anything, it’s that the viewing public’s desire to make it with not-quite-human organisms is only growing in ardor. That’s the sturdy foundation upon which Roger Donaldson’s admirably smutty sci-fi staple of adolescent sleepovers was built, its servicing of peculiar fetishes less out of joint with the present than the conditions of its making. That MGM would throw $35m (in 90s dollars!) at a softcore B-movie scans as utterlyaliento today’s studio protocols, and as such, a similar investment would be the ideal tonic for an anemic summer movie landscape. Right now, every tentpole is grasping for an air of can’t-miss ceremony, which leads to leaden seriousness and self-importance; the people crave base pleasures, the dumb horny fun of getting ravished by a sextraterrestrial. (And just think of how well the novelization will sell with fan-fiction types.)Charles BramescoShanghai NoonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Touchstone/AllstarHow well do Shanghai Noon and Knights – the Owen Wilson/Jackie Chan martial arts/western buddy movies from the earlier noughties – stand up, 20 odd years on? A brief gander at the trailers feels … unencouraging but at the time I remember really liking these for their loose limbs and nimble feet, charming performances and some surprisingly good jokes. The first was set in the old west and had a lot of broad stroke nudge-nudge genre nods, the second in Victorianish London, with ribald support from Gemma Jones, Aidan Gillen and a very young Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Charlie Chaplin. A third was reportedly planned a few years later, set in Mexico, but it never happened because Jackie Chan “lost interest”. Maybe the healthy box office for the Karate Kid reboot might reignite that? Perhaps Owen Wilson is finding his mojo again, post Stick? Either way, it’s one breezy bit of entertainment I’d happily lap up again.Catherine ShoardExplore more on these topicsFilmfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a slightly frustrating experience, because the film has got loads going for it but could be just that little bit better. So many of the ingredients are right: it’s nicely shot and directed, and the casting feels on point – it’s not so much that you buy these evidently non-teenage actors as teenagers, but that their presence is part of a noble tradition of adults playing teens in films. It’s as cosily familiar to anyone who came of age in the 1990s as baggy skate trousers and a band hoodie.This sense of cultural time capsule extends to the characters themselves: they feel like 90s teenagers rather than modern-day ones, and that’s presumably a bonus for anyone drawn hither by DeLonge’s status as guitarist and singer for one of the more enduring bands of the pop punk explosion of that decade. These kids are crude and puerile, and it’s somehow fun to see the American Pie-type kid in a contemporary setting; certainly anyone with a fondness for that particular type of high school movie will inhale a pleasant hit of nostalgia without having to think too hard about whether there’s much value here.Where the film struggles is plot and structure, with events alternating between meandering and slightly overdetermined. The big tonal shifts are not necessarily a problem per se – it ought to be perfectly possible for a film to sustain childlike awe and wonder at the magic of the universe and also have a scene where a man gets apparently pissed on by Bigfoot – but there are some bumpy transitions between the different modes. It’s the sort of film that spends its rather too long runtime trying to be Stranger Things at some points, and at others is more closely aligned with Jackass, when it really ought to be a tighter, more casual affair.Monsters of California is on digital platforms from 7 JulyExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsComedy filmsBlink-182ComedyScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Almost 10 years ago, young Palestinian film-maker Mohamed Jabaly came from Gaza City to the Tromsø film festival in northern Norway with hismuch admired documentary Ambulance,about his time volunteering with an ambulance crew in Gaza in 2014. But the Rafah crossing with Egypt, Gaza’s only entry and exit point, was closed by Israel while Jabaly was away and he found himself stranded in the city. He used the time to shoot this documentary about his exile and about the Norwegian lens through which he poignantly views his beloved homeland.Jabaly’s friends and admirers in Tromsø rallied round and became his surrogate family, chiefly the heroically good-natured festival directors Hermann Greuel and Martha Otte. But when Jabaly applies for new visa to extend his stay, the online entry form refuses to accept “Palestinian” as his nationality and recognises him merely as “stateless”, which may well be a factor in causing his application to be refused. He can’t go … he can’t stay … time is running out … but Jabaly’s boyish, innocent enthusiasm seems inexhaustible (though there are moments when the same can’t exactly be said for Greuel, who sometimes comes across as Jabaly’s grumpy dad.)It’s an eye-opening and very approachable cine-essay about the real experience of exile. But a word about the title: the original Arabic is “al haya helwa”, which is what one of Jabaly’s friends cheerfully says to him on the phone. The echo of Roberto Benigni’s famous second world war Nazi death camp tragicomedy of the same title is, I think, accidental, though it brings us inadvertently and indirectly close to the worrying and problematic Israel-equals-Nazis jibe. But the film itself is too ingenuous and open for that.Life Is Beautiful is on True Story from 4 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGazaNorwayEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The detail about the bathtub is astonishingRebecca NicholsonTue 1 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 00.01 EDTShareNetflix is not always known for its restraint in the documentary genre, but with its outstanding recent filmGrenfell: Uncovered, and now Attack on London: Hunting the 7/7 Bombers, it appears to be finding a new maturity and seriousness in the field. There have been plenty of recent documentaries on the subject of the attacks and the sprawling investigation that followed – no surprise, given that it is the 20th anniversary this week – but there is still real depth to be found here.Over four parts, this thorough series unravels the initial attacks on the London transport system, which killed 52 people and injured more than 700, then follows that febrile month into the failed bombings of 21 July, and then thepolice shooting of the innocent Jean Charles de Menezes, a day later. The first 25 minutes or so simply recount those first attacks, compiling the story using phone pictures, news footage, occasional reconstructions, the infamous photographs of the injured pouring out of tube stations and accounts from survivors and the families of victims. Though it is by now a familiar story, this evokes the fear, confusion and panic of that day in heart-racing detail.View image in fullscreenJean Charles de Menezes, who was shot dead by police, after being mistaken for a suspect.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixIn those details, it is unsparing and frequently horrifying.Daniel Biddle lost his legs in the explosionat Edgware Road. His memory of locking eyes with the man who would shortly detonate the bomb in his bag is chilling, and his account of his fight to survive is as gripping as it is brutal. Others talk about the chaos, the noise, the screaming. One woman, who had managed to jump on the 30 bus near Tavistock Square in all of the transport disarray, recounts getting a text from her boyfriend at the time, saying: “You were right, they were bombs.” She had just put her phone back in her pocket after reading it, she says, when the bus exploded.Those attacks led to the largest criminal investigation ever seen in the UK, which is the primary focus of all four episodes. These were the first suicide bombings to take place on British soil, and police did not know, immediately, that the bombers had also blown themselves up. The revelation about how they came to suspect this – from evidence gathered in one of the tube carriages – is gruesome and fascinating. Explosives expert Cliff Todd talks of material and techniques he had never seen before, and the work that went into tracking down those responsible – and attempting to prevent further attacks – is astonishing in its scale and reach.This is not simply a police procedural – and that strengthens it greatly. It is impressively comprehensive, taking in the political and media climate of the time. There are interviews with Eliza Manningham-Buller, then director general of MI5, as well as the former prime minister Tony Blair. It even puts the crucial question to Blair: did the invasion of Iraq in 2003 lead directly to these attacks in Britain? His answer is politician-like and broad, but at least it asks the question, and offers context to attacks that did not happen in a vacuum.Another survivor,Mustafa Kurtuldu, recalls his experience of being on the tube near Aldgate when his train was blown up. When he was finally removed from the carriage and taken out of the station, police searched his bag. There is footage of an appearance on GMTV, just days later, when the presenter asks him how he feels about the attacks, “as a Muslim”. When the investigation moves to Beeston, in Leeds – where two of the four attackers were from – a youth worker in the Muslim community talks about the realisation that, as after 9/11, he would be asked, once more, to apologise for the actions of extremists.The third episode deals with the failed attacks on 21 July. There are eyewitness accounts of the explosions that went wrong – chilling and eerie, in their own way – the subsequent hunt for the four men who escaped is, again, astonishing in its scope. The next day, the 27-year-old Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes was on his way to work when he was described as behaving in an “edgy” manner by police who had mistakenly identified him as a suspect. He was shot dead. One of the officers who pulled the trigger speaks here, his identity disguised.Again, the strength of Attack on London is in the details. When officers finally caught up with Yassin Omar – who had attempted to blow up Warren Street and had fled to Birmingham disguised in a burqa – he was standing in a bath with a backpack on. Fittingly, though, this does not end with the attackers, but with the survivors and their relatives. It strikes a careful balance throughout.Attack on London: Hunting the 7/7 Bombers is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV review7 July London attacksreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was a glib, ahistorical comment, and was widely ridiculed. Shattered Lands, Sam Dalrymple’s urgent and ambitious debut, offers a more comprehensive rebuttal. Far from being a region riven by ancient hatreds, the lands that comprise modern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar – as well as parts of the Gulf – were divided up within living memory from an empire in retreat.“You can’t actually see the Great Wall of China from space,” Dalrymple begins, “but the border wall dividingIndiafrom Pakistan is unmistakable.” Stretching more than 3,000km and flanked by floodlights, thermal vision sensors and landmines, this is more a physical scar left by the hurried dismantling of British India than a traditional geopolitical divide. What might now seem like natural frontiers were shaped by five key events: Burma’s exit from the empire in 1937; the separation of Aden that same year, and of the Gulf protectorates in 1947; the division of India and Pakistan, also in 1947; the absorption of more than 550 princely states; and, in 1971, the secession of East Pakistan. Neither ancient nor inevitable, these lines were hastily drawn in committee rooms, colonial offices and war cabinets.What makes Shattered Lands remarkable is not just the breadth of its archival reach or the linguistic range of its interviews (from Bengali to Burmese, Urdu to Konyak), but the way it reframes south Asia’s history through the lens of disintegration.The son of acclaimed historian William Dalrymple, Sam nevertheless writes with a distinct sensibility. His work is shaped by a generational awareness of fractured identities, contested borders and the violence of nation-making. Where the elder Dalrymple has often chronicled the grandeur and decline of empires, the younger is more interested in how they splinter.And so, rather than treat the 1947 Partition as the singular rupture, Shattered Lands shows it to be one of many. The imperial map frayed gradually, and each unravelling left its own legacy of dispossession, nationalism and insurgency.Take Burma (now Mynamar), whose reconstitution as a crown colony in 1937 represented the first major partition of the Raj. Dismissed by many Indian elites as peripheral, Burma’s separation was both strategic and symbolic. Gandhi, often invoked as a unifier, was among its supporters. “I have no doubt in my mind that Burma cannot form part of India underswaraj[self rule],” he once wrote, aligning with the view of many Indian leaders who viewed India asBharat, the sacred geography referred to in the epicMahabharata, which excluded Burma and Arabia. Speaking to Rangoon’s Gujarati community, Gandhi told them they were “guests in a foreign country” despite many Burmese seeing themselves as Indian.That same year, as Burma and Aden were severed from the Indian Empire, the Congress party adoptedVande Mataramas India’s national song. In equating the nation with the Hindu goddess Durga, it alienated Muslims such as Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who increasingly saw Congress as a vehicle for Hindu majoritarianism. The ideological groundwork for the creation of Pakistan was already being laid.Among the most poignant moments in the book is a brief account of a Bible salesman from the Naga hills who volunteers to fight in the second world war. The Nagas are ethnically Tibeto-Burman peoples native to the borderlands of north-east India and north-west Myanmar, with distinct cultural traditions and a strong sense of nationhood that long predates these modern states. When asked if he is Indian or Burmese, the man replies, “I am a Naga first, a Naga second, and a Naga last.” The British system, designed to sort subjects into clear administrative categories, had no space for an affiliation that transcended colonial borders, and he was turned away.If there’s a critique to be made, it’s that Dalrymple’s account remains largely anchored to the great men of history: viceroys, premiers, politicians, princely elites. While there are flickers of grassroots perspective – such as the Naga would-be soldier and Rohingya families from the borderlands – they often play a supporting role in a narrative shaped by those drawing the maps. Yet perhaps that is the point: these were top-down decisions, made in grand offices, whose human cost has still not fully been reckoned with.More significantly, Shattered Lands speaks powerfully to our present moment. At a time of widespread historical amnesia – when revisionist governments across south Asia are remaking textbooks and erasing inconvenient truths – this book reminds us how recent, contested and fragile these dividing lines are.The prose is vivid, the storytelling cinematic, and Dalrymple draws together forgotten archives from Aden to Assam. Above all, there is a refusal to mythologise, and instead a clear-eyed history that lays bare the possibilities foreclosed by the region’s fragmentation.Shattered Lands: Five Partitions and the Making of Modern Asia by Sam Dalrymple is published by William Collins (£25).

Bundy was handsome, charming, extremely intelligent and sociopathic – “a sexual virus masquerading as a person”. There is persuasive evidence that he began killing much earlier but never this gluttonously. Almost all of his victims had long brown hair, parted in the middle. Sometimes he broke into the women’s houses while they slept, or snatched them off the street. Sometimes he would put on a sling or plaster cast and lure them into his car to help with some fabricated task. If one refused, he tried another, convinced that he would never be caught because they would never be missed. “I mean, there aresomany people,” he reasoned. “It shouldn’t be a problem.” Fraser lived on Mercer Island, Washington, near Bundy’s first hunting grounds. Recalling the moment he was first charged with murder in October 1976, she writes: “Everybody knows somebody who knows somebody who almost went out with Ted Bundy.”Bundy was one of at least half a dozen serial killers active in Washington in 1974. Within a few years, the state would produce the similarly prolific Randall Woodfield, known as the I-5 Killer, and Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer. Its murder rate rose by more than 30% in 1974 – almost six times the national average. In Tacoma, the city where Bundy grew up, Ridgway lived and Charles Manson was incarcerated for five years before starting his Family, murder was up 62%. It was as if a malevolent cloud had enveloped the region.Fraser argues that the epidemic was related to a real cloud, containing sulphur dioxide, arsenic and lead, which emanated from the smokestack of a smelting facility in Ruston, outside Tacoma. Nobody knows what cursed constellation of genes, upbringing, social circumstances, brain chemistry and plain old evil makes serial killers do what they do, but Fraser advances the lead-crime hypothesis. Lead in the blood has been shown to deplete brain volume in the part of the prefrontal cortex that regulates behaviour, especially in men. Today, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) defines more than 3.5 micrograms of lead per decilitre in a child’s blood as a cause for concern; the CDC’s first “safe” threshold, in 1960, was 60 micrograms. Yet as far back as the 1920s, doctors observed that lead poisoning from paint made children “crazy-like”. Fifty years later, the Ecologist asked “Does lead create criminals?” and the CDC connected lead to “functional derangements”.It is as haunting a nonfiction book as I have read in a long time. It gets into your bloodIt was also connected to money. The Guggenheim dynasty built its fortune on mining and smelting metal – its company Asarco was once responsible for 90% of US lead production. Asarco acquired the Ruston smelter in 1905 and converted it to refine copper, bleeding waste metals into the sky through what was for a while the world’s tallest smokestack. “The unwitting populace breathes [lead], eats it, and becomes it,” Fraser writes. In 1974, researchers found that the Ruston smelter was pumping 25lbs of lead dust and 58lbs of arsenic into the air every hour. That same year, Asarco celebrated its 75th anniversary by reporting record profits.Murderland sets its sights much higher than true crime. LikePrairie Fires, Fraser’s Pulitzer prize-winning 2017 biography of Laura Ingalls Wilder, it’s a big, ambitious story about the United States and the people it breeds. Then again, wasn’t it a work of true crime, Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood, that kickstarted literary nonfiction 60 years ago? Two recent tales of money and murder –Patrick Radden Keefe’s Empire of PainandDavid Grann’s Killers of the Flower Moon– also border Murderland. It is as hauntingly compulsive a nonfiction book as I have read in a long time. It gets into your blood.The occasional overripe passage and portentous epigram (Dante, Dostoevsky) is a small price to pay. Fraser’s lyrical present-tense prose is urgent yet tightly controlled as she digs into newspaper archives to create a pin-studded map of a country losing its mind. The bravura section about 1974, that annus horribilis, uses immersive day-by-day storytelling to braid the killings with the unravelling of President Nixon, the kidnapping of Patty Hearst and Fraser’s own coming of age on Mercer Island, where she dreams of killing her father, a violent, autocratic Christian Scientist. By evoking the victims’ lives and treading lightly around their grisly deaths, she avoids the clammy voyeurism that makes so many serial killer histories feel sordid.Fraser’s narrative map is criss-crossed with red threads. She pulls in erstwhile Tacoma residents such as Dune creator Frank Herbert, who said that his home town’s air was “so thick you can chew it”, and Dashiell Hammett, who fictionalised the city as “Poisonville” in Red Harvest. We meet Thomas Midgley Jr, the “one-man environmental disaster” responsible for both leaded gasoline and ozone-shredding chlorofluorocarbons, and Clair Patterson, the former Manhattan Project geochemist who used lead levels to accurately calculate the age of the Earth and then successfully campaigned to undo Midgley’s sin. We jump back to the second world war, whose ravenous appetite for lead and copper fuelled an environmental catastrophe. I wasn’t quite persuaded by the subplot about the Lake Washington Floating Bridge, an engineering atrocity whose careless design killed more people than Bundy, but I was never bored.Fraser evokes the fear and vulnerability of the age of serial killers – a time of unguarded hitchhikers, unlocked windows and police officers who have no idea who they’re dealing with. Most perpetrators of sexual violence are known to their victims, but in the US during the 1970s, almost 300 men were compulsively trolling for strangers to abuse and kill. That number plummeted, along with the overall crime rate, during the 1990s, which happened to be after lead was removed from gasoline and most of the big smelters closed down. The one at Ruston fell silent in 1985, thanks more to market forces than to regulation: the price of copper had crashed.Can the serial killers’ crimes be solely explained by the air they breathed, the water they drank and the metal in their brains? Surely not, but Fraser demonstrates enough correlation to make lead pollution a likely contributing factor. Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker, who terrorised California in the mid-80s, grew up near Asarco’s smelter in El Paso, Texas. Gary Ridgway was exposed to lead paint for three decades in his job spray-painting trucks. James Oliver Huberty, who shot dead 22 people in a McDonald’s in California in 1984, was riddled with cadmium from his work as a welder. He had complained that the fumes were “making me crazy”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The incompetence of law enforcers is twinned with the weakness of environmental regulators. The killers’ contempt for individual human lives finds an echo in the ruthless amorality of the corporations. In 1973, a fire destroyed the filtering system at the smelter at Bunker Hill, Idaho, octupling its emissions. An executive weighed the costs of temporary closure against the maximum likely settlement to affected families and kept it going.“They’re doing the devil’s business, which is no different from what Ted does,” Fraser writes, hot with indignation. “Like Ted, Bunker Hill has been killing people for years. It’s second nature.” In Murderland, some killers get caught, tried and punished. Others just get rich. For both, it’s a numbers game.Murderland: Crime and Bloodlust in the Time of Serial Killers by Caroline Fraser is published by Fleet (£25).

That’s the question posed by Moonlight Peaks, the gen Z-coded, achingly TikTok-ready supernatural life sim. Inspired by the popularity of “cosy games” such as Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, Moonlight Peaks drapes you in the cape of Dracula’s daughter, who has fled her father’s corpse-ridden home to start a new, peaceful life.Soon, she settles among werewolves and witches in the supernatural farming town of Moonlight Peaks, where she grows crops and rears animals instead of subsisting on the blood of innocents. Both cosy and creepy, the game has you creating your own plant-based blood substitutes, befriending the town’s residents and fixing a whole host of problems left in daddy Dracula’s wake.While farming and decorating make the core of the game, its creators tell me there are a surprising number of story-led quests to find. “We joke that you’re the town therapist,” says Mia Boas, art director, “because you arrive and have to help everyone solve their family issues.” From calming worried werewolves to quelling quarrelling mermaids and even flirting with the grim reaper – plus flower-arranging and embroidery minigames - developer Little Chicken promises there will be more than just perfecting your haunted homestead.“We decided it should be a cute and cosy experience, through and through,” says Yannis Bolman, CEO game director. “When we first started out, we had a mechanic where you could bite every bystander. It just felt off, because you’re trying to make friends with these people, and then you’re biting them? It just felt really weird.”Like any social-media-friendly life sim, Moonlight Peaks has a range of romance options for players to sink their teeth into. “Once you become romantically interested, you can go on dates like stargazing, marshmallow roasting … And if you do well enough, you can get married,” says Bolman. “The ultimate step is, you can turn them into a vampire, too. But you’re biting them with consent, of course. They’llaskyou to bite them.” In an adorable touch, finding your fanged soulmate turns your home’s single coffin into a double.Bolman and Boas tell me that fan feedback has helped guide the direction of the game, which is already attracting an excitable – and predominantly female - fanbase. With a vibrant art style that looks surprisingly slick considering the size of its team, Moonlight Peaks looks set to fill a Twilight-shaped gap in the sim market.Moonlight Peaks is out onPCin 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCShareReuse this content"

Now, 20 years on, Hicks is performing her beloved jazz standards on stage – and remembering those who saved her lifeEmine SanerTue 1 Jul 2025 10.34 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareWhen Gill Hicks takes to the stage, she says with a small laugh that she hopes she can get through just the opening number, “without breaking down in a heap”. It will be emotional. Wryly titled Still Alive (and Kicking), the show is Hicks’s own way to mark the 20th anniversary of the suicide bombings on London’s public transport that killed 52 people, and injured more than 700 – Hicks, a survivor, lost both her legs. In her show, she weaves her story of survival and resilience around singing the jazz standards she has always loved.She has already performed a version of it in Australia, where she now lives, but for its London outing she hopes around 20 members of the medical and emergency teams who attended that day will be in the audience. “They are extraordinary,” she says, “and their actions not only saved my life that morning, but I honestly believe they have saved me every single day since.”After using her scarf as a tourniquet around what was left of her legs, Hicks made what she describes as a contractThat July morning, Hicks was on her way to work when one of the four suicide bombers who targeted London detonated his bomb in her tube carriage, somewhere between King’s Cross and Russell Square. Hicks is believed to have been the last survivor pulled from the wreckage some 40 minutes later, her injuries so bad that when she arrived at hospital she was simply labelled: “One unknown, estimated female”.Before that, lying in the dark smoke-filled carriage, having used her scarf as a tourniquet around what was left of her legs to stop the bleeding, Hicks remembers making what she describes as a contract. She would get the chance to live, and she would make it count. “That’s really helped me continue to get up every day regardless of the situation I’m in. There’s a purpose and an absolute sense that there’s things to be done that help remind us of our shared humanity.”View image in fullscreenHeld with love and intention for survival … Hicks and PC Andy Maxwell, who came to her aid.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAShe had lived in London for more than 20 years, working in architecture and design, then after the bombings dedicating her time to organisations that promoted peace, before moving to Australia in 2013, the same year she had her daughter. The last time Hicks came to London was in 2015 to commemorate 10 years since the bombings. But she doesn’t associate the city with trauma. That has been a conscious choice, she says. “That’s the one power that we all have, to be able to choose how we react and how we respond. Part of the honour of life for me is constantly choosing to live from a place of gratitude and positivity.”Twenty years, she says, is long enough to consider the depth of the impact on her. “With the nature of my disability, I’m never detached from what’s happened,” she says. Forgiveness hasn’t felt necessary, or even possible given the man who blew up that tube carriage died in the blast, “so he’s taken away this exchange. It’s also made me feel I don’t have to really consider my feelings about him. I have to instead focus on what I do with my life, and how do I honour my life?” She is also always aware of those who didn’t come home that day.When something like this happens, it’s so easy to lose yourself, because your identity is skewedThe idea of “healing” or “recovery” is difficult – “My legs won’t grow back. I live in quite a lot of constant pain” – but for Hicks, the arts have been part of reclaiming her sense of self. She was a jazz musician before the bombings, but she never thought she would be able to sing or perform again. Her injuries left her with hearing loss, and one functioning lung. “It took me months to learn how to speak again,” she says. “When something like this type of life-altering event happens, it’s so easy to lose yourself, because your identity is skewed. Suddenly you’re a disabled person, so that’s one label. You’re a double amputee, that’s another. You’re a survivor, or are you a victim? I’ve been given a new life, but it’s this constant struggle of how do I do this?” The arts, including her vibrant paintings (which will be projected during the show) and working with the violinist Julian Ferraretto (also part of the show) represented “this beautiful piece of life before, that came back but with a different meaning, so it’s actually more powerful”.Instead of thinking about the hate and extremism of that catastrophic moment, Hicks prefers to focus on the love and compassion she was shown in the months and years afterwards. She tracked down as many people involved in her care as she could, “to look into their eyes and say thank you.” Several, including one of the first paramedics who entered Hicks’s carriage, have become close friends.This is what she wants her show to bring to people. “Through the addition of music, it becomes a real celebration of not only life, but of who we are as human beings – the extraordinary, unconditional love that I was shown as a person without identity, ‘One unknown, estimated female.’ To think that my body wasn’t just passed from one person to the next, it was absolutely held with love and intention for survival. Who I am today is because of how powerful that love and care was on that morning. I think the undercurrent for me of 20 years is: how do I tell that? How do I be the reminder?”Still Alive (and Kicking) is atWilton’s Music Hall, London, on 9 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageJazz7 July London attacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s both an opera masquerading in oratorio’s clothing, and a moralising object lesson in knowing your place. “Nature to each allots its proper sphere,” sings the chorus as the overly ambitious heroine goes up in smoke, charred to a crisp by the divine brilliance of her adulterous lover. It’s a point hammered home in Oliver Mears’ astute new production where the hapless Semele is a go-getting servant trapped in a palace with a slippery cad, his vengeful spouse and their glassy-eyed children.If you take William Congreve’s libretto at face value, Semele – the daughter of King Cadmus of Thebes – is a vain fly-by-night, easy prey for the jealous Juno who eggs her on to insist that her mighty paramour appears in all his flesh-consuming majesty rather than human form. Mears takes a more interesting approach, seeing in Semele a tenacious contender who honestly believes that Jupiter intends to make her his life partner. It’s clear, however, from the bookended byplay in the overture and finale that she is merely the latest in a long line of discarded women to be consumed in the royal incinerator. A cupboardful of urns, labelled Calisto, Io, Leda etc is a suitably chilling touch.Flames are pretty much everywhere in Mears’ occasionally fussy staging, from the post-coital cigarettes to the toasty fire and ominous chimney that dominate Jupiter’s love nest. Annemarie Woods’ chic sets and costumes place us in the here and now – the royal residence might be a luxe Parisian hotel – while Fabiana Piccioli’s lighting turns from playful to horrifying at the flick of a switch. The direction has its inconsistencies, and whether Mears earns the horror of his final 15 minutes given the lighter tone adopted for much of the preceding two hours is questionable, but there’s no denying the effectiveness of the denouement.View image in fullscreenDeliciously spiteful … Alice Coote (Juno) and Brindley Sherratt (Somnus) in Handel’s Semele.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianChristian Curnyn leads a respectable account of the score, though the Orchestra of theRoyal Opera Houseis occasionally too loud for the lighter voices and several singers could benefit from crisper diction. Curiously, the chorus sounds better offstage than on.With her filigree upper register, Pretty Yende is vocally appealing in the title role, making relatively light work of Myself I shall adore. She’s spirited too, though the character is sometimes sketchily defined. Ben Bliss is a smooth, articulate Jupiter, dazzling in coloratura passages and elegant in Where’er you walk. Carlo Vistoli makes for a fruity, frenetic Athamas, with Niamh O’Sullivan an intense, velvet-voiced Ino and Marianna Hovanisyan a sweet-toned Iris. Brindley Sherratt does sterling duty as Semele’s run-ragged father and the shabby God of Sleep, but it’s Alice Coote’s deliciously spiteful, yet ultimately abject Juno that gets to the emotional heart of Mears’ bleak reimagining.AtRoyal Opera House, London, until 18 July.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

As Oasis prepare for their return gig on Friday, it’s worth asking what their cultural impact has beenTue 1 Jul 2025 06.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 06.38 EDTShareIn the peculiar counterfactual 2019 romcom Yesterday, the Beatles suddenly and mysteriously vanish from history, remembered by just one man. In the interests of a cheap joke, writer Richard Curtis improbably suggests that every band in the world would still exist in the Beatles’ absence, bar one:Oasis.But what about a world without Oasis? As the Gallaghers themselves would admit, they weren’t innovators like the Beatles, whose every move changed the course of popular music. If Noel had never joined Liam’s band at the end of 1991, Creation Records might well have gone bust, Manchester City would have had less pop cachet, and The Royle Family would have needed a different theme tune, but music wouldn’t have sounded significantly different. Today, new bands are more likely to cite the spiky intelligence of Radiohead or the Smiths than Oasis’s broad strokes, and very few younger than Arctic Monkeys expects to fill stadiums.What Tracey Emin beautifully described as the “brightness of things happening” did not depend on Oasis – from club culture to the Young British Artists, Trainspotting to Kate Moss, New Labour to Euro 96, the era’s colour was turned up with or without them. Nor didBritpopflow from Oasis. By the time Definitely Maybe came out in August 1994, Suede and Pulp were crashing the charts and Blur’s Parklife was on its way to going four times platinum, their paths smoothed by Matthew Bannister’s rejuvenation of Radio 1. The commercial bar for indie rock had already been raised, up to a point.Instead, as the mania around their reunion demonstrates, the Gallaghers’ unique achievement was unprecedented scale. They made alternative culture mainstream, because nobody else craved success so unapologetically: daytime airplay, No 1s, stadiums, the whole shebang. For some of their peers, this breakneck acceleration and magnification produced new opportunities. Oasis’s example made possible the second acts of Manic Street Preachers, the Verve and Robbie Williams, before inspiring the formation of younger bands such as Coldplay, the Killers, Arctic Monkeys and Kasabian. It wasn’t the sound so much as the possibility: music for the masses.View image in fullscreenMusic for the masses … The crowd at Knebworth, 1996.Photograph: Hayley Madden/ShutterstockOasis made dreaming big not just an option but a necessity. “It wasn’t: ‘Who’s good?’” the Boo Radleys’ Martin Carr complained of the cash-burning A&R hunt for the next Oasis. “It was: ‘Who’s going to be famous?’” Bands like his, accustomed to modest commercial goals, were suddenly deemed failures if their latest single missed the Top 20, and derailed by these impossible expectations. Even Damon Albarn and Jarvis Cocker soon overdosed on pop celebrity and sought stranger escape routes.Oasis alone sought and achieved true mass appeal by tapping into a communal, aspirational hedonism that suited the times. But in shrugging off indie’s underdog mentality, they also devalued its eccentric outsider’s point of view. The Britpop boom scrambled the music papers’ bearings, turning them into cheerleaders for what was popular rather than champions of what was interesting. “[Oasis] shut down the argument, shut down experimentation,” the artist Jeremy Deller once complained. “They took all the oxygen out of the scene and became the only band.”Nothing summed up the new sports-like obsession with victory more than Blur and Oasis’s news-making battle for No 1 in August 1995, which also established a crude and artificial class dynamic. Contrary to the rich and varied history of British popular music, the discourse around Oasis defined the only “authentic” working-class music as simple, direct, white, laddishly male and aggressively anti-intellectual. Noel insisted (sometimes disingenuously) that his songs meant next to nothing – they were “just about a feeling”. Oasis were a vibe, an energy, and one that lent itself to gung-ho patriotism. Contrast Albarn’s sharp ambivalence about British identity with the blunt hurrah of Noel’s union jack guitar. Oasis can’t be blamed for all these unintended consequences but they were the giant catalyst.‘Liam had been drinking all night. Noel was not in a great mood’: photographers pick their best Oasis shotRead moreToday, the Gallaghers are in every 90s nostalgia montage – Liam in bed on the cover of Vanity Fair’s Cool Britannia issue and Noel shaking hands with Tony Blair at Number 10. They remain a magnetic force, bending our collective memory towards them.So let’s again imagine that Oasis never came to pass. What’s different? Most of 90s culture proceeds anyway, only its busy diversity is more apparent. Britpop remains, but in a less anthemically populist form, closer to journalist Stuart Maconie’s original 1993 manifesto of “glamour, wit and irony”. Alternative music still crosses over but its growth is more sustainable and commercial success does not become a do-or-die metric. Tabloid gossip columns rarely overlap with the NME. Flags and politicians are still regarded with suspicion. The lows aren’t as low – but maybe the highs aren’t as high.Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockBritpopcommentShareReuse this content"

Arecording of the eventcaptures the Welsh writer’s speaking voice in what would be one of his last public appearances before his death 12 days later at the age of 39. Amid the pops, ticks and crackles of the tape, we hear Thomas on sparkling form, telling the audience about an experimental play he had been to see “in a cellar or a sewer or somewhere”, accompanied by the US playwright Arthur Miller. In the middle of the performance, he recounts, Miller turned to him and remarked, “Good god, this is avant garde. In a moment the hero’s going to take his clothes off.” Roars of laughter follow this anecdote, before questions turn to Thomas’s radio play Under Milk Wood, which had enjoyed a number of public readings in New York City that year, billed as a “new comedy”.Under Milk Wood is quite a different sort of play to the avant garde production Miller and Thomas had attended. Set in the fictional Welsh town of Llareggub (“Bugger all” backwards), it documents the dreams, digressions and foibles of the town’s inhabitants in a blaze of poetic beauty and vibrant satire. It is a “play for voices”, borne out of the world of the mid-20th-century BBC radio feature – a fluid, experimental genre in which narration, acting, song, verse, music and sound effects were mixed together often without the constraint of a dramatic plot. Thomas himself was a gifted radio actor and had taken part in a number of BBC radio features, includingThe Dark Tower by Louis MacNieceandIn Parenthesisby David Jones. When Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954 on the BBC’s Third Programme, the cast was led by his friend and acting companion, Richard Burton.View image in fullscreenA gifted radio actor … Dylan Thomas at the BBC in 1948.Photograph: Pictures from History/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesI was only dimly aware of Thomas’s radio play when I was first approached about adapting it. I knew that the script contained extensive passages of memorable narration and this, alone, was enough of a draw for me. The proposition – from Nova Music Opera, Presteigne festival and Spitalfields music festival – was to compose a music-theatre adaptation of Thomas’s radio play in an abridged form combining narration, acting and singing, in the vein of Stravinsky’s l’Histoire du Soldat. I was both curious and cautious. Since its first broadcast, Milk Wood has been through all sorts of transformations – from staged theatrical productions to feature films, an animated version, a ballet, a contemporary classical opera and even a jazz suite. The question of what it means to “stage” a radio play has been debated vigorously. Then there is the challenge of setting Thomas’s words to music, given that his language already possesses such a distinctive music, shape and rhythm of its own.Exploring relationships between words and music has marked much of my work to date. I have created musical settings of poetry, fragments of prose and private letters by figures such as Rainer Maria Rilke, Don Paterson, Joseph Roth and Aubrey Beardsley. Setting words to music can be a minefield for composers. As Virginia Woolf remarked in her1937 broadcast On Craftsmanship: “Words, English words, are full of echoes, of memories, of associations – naturally. They have been out and about on people’s lips, in their houses, in the streets, in the fields, for so many centuries.” Words are living entities, but composers attempt to capture them, to fix them in a foreign structure as a jeweller would a precious stone in a metal setting.View image in fullscreenPeter O’Toole, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in a behind-the-scenes moment from the 1971 film of Under Milk Wood, directed by Andrew Sinclair.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesMy first task was to cut 90 minutes of material down to just under an hour. I shrunk it by degrees until I arrived at a shortened version of Milk Wood that preserved Thomas’s temporal arc stretching from dawn to dusk. Many of Llareggub’s most notorious residents remain in my text: Captain Cat with his seafaring memories, Mr Pugh who studies a book titled Lives of the Great Poisoners as he prepares to murder his wife, Willy Nilly the postman who reads other people’s letters, Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard and the ghosts of her two henpecked husbands, Polly Garter pursuing endless liaisons, Mr Waldo singing drunkenly in the pub, and the dead lovers who surface to haunt the living.Scenes from Under Milk Wood is written for a small mixed instrumental ensemble and a cast of one narrator, two singers and two actors who perform multiple roles. Like a fox in a hen house, I’ve enjoyed running riot with the music, devising a score that includes atmospheric underscoring for narration and spoken poetry, lyrical and declamatory operatic singing, and my attempt at a kind of modern folksong. The hybrid form of the piece connects back to the experimental radio feature world that first gave rise to Milk Wood, and the decision by our director Harvey Evans to return the production to a semi-staged radio studio is therefore fitting. Our cast turn up in the mid-1950s for a live recording session and endeavour, with scripts in hand, to bring Thomas’s eccentric characters to life, just as the original broadcasting group did over 70 years ago.View image in fullscreenNinfea Cruttwell-Reade, composerPhotograph: PRFor today’s audiences, the radio studio staging of Scenes from Under Milk Wood also provides an opportunity to be transported, in the same manner as the listeners of the 1954 broadcast, into what Evans describes as the “living mosaic” of Llareggub. The music seeks to celebrate the comedic aspects of Thomas’s loving and humorous portrait of human imperfection, bringing back into focus his subtle invitation to audiences to learn to laugh at themselves. For, as one famous jester in another age memorably put it, “Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun, it shines everywhere”.The world premiere of Scenes from Under Milk Wood is atSpitalfields festival, London, on 2 July.

I knew so much more about him as a person.”This moment of connection captures the essence ofKids of the Colony,a grassroots travel series on YouTube created by three childhood friends from Islington: Abubakar, Kayum Miah and Zakariya Hajjaj, all 23. In a series of chatty vlogs that thrive on their offbeat humour and close friendship, the trio provide a rich travelogue of culture and identity as they explore the countries of their parents’ birth.The idea came to Abubakar while contemplating his next steps after graduating from Oxford University in 2023. “I just thought about the places that we came from,” he says, reflecting on the layered identity of growing up inLondonwith ties elsewhere. Abubakar is Somali, Kayum is Bengali and Zakariya is of Moroccan and English descent.View image in fullscreenKids of the Colony in Somaliland, where Abubakar has roots.Photograph: Abubakar Finiin“My uni life was so different from my home life. I wanted to do something positive that inspires people,” Abubakar says. After his pitches to media production companies were ignored, he turned to his school friends. “We were already planning to travel that summer, so I asked Kayum and Zakariya if they wanted to go to Bangladesh.”“I was in love with the idea from the jump,” Zakariya says. “I’m a guy who loves travelling – especially if my friends are there.”It was also a no-brainer for Kayum: “I couldn’t let you [Abubakar] go to Bangladesh on your own.”Despite lacking a studio or a big budget, they gathered some friends to help them film. “TravelYouTubeis such a huge mini-genre,” says Abubakar. “But it felt weird that people only go to the markets with a GoPro and try to haggle prices. You can’t go to a country and not show the culture or local traditions.”Their rules were simple: no resorts, no tourist traps and no fancy restaurants – just real life, as lived by the people who call these places home.“It’s always important for us to have someone that’s connected to that country on the trip,” Abubakar adds. “I think that’s what differentiates us.”We’ve had teachers telling us that they’ve been showing our videos in geography classesTheir first trip was to Bangladesh, where Kayum’s family is from. Serving as an unofficial tour guide, he took them to try on alungi(traditional men’s skirt) and sample street food from Sylhet, in the country’s north-east. They swam in afukri, a large communal pond dug by locals, and marvelled at cows wandering freely along the roads.“A lot of Abubakar and Zakariya’s first-time experiences were new to me, too,” says Kayum, despite having spent his summer holidays in Bangladesh. “But seeing their reactions to things I viewed as normal, like the cows, was hilarious.”One of the more moving, yet humorous, moments comes when they chat with Kayum’s grandfather, a man who insists he’s 120, though no one can confirm this. “It was amazing to see my friends merge with my family in my homeland, especially when my nieces and nephews played football with us,” Kayum says. “It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.”The second series took them toSomaliland, where Abubakar has roots. There, they servedshaah(spiced tea) in a local cafe, caught fish in the northern port city of Berbera, and joined the Eid prayer with thousands of others at the national stadium in the capital, Hargeisa. In one episode, they’re invited to try martial arts at a local taekwondo studio. Kayum, who had never stepped inside a dojo before, was struck by the energy. “They didn’t have much funding – they were just doing it themselves,” he says. “But inside, there was so much talent.”Then came the trio’s favourite moment – sharing an urn of camel milk. “Everyone started dropping like flies – there was very little footage the day after that,” Abubakar laughs, recalling how everyone but him got sick. The chaotic aftermath of Zakariya and Kayum splayed out on sofas, of course, made it into the vlog. “It was so funny to me that I drank it and just had immunity.”Though not yet featured on their channel, the boys also visited Morocco, Zakariya’s home country. In oneTikTok clip, they’re serenaded by a street performer whom they dub the “Moroccan Shakira”, somewhat questionably. “We’re planning to revisit and film another series,” Zakariya tells me.View image in fullscreenWith a street performer they dubbed the “Moroccan Shakira”.Photograph: Abubakar FiniinSince uploading their first video in November 2023, Kids of the Colonyhas attracted a loyal audience. Their Instagram following has passed35,000, theirTikTokhas racked up more than one million likes when combined withAbubakar’s own page. Their fans include everyone from NBA star Kyrie Irving to Amelia Dimoldenberg of YouTube’s celebrity interview show Chicken Shop Date. “We’ve had people recognising us in public and teachers telling us [on social media] that they’ve been showing our videos in geography classes,” Kayum says.“We wanted to create a fun family show where parents can watch and remember their childhood,” Abubakar explains.The desire to represent their roots and reframe negative perceptions is reflected in their channel name, which was coined by Abubakar after learning about third-culture kids – individuals who grow up in a culture different from their parents’. He says he wanted to come up with his own version: “[The name] references children of immigrants from ex-colonies. But when we come together, we can create a colony of our own – like ants – to be a nice and powerful force.”Through film, writing and the arts, children of immigrants are trying to forge an identity. We hope our platform celebrates that identityAfter filming in each others’ countries of origin, Zakariya is keen to keep going: “I want to go to every country. I love travelling, so this gives me more of a reason.” Meanwhile, Kayum sees the show as a chance to reclaim misrepresented parts of the world: “I’d love to visit Palestine. I want to go to places that get the worst media coverage.”While they’re still self-funding, all working and using their savings to pay for the filming and travel, the trio feel the investment has been worth it: “So many things are happening from us coming together, so it feels very good to see the results,” says Kayum.“We grew up in working-class families,” Abubakar says, “but through film, writing and the arts, children of immigrants are trying to forge an identity. We hope our platform celebrates that identity.”As Kayum puts it: “It’s about preserving culture.”And in doing so, Kids of the Colony reshapes the narrative around where we get to travel and whose stories are documented.Explore more on these topicsTravelBangladesh holidaysSomalia holidaysMorocco holidaysSomalilandYouTubeFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But between bouts of illness, relentless admin and crushing loneliness, many have found comfort in the 9-5 back homeEmily BrattTue 1 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTShareJason, a 34-year-old American, is stumbling around the pool table, cue in hand. Five Saigon beers later, he will shuffle out, clamber on to a scooter and drive back to his beach hut. I know this because I’ve seen the same routine for the past four nights. Meanwhile, Eloise, 38, a French national, is gyrating on the dancefloor. Earlier, on the beach, she told me about her big bitcoin dreams – although she hasn’t got the funds she needs yet. Then there is Bex, a Briton in her late 50s whose eyes are large and wild because she has just popped a pill. She spends only a month a year in the UK – not because she wants to, she says, just to check in with family who are worried about her.Here we are together on this paradise island in south-east Asia, laptops closed for the day. This is the digital nomad dream, isn’t it? This is what adventure and freedom looks like, right? We’re happy!Or are we all just pretending?The number of digital nomads – people who work remotely from no fixed location – has risen dramatically in the past few years. About 18.1 million American workers described themselves as digital nomads in 2024, an increase of 147% since 2019, according to the recruitment firmMBO Partners. The research firmPublic Firstestimates that there are 165,000 British citizens working as digital nomads and that 7% of the adult population say they are very likely to live and work as a digital nomad in the next three years.View image in fullscreenBratt and her brother in Vũng Tàu, VietnamHowever, for some digital nomads, the shine may be wearing off. I know, because, until recently, I was one of them. In 2022, I went freelance in my job as a writer. The cost of living in the UK was rising and I could either pay about £1,000 a month for a flat (outside London) or pet-sit and live, for free, in other people’s homes while saving for a house deposit. It was a no-brainer.I pet-sat in the UK and in sunnier climes, too. Flights were my biggest outgoing (when I wasn’t pet-sitting, I stayed with friends and family who lived abroad), but chasing the sun was still cheaper than paying rent and bills in the UK and it allowed me to save money. I knew a bit about living and working abroad, having not long returned from two years working in Japan and a year in Australia before that. So, I surmised, it would be absurd not to head to a beach bar in south-east Asia and work freelance from there.Initially, I adored the lifestyle. I worked my own hours, usually during the day, for a handful of clients. Come evening, I would hop on the back of a scooter and drive through plumes of street-food smoke to meet new friends on the beach and sip from coconuts. It all felt wonderfully freeing.But somewhere around the midway mark of my most recent six-month trip, something happened. A whisper of a thought began to emerge at the back of my mind. By the final month, it was a pervasive shriek: “What am I doing?”View image in fullscreen‘The difficulty of it all exhausted me’ ... Corina at Machu Picchu, PeruCorina, a former digital nomad from Australia, began to be haunted by the same question. As she was able to run her property business remotely, she had headed to South America. “I was exploring, meeting different people – it was great. I felt real freedom. But then, suddenly, I just started questioning whether what I was doing was what I really wanted.”A seasoned traveller who has visited 40 countries, Corina doesn’t easily feel homesick. She describes the thrill of crossing into Venezuela, spending six months there and feeling “wild and free”. However, she says: “At some point, the difficulty of it all exhausted me. I just never knew what was coming. The hot water and power would stop at a random time each day. Taxi drivers relied on spoken directions and I only had elementary Spanish. And there was no currency. You had to pay for things either in cryptocurrency – using an app which only sometimes worked – or in US dollars, which required finding someone you trusted to trade with.”For me, any memories of challenges I had faced would evaporate after a week back in overcast England. The thought of jetting off again was the only thing that lit a spark in me. But just as with any addiction, satisfying a craving for travel with more travel didn’t fix anything. I had the sense that I was avoidant rather than liberated.I had conflated digital nomadism with holidaying. But it turned out that working in a cafe was still working in a cafe, whether you are in a Starbucks in Swindon or a beach bar in Bali. I found myself resenting having to work when there was so much to explore.View image in fullscreen‘I questioned whether I was really doing what I wanted’ ... Corina working remotely in MexicoPerversely, many digital nomads end up doing a global tour of Starbucks. “It was the one place with reliable wifi,” says Matt, 25, a fellow British writer and on-off nomad since 2019. “I hated that I was in there, but finding somewhere to work was always difficult.” He, too, was plagued by unsettling existential questions as he fulfilled his dream of travelling. “It started early on,” he says. “I got to my rented apartment in Kuala Lumpur, which had a rooftop pool, and I thought: ‘Wow, this is everything I’ve dreamed of!’ But the excitement wore off and I had this deep ache inside me. I thought I was just in the wrong place.”At one point, Matt visited 12 countries in 90 days as part of a two-year trip. “At every new place I arrived at, I remember thinking: ‘What now?’ When I was young, I thought that success meant being able to travel the world. But I didn’t feel successful; I felt lonely and exhausted. I wanted to go and explore, but I just didn’t have the energy.”According to one study from theUniversity of Groningen in the Netherlands, permanently living a nomadic lifestyle could have “significant implications for an individual’s life course”, affecting employment opportunities as well as mental wellbeing. The study concluded that “digital nomads perceive their fast-travelling lifestyle as temporary phase in their lives” and that many will “eventually search for more stability and continuity”, either by settling back in their home countries or permanently migrating.Caterina, a project manager from Italy, found the lifestyle started to affect her health. Working remotely for a tech startup in 2022, she and her partner spent stints in Europe, Asia and the US. “I hadn’t accounted for all the extra admin the lifestyle entailed,” she says. “We were always booking flights, finding accommodation and muddling through in other languages – all while juggling full-time jobs,” she says. “We started getting sick more frequently than normal and we could never fully recover because we weren’t in a comfortable environment. And then we’d be off on another trip.”View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t have energy to explore’ ... Matt in Sydney, AustraliaI recall a period of my travels in 2023in Vietnam when a bout of tonsillitis was bookended by rounds of food poisoning – all in the same two months. I shivered and sweated my way from Ho Chi Minh to Vũng Tàu, on board a two-hour ferry, silently willing the journey to end. But I should confess: I was doing digital nomading lite. The ferry would drop me almost directly at my brother’s front door in Vũng Tàu, where he lived at the time. I could slide into the spare room bed and lock myself away, free of obligations.Unlike Matt, who – barely out of school – set out alone for unfamiliar countries, I based myself in places where I already had connections, staying with or near friends for extended periods. For three months in Sydney, I recreated the expat life I had had there several years before: working during the day from my accommodation, swimming in the sea on my lunch break and meeting friends in the evenings and at weekends.And yet my worries persisted. I was neither holidaying in Sydney, nor living there. I watched friends go about their days, following through on plans made before I arrived and making new ones for after I had gone. I was like a time traveller, temporarily injected into their world from another realm.I began to suspect that much of digital nomad life was performative. In Bali, I had heard a man brag about his effortless passive income, before witnessing him looking stressed on a video call at 10pm. I watched a life coach who preached positivity on her travel vlog shout at a local waitress because her steak was overdone. And I winced at the number of 25-year-olds calling themselves entrepreneurs (although that might just be the Briton in me recoiling from American confidence).The word “settle” had been anathema to me for so long. Then, one day in Sydney, I chatted with a local person at the Collaroy rock pool before spending the evening cackling with old friends over dinner – and I realised the city wasn’t the main determinant of my happiness. It was people and community – which I could find at home and enjoy without a cutoff point if I stayed in one place.View image in fullscreen‘The lifestyle required so much admin’ ... Caterina in Seoul, South KoreaGradually, the idea of having a space that was mine, neighbours to get to know, regular exercise classes to attend and a coffee shop where they knew my name felt exciting. I had once laughed in the face of routine; now, I knew it was crucial if I wanted to build a life worth living.I knew coming home wouldn’t be easy. As the plane from Ho Chi Minh to London descended, I looked out over England’s patchwork fields and was unsure what I was returning to or for. Those first few months were spent flitting between my family home and more pet-sitting stays. Friends and family wanted to know “my plan” and I felt more diminished each time I told them I didn’t know. The reverse culture shock was acute. I discovered that people don’t ask about your travels because the experiences are too unrelatable. Plus, a relationship I had formed overseas, and was trying to maintain, was nosediving and it was hard to discuss it with friends, since they didn’t know the person or the context. I was disoriented, but also felt as if I had never been away.I accepted a job that – although still remote – had stipulations on where I could be based. I signed a lease on a flat in Brighton, keeping me in one place for the next year at least. Some nomads, including me three years ago, might view this as incarceration, but I felt liberated.Corina, knowing certain aspirations could be fulfilled only by being in one place, returned to Australia. But she took it one step further: for the first time in more than a decade, she got an office job. “Ironically, having a job has given me a break,” she says. “When I first returned, I spent two weeks visiting my sister in another city. Because I work for myself, I could do that. But while I was there, I was always taking calls and she told me I wasn’t present. And I started to wonder: when do I actually have my own time?”View image in fullscreen‘I don’t regret a second of my travels’ … Bratt in BaliInitially, Corina thought that returning to an office would be like “caging a wild beast”, but it has had an unexpectedly positive impact on her life. “Having to come into an office, I’m forced to be productive … I realised that I’m less efficient when I’m in charge of my own timetable: I stay up late and wake up late, procrastinate, berate myself for being lazy and then end up doing the thing I was supposed to do at 9am at 3am out of last-minute guilt. But now I have structure and, because I’ve only got short, set windows of time in which to get things done, I’m suddenly able to do them.”After five years of on-off travel, a collapsed lung in Calgary was the final straw for Matt. “I was in hospital, I couldn’t breathe properly and I had no one,” he says. His travel insurance wouldn’t cover the cost of medical care and he had to use his savings to pay for treatment. “It was a total mess and I felt really isolated and lonely.” Matt made a full recovery, but returned to the UK and is enjoying spending time with family.After four years of living in Airbnbs, Caterina tells me, with a mix of excitement and trepidation, that she and her partner have just signed a lease on a New York apartment, “although it took us a year to commit to signing”, she laughs.None of us are ruling out travelling again. But we all agree that, for now, it’s time for some continuity and a mental reset – and to see what that brings. So far, it’s brought newfound joy for life’s little things. For Caterina, that is having quality, sharp kitchen knives. For Matt, it’s a library card. For me, it’s a membership to a swimming pool.Like all the former digital nomads I’ve spoken to, I don’t regret a second of my travels. I am immensely grateful to have had an opportunity that many aren’t afforded – and I often felt that gratitude intensely as I looked on, in awe, at the foreign landscapes I found myself in.And while I can’t hike up a Balinese volcano tomorrow morning to watch the sunrise, the sunrise looks pretty good from the pebbles of Brighton beach.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A concealed elasticated waistband feels chill but looks sleek, the wide leg looks more modern than a track pant, and the textured neutral fabric elevates. You can wear these with a vest and sweatshirt to travel in, and then with a linen shirt and chunky jewellery for holiday nights.Smell delicious (and save space in your liquids bag)View image in fullscreenBlack cashmeran and tonka fragrance paintbrush£42 at Jo Loves£42 at Space NKHot car seats, sun cream, pine-scented walks, figs on a tree, strong morning coffee. Scent is one of the sensory pleasures of holidays, so fragrance is a must-pack for me. If I’m flying, I don’t check in luggage, so liquid space is at a premium. So I’m obsessed with the brilliant marker-pen delivery system of Jo Malone’s Jo Loves fragrance paintbrush. At £42 for a 7ml paintbrush with a refill, this is a good price for a classy scent. I am devoted to the vanilla-coded black cashmeran and tonka scent, which dispels all traces ofJungle Formula Maximum mosquito repellent spray(also a must, the little buggers love my ankles.)Small but mighty!

These sandals are designed for a barefoot feel, with a slim sole and minimal strapping that you adjust to fit. They weigh almost nothing, take up no space, and look really chic with a wide-leg trouser, like the Zara ones above. They come in black or stone, but I’m quite into the raspberry for a pop of colour.The best summer shoes: 44 sandals, pumps and trainers for everyoneRead moreBuy this dress and wear it every summerView image in fullscreenPippa dress£125 at SézaneSézane is such a smart brand. That French-girl effortless chic thing, but properly well thought out. What is brilliant about this dress is the tie-side waist, which gives a much more graceful line than a straight T-shirt dress, can be adjusted to suit you, and gives a relaxed feel that a few creases won’t spoil. (I don’t know about you, but I am absolutely not ironing on holiday.) It comes in fun prints (leopard!), classic black, coral red or a gorgeous soft sea blue.Take a beach skirt that isn’t basicView image in fullscreenPinkbroderie cutwork midi skirt£46 at River Island£46 at AsosThis is one of the secrets of packing light: instead of taking simple basics for daytime and then snazzier pieces for evening, find pieces that do both. That means easy enough for day, fabulous enough for night. A case in point: this skirt, which you can pull on over a swimmy to walk to the beach, throw in the washing machine, and wear out in the evening with a light knit and your fave earrings.Pack jewellery that makes you smileView image in fullscreenPomegranate earrings with jade accents£123 at Wolf & BadgerPomegranates, lemons, tomatoes: all giving summer, right? Wolf & Badger is a great hub for small independent brands, and my go-to for finding unusual jewellery pieces that have real personality. Pomegranates are good luck in many cultures, and to me, they speak of holidays: the red jade seeds inside these little gold pomegranates will sparkle in golden hour light.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Nobody’s Child is such a great brand – sustainable, affordable, British – and I love this dark blouse for a cooler twist on boho and the intricate floral embroidery.I know this doesn’t look useful, but hear me out!View image in fullscreenVinchi Cálido tulle dress£304 at Celia BYou are going to think I’ve gone mad, including this in a capsule wardrobe. It is, after all, a trapeze-shaped dress with trumpet sleeves, with neon ruffles in pink, red and orange on a transparent tulle base, and also £304. Basic, it is not. But! Unbuttoned, this piece by Spanish slow-fashion designer Celia Bernardo is the best cover-up on any beach, anywhere, by a country mile. Buttoned up over a nude slip, it is a sensational evening gown. And shoulder robed over a plain bright dress, it is an outfit-maker that will have your back at weddings and parties for summers to come. Look, what I’m trying to say is, I’ve fallen in love with it, and the heart wants what it wants.The nice top in jeans-and-a-nice-topView image in fullscreenCotton-rich textured hardware detail top£25 at M&SIt’s “just” a black top, so you can wear it with anything. But it’s also absolutely not “just” a black top, because the lil textured gold knuckle at the right shoulder takes it from blah to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and the ruching to the side of the waist gives it soft structure.You can never have too many summer basketsView image in fullscreenRaffia tote£28 at John LewisI’m literally obsessed with them, and this is my latest must-have. The square shape and loose raffia are veryPrada-coded, but the price tag – £28 – is most definitely not.

This one is a win-win. The rainbow-hued scallops are a California daydream, but the raised waist and central ruching have been well thought out to suit real-world bodies.Going on holiday soon?

Crab midweek? Yes, please, and fried rice is my fallback whenever I am in a dinner pickle. That’s not to belittle its deliciousness, complexity or elegance, though, because this spiced crab version can be as fancy as you like. That said, the speed and ease with which I can create a meal that I know everyone will love is the winning factor. Plus, I often have leftover cooked, chilled rice in the fridge, anyway, which is always the clincher (cooked rice has a better texture for frying once chilled).Spiced crab egg fried ricePrep10 minCook25 min, plus coolingServes4Fine sea salt250g jasmine riceVegetable oil4cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped½ tsp ground white pepper2 tbsp fish sauce2 tbsp soy sauce3 large eggs, beaten200g mixed crab meat1 bunch fresh coriander, finely chopped1 green chilli, finely sliced2 limes, halvedBring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Wash the rice until the water runs clear, then boil it for 10 minutes, or until it is just cooked through. Drain, rinse under the cold tap and leave to cool completely (if possible).When you are ready to fry the rice, set a large wok or frying pan on a high heat and add a couple of tablespoons of oil. Add the chopped ginger and garlic, stir-fry for a minute, then add the rice. Stir in the ground white pepper and the fish and soy sauces, then stir-fry for a few minutes, until the rice is piping hot. Push the rice to the side of the wok, pour the beaten eggs into the middle of the pan and scramble for a minute or two. Break up the cooked egg and stir it into the rice.Add the crab to the wok, then stir-fry until everything is cooked through and hot. Stir in the chopped coriander and sliced chilli, and serve with the lime halves.Explore more on these topicsFoodShellfishSeafoodRiceEggsMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Should I walk away?Pamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 1 Jul 2025 04.57 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 05.18 EDTShareI have been seeing a womanwhom I met online for almost a year.Before wemet face to face, we had a number of phone calls, during whichshe became very sexualvery quickly. She asked me the size of my penis (which isslightlyabove average).Then she told me she likedbigpenisesand that an ex-partner’s was 12in(30cm) long.This made me feel very insecure and I told her this. Shesaid:“It’s only a preference.”Since then, this issue has surfaced again and again. I know it’s hard to believe, but we haven’t had penetrative sex yet. (Initially, I wanted to take things slow. Plus,she is menopausal and hasn’t been feeling sexual much of the time.) We do have other kinds of sex and she says I am the“best”in this respect. Butpenetrative sex,for me,is very important. She says I’m“big enough”and that she is sure I’ll satisfy her –but the thought that she“prefers bigger”is devastating. She says she doesn’t understand why she madethe original remark. She is sorry, but this doesn’t help.I feel I should walk away, butI have strong feelings for her.It is very likely that this woman was telling the truth when she said she doesn’t know why she made the initial remark, but it probably came from her own insecurity. Trying to connect with someone new online or by phone can create a lot of anxiety, so some people present themselves as something they are not.When any woman talks about “preferring big penises”, it’s usually – consciously or not – an attempt to gain power due to a sense of weakness, so it would be wise for you to try to ignore it.Her words have had the effect of pushing you away but try having a gentle and frank conversation. Hopefully, both of you will get to the point of recognising the other’s insecurities and resolve to work on mutual soothing and acceptance.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

My dog and I were on our usual walk up the dirt road that bisects our old mining town, nestled just shy of 10,000ft (3km) in south-western Colorado.It was a short walk from the house, and we were out just to get a little movement. Not to see one.The stool itself was unremarkable: it was not the panicked, loose follow-up to an ill-advised meal, nor a heaping feat that could render a body incapable of holding on to it any longer. The man threw his toilet paper on to the log like a napkin on to a finished plate, and then got back into his SUV, a 15-minute walk from my house.It was the summer of 2024 when we noticed the uptick in shit. Years of overlanding traffic had rumbled through our sleepy bedroom town, with visitors stopping now and then for a red-cup lemonade, a homemade cookie or – if the kids were feeling entrepreneurial – a rock billed as a crystal. Tourists came and they went, leaving nothing but dust and a few dollars.Until last summer, when their numbers finally added up to something else: public dumps.Park and land managers consistently report that improper human waste is now among the top backcountry issuesJD TannerThis is not what I would call my preferred watching, but by the fourth time you find human shit on your dog-walk loop in a national forest in a week, you start to become curious. You start to wonder, what compels a person to shit directly on the road?I became a bit of a fecal fanatic.“We are definitely seeing an escalation in human waste impacts,” JD Tanner told me. Tanner is the director of education and training forLeave No Trace, the organization promoting the same principle as its name. “Park and land managers consistently report that improper human waste is now among the top backcountry issues – from surface feces to visible toilet paper near campsites and water sources.”Despite decades of public service announcements, backcountry signage and the many guiding traces of Leave No Trace educators, an astonishing number of hikers, campers, Jeepers and general park-goers still treat nature like us humans didn’t fully extricate ourselves from it. Toilet-paper piles appear like mushroom clusters. Dogs return to trail, tongues furiously working to hide the evidence.Land managers from Vermont to Patagonia are asking the same question: why is it so hard for humans to bury their poop?It starts with a simple misunderstanding: most people don’t see why they should. We’re animals, right? Just poop how animals poop.Alas, it isn’t so simple. “In a lot of outdoor places, especially popular trails and fragile environments, human waste doesn’t break down the way we think it does,” Tanner said. Instead, it can take poop and its pal toilet paper years in some environments to break down.Plus, the idea that animals are just shitting willy-nilly in the woods isn’t even always true. Hares, badgers, raccoons and many other species are actually more like the best behaved of humans: they use latrines, going to the bathroom in specific areas for territory and sanitation. And crucially, they’re only putting into the ecosystem what they took out.Federal layoffs hit the deep-red, rural US west: ‘Our public lands are under threat’Read moreHumans are an unusually disruptive species, and we’ve done just about everything possible to remove ourselves from nature. Our diets, disease profiles and toilet-paper trails don’t resemble those of deer, bears or even dogs. We’re too far removed, and when we don’t remove our poop, or at least bury it, it sticks. Literally.“It can stick around for years, spread disease, pollute water sources and ruin the experience for the next person,” Tanner said.But does anyone care about the next person? It’s a classic case of the “tragedy of the commons”. If it’s just me out here in these big ol’ woods – how bad could one unburied poop with a little toilet paper be?Jeff Marion, a recreation ecologist and a founding member of the Leave No Trace board of directors, said that improperly disposed human waste quickly becomes a delivery vehicle for disease. Flies land on feces, then on your dinner plate. “But how far can a fly actually fly?” I asked, intonating that most of the people pooping in my backyard are also immediately driving away.“Oh, miles. Wherever you’re going, they’re going.”The flies land on our food. The food makes us sick. We need to go to the bathroom. The cycle continues.The first line of defense we have is simple: if you need to go, dig a cathole.The cathole has long been hailed as the gold standard of backcountry pooping. A simple 6-8in hole, at least 200ft (61 metres) from any trail, water or camp. Deep enough to prevent runoff, shallow enough to decompose, and far enough to avoid health and aesthetic issues. The more thoughtful hikers carry small trowels to dig their holes, the cheapest of which you can get for a few bucks. Experienced car campers and overlanders often have shovels that make for easy digging. And plenty of catholes have been dug with rocks and sticks.It’s not complicated. But it’s also not happening. First, 200ft is two-thirds of a football field. When ambling from a campsite at night with a headlamp, most people simply will not do this. Even in broad daylight, most people don’t venture very far off the trail. I asked Marion if there were studies measuring human poop along trails. He said not really – most are done near campsites.Then a memory of one trail in particular caught his attention.Marion was once being driven by an Appalachian Trail volunteer to the trailhead, who asked if she and her dog could tag along with him for the first hour.After he agreed, she made a confession: her dog was a bit of a shit-hound. It had a nose for human waste.“I couldn’t believe how many improperly disposed human waste sites this dog found, invariably within 20ft of the trail on either side,” Marion said. Within an hour, the dog found at least a dozen, typically 12-20ft from the trail – all above ground with toilet paper. This was over a decade ago.Marion was quick to mention it’s hard to study the bathroom behaviors of through-hikers, but he estimated 3-4% just surface dispose of their human waste. If some 750 people attempt to hike the full Appalachian Trail each year, and on average it takes them about six months, that 3% turns into nearly 4,000 open-air poops every year – and that’s not including the thousands of people who hike shorter portions of the trail.Why don’t people dig holes? Marion shrugged. Is it ignorance? Ethics? It’s hard to know. Surveys require federal approval and funding, which are hard to come by.Marion once helped with a study on why people leave trails. Obviously, he thought, one reason is they’re going to the bathroom. The team included that as a survey option, but the office of management and budget struck it. Too inappropriate, they said.“We didn’t say ‘have sex in the woods’ or anything like that. We just listed a biological necessity!”However willing the digger, sometimes it’s the trail itself that poses a problem.In certain terrain, surface disposal just seems like the only option. When catholes aren’t feasible – on rock, in alpine tundra or in deserts – some responsible and experienced recreators turn to the smear technique.It is exactly what you are imagining. You grab a rock or stick and smear your feces as thinly as you can in any area that gets sun exposure. It can work, but researchersconcludedit’s only effective in remote areas by trained campers.So what’s your regular front-ranger to do? The modern recommendation is to pack it out. Enter the Wag bag: a resealable, odor-containing, waste-stabilizing bag that allows you to carry out your business, similar to how you might bag your dog’s poop.But “might” is the key word, given how unpopular it is. The idea of carrying your own feces, even carefully double-bagged, seems to be a breaking point for many outdoorspeople.Since people seemingly won’t bury or carry, surely all of this would be solved by more toilets. But oh, how simple that would be.One of the worst things you can do in waste management is mix pee and poop together and leave them in a dark placeGeoff Hill, PhD, didn’t set out to become the country’s leading expert on wilderness poop. But a field assignment in the Canadian Arctic on Nunavut land changed his path by sheer force. While there, they couldn’t leave their feces behind, so the team had to defecate into a metal bucket frozen into the permafrost. Then, whoever drew the short straw had to wrestle the bucket out of the frozen hole, drag it into the intertidal zone with a hazmat suit on, and chop the frozen poop out with a hatchet.Hill laughed while telling the story.“I was doing this, fully coated and splattered with crystallized poo bits, and I thought, there’s a better way, there’s got to be a better way.”Hill’s company, ToiletTech, designs waste-separating systems for parks around the world. But why separate? Hill explained that one of the worst things you can do in waste management is mix pee and poop together and leave them in a dark place.“You end up with this horrible mix of high ammonia, undecomposed organic matter rich with pathogens that’s not going to be decomposed by the natural soil invertebrate ecosystem.”Mammals in the wild separate pee and poop, and Hill’s system imitates this. You do your business on a regular toilet seat, the liquid falls into the tank below, while the solids land on the belt to be scooted back into a different tank. Parks that use this kind of technology – from Glacier Bay to Death Valley – report lower maintenance costs, better user satisfaction and, crucially, fewer poop sightings in the wild.But even the best toilets won’t work if people don’t use them, or use them correctly.When Hill was doing this research, he had to set up experiments both in bathrooms and under bathrooms, including getting sensors out of the inside of composting toilets and setting up pet scales to weigh diverted urine versus poop. Regardless of whatever red tape was up, people who felt the need to relieve did so at their leisure.“They’d step over my toolboxes, go past signs that said ‘Do not enter – Closed.’” Hill said when it comes to going to the bathroom, most people enter with a “nothing’s gonna stop me” mentality, including pooping on Hill himself.“I got pooped on and peed on more than one time,” he says. “People are crazy in bathrooms.”To really make progress, we need to widen the lens – from backyard trails and surface poops to the infrastructure, history and psychology that got us here in the first place.Long before catholes and Wag bags, Americans pooped in the woods with little thought for posterity. In the early 20th century, the US Forest Service and National Park Service were preoccupied with trail building, visitor access and managing fire.Sanitation was an afterthought – until it wasn’t. As recreational use surged in the postwar era, so did the stink.Everything from Boy Scout manuals to National Geographic articles framed the wilderness as a rugged, forgiving spaceEarly wilderness toilets were literal pits: a shallow hole, a wooden seat, sometimes a shed. In 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Water Act and subsequent Underground Injection Control (UIC) rules made it illegal to simply dump human waste into the ground in many public areas. Parks began scrambling for alternatives, leading to the proliferation of vault toilets, fly-ridden composting experiments and labor-intensive haul-out programs.Even as toilets improved, behavior didn’t. The idea that nature would absorb human waste, like it absorbs deer poop or dead leaves, persisted in the cultural imagination. This myth was especially popularized during the rise of outdoor recreation in the 1960s and 1970s, when everything from Boy Scout manuals to National Geographic articles framed the wilderness as a rugged, forgiving space that welcomed self-sufficiency and personal freedom.That framing stuck. If your grandfather squatted behind a tree and left his poop, why couldn’t you?However vast the backcountry can seem, it isn’t equipped to process human waste at modern volume. Most popular parks today host millions of visitors per year. A 2019 National Park Service report estimated over 300m annual visits to public lands, and each visitor produces, on average, one to two bowel movements a day.That’s hundreds of millions of poops. A deluge of shit. How many do you think land a few feet off the trail?The question, then, isn’t just about disposal; it’s about instinct. Humans are wired to treat their waste with secrecy and urgency. Pooping is private. And in public, it’s often rushed. When discomfort strikes in the woods – no toilet in sight, body on high alert – the brain prioritizes speed and invisibility over stewardship. All it takes to swing from predator to prey is having your pants down.Culturally, Americans have a particularly conflicted relationship with bodily functions. We sanitize them. We euphemize them. We hide them behind stall doors and scented sprays. The idea of carrying out one’s own poop, even sealed in a leakproof Nasa-grade polymer bag, feels humiliating to many.There’s a shame to the act, and somehow a deeper shame in being seen doing the right thing.But humor can help. Tanner told me that Leave No Trace intentionally incorporates humor (like “Nature” appearing on caller ID when “nature calls”) into their training and campaigns. Not only does it mitigate some of the discomfort around an awkward topic, but it helps people to internalize proper practices.When passing through Four Corners Monument on a road trip, I stopped to take the obligatory photo where the four states of Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico touch. I also stopped to use the facilities. On my way out of the bathroom, a woman asked me how they were.“Pretty good. Mostly clean. Wouldn’t stay longer than I needed to.” I said the last part with a chuckle. Bathroom humor. She did not laugh.“But do the toilets flush?”They didn’t. It was some kind of vault toilet, and when I told the woman that, she balked.“I’ll just find something to hide behind.”We think wilderness should be a place where we can disappear to be and do what we wantThe Four Corners Monument is situated on a high desert. The best and perhaps only thing to hide behind was the toilets themselves.Backcountry rangers see this dynamic play out daily. A visitor in an endless stream of cars will recoil at the idea of using the same bathroom as millions of others. And a visitor who will spend $400 on a down quilt and $200 on a titanium stove will laugh at the idea of carrying a free waste kit. The math isn’t rational; it’s emotional. It’s about what we think wildernessshouldbe: a place where we can disappear to be and do what we want.Internationally, some places have tackled the issue with design, policy and cultural norms. In New Zealand’s Fiordland and Abel Tasman national parks, composting toilets are routinely helicoptered out and swapped when they reach capacity. These toilets don’t rely on user compliance, they rely on park infrastructure. In the Swiss Alps, waste is also frequently piped or airlifted away from high-altitude huts.In Norway, toilets are not only better built, they’re often architecturally stunning: small cabins perched along trails with views of mountains or fjords, maintained with pride. And in parts of Japan, forest toilets are sowell-designedthat they can feel like tea houses – quiet, clean and integrated into the landscape. In these contexts, pooping is a matter-of-fact part of being human in nature, not an aberration.These efforts are expensive. But so is the alternative. Denali national park spends tens of thousands each year removing human waste from glaciers and base camps. Mount Rainier has similar costs associated with fly-out waste barrels. And just one contract for vault toilet cleaning services at the Clear Creek ranger district recreation sites came in at almost $10,000 a year.In remote regions of British Columbia, local governments are experimenting with solar dehydrating toilets and black soldier fly larvae to break down human feces. These innovations are promising, but still niche. Most US parks are left with a patchwork of Porta Potties, half-funded composters, and volunteer-run privy programs. How much would you need to love the outdoors to volunteer to carry other people’s poop?Turmoil, resignations and ‘psychological warfare’: how Trump is crippling US national parksRead moreAs for my neck of the woods, there are no public facilities. We’re sandwiched between national forests and bisected by a mountain pass frequently taken by overlanders. From my house, the closest public toilet is at least 25 minutes, probably 40 if you account for parking in the popular resort town. There’s one portable toilet across from the post office, but it’s locked. It’s the postman’s toilet, and he walks across the road from the 8x8 shed we call our post office to use it.Locally, we’ve talked about increasing signage, but the existing signage about speed limits, dust and whether or not the pass is even open seems to go unnoticed. Creating a bathroom-specific sign that says: “Please go to the bathroom here instead of in the woods because our dogs are eating your feces” is a lot to put on a placard. But it’s the detail that gets people’s attention.Because poop only matters when it becomes personal.When people mockingly ask, “does a bear shit in the woods?” It’s worth remembering that they don’t shit at all during hibernation. They form a fecal plug and then wait until they’re out of the den in the spring to release it.Maybe it’s time we learn to wait, too.Kelton Wright writesShangriLogs, a diary from a tiny town in Colorado"

If you need me after this newsletter publishes, I will be busy poring over photos from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez’s wedding, the gaudiest and most star-studded affair to disrupt technology news this year. I found it a tacky and spectacular affair. Everyone who was anyone was there, except for Charlize Theron, who, unprompted,said on Monday: “I think we might be the only people who did not get an invite to the Bezos wedding. But that’s OK, because they suck and we’re cool.”AI companies start winning the copyright fightLast week, tech companies notched several victories in the fight over their use of copyrighted text to create artificial intelligence products.Anthropic:A US judge has ruled that Anthropic, maker of the Claude chatbot, use of books to train its artificial intelligence system – without permission of the authors – did not breach copyright law. Judge William Alsup compared the Anthropic model’s use of books to a “reader aspiring to be a writer.”And the next day, Meta:The US district judgeVince Chhabria, in San Francisco, said in his decision on theMetacase that the authors had not presented enough evidence that the technology company’s AI would cause “market dilution” by flooding the market with work similar to theirs.The same day that Meta received its favorable ruling,a group of writers sued Microsoft, alleging copyright infringement in the creation of that company’s Megatron text generator. Judging by the rulings in favor of Meta and Anthropic, the authors are facing an uphill battle.These three cases are skirmishes in the wider legal war over copyrighted media, which rages on. Three weeks ago, Disney and NBCUniversal sued Midjourney, alleging that the company’s namesake AI image generator and forthcoming video generator made illegal use of the studios’ iconic characters like Darth Vader and the Simpson family. The world’s biggest record labels – Sony, Universal and Warner – have sued two companies that make AI-powered music generators, Suno and Udio. On the textual front, the New York Times’ suit against OpenAI and Microsoft is ongoing.The lawsuits over AI-generated text were filed first, and, as their rulings emerge, the next question in the copyright fight is whether decisions about one type of media will apply to the next.“The specific media involved in the lawsuit – written works versus images versus videos versus audio – will certainly change the fair-use analysis in each case,” said John Strand, a trademark and copyright attorney with the law firm Wolf Greenfield. “The impact on the market for the copyrighted works is becoming a key factor in the fair-use analysis, and the market for books is different than that for movies.”To Strand, the cases over images seem more favorable to copyright holders, as the AI models are allegedly producing images identical to the copyrighted ones in the training data.A bizarre and damning fact was revealed in the Anthropic ruling, too: the company had pirated and stored some 7m books to create a training database for its AI. To remediate its wrongdoing, the company bought physical copies and scanned them, digitizing the text. Now the owner of 7m physical books that no longer held any utility for it, Anthropic destroyed them. The company bought the books, diced them up, scanned the text and threw them away,Ars Technica reports. There are less destructive ways to digitize books, but they are slower. The AI industry is here to move fast and break things.Anthropic laying waste to millions of books presents a crude literalization of the ravenous consumption of content necessary for AI companies to create their products.AI and the environment: bad newsGoogle’s emissions up 51% as AI electricity demand derails efforts to go greenInside a plan to use AI to amplify doubts about the dangers of pollutantsAn update on last week’s stories: Trump’s phoneView image in fullscreenComposite: Guardian/Getty/Trump Mobile/Trump Watches/EbayTwo stories I wrote about last week saw significant updates in the ensuing days.The website for Trump’s gold phone, dubbed “T1”, has dropped its “Made in America” pledge in favor of “proudly American” and “brought to life in America”, perthe Verge.Trump seems to have followed the example of Apple, which skirts the issue of origin but still emphasizes the American-ness of iPhones by engraving them with “Designed in California”. What is unsaid: assembled in China or India, and sourced from many other countries. It seems Trump and his family have opted for a similar evasive tagline, though it’s been thrown into much starker relief by their original promise.The third descriptor that now appears on Trump’s phone site, “American-Proud Design”, seems most obviously cued by Apple.The tagline “Made in the USA” carries legal weight. Companies have faced lawsuits over just how many of their products’ parts were produced in the US, and the US’s main trade regulator has established standards by which to judge the actions behind the slogan. It would be extremely difficult for a smartphone’s manufacturing history to measure up to those benchmarks, by the vast majority of expert estimations.Though Trump intends to repatriate manufacturing in the US with his sweeping tariffs, he seems to be learning just what other phone companies already know. It is complicated and limiting to make a phone solely in the US, and doing so forces severe constraints on the final product.Readlast week’s newsletterabout the gold Trump phone.… and online age checksView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesLast week, I wrote about Pornhub’s smutty return to France after a law requiring online age verification was suspended there. This week, theUS supreme courtruled in favor of an age-check law passed in Texas. Pornhub has blocked access to anyone in Texas in protest for the better part of two years, as it did in France for three weeks. Clarence Thomas summed up the court’s reasoning:“HB 1181 simply requires adults to verify their age before they can access speech that is obscene to children,” Clarence Thomas wrote in the court’s 6-3 majority opinion. “The statute advances the state’s important interest in shielding children from sexually explicit content. And, it is appropriately tailored because it permits users to verify their ages through the established methods of providing government-issued identification and sharing transactional data.”Elena Kagan dissented alongside the court’s two other liberal justices.The ruling affirms not only Texas’s law but the statutes of nearly two dozen states that have implemented online age checks. The tide worldwide seems to be shifting away from allowing freer access to pornography as part of a person’s right to free expression and more towards curtailing.Experts believe the malleable definition of obscenity – the Texas law requires an age check for any site whose content is more than a third sexual material – will be weaponized against online information on sexual health, abortion or LGBTQ+ identity, all in the name of child protection.“It’s an unfortunate day for the supporters of an open internet,” said GS Hans, professor at Cornell Law School. “The court has made a radical shift in free speech jurisprudence in this case, though it doesn’t characterize its decision that way. By upholding the limits on minors’ access to obscenity – a notoriously difficult category to define – that also creates limits on adult access, we can expect to see states take a heavier hand in regulating content.”I’ll be closely watching what happens in July when Pornhub willingly implements age checks in compliance with the Online Services Act.Read more:UK study shows 8% of children aged eight to 14 have viewed online pornographyRead more AI newsNumber of new UK entry-level jobs has dived since ChatGPT launch – researchFake, AI-generated videos about the Diddy trial are raking in millions of views on YouTubeDenmark to tackle deepfakes by giving people copyright to their own featuresThis week in AI: new WhatsApp summaries and Nobel winners’ genomic modelView image in fullscreenMeta’s WhatsApp will begin showing you AI-generated summaries of your unread messages.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APNew features are a dime a dozen, but even a small tweak to the most popular messaging app in the world may amount to a major shift. Meta’s WhatsApp will begin showing you AI-generated summaries of your unread messages, perthe Verge.Apple tried message summaries. They did not work. The company pulled them. For a firm famed for its calculated and controlled releases, the retraction of the summaries was a humiliation. The difference between Apple and Meta, though, is that Meta has consistently released AI products for multiple years now.In other AI news, I am rarely captivated by new technologies, but a recent release by Google’s DeepMind AI laboratory seems promising for healthcare.AlphaGenomeis an AI meant to “comprehensively and accurately [predict] how single variants or mutations in human DNA sequences impact a wide range of biological processes regulating genes”, per a press release. The creators of AlphaGenome previously won the Nobel prize in chemistry for AlphaFold, a software that predicts the structures of proteins.A major question that hovers over Crispr, another Nobel-winning innovation, is what changes in a person when a genetic sequence is modified. AlphaGenome seems poised to assist in solving that mystery.The wider TechScapeDisabled Amazon workers in corporate jobs allege ‘systemic discrimination’Six arrested at protest of Palantir, tech company building deportation software for Trump adminOnline hacks to offline heists: crypto leaders on edge amid increasing attacks‘Lidar is lame’: why Elon Musk’s vision for a self-driving Tesla taxi faltered‘It’s like being walled in’: young Iranians try to break through internet blackoutExplore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterArtificial intelligence (AI)MetaWhatsAppLaw (US)Donald TrumpUS supreme courtnewslettersShareReuse this content"

It uses the plural, “organisations”, because two other groups are also named – Maniacs Murder Cult (MMC) and Russian Imperial Movement (RIM).What is the justification given for the ban?Cooper said MMC was a white supremacist, neo-Nazi organisation whose leaders and members had have claimed a number of violent attacks globally. She said RIM was a white supremacist, ethno-nationalist organisation that sought to create a new Russian imperial state.With respect to Palestine Action, she said its “attacks” included at a Thales factory in Glasgow in 2022, and last year at Instro Precision in Kent and Elbit Systems UK in Bristol, adding: “The attack on the Thales defence factory in Glasgow caused over £1m worth of damage to parts essential for submarines. Staff fled for safety as pyrotechnics and smoke bombs were thrown in evacuation areas.“Such acts do not represent legitimate acts of protest and the level of seriousness of Palestine Action’s activity has met the test for proscription under the Terrorism Act 2000.”Palestine Actionposted videoit said was of staff walking out of the building in Thales because activists were on the roof, writing: “Do they look like they’re running for their safety? Escaping the flares and Palestine flags?”Will this become law?MPs are due to debate and vote on the proscription order on Wednesday afternoon and – assuming MPs vote in favour – the Lords are provisionally due to do so from 5pm on Thursday.Crucially, parliamentarians cannot choose to proscribe some of the organisations on the statutory instrument and not others – it is all or nothing – leading Palestine Action to accuse Cooper of grouping them within neo-Nazi groups to ensure the order is approved.If it is, Cooper would sign the order, probably on Friday morning, and it would come into force on Saturday subject to a legal challenge (see below).What is Palestine Action doing to try to stop the order?The home secretary ignored a lettersent by lawyersfor Palestine Action on the day she announced the proposed ban, in which they argued the order was “unlawful, dangerous and ill thought out”.Interventions from third parties, including civil society organisations, lawyers and politicians, have also failed to sway ministers but Palestine Action has been granted an urgent hearing at the high court in London on Friday, which could prevent the order coming into effect.The group is applying for interim relief, which Mr Justice Chamberlain said, at a hearing on Monday, would “have the effect of suspending [the order’s] operation”.What if the attempt to suspend the order is unsuccessful?If the legal challenge is unsuccessful, then Palestine Action would be banned from Saturday, making membership of it – or inviting support for it – a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.However, the group would still be able to challenge the order and seek to quash it after came into effect. A high court hearing has been set for 21 July for them to apply for permission to do this.Explore more on these topicsProtestYvette CooperActivismUK security and counter-terrorismCounter-terrorism policyexplainersShareReuse this content"

Why is Britain addicted to them?, 24 June) raise the question of the rationale of government investments. More good money is going intoHS2, completion receding over the horizon, and nearly another £590m into the Lower Thames Crossing, which is supposed to relieve congestion on the Dartford Crossing. As many earlier studies have shown, more road capacity does not solve butworsens traffic congestion, an observation made in the 1963Buchanan report.In fact, over half the traffic on the Dartford Crossing is local between south Essex and north Kent. The latest payment to the Lower Thames Crossing would pay for the KenEx tram project linking Dartford, Northfleet, Gravesend, Grays, Tilbury and Purfleet, offering a six-minute or better service, and cutting journey times. Indeed, the Thames tram tunnel has been designed to allow emergency vehicles to use it and save time reaching local hospitals, especially at peak times.Research shows thatcar commuters will use trams when available, saving the time and trouble of looking for parking: 25% of tram passengers have switched from car use, the UK average. In the US, the figure is about 40%. KenEx reducing the Dartford Crossing traffic by about 20% will free capacity for freight that cannot go by rail. This is the same claimed for the Lower Thames Crossing, at less than 5% of the cost. The other £13.5bn would go a long way repairing hospitals and schools.Prof Lewis LesleyLiverpoolThe future funding of large-scale infrastructure projects may well be vital for growth. But the people of north Kent and Essex living near the current Dartford Crossing would be much happier if small-scale projects such as the repair and subsequent reopening of the A226 between Gravesend and Dartford, which collapsed nearly two years ago, could be carried out soon.Furthermore, the funding wrangles over the Gravesend-Tilbury passenger ferry should be ended and the service restored.These smaller infrastructure projects would improve the lives of many working people living in the area and make them feel more disposed to support the disruption that will be caused by the construction of the new crossing.Barry CoomberPinner, LondonThe government’s commitment of £725bn over 10 years in the UK infrastructure strategy is welcome but, as George Monbiot points out, overblown infrastructure projects damage lives and imperil democracy.In fact, the biggest infrastructure danger to democracy is the question of the refurbishment of the Houses of Parliament. With costs already estimated as high as £22bn and rising, this government is expected to make final decisions in the next year or two, so a budget allocation will be required and should be acknowledged in spending plans.Viewed through one lens this is essential work to restore and conserve one of our finest buildings, which serves as a globally recognised symbol of British democracy. Through another it is a crumbling, dysfunctional pile that distorts our democracy and economy and will only proceed as a vanity project for parliamentarians.John ForsythPenzance, CornwallHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It reflects the constraints on any meaningful debate about Israel’s response to the atrocities of 7 October and its subsequent behaviour in Gaza and on the West Bank, the results of which are shaping up to be one of the worst humanitarian disasters of this century. Nowhere does this resistance to discussion seem more apparent than at the Board of Deputies of British Jews. When 36 of its membersexpressed their concern about Gaza in a letter to the Financial Times,five were suspendedand the rest were censured.What neither theBBCnor the Board of Deputies can ignore is that the decades-old protected status of Israel is fragmenting. Awkward questions have to be asked. The BBC must not let fear of giving offence stifle coverage.Peter GrimsdaleFormer BBC executive and Channel 4 religion commissionerThe BBC said that it would not broadcast a film on the treatment of doctors in Gaza because of concerns that it may create “a perception of partiality that would not meet the high standards that the public rightly expect” (Channel 4 to show BBC-commissioned documentary Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, 28 June).This highlights the issue with the BBC that I have struggled with for many years. Reporting the truth, where it has been verified by reliable sources, is not partial. Giving a counterpoint that has not been so verified is partial.This is why Palestinian lives are not universally valued. Because every time someone stands up for them, there is a counterpoint that makes it sound antisemitic to have valued a Palestinian life.Alexandra LucasLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The cost of this can be considerable for those on limited incomes, which causes some to undertake dangerous procedures themselves to clear their wax, or go to an unregulated and possibly dangerous practitioner, or simply live with reduced hearing.The double whammy is that you can’t get an NHS hearing check – and thus NHS-funded hearing aids if you need them – or access to other treatment unless you have had your earwax removed at your own expense. RNID, the national hearing-loss charity, has published a report,Stop the Block, highlighting the issue.As your article rightly says, people need good hearing to stay socially connected. Without good-quality social interactions, people can become withdrawn, isolated, depressed and ill.The withdrawal in many areas of this apparently minor service to remove earwax is having a serious impact on some people’s lives.

At least two robots were stretchered off after failing to regain their feet after going to ground.Cheng Hao, the founder and chief executive of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offered the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots. He said humans could play robots in the future, although judging by Saturday’s evidence the humanoids have some way to go before they can hold their own on a football pitch.Cheng said: “In the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe.”Prof Subramanian Ramamoorthy, the chair of robot learning and autonomy at the University of Edinburgh, said the robots were similar to humanoids at tournaments such as the RoboCup and were, despite the tumbles, on an upward development curve.“It is certainly impressive to see the year-on-year advancement in such robots,” he said.The competition was fought between university teams, which adapted the robots with their own algorithms. In the final match, Tsinghua University’s THU Robotics defeated the China Agricultural University’s Mountain Sea team with a score of 5–3 to win the championship.One Tsinghua supporter celebrated their victory while also praising the competition. “They [THU] did really well,” he said. “But the Mountain Sea team was also impressive.

In the call, she can be heard calling Hun Sen “uncle” and saying that if there were anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made critical remarks about a senior Thai military commander.The recording has caused public outrage, with critics accusing her of betraying her country and kowtowing toCambodia.Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia for almost four decades and remains powerful in the country, is known to have been an old friend of Paetongtarn’s family, though relations have soured in recent weeks.Tuesday’s decision is the latest blow for Paetongtarn, scion of the powerful but controversial Shinawatra family. She is clinging to power after a coalition partner quit her government earlier this month, leaving her with only a slim majority as a possible no-confidence vote looms. On Saturday 10,000 protestersgathered in Bangkok calling for her resignation, while an opinion poll released at the weekend showed her approval rating had fallen from 30.9% in March to 9.2%.Paetongtarn’s father, Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former leader, is also facing legal troubles, and appeared in court on Tuesday to face allegations that he breached the lese-majestylaw. Under the law, any criticism of the royal family can lead to up to 15 years in prison. The case relates to a 2015 interview he gave to South Korean media.For two decades Thai politics has been dominated by a power struggle between the Shinawatras and their opponents in the conservative military royalist establishment. Thaksin was twice elected prime minister, but was ousted in a coup in 2006. His sister Yingluck Shinawatra was ousted by a court ruling followed by a coup in 2014.Paetongtarn told reporters at Bangkok’s Government House that she accepted the ruling. “It’s always been my intention to do the best thing for my country,” she said. “I’d like to apologise to Thai people who are frustrated about this.” She has previously described her comments in the call as a negotiating tactic.Thailand has a long-runningborder dispute with Cambodiathat flared up in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed during a brief exchange of fire. The incident has led to a surge in nationalist sentiment andtit-for-tat actions by both governments.The deputy prime minister, Suriya Juangroongruangkit, will take over as a caretaker while the court decides the case against Paetongtarn.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificCambodianewsShareReuse this content"

Winds with gusts above 125kmh were possible along the coastal fringe of the Illawarra and south coast.The BoM said that the storm would bring heavy rainfall which could lead to flash flooding in the Illawarra south of Nowra, extending southwards towards Bega and inland to Braidwood.However, the rain is expected to ease on Wednesday morning.Commuters nevertheless face severe disruption on Wednesday after Transport NSW advised passengers that they “should avoid non-essential travel across the rail network”. Infrastructure had been damaged, it said, and routes cancelled due to fallen trees.It also said drivers should be ready for delays and disruptions to last through the coming days.Communities from Jervis Bay to Batemans Bay on the south coast were urged to stay indoors just after 5pm due to heavy rainfall and damaging and destructive winds, while other areas, including parts of Sydney, faced flood warnings.As of 7pm on Tuesday, about 30,000 Ausgrid customers remained without power, according to the company, which distributes electricity to about 1.8 million customers inSydney, the Central Coast and the Hunter.Ausgrid said the worst affected areas were the Central Coast and the Hunter region, where 15,500 and 13,000 homes had lost power, respectively. Emergency crews would work through the night to restore power, the company said.Earlier, the SES issued a general warning for people to stay indoors. As of 7.30pm, people in Sydney were advised to monitor weather conditions and stay across any hazards as the weather system tracked south.A spokesperson for the SES said it had responded to more than 1,300 calls for assistance in the 24 hours to 7pm on Tuesday. Some ferries and trains were suspended in NSW while commuters in Sydney faced heavy traffic.The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) deputy commissioner, Debbie Platz, told ABC News conditions along the east coast were “very dangerous” and would “deteriorate even further overnight”.Platz said wild weather had knocked over trees and powerlines, leading to significant crashes on the roads.View image in fullscreenRain falls over the Sydney CBD on Tuesday.Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAPJust before 4pm on Tuesday, the SES directed people living in parts of the Central Coast to evacuate immediately due to the threat of dangerous waves causing damage to buildings amid coastal erosion caused by storm activity.People in propertiesalong Hutton Roadat North Entrance and at Wamberal on parts ofOcean View Drive, which backs on to Wamberal beach, andPacific Streetwere told to evacuate.The community of Wamberal, 50km north of Sydney,has been struggling with coastal erosion for years, with division over whether or not the council should install a sea wall in an effort to protect properties on the shoreline.NSW weather maps: which parts of state are being hit by flooding and rain – and what areas are at risk?Read more‘Not out of the woods yet’The system was expected to be “more intense and much sharper” than the weather event that caused flooding across the Hunter region and mid-north coast in May, the SES northern zone commander, Chief Supt Andrew Cribb, said.“We’re not out of the woods yet,” he told reporters on Tuesday.The NSW emergency services minister, Jihad Dib, said the “complex and large system” stretched from the mid-north coast down to Bega.“It may seem pretty bad [now], but the terrible thing is that the situation is going to worsen over the course of the next 24 hours, particularly later this afternoon and into the evening [and] tomorrow,” Dib told reporters on Tuesday. “So once again, we’re asking people to be as prepared as they possibly can be.”The rapidly deepening system reached the NSW coast and was slowly moving southwards. Widespread rainfall totals of 50mm-150mm were likely, the SES warned, with isolated intense falls above 200mm in 24 hours, “which will cause flash flooding”.The SES had deployed vehicles, helicopters and personnel to areas likely to be heavily affected.The service had responded to more than 900 incidents since Monday morning and had received more than 1,700 calls to the state operations centre, a spokesperson said.“We’re seeing a lot of debris and trees down, requests for sandbags and also leaking roofs,” they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By 7.30am on Tuesday, Jervis Bay had recorded 109mm, Currarong 85mm and Williamtown 70mm. Several places in the northern rivers had already had 40mm of rainfall, she said.The bureau was also warning of destructive winds averaging 60-70km/h, with peak gusts of up to 125km/h possible.By Tuesday mid-morning, wind speeds of 113km/h were recorded at Wattamolla, south of Sydney.View image in fullscreenWalkers shelter from the rain at Bondi Beach in Sydney on Tuesday.Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP‘Everyone’s just a bit over the weather’: NSW residents barely back on their feet brace for fresh floods – againRead moreWarragamba Dam was 98% full and was expected to spill in the coming days based on forecast rainfall, WaterNSW said in a social media post.Transport for NSW urged public transport users, motorists and boaters to be prepared.A spokesperson for Sydney airport said flight schedules could be affected. “We recommend passengers check with their airline regarding the status of their flight.”Airservices Australia said aircraft movements had been reduced on Tuesday morning and it was working to manage the impact of severe weather conditions in Sydney.The SES urged people to be vigilant.“We’ve been asking people to prepare their homes and properties since last week and now it really is too late to be outside in the weather,” a spokesperson said.– with Australian Associated PressExplore more on these topicsAustralia weatherNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

She had reportedly suffered from a heart condition.A 70-year-old man was reported to have drowned at a tourist resort close to Turin as intense heat gave way to storms and flash floods.Admissions to hospital emergency units in parts ofItalyhave risen by 15-20% in recent days. The majority of patients are elderly people suffering from dehydration.The heatwave, which has forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from their homes inTurkey due to wildfires, has also forced the closure of schools in parts of France – as education unions warned the classrooms were dangerously hot for children and teachers.View image in fullscreenThe top of the Eiffel Tower was closed to tourists amid the high temperatures in Paris.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/ReutersTourists, meanwhile, were confronted with closures of some of Europe’s popular attractions.

In Brussels, the Atomium monument, famed for its giant stainless steel balls, closed early as temperatures inched towards 37C.In Italy, Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, two industrial hubs, announced they were stopping open-air work between 12.30pm and 4pm, joining 11 other regions – stretching from Liguria in the north-west to Calabria and Sicily in the south – that have imposed similar bans in recent days.Local authorities were heeding advice from trade unions after the death of Brahim Ait El Hajjam, a 47-year-old construction worker, who collapsed and died while working on a building site close to Bologna, the capital of Emilia-Romagna, on Monday.Europe swelters under heatwave – in picturesRead moreTwo workers fell ill on Tuesday on a construction site near Vicenza in Veneto. One is reportedly in a coma.The CGIL Bologna and Fillea CGIL unions said in a statement: “While we wait to learn the actual cause of death, it is essential, during this terrible period, to promote a culture of safety.“The climate emergency has clearly worsened the conditions for those who work outside every day and companies must give absolute priority to the protection of workers.”The French national rail operator SNCF said train travel betweenFranceand Italy had been suspended for “at least several days” after violent storms on Monday, AFP reported.Cogne, a town in Italy’s Aosta Valley that suffered severe flooding in June last year, has been cut off by a landslide.The Spanish state meteorological agency, Aemet,said in a social media update that“June 2025 smashed records” when it came to high temperature, with an average temperature of 23.6C, 0.8C above the previous hottest June in 2017.The monthly average was also 3.5C higher than the average over the period from 1991 to 2020, it said.View image in fullscreenA man drinks from a fountain during hot weather in Naples.Photograph: Ansa/Ciro Fusco/EPAThe agency’s comments come just days after Spain’s highest ever June temperature of 46C was recorded in the Huelva province of Andalucía.InPortugal, temperatures hit 46.6C in Mora, a town in the Évora district, in recent days, making it the highest June temperature ever recorded in the country, according to the Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere.In France, the prime minister, François Bayrou, tried to calm anger at the heatwave crisis in French schools. More than 1,896 schools across the country were fully or partially closed on Tuesday.InParis, which was on maximum heatwave alert, parents were advised to keep their children at home on Tuesday and Wednesday. Some other towns, including Troyes and Melun, closed all their schools.Bayrou said the education ministry would open talks with mayors on how to adapt school buildings, most of which are extremely poorly insulated.As temperatures rose on Tuesday, some Paris teachers had nothing more than a water spray on their desk to repeatedly spritz children in classrooms in the hope of keeping cool.View image in fullscreenSeveral Spanish regions, including Barcelona, were on alert for exceptionally high temperatures as the first heatwave of the summer hit the country.Photograph: Alejandro García/EPABayrou, who is facing a vote of no confidence on Tuesday, which he is expected to survive, has cancelled his meetings to monitor the situation in real time.The hot weather front known inGermanyas Bettina is expected to have nearly the entire country in its grip by Wednesday, with temperatures shooting toward the 40C mark and only the coasts and Alpine peaks spared the scorching temperatures.Industry groups warned that schools, elderly care homes and hospitals were ill-prepared for the heatwave – an urgent issue they said must be addressed as the frequency of life-threatening weather increases.Other cities across Europe are also experiencing higher than usual temperatures, including Zaragoza (39C), Rome (37C), Madrid (37C), Athens (37C), Brussels (36C), Frankfurt (36C), Tirana (35C) and London (33C).Turkey’s forestry minister, İbrahim Yumaklı, said firefighters had been called out to 263 wildfires across the country in recent days.

After he took office in May, Germany stationed more police at the border and said some people trying to enter the country would be turned away.Even before that, Merz’s predecessor in February extended by six months the temporary border checks Germany had imposed on its frontiers last autumn, as it attempted to cut the number of people arriving in the country.Tusk argued that the recent policy shift had placed undue pressure onPolandto accept individuals denied entry at the German border.“With no border checks on the Polish side, it becomes difficult to determine whether those being returned or redirected to Poland should be sent there,” he said.Tusk added that he had spoken “several times” with Merz, warning him that Poland’s “patient stance … was wearing thin”.“We have been defenders of the Schengen area [the EU’s visa-free travel zone] and remain advocates of aEuropewith open borders and unrestricted movement. However, such a system requires the same, symmetrical commitment from all neighbouring countries,” he said.“Therefore, the temporary reinstatement of border controls on the Polish-German border is necessary to reduce, to the minimum, the uncontrolled flow of migrants crossing … the border.”According to the EU, member states are allowed to temporarily reintroduce border controls in cases of a serious threat, such as internal security. It says border controls should be applied as a last resort in exceptional situations, and must be limited in time.In a pointed warning to Merz, Tusk on Tuesday said that if the German government extended one-sided border controls in September, Poland would retaliate with a similar move. “The time when Poland would not respond appropriately to such actions has definitively come to an end,” he added.Debate over migration in Poland has turned increasingly heated in recent weeks, with far-right activists starting to organise patrols along the border with Germany.The move to introduce temporary border controls with Lithuania was understood to be linked to the German policy change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m only a child. Why are you doing this?”New data in the report shows that 2024 was the worst year on record for child and adult deaths, with at least 15 children dying while trying to cross last year, and at least three of those due to crushing injuries. Their ages ranged from three days to 16 years old. More children died attempting to cross the Channel than in the previous four years combined.“The UK-France border is becoming an increasingly deadly space for children,” the report states.Last year the French Red Cross encountered 879 unaccompanied children in northern France. Some, particularly those who have fled Sudan, do not have money to pay smugglers and are more likely to try to clandestinely board lorries, which carries risks of asphyxiation, being hit by traffic, and violence from lorry drivers if they are discovered.French plans to stop small boats will lead to more deaths, says charityRead moreLast year the French NGO Utopia 56 came into contact with 14,538 people involved in 659 failed crossings,of whom 1,131 were children, 268 unaccompanied.Project Play, which provides play services and other support to children and families around Calais and Dunkirk, directly attributed the rising levels of violence, trauma and deaths of children to UK government policies.“On 16 October, a three-year-old began lining up toy cars like riot vehicles and yelling ‘police’. He was deeply dysregulated,” said one Project Play staff member.Katie Hall, the advocacy lead at Project Play, said: “Every day, we see France and the UK not only failing to protect the human rights of children, but pursuing policies which actively threaten and undermine them.”Many children showed signs of trauma as a result of police intimidation and aggression.The report calls for an urgent end to the violence that children face on the border, and makes recommendations for policy changes in the UK and France.These include the publication of transparent data on deaths, an end to violent French police operations in living sites and on beaches, and a halt to the UK funding that enables them.The report also calls for the creation of safe and accessible routes to asylum in France and the UK.Project Play dedicated the report to the children who died at the border in 2024: Abadeh, Mohamed, Roula, Sara, Abdelaziz, Mohammed, Ishannullah, Sabila, Meri, Mansur, Maryam, Salah, and the others whose names have been lost.The UKHome Officeand France’s interior ministry have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceChildrenMigrationHome OfficeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Shrapnel flew everywhere, and the place filled with smoke and the smell of gunpowder. I couldn’t see anything. I ran toward the cafe and found it destroyed. I went inside and saw bodies lying on the ground. All the cafe workers were killed,” he told the Guardian.“There was a family there with their young children – why were they targeted? It was a place where people came to find some relief from the pressures of life.”View image in fullscreenAftermath of the Israeli airstrike at Al-Baqa cafeteria on Gaza’s seafront.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThe cafe and restaurant had so far survived more than 20 months of war and offered some respite from the relentless violence of the conflict.“There’s always a lot of people at that spot, which offers drinks, spaces for families and internet access,” said Ahmad al-Nayrab, 26, who was walking on the nearby beach when he heard a loud explosion. “It was a massacre,” he told AFP. “I saw bits of bodies flying everywhere, bodies mangled and burned. It was a bloodcurdling scene; everybody was screaming.”1:17Israeli airstrike on popular Gaza beachside cafe leaves at least 30 dead – video reportAdam, 21, was working nearby, renting chairs and tables on the small promenade. “When the strike happened, we dropped to the ground as shrapnel began falling on us,” he told the Guardian. “We started running, trying to understand what had happened, and we helped with the rescue efforts. When I reached the site, the scenes were beyond anything imaginable. I knew all the workers at the place. It was full of customers of all ages.”Other witnesses described seeing a dead four-year-old child, an elderly man with both legs severed and many others with severe injuries. Photographs showed pools of blood and flesh amid shattered concrete columns and roofing, as well as a deep crater suggesting the use of a powerful weapon by Israel.The IDF spokesperson said that “prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians using aerial surveillance”.View image in fullscreenThe cafe and restaurant had survived more than 20 months of war and offered some respite from the relentless violence of the conflict.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianTwo other strikes in Gaza City killed 15 people, according to al-Shifa hospital, which received the casualties, and there were also reports from witnesses, hospitals, and Gaza’s health ministry that Israeli forces killed 11 people who had been seeking food in the south of the territory.Dozens of international charities and non-governmental organizations, including Oxfam, Save the Children and Amnesty, called on Tuesday for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – an Israeli and US-backed logistics group – to disband after repeated incidents of chaos and deadly violence against Palestinians heading toward its sites.“Palestinians in Gaza face an impossible choice: starve or risk being shot while trying desperately to reach food to feed their families,” they said.GHF started distributing aid on 26 May after a nearly three-month Israeli blockade that has pushed Gaza’s population of more than 2 million people to the brink of famine. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed around the chaotic and controversial aid distribution programme over the past month.In a statement, GHF said said it had delivered 53m meals in Gaza and was working tirelessly to feed as many innocent people as possible, adding: “Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza.”Israel has ramped upits offensive in Gazain recent days, with multiple waves of airstrikes and new “evacuation orders” which have forced tens of thousands of people to leave makeshift homes across a swath of the north of the devastated territory.The orders warned of impending assaults and told Palestinians to head south to overcrowded coastal zones where there are few facilities and a limited supply of water. About 80% of the territory is now covered by such orders or controlled by Israeli forces.The IDF has signalled that it plans to advance into the centre of Gaza City, the most densely populated part of Gaza, to fight Hamas militants based there.The war began when Hamas-led militants launched an attack into southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages back to Gaza.Israel’s subsequent military offensive has killed more than 56,500 Palestinians, mostly civilians, displacing almost the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza and reducing much of the territory to rubble.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Video by Saminda SidhuTue 1 Jul 2025 04.09 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 04.58 EDTShareIn the weeks leading up to Israel’s war with Iran,which it launched on 13 June, there had been little let-up in its offensive in Gaza. A tenuous ceasefire had broken down in March, and a wave of airstrikes followed, as well as an 11-week blockade on all aid. Though some humanitarian assistance was allowed in from late May, military action intensified at the same time.Growing numbers of desperate Palestinians were being killed as they sought scarce food either from looted aid convoys or from distribution hubs set up by the new, secretive Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a group backed byIsraeland the US as an alternative to the existing, much more comprehensive UN-led system. Rolling IDF “evacuation orders” covered much of the territory.map 114 JuneOn the second day of the Israel-Iran conflict, at least 20 Palestinianswere killed by Israeli strikesin Gaza, according to local health officials, and another 11 near food distribution points run by the GHF. Palestinian witnesses said Israeli forces fired on the crowds, while the Israeli military said it fired warning shots near people it described as suspects who approached its forces.Footage filmed inGazaCity showed people pleading for food at a soup kitchen distribution point.Gaza City soup kitchen 14 June.A day later, eight more Palestinians were killed as they sought aid.16 JuneBefore dawn, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of hungry Palestinians heading for two hubs managed by the GHF. At least 37 people died, mainly while trying to reach the GHF centre near the southern city of Rafah, which has largely been razed by the Israeli military, and close to a second GHF site in central Gaza.Most of the casualties were taken to the Nasser hospital, which received more than 300 injured people. More than 200 patients were take to a Red Cross field hospital – the highest number received by the facility in one single mass casualty incident to date.17 JuneOn the bloodiest day for weeks in Gaza, witnesses described scenes like “a horror movie” after Israeli forces fired towards a crowd waiting for UN trucks loaded with flour near Khan Younis in the south, killing at least 59 Palestinians and injuring hundreds more.Gaza death graphicFootage showed people carrying flour bags away from the scene before the IDF began shooting.People carrying flour at food distribution site.A short time later injured Palestinians were seen arriving at a hospital in Khan Younis.View image in fullscreenPalestinians carry the bodies of loved ones killed when the IDF opened fire near Khan Younis on 17 June.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockThe incident led to a temporary suspension of such convoys, exacerbating an acute lack of food in the devastated territory. Fuel, clean water, medical supplies and much else is also in short supply, with dire humanitarian consequences. An Israeli military spokesperson said troops followed international law and took feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.18 JuneOnce again, vast crowdsgathered to “self-distribute”flour loaded on to aid convoys in central Gaza, and once again they were fired on by Israeli troops. Reports put the death toll at 11.

The term “cakeism” – the false belief that one can simultaneously enjoy the benefits of two mutually exclusive choices – may forever be associated with the Brexit negotiations, when keeping the advantages of EU membership while also shedding its costs became the UK’s official bargaining position.But the appeal of cakeism endures, and over the last week the US president’s approach to the conflict with Iran has started to look distinctly gateau-shaped.Donald Trumpwants the glory of a decisive victory on the battlefield but is not so keen on the long-term repercussions that come with it: tit-for-tat retaliations, unforeseeable conflict spillage, focused diplomacy, or even regime change – the kind of talk the Maga movement associates with Trump’s predecessors.Questions over the efficacy of the US strikes of Iranian nuclear facilities remain unanswered. And as the regime in Tehran defiantly insists on its own “victory”, insists thattrust in the UN nuclear inspectorate is “broken”, and cracks down on dissent at home, it is starting to look as if Trump might not be able to have his cake and eat it after all. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to diplomatic editorPatrick Wintourabout how weakened Iran really is, and what this could mean for the stability of the ceasefire. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesWelfare| Downing Street’s plans to see off a major Labour welfare rebellionwere in chaos on Monday night, amid continued brinkmanship between MPs and the government over the scale of the concessions. There was significant division between government departments over how to respond to rebels’ demands ahead of the knife-edge vote on Tuesday.UK news| Policehave formally opened a criminal investigationinto comments made by Bob Vylan and Kneecap at Glastonbury after reviewing video and audio footage of the performances. Meanwhile on Monday, the BBC said that it should not have allowed chants of “Death to the IDF” at Bob Vylan’s performance to be broadcast.Crown Estate| King Charles is set to receive official annual income of £132m next year, after hisportfolio of land and propertymade more than £1bn in profits thanks to a boom in the offshore wind sector.Arms trade| Britain’s decision to allow the export of F-35 fighter jet components to Israel, despite accepting they could be used in breach of international humanitarian law in Gaza, was lawful,London’s high court has ruled. The judges ruled that the “acutely sensitive and political issue” was “a matter for the executive … not for the courts”.Crime| A 92-year-old man who evaded justice for almost 60 yearshas been convictedof raping and murdering a woman in Bristol, after a review by a cold case police team and scientists. Officers believe the 58-year gap between the crime and the conviction may be the biggest in modern English policing history.In depth: ‘The situation is very unstable, and anything could kick it off’View image in fullscreenAmir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, in June.Photograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersOn 21 June, the US air force and navy bombed three of Iran’s nuclear sites, thus becoming directly involved in a military conflict started whenIsraelstruck key military and nuclear facilities in Iran eight days earlier. Since then, president Donald Trump has been ever more adamant that Iran’s nuclear facilities have been “completely and totally obliterated”, and that the ceasefire agreed on 24 June would bring “tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY” to the region in perpetuity.A week on, the ceasefire still holds, but questions over the strikes’ long-term consequences are mounting. CNN has reported US intelligence assessments that the bombing did not destroy the core components of the country’s nuclear programme.The regime in Tehran, meanwhile, has struck a note of defiance, with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claiming his country had “dealt a severe slap to the face of America” with a missile attack on a US base in nearby Qatar. Which begs the question: didOperation Midnight Hammerweaken Iran’s nuclear ambitions, or will it embolden its leadership to pursue them in the long term?How damaged are Iran’s military capabilities?The intense fighting between Israel and Iran – now often referred to as the “12-day war” – exposed the Islamic Republic’s air defences, showing it was not able to defend itself as effectively against aerial assaults as it has previously claimed.The American strike on the three nuclear facilities – at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan – was undoubtedly effective. “Most serious analysts think that the damage of the US strikes was very, very serious, and it’s hard to imagine that Iran still has a credible nuclear weapons programme in place that has somehow eluded intelligence,” said Patrick Wintour.That is not the same as “obliteration”, however – significantly so. Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that while American bombers had “severely damaged” Iranian facilities, “one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there”, andTehran could begin weaponising uranium againin “a matter of months”.“Even if Iran just has a couple of dozen centrifuges out of tens of thousands left, it could purify its uranium stockpiles within about three months,” said Patrick. “That’s the problem with a military solution and no diplomatic strategy behind it – it would have to be a total wipeout to solve the problem.”Last week, Iran’s parliament voted unanimously to suspend all cooperation with the IAEA, and the message that Tehran does not want anyone to have a close look at the wreckage was underlined by a menacing article in an Iranian newspaper, claiming Grossi was an Israeli spy who should be executed. “They cannot have access to our site,” Iran’s UN ambassadorAmir-Saeid Iravani said. “Our assessment is that they have not done their jobs.”Until the nuclear inspectorate is allowed access to what remains of the facilities, Patrick said, “we are driving blind” – which, at the moment, could actually be not just in Iran’s but also Trump’s interest. “Iran wants to have nuclear ambiguity for now”, he added. For the US president, meanwhile, the lack of empirical evidence has allowed him to claim an emphatic military victory: “It has allowed his assessment of the strikes’ impact to become harder and harder.”How isolated is Iran diplomatically?In recent months, Iran’s foreign minister has invested some effort trying to convey to Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE that Tehran is not some rogue bellicose state but a mature diplomatic player in the region. “The war has undone that,” said Patrick. “And that’s the case even though those wealthy Gulf states don’t publicly support what the US has done, and even bemoan its short sightedness in private.”The 12-day war and its aftermath have also shown up little return for Iran’s diplomatic efforts in Europe. Germany’s new chancellor, conservative Friedrich Merz, praised Israel’s air strikes on the Islamic Republic, saying it was “doing the dirty work for all of us”, and later added there was “no reason” to criticise America’s attack. Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, backed the strikes and only warned mildly of a “risk of escalation” in the Middle East.“What will trouble Tehran most is that it hasn’t managed to leverage the disagreements between Trump and the European Union,” said Patrick. “The Iranians had hoped that Europe would be much more condemnatory of the strikes.”Is the regime also weakened domestically?In the wake of Operation Midnight Hammer, some Maga acolytes on social media called on the Iranian people to rise up against the regime. Given the social and economic situation in the west Asian republic, this might sound like a realistic demand: unemployment and poverty rates are high, inflation at almost 40%, in part due to the state’s self-punishingly high military spending. It was only three years ago that the country saw civil unrest and mass protests against the regime, triggered by the death in police custody of the22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini.Yet Israeli and American air strikes, with a reported death toll of more than 900 lives, have also shored up support for the government. “The regime is trying to galvanise what happened, and there has been a rallying-around-the-flag effect”, Patrick said. “Even critical voices in the diaspora have been mindful of alienating ordinary Iranians.” Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah who has been one of the leading figures of the pro-democracy movement, has endorsed calls for a civil uprising but has appeared isolated.Instead of pro-democracy marches, Tehran has seen the regime parade the coffins of the “martyred” military chiefs and nuclear scientists who died in the strikes to state funerals.The regime has also further tightened its grip on civil liberties, turning on alleged traitors from within. “After the strikes, the Iranian opposition called on the regime to mark a fresh start and release political prisoners”, says Patrick. In fact, the opposite happened.” During the 12-day war, six Iranians were executed on alleged charges of collaborating with Israel. “It is clear that a new wave of intense repression has begun, more severe than ever before”, the daughter of one political prisonertold Guardian reporters.Prioritising military over social spending might become a harder political sell in the wake of the war, but then there is only so much political-selling that authoritarian regimes need to do while they have the electorate’s hands tied behind their backs. “In truth, Iran’s loathsome regime didn’t even come close to falling”,said foreign affairs commentator Simon Tisdallin his analysis.What does this mean for the ceasefire?The truce between Israel and Iran is volatile. “The situation is very unstable, and anything could kick it off,” said Patrick. The list of unpredictable “anythings” is long: American security agencies have warned of a looming threat of Tehran-backed; US-based“sleeper cells”could be called in for retaliatory attacks; and Iran’s top Shia cleric has issued a fatwa for Trump and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu to be made to “regret their words and mistakes”.Analysts are concerned about the lack of a political programme to keep the ceasefire in place. Trump has said he is “not offering Iran anything”, while the Iranian side has claimed that the US president wants to return to negotiations. In an interview with the BBC on Monday, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said his country would only be open to such talks if the US were to rule out further strikes during the process.But as long as Trump’s intelligence assessment of his victory remains the same, Patrick reckoned there was also considerable pressure to keep the ceasefire in place. “If it were to end, the next stage could only be regime change, and that would take Trump into ideologically difficult territory.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He once found six or seven bedbugs in his blanket when he woke up,” said his daughter Mehraveh Khandan, who described “horrific” sanitary conditions in the prison.Families of political prisoners inIransay conditions have worsened since the end of the 12-day war and that they fear vulnerable detainees will bear the brunt of what activists say is a broader crackdown by the Iranian authorities, whose legitimacy was shaken by Israel’s campaign.View image in fullscreenReza Khandan’s family say he does not have a bed and is being forced to sleep on the floor in an unsanitary prison.The fighting began on 13 June with a barrage of hundreds of Israeli airstrikes that Israel said were aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly responded with a barrage of ballistic missiles and drones. The air war brought in the US and continued until both sides agreed a ceasefire.An unknown number of prisoners were moved by the Iranian authorities to other detention facilities in the aftermath of Israel’s strike on Evin, which killed 71 people, including some in the jail and others in its vicinity. The whereabouts of many is unknown but those who have been in contact with relatives have said their new jails are even worse than Evin, which was notorious for the torture of political detainees.Mehraveh, who is based in Amsterdam, said: “The only cooking water available to prisoners was salty until Sunday. [And] in recent days we have witnessed the disappearance of several prisoners who were already facing the death penalty or long sentences.”Many families have not heard from their loved ones, as long queues have formed for the few phones in detention facilities. Asso Azizi, whose sister Pakhshan Azizi, a Kurdish aid worker, is on death row, said he had not heard from her in two days.She and other women were transferred to Qarchak prison, which is described as overcrowded and unsanitary. “Unfortunately, they were not even able to take their personal and sanitary items with them,” Asso said.Besides the unsanitary conditions, Asso is terrified that the authorities may expedite his sister’s death sentence, which she was handed in July 2024 “solely in relation to her peaceful humanitarian and human rights activities”, according to Amnesty International. The Iranian authorities charged her with armed rebellion against the state.“There is a concern that just as the process of dealing with her case was very hasty and fast, confirming this sentence in only three days, that now they will execute this sentence to create terror among the people,” Asso said.As conditions worsen in prison, activists and residents of Tehran have also described a wave of repression as the country reels from the war. Security forces have set up checkpoints across the country, stopping pedestrians and checking their mobile phones, sometimes detaining people based on their online activity.The security crackdown comes as the Iranian authorities grapple with the extensive Israeli intelligence penetration of its forces and a wave of online criticism.According to Iranian state media, 700 people have been arrested on charges of collaborating with Israel during the 12-day war. The New-York based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) has said hundreds more were arrested in Tehran and six people were executed on espionage charges.Iran’s parliament is considering a bill that allows for broader use of the death penalty for those who are accused of collaborating with foreign powers, with judicial authorities specifically referencing espionage with Israel.Hadi Ghaemi, the CHRI’s executive director, said: “Iranian authorities are locking people up incommunicado without cause or access to a lawyer, and sending them to the gallows on ‘national security’ charges in order to terrorise the public and re-establish control.”The Iranian prison system is murky, particularly for political prisoners. The legal system is plagued with secret trials and allegations of torture. Tracking detainees through the labyrinthine Iranian security apparatus is often a challenge.For families of Iranian political prisoners, the days ahead will be filled with fear. Mehraveh said: “It is clear that a new wave of intense repression has begun, more severe than ever before. We are deeply concerned.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Cervical cancer leads to approximately685 deaths a year in Englandalone.Now a large-scale observational study published in Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinical Medicine has found that older women are more likely to have HPV infections and to have abnormal cells in test results than younger women.Researchers in China analysed cervical cancer screening data for more than 2 million women between 2017 and 2023. Of the 2 million, 17,420 were aged 65 and above; the remainder were younger.The study found greater prevalence of high-risk HPV infections and abnormal cells among women aged 65 and over than in younger women. Nearly 14% of those 65 and over tested positive for high-risk HPV infection types, compared with 8% of those who were younger.Older women were also more likely to be infected with several different types of HPV and have abnormalities picked up on screening.While acknowledging limitations to the study, the findings indicate that “women [aged 65 and above] are a high-risk group for cervical cancer incidence and mortality, necessitating urgent attention from countries worldwide”, the authors conclude.“Most guidelines suggest stopping screening for those with adequate primary screening and no high-risk factors, particularly for women under 65,” they say. “However, the situation differs for those over 65, who may not have been vaccinated or thoroughly screened. With increasing life expectancy, the risk of cervical cancer in this demographic is significantly heightened.”Responding to the findings, Athena Lamnisos, chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said among people over 65, “there is a largely unvaccinated population who, if under-screened or if they have never attended screening, may well still be at high risk of cervical cancer”.“We would look to the National Screening Committee to examine the findings and see if there would be benefits in reviewing screening age.”Maxine Lenza, health information manager atCancerResearch UK, said: “Recent improvements to the test in the UK means it’s an extremely effective way of preventing cervical cancer and saving lives, so those over the age of 65 and up to date with their cervical screening will have a very low risk of developing the disease. However, women over 65 who have never had cervical screening can request a test with their GP practice.”An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS cervical screening programme in England follows expert recommendations on age and frequency of screening by the UK National Screening Committee, which are based on regular reviews of the best evidence globally.“Women with an HPV-positive screening result at the age of 65 are invited for additional screening to monitor their ongoing risk and we would encourage all women to attend appointments when invited to ensure they have the best protection against cervical cancer.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “The screening age brackets are based on robust scientific evidence and an expert recommendation from the UK National Screening Committee, however any women who are worried about their symptoms can speak to their GP who will decide the best course of action.“It is vital that we increase the number of women accepting their invitation for cervical cancer screening within the existing age bracket. As part of our 10-year health plan, those who are eligible will be offered convenient human papillomavirus self-sampling kits – breaking down barriers to healthcare as we shift from treatment to prevention.”Explore more on these topicsCervical cancerWorld Health OrganizationHealthCancerWomenVaccines and immunisationOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

The universal credit and personal independence payment bill passed it second reading on Tuesday by 335 votes to 260, a majority of 75.How No 10 went from bullish to badly damaged as rebels forced further welfare bill concessionsRead moreMPs were particularly concerned that the government’s own poverty analysis showed that, even after a series of concessions, 150,000 of the most vulnerable people would end up in relative poverty as a result. Officials said the modelling did not take into account the changes being made to the NHS and back-to-work schemes.The bulk of the rebels were from the left of the party, and none of them were the select committee chairs who spearheaded the rebellion last week, but it was a sizeable rebellion given the scale of concessions already made.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, and government whips warned Downing Street on Tuesday that further movement was needed after meetings with Labour MPs already unhappy over the substance of the bill and Starmer’s approach after he dismissed criticism as “noises off”.As a result, the government confirmed the changes to disability payments will only take place after Stephen Timms, the welfare minister, has reported the findings of his review into the system, due to conclude in autumn 2026. Originally, the Pip changes were due to come in from November 2026.Government insiders suggested that resignations could follow the chaotic scenes, although at a cabinet meeting before the vote Starmer defended his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who has been credited for winning Labour’s 165 working majority, but faced some internal criticism over the row.“We will learn from our mistakes, but we will not turn on each other,” Starmer told his ministers. “We will not resile from our record of achievements and we will not turn on our staff – including our chief of staff, without whom none of us would be sitting around this cabinet table.”The process left Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, badly humiliated with the U-turn coming just hours after she had told the Commons the new Pip four-point threshold would apply from November 2026 and emphasised the need for the Timms review to take its time.Asked if her position was untenable after the series of concessions left the bill a hollowed-out version of the original proposals, Kendall insisted that despite what she called “a bumpy time” with the vote, the broader policy was on track.“I think listening is actually a strength in politics, as indeed it is in life, and I’ll continue to listen to colleagues,” she said. “What was very interesting was how much support there was for the principle of reforming the welfare state.”She insisted the Labour party was “100%” behind the Starmer, but added: “There are definitely lessons to learn from this process. I certainly will do that, and I’m sure my colleagues will too, but we have agreed on the principles of reform here.”The removal of an entire clause of the bill means there will be no immediate changes to Pip, the most contentious part of the changes, and where ministers hoped to make the bulk of savings. The Timms review will be “co-produced” with disabled people, leaving open the possibility that they will never happen.However, plans to increase the standard rate of universal credit, to incentivise more people back into work and extra protections for the most severely ill and disabled will go ahead. Separate plans for back-to-work schemes will also proceed.Last week, 126 Labour MPs, led by the Treasury select committee chair, Meg Hillier, signed an amendment designed to blow up the bill. Ministers said that no current claimant would be affected by the changes to UC and Pip. Rebels were also promised the Timms review of the criteria would heavily involve disability groups.But the terms of reference of the review made clear that there would still be a higher bar for obtaining Pip – new claimants would need a high score of four in at least one of the daily living categories for assessment to qualify.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/30/who-are-the-key-labour-rebels-in-the-revolt-against-starmers-welfare-billSubstantial numbers of the rebels fell into line after the government’s initial concessions, however 42 Labour MPsbackeda separate wrecking amendment, which did not pass, tabled by the backbencher Rachael Maskell.The chancellor will now have to find another £5bn in savings at her budget as a direct result of all the concessions on the welfare bill, as well as £1.25bn to cover the cost of the winter fuel U-turn, all raising the likelihood of her being forced to put up taxes.Ruth Curtice, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “The government originally hoped to save £4.8bn from its welfare reforms in the crucial year of 29-30. The upshot of all the concessions this week is it will now not make any net savings in that year.“The changes to universal credit are nonetheless important for recipients and their work incentives, and are expected to save money in the longer term.”Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, posted on social media: “This is an utter capitulation. Labour’s welfare bill is now a TOTAL waste of time. It effectively saves £0, helps no one into work, and does NOT control spending. It’s pointless. They should bin it, do their homework, and come back with something serious.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsLabourHouse of CommonsDisabilityKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Dozens of them were still planning to vote against the government, and one of Keir Starmer’s major economic policies hung in the balance.The prime minister agreed to Rayner’s proposal to make the biggest concession available to the government without withdrawing the bill altogether.The planned cuts to personal independence payments (Pips) would be shelved, Starmer agreed, and any future changes to the system would be implemented only after a review by the welfare minister Stephen Timms, in conjunction with disability groups.Welfare bill passes after Keir Starmer offers late concessionRead moreThe prime minister relayed his message to a handful of potential Labour rebels, and directly to the Commons chamber, where MPs had been debating the measures for more than three hours. In huddled conversations on the frontbench, the U-turn was communicated to the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, and then hastilyannounced by Timms.This capped the most tumultuous 24 hours of Keir Starmer’s premiership: one that has underlined how badly damaged the prime minister has been by his first year in power and which could define the rest of his time in Downing Street.Ministers began the week in bullish mood. TheU-turns announced on Friday– including limiting the Pip changes to new claimants only – appeared to have won the support of leading rebels including Meg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury select committee.Kendall went to the Commons to outline the concessions to MPs. But despite her confident tone, some MPs felt she had tripped on some of the finer details and even contradicted herself at times.Rebels had been particularly upset by one important clarification Kendall offered: the Timms review would not be ready in time to forestall the new four-point system. That system would be imposed as planned in November 2026, with any changes recommended by Timms coming into force at a later stage.View image in fullscreenStephen Timms next to Liz Kendall in the Commons. Timms announced the U-turn in the chamber, where MPs had been debating the bill more for than three hours.Photograph: Parliament TV“We were already worried about a two-tier system,” said one waveringLabourMP. “Now the government was telling us it was going to be a three-tier system.”What made it worse was the unexpected publication of a new impact assessment, showing that even after the government’s changes the bill would push 150,000 people into relative poverty.Whips spent much of Monday calling prospective rebels, focusing particularly on those first elected in 2024 whom they deemed most likely to change their minds.The tactics showed some signs of success, but also created anger among many longer-serving Labour backbenchers.“They’re focusing only on the 2024 intake,” said one person who signed Hillier’s amendment. “They seem to have forgotten the rest of us exist.”Complaints about the behaviour of Labour whips have plagued the bill throughout the negotiations and became louder over Monday and Tuesday.“Once they thought they had it in the bag, we never heard again from a single minister,” one MP said.Downbeat Liz Kendall acts as if even she no longer believes in welfare reforms | John CraceRead moreAnother added: “It has been student politics throughout. They were laughing that the rebels didn’t have the numbers, then got angry when they realised they did and started threatening deselection instead.”By Monday evening it wasclear the government was still in trouble. A new wrecking amendment was published by the Labour MP Rachael Maskell, complete with the signatures of 39 MPs.Many Labour MPs did not want to join forces with Maskell, whom they considered an imperfect leader of the rebellion.“Rachael called me to ask me to sign the amendment and I asked her what the political strategy was after laying it,” said one. “She didn’t seem to have one.”Another added that Maskell had alienated some moderates by ostentatiously sitting next to Jeremy Corbyn during Monday’s heated Commons debate. “We fought Corbyn for five years,” said the MP. “And there she is cosying up to him. It was not a great look for someone looking to win over colleagues to her cause.”These concerns did not change the fact that many MPs were still planning to rebel – many more than the 39 who signed Maskell’s amendment.Ministers knew this, and at one point on Monday evening Kendall came close to making further U-turns on the timing of the Timms review and a promise to address the potential “three-tier” system.Late on Monday that offer was hastily withdrawn amid disagreement between Kendall’s department and No 10 on how to respond. The Treasury insisted they could not release any more money.At one point negotiations over the concessions became so fraught that when one rebel MP asked if the government could include lifting the two-child benefit limit, a furious aide told them: “You’ve just spent the money for that!”Tuesday began with the prime minister on the front foot.Starmer opened his weekly cabinet meeting with a warning shot to those who had been anonymously blaming his advisers for the chaos surrounding the welfare bill.The briefing wars must stop, he said, giving a full-throated defence of his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. He said without his master strategist “none of us would be sitting around this cabinet table”.For most of the rest of the day, ministers continued to defend their plans. Having agreed concessions with Labour rebels days earlier, the government was determined to stay the course.Opening the debate on Tuesday afternoon, Kendall reinforced this message, with no sign of the concession to come. “This bill and our wider welfare reforms seek to fix the broken benefits system that we inherited from the Conservatives and deliver a better life for millions of people across our country,” she told the Commons.The truth was, however, that ministers were still unsure even at this late stage whether they could get the bill through the Commons.As they huddled in corners of the parliamentary estate on Tuesday morning, Labour MPs admitted to each other that they were still uncertain how to vote.“What are you going to do?” asked one. Their colleague replied: “I don’t know, I’ll probably make my mind up during the debate.”Sitting at tables in the atrium of Portcullis House, a number of worried new MPs were war-gaming what would happen if the government were to lose. Several asked journalists if they knew what it would mean.“It would unleash something a lot of colleagues don’t intend to,” one supportive MP said. “I think only this morning was the time they are really grappling with that. I think it’s the PM’s only hope to be honest. Do you really want to completely destroy this government’s authority?”Several MPs said they were thinking of rebelling even though they had not signed Maskell’s amendment. “I didn’t want the whips pestering me all night,” one said.Even those loyal to Starmer admit the lead-up to the vote had been badly handled, but said that in the final reckoning many MPs had decided the consequences of rebelling would be too severe.“People have started to think about what the alternative is,” one Labour MP said. “The alternative is maybe not to bring down the government, but it would get pretty close.”Meanwhile, Rayner, who led the negotiations for the government throughout last week, was engaged in shuttle diplomacy, crossing the floor of Portcullis House on multiple occasions as she carried messages between rebels and the whips’ office.The final message was clear: Labour was heading for a possible defeat on one of its most important economic policies. Ministers could gut the bill, withdraw it, or lose.Timms’ dramatic announcement on Tuesday evening may have staved off the threat of a ministerial resignation but it leaves Starmer badly damaged and his chancellor having to find nearly £5bn of extra cuts in the budget this year.MPs are particularly irritated that the issue of welfare cuts has tripped up another Labour leader, as it did with Tony Blair, Ed Miliband and Harriet Harman.Many potential rebels cited the experience in 2015 when Harman as interim leader whipped her MPs to abstain on government benefits cuts, a decision which helped propel Jeremy Corbyn to office in the subsequent leadership election.“Many of us were thinking of abstaining at second reading and then using the extra time to push for more concessions,” said one MP. “But the problem is this was the tactic Harriet used in 2015, and that backfired badly.”Conservatives were gleeful. “While we’ve been here debating it, the bill has more or less disintegrated,” said Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary. “Describing this as chaos now feels like an understatement.”Many Labour MPs agreed. “I’m absolutely amazed at what’s happened even this afternoon,” Ian Lavery told the Commons during Tuesday’s debate. “This is crazy. This is outrageous.”As they reflect on a bruising 48 hours, some government officials are contrite. “It is clear we failed to take people with us,” said one Downing Street aide.Others were more defiant. “It’s the Brexiteers all over again,” said one government official, likening the Labour rebels to the Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs who caused such problems for a succession of Tory MPs. “They don’t know when to take yes for an answer.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsDisabilityLabourKeir StarmerLiz KendallnewsShareReuse this content"

Putintseva, who was born in Russia, changed to represent Kazakhstan in 2012.A Wimbledon spokesperson declined to say if the spectator was ejected. “Security was in the area. The issue was dealt with,” he said. The incident is the latest surrounding security measures after a man who was given a restraining order in Dubai in February for stalking Emma Raducanuwas blocked from buying ticketsfor the championships this month in the public ballot.Dite said: “Protocols were followed. The matter was dealt with.”On Tuesday morning, more than 10,000 spectators queued outside the grounds with fans and umbrellas to watch British playersincluding Jack Draper, a top contender for the men’s singles championship.On Monday, more than 13,000 people entered the grounds after queueing in the heat, some overnight, as opening-day attendance jumped to 42,756 from 40,514 last year. Protesters on the ground’s outskirts called for a boycott of Wimbledon’s banking partner, Barclays, over ties to Israel’s war on Gaza.Temperatures on Tuesday reached 34.2C (93.6F) by early afternoon, as spectators frequently sought shade and were encouraged to hydrate after a woman collapsed while watching a match on Monday.Dite, discussing the incident on Monday during which Carlos Alcaraz interrupted play to hand a struggling spectator a bottle of water, thanked the returning Wimbledon champion for his support and acknowledged there had been a delay in the medical response.“Yes, it did take a while, but this lady had fainted, so it needed to be managed very carefully. I know there was a bit of delay but we all work very hard,” said Dite.“It takes a while sometimes to just assess the situation,” she added. “And thanks to Carlos for his support for going to get some water.”Daniel Evans was the first British player to go through to the second round of Wimbledon on Tuesday after defeating Jay Clarke in an all-British clash. Draper eased into the second round after his opponent Sebastian Baez retired injured, while wildcard Jack Pinnington Jones completed a straight-sets victory over Tomás Etcheverry.Six Britons – Clarke, Heather Watson, Johannus Monday, Jodie Burrage, George Loffhagen and Francesca Jones – suffered first-round exits.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The US president responded: “Well, then, we’ll have to arrest him,”Axios reported.Mamdaniposteda statement on X in response. “The President of the United States just threatened to have me arrested, stripped of my citizenship, put in a detention camp and deported. Not because I have broken any law but because I will refuse to let Ice terrorize our city,” he wrote.He continued: “His statements don’t just represent an attack on our democracy but an attempt to send a message to every New Yorker who refuses to hide in the shadows: if you speak up, they will come for you. We will not accept this intimidation.”Controversy over his immigration status follows a chorus of Islamophobic attacks on his Muslim faith following his victory in last week’s New York mayoral primary, when he finished first in a field that included Andrew Cuomo, the former New York state governor and favored candidate of the Democratic establishment.It also comes after theTrump administration instructed attorneys to prioritize denaturalizing foreign-born US citizenswho had committed specified crimes. A justice department memo instructs lawyers to institute proceedings against naturalized citizens who ares suspected of having “illegally procured” naturalization or having done so by “concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation”.Ogles wroteto Pam Bondi, the attorney general, calling for an investigation into Mamdani after his Democratic mayoral primary victory on the grounds that “he may have procured US citizenship through willful misrepresentation or concealment of material support for terrorism”.As evidence, he cited a rap song by Mamdani, entitled my love to the Holy Land five, in which he called members of a foundation convicted of supporting Hamas “my guys”. He also referred to Mamdani’s refusal to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada”.In an accompanying post on X, Ogles wrote: “Zohran ‘little muhammad’ Mamdani is an antisemitic, socialist, communist who will destroy the great City of New York. He needs to be deported.”Asked about Ogles’s call,Leavitt said: “I have not seen those claims, but surely if they are true, it’s something that should be investigated.”The justice department has confirmed receiving Ogles’s letter but has not commented further.Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator for Connecticut who has become one of the Trump administration’s most effective critics, called the demand to denaturalize Mamdani “racist bullshit”.“Trump will stop at nothing to protect billionaires and price gouging corporations, even racist bullshit like this,”he wrote.“Zohran won because he ran a campaign laser focused on putting power back in the hands of working people. And that’s a threat to the Mar-a-Lago crowd.”Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, has had his social media posts and previous political activism fiercely scrutinized since last week’s election victory, which was accompanied by promises of leftwing populist policies for New York if he is eventually elected mayor.Amid a chorus of rightwing vitriol,Donald Trump has called him “a pure communist”and has threatened to cut off funds to New York if Mamdani becomes mayor and “doesn’t behave himself”.At a news conference at the official unveiling of a new detention centre for immigrants in Florida’s Everglades, Trump reiterated his communist remark and referred to allegations that Mamdani had obtained his citizenship “illegally”.“We don’t need a communist in this country, but if we have one, I’m going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation. We send him money, we send him all the things that he needs to run a government,” Trump said.“We’re going to be watching that very carefully. A lot of people are saying, he’s here illegally. We’re going to look at everything, but ideally, he’s going to turn out to be much less than a communist. Right now he’s a communist, that’s not a socialist.”Mamdani also commented on the fact that Trump praisedEric Adams, the current New York City mayor who is struggling in his re-election campaign and switched from representing the Democratic party to running again as an independent. Trump said Adams was a “good person” whom he had “helped out a little bit”, referring to the US justice department in Aprildismissinga federal corruption case against Adams.Mamdani said in his post: “That Trump included praise for Adams in his authoritarian threats is unsurprising.”Joanna Walters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniTrump administrationNew YorkUS politicsDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

But it was greeted with skepticism by moderateRepublicans, who blanched at the bill’s cuts to two major safety net programs to offset expensive outlays elsewhere: tens of billions of dollars to fund mass deportations and build border walls, along with tax-cut extensions and new deductions that could increase the budget deficit by trillions of dollars over the coming decade.Even conservatives like Missouri’s Josh Hawley were nervous about the bill’s targeting of Medicaid, the program that provides healthcare to poor and disabled Americans. He went to the New York Times and published anan op-edheadlined: “Don’t cut Medicaid”.Senate Republicans pass Trump’s sweeping policy bill, clearing major hurdleRead moreYet just after noon on the first day of July, it became clear that the Senate’s Republican leaders had mollified those holdouts through a series of bargains struck right up until the final votes. The bill receivedjust enough supportfor passage, after JD Vance, the vice-president, came to the Senate chamber to break a tie.“No bill of this size comes together without a lot of very hard work,” Republican Senate majority leader John Thune said following the vote. Left unsaid was the tumult that occurred on the road to getting there, and what it may cost Republicans in the future.It started over the weekend, when Thune movedto open debateon the measure. Kentucky senator Rand Paul voted no, concerned about the bill’s impact to the budget deficit, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated could total $3.3tn through 2034. Also objecting was moderate North Carolina senator Thom Tillis, which prompted an immediate attack from Trump, after which Tillis said hewould not seek re-electionnext year. Forecasters immediately saw the Republican defection as a boost for Democrats hoping to claim the purple state’s seat.Hawley’s objections were couched in concerns that theworking-class voterswho backed Trump and other Republicans last November would desert the party if it pushed ahead with the cuts to Medicaid. The bill imposes new work requirements on enrollees, and also freezes or reduces the provider taxes that states have used to finance their Medicaid programs, which is feared to badly harm rural hospitals.Senate leaders agreed to add a special fund to support rural hospitals that eventually grew to $50bn, as well as provisions to compensate nuclear radiation survivors that Hawley has long championed. Hawley voted for debate and passage of the bill, saying: “I will continue to do everything in my power to reverse future cuts to Medicaid. If Republicans want to be the party of the working class, we cannot cut health insurance for working people.”Yet the bill would do just that – the CBO estimates that the number of uninsured people will climb by 11.8 million in 2034 because of the measure. And the new tax deduction would only last through Trump’s current term, while the provisions to extend cuts made during his first term – the most expensive part of the bill – are estimated tomostly benefit the rich.Passage of the bill still came down to the wire. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who is Democrats’ top target to unseat in next year’s midterms, voted to begin debate but could not be swayed when it came to final passage.“My vote against this bill stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid,” she said after she voted no, alongside Paul, Tillis – who also objected to the Medicaid cuts – and all the Democrats.In the final hours before the bill passed, the most sought-after vote was Lisa Murkowski’s, the Alaska moderate who was known for bucking her party, andplayed a partin torpedoing the GOP’s attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act during Trump’s first term.No such saga was to play out this time. Into the bill went provisions targeted specifically at her state, including an increase in tax deductions for Native Alaskan whalers. And while the bill will force most states to pick up some of the costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), a move expected to result in millions of people losing benefits they use to buy food, a provision was inserted to temporarily exempt states with high rates of over or underpayments – a group that includes Alaska.It appeared to work – Murkowski voted for the bill.“This was one of the hardest votes I have taken during my time in the Senate,” she latersaid in a statementthat went on to describe “an awful process”.“My sincere hope is that this is not the final product. This bill needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the president’s desk,” she said. Yet that is where Trump wants the bill to be by Friday, the Independence Day holiday, and the House is now racing to pass the Senate’s version in time.Democrats, meanwhile, could do little but watch and attempt to offer amendments that were mostly voted down. Minutes after its passage, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer convened a press conference where he warned that Republicans would regret passing this bill.“When their electric bills go up, when their premiums go up, when kids and parents lose Snap funding, the people of America will remember this vote,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsTrump administrationUS SenateUS CongressRepublicansanalysisShareReuse this content"

Websites for thenational assessmentsand theUS Global Change Research Programwere down Monday and Tuesday with no links, notes or referrals elsewhere. The White House, which was responsible for the assessments, said the information will be housed within Nasa to comply with the law, but gave no further details.Searches for the assessments on Nasa websites did not turn them up. Nasa did not respond to requests for information. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which coordinated the information in the assessments, did not respond to repeated inquiries.Trump’s ‘climate’ purge deleted a new extreme weather risk tool. We recreated itRead more“It’s critical for decision-makers across the country to know what the science in the National Climate Assessment is. That is the most reliable and well-reviewed source of information about climate that exists for the United States,” said Kathy Jacobs, a University of Arizona climate scientist, who coordinated the 2014 version of the report.“It’s a sad day for the United States if it is true that the National Climate Assessment is no longer available,” Jacobs added. “This is evidence of serious tampering with the facts and with people’s access to information, and it actually may increase the risk of people being harmed by climate-related impacts.”Harvard climate scientist John Holdren, who was Barack Obama’s science adviser and whose office directed the assessments, said that after the 2014 edition, he visited governors, mayors and other local officials who told him how useful the 841-page report had been. It helped them decide whether to raise roads, build seawalls and even move hospital generators from basements to roofs, he said.“This is a government resource paid for by the taxpayer to provide the information that really is the primary source of information for any city, state or federal agency who’s trying to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate,” said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who has been a volunteer author for several editions of the report.Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in Noaa’s library. Nasa’s open science data repository includes dead links to the assessment site.The most recent report, issued in 2023, includes an interactive atlas that zooms down to the county level. It found that climate change is affecting people’s security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority and Native American communities often disproportionately at risk.The 1990 Global Change Research Act requires a national climate assessment every four years and directs the president to establish an interagency United States Global Change Research Program. In the spring, theTrump administrationtold the volunteer authors of the next climate assessment that their services weren’t needed and ended the contract with the private firm that helps coordinate the website and report.Additionally, Noaa’s main climate.gov website was recently forwarded to a different Noaa website. Social media and blogs at Noaa and Nasa about climate impacts for the general public were cut or eliminated.“It’s part of a horrifying big picture,” Holdren said. “It’s just an appalling whole demolition of science infrastructure.”The national assessments are more useful than international climate reports put out by the UN every seven or so years because they are more localized and more detailed, Hayhoe and Jacobs said.The national reports are not only peer-reviewed by other scientists, but examined for accuracy by the National Academy of Sciences, federal agencies, the staff and the public.Hiding the reports would be censoring science, Jacobs said.It’s also dangerous for the country, Hayhoe said, comparing it to steering a car on a curving road by only looking through the rearview mirror: “And now, more than ever, we need to be looking ahead to do everything it takes to make it around that curve safely. It’s like our windshield’s being painted over.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisTrump administrationUS weatherUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, he said: “Anybody would be better than J Powell. He’s costing us a fortune because he keeps the rate way up.”He spoke not long after Powell told a European Central Bank (ECB) event in Portugal that the Fed was waiting to assess the inflationary impact of the president’s trade policies.Speaking on a panel of central bankers in Sintra, the Fed chair said: “In effect we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs. Essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs. We didn’t overreact, in fact we didn’t react at all. We’re simply taking some time.”Asked if the Fed would have cut its key Fed funds rate further, from the current target range of 4.25-4.5%, if it wasn’t for tariffs, Powell said: “I think that’s right.”Economists generally expect tariffs to be inflationary, as the costs of paying them tend to be passed on to consumers. The effects are highly uncertain, however, as some retailers may be able to absorb some or all of the costs, or switch to alternative suppliers.Powell said: “We haven’t seen effects much from tariffs, and we didn’t expect to by now. We’ve always said the timing, amount and persistence of the inflation would be highly uncertain and it’s certainly proved that.”He added: “We’re watching. We expect to see over the summer some higher readings, but we’re prepared to learn that it can be higher, or lower, or later or sooner than we’d expected.”Trump has consistently sought to undermine Powell since returning to the White House, peppering him with insults such as,“major loser”and“very dumb”,and reportedlyconsidering replacing himbefore his term finishes in May next year.When these personal attacks were raised at the ECB event, the Fed governor received a round of supportive applause from the audience – and from his fellow central bankers on the panel.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has suggested theTrump administrationmight take advantage of the opening of a vacant seat on the Fed’s board to appoint a potential successor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photographs by José CíceroTue 1 Jul 2025 05.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 14.31 EDTShareMinaçu, a small city in inlandBraziland home to the only asbestos mine in the Americas, is set to become the first operation outside Asia to produce four rare earths on a commercial scale – a group of minerals key to the energy transition at the centre of the trade dispute between China and the US.Until now, China has dominated the separation of rare earths, and accounts for90% of the manufacture of rare-earth magnets, or super magnets, which are made with these elements and used in electric cars, wind turbines and military equipment such as jets.But in April, Chinarestricted its exports of the minerals in response to US tariffs, causinguncertainty over global supply. Brazil’s incipient production could hardly be better timed. To stimulate the sector, the Brazilian government has issued a call for tenders with an investment forecast of 5bn reals (£670m) inprojects related to the supplyof strategic minerals, such as rare earths.With the second-largest known reserves of rare earths in the world,Brazilappears to be a strategic alternative to China, says Constantine Karayannopoulos, an industry expert. “I’ve been evaluating [this market] around the world for years, and I think Brazil has by far the best deposits of rare earths,” he says.The Brazilian new frontier is in Minaçu, 237 miles (382 km) from the capital, Brasília, where a mining company controlled by an American fund began extracting rare-earth minerals in 2024 with the aim of export – to China.View image in fullscreenMinaçu’s asbestos mine has left three huge open pits in the mountains and used to shake the town with its explosions.Photograph: José Cícero/The GuardianThe town of 27,000 inhabitants was founded around the exploitation of asbestos, a mineral used in construction and which boosted the local economy for decades. But in 2017 all production and trade of the mineral was banned by the Brazilian supreme court due to its harmful effects on health. Today, more than 65 countries have banned or restricted the use of asbestos.In 2019, the state of Goiás reauthorised asbestos production solely for export, but the constitutionality of the law has been under review by the supreme court since then, threatening the future of mining in Minaçu – until the discovery of rare earth elements.Rare earths are a group of 17 elements with high magnetism and the ability to absorb light, features that make them essential for the transition to clean energy. Some of the most coveted are neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium – used in the manufacture of electric motors and wind turbines, two industries that fuel the demand for rare earths, whichhave doubled globallybetween 2015 and 2023.The complex and expensive separation of these elements is done almost entirely in China, which has invested heavily in the industrial chain since the 1990s.Now, the Serra Verde mining company, controlled by Denham Capital, an American investment fund, wants to be the first outside Asia to produce a concentrate containing the four main rare earths used in super magnets on a commercial scale.View image in fullscreenThe Serra Verde mining company wants to be the first outside Asia to produce a concentrate containing the four main rare earths on a commercial scale.Photograph: José Cícero/The GuardianThe operation is based on one of the largest deposits of ionic clay outside south-east Asia. Unlike the hard rock deposits found in Australia and the US, clay extraction is less expensive and less environmentally aggressive.For Minaçu, rare earths are the promise of a fresh start. In 2017, Sama was compelled to halt the asbestos mining that for 50 years had shaped the town. The temporary permit granted for export extraction two years later permitted it to keep operating, but with diminished capacity.So Serra Verde’s licence, granted by the state in 2019 to explore rare earths, was met with enthusiasm locally. “When [Sama] closed down, it was a shock,” says Hivan Soares, 39. “But then there was that expectation of Serra Verde’s arrival.”Before the 1962 Cana Brava asbestos deposit discovery, the savannah nearChapada dos Veadeiroswas inhabited by the Indigenous Avá-Canoeiro people and a few miners. Sama built the first houses and paved streets – using asbestos – and established a hospital, police station and school.The mine and the town were so connected that in the 1970s and 1980s, Minaçu’s houses, cars and trees were covered in fine white dust from the mine tailings. Older residents remember when it used to “snow” in the village.“Until 2019, Sama was a mother to the city,” says Hivan Soares, a former employee of the company, about its nickname.View image in fullscreenA worker bags chrysotile, or white asbestos, at the Cana Brava mine in Minaçu, January 2013.Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/ReutersHalf a century later, Minaçu remains heavily dependent on mining. “It’s a city produced by and for mining capital,” says geographer Fábio Macedo Barbosa, who studied Minaçu for his PhD thesis.Still, not even at its peak did asbestos mining translate into economic diversification and increased local wealth. According to the Brazilian government, 32% of families in Minaçu are living in poverty.Between 2014 and 2020, royalties paid to the municipality did not reduce dependence on welfare, says researcher Agnes Serrano, who wrote a PhD thesis on Minaçu at the University of Brasília.Ricardo Gonçalves, a geography professor at the State University of Goiás, came to the same conclusion after analysing the number of people living in poverty between 2015 and 2022. “The fact that more than 20% of the population remains socially vulnerable shows that the profits from asbestos mining do not result in quality of life for the local population,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For this to happen, production must still increase. The operation start was delayed from 2022 to January 2024, and the only two shipments to China, totalling 60 tons in September and 419 tons in February, are far from the 5,000-ton yearly goal.“It will bring enormous wealth to the city,” Leréia believes.Abundant, easy to extract, flexible, heat- and fire-resistant, asbestos was widely used in building materials such as roof tiles and water tanks – and still is in countries including India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Thailand, the main buyers of Minaçu’s ore. The US also imports Minaçu asbestos for the oil industry.But studies raise questions about the health impacts and environmental damage ofmining for asbestos.View image in fullscreenA large rock of asbestos at the entrance to the Minaçu courthouse.Photograph: José Cícero/The GuardianInhaling asbestos ore fibres can cause serious diseases such as asbestosis, pleural plaques, lung cancer and mesothelioma. WHO data reportsmore than 200,000 deaths globallyfrom asbestos exposure, with 70% due to work-related cancers.In Brazil,3,057 deaths from asbestos-related diseasesoccurred between 1996 and 2017, but this figure is likely under-reported. “Several factors contribute to the invisibility of asbestos sufferers,” says Fernanda Giannasi, founder of the Brazilian Association of People Exposed to Asbestos. “Between first exposure and diagnosis, the latency period can be decades. And many doctors lack knowledge, and don’t always ask if patients have had contact with asbestos in the past.”View image in fullscreenRaimundo Ferreira de Lima, 75, one of the first residents of Minaçu and a former Sama employee.Photograph: José Cícero/The GuardianResidents of Minaçu keep a “pact of silence” about asbestos’s effects on workers’ health. Few are as critical as Raimundo de Lima. He says he knew many former workers who died of lung problems. “In the old days, we said such and such a person died clogged by ore blockages,” he says.When asked about health concerns, Eternit, Sama’s parent company, did not comment.Serra Verde claims to be a “sustainable” mining company, highlighting that its extraction is done in shallow holes, without the use of explosives or crushing, using only water and salt to process the ores. The method contrasts with asbestos mining, which left three huge open pits in the mountains and used to shake the city with explosions.The lawless mining gangs targeting the Amazon’s precious green energy mineralsRead moreResidents living near the mine are nonetheless concerned about the potential environmental effects. Families report that since mining began, two streams in Serra Verde have become muddy, with a greasy substance turning clear water a reddish colour. They also reported miscarriages in cattle drinking water from the same source.Families report that company representatives have visited their properties to collect water samples, but have not yet provided residents with an explanation.View image in fullscreenA woman looks towards the mine from her backyard. Residents are concerned about potential environmental and health impacts.Photograph: José Cícero/The GuardianIn a statement, Serra Verde commented on the company’s economic prospects, but has not answered specific questions about the water.Maintaining a positive image in Brazil is crucial for the company as it seeks to differentiate itself from those mining in Asia, where problems have already been identified in the extraction of rare earths.In China, the government shut down several ionic clay mines due to their environmental impact. Extraction then migrated to Myanmar, wherethere have been reportsofammonium nitrate contaminationof soils and rivers.“Now, all the heavy rare earths refined in China come from Myanmar,” says Karayannopoulos, who has already been approached by clients willing to eliminate Myanmar from the global rare earth chain.View image in fullscreenSerra Verde says its extraction of rare earths is done in shallow holes, without the use of the explosives used for asbestos.Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/ReutersStill, Brazil is a long way from becoming an alternative, as a complete industrial strategy is needed for the country to play a greater role in the rare earths production chain. Experts say the country needs investment not only in extraction but also in refineries for separating rare earths, specialised labour, identification of customers outside China and strengthening of domestic demand for super magnets and electric vehicles.Mineral extraction has so far brought more promises than social development to Minaçu. Residents such as Lima believe life mining rare earths will bring no greater prosperity to for most than when they lived with asbestos. “These rare earths are now the same,” he says.This report is a partnership between Agência Pública and the Guardian.

This is the biggest monthly decline since February 2023. The annual rate of house price growth slowed to 2.1% from 3.5% in May.Northern Ireland recorded the fastest annual house price growth, of 9.7% in the second quarter, but down from 13.5% in the first quarter.

She was trying, and struggling, to put her finger on why she had become the most high profile casualty of a typically consequential first round at Wimbledon. “I don’t know, I just feel a little bit disappointed in how I showed up today.”The question before the tournament was whether Gauff could cement her standing at the top of the game by adding Wimbledon tothis year’s French Open titlefor a “Channel Slam”. The answer turned out to be a rather decisive “no”. The second seed was knocked out in less than two hours on Tuesday evening, with the biggest shock how easily she was dispatched by the Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska.Wimbledon’s rampant British players deliver joint-best performance 1976Read moreThe 21-year-old was at first outpunched and ultimately outplayed, but in the middle came a collapse all of her own making. An inability to match up against Yastremska’s power in a series of fierce rallies only led to Gauff taking more risks, which rarely came off. When her serve began to depart her in the first set tie-break the writing was on the wall. Gauff said maybe a bit more practice on grass might have helped her efforts, but she couldn’t be certain.Yastremska seemed almost as nonplussed in victory as Gauff was in defeat. She said she went into the match without even a “small expectation” of winning. “I knew that [Gauff] would not give me one ball for free,” she said. “Today I think I’ve done most of the job. I was leading during the game, during the points. Obviously she plays much playing much better on clay court and hard court and I kind of felt [I have] a bit more priority on grass. But, well, in general, I don’t know!” At which point she burst into laughter.Gauff beat Venus Williams in her first match at the Championships on a run to the fourth round in 2019 as a 15-year-old. Shewon the hearts of SW19then, and the crowd were behind her here, but she is yet to go deeper in the competition and seemed very short on ideas of how to play her way out of the trouble Yastremska was inflicting on her.The Ukrainian has been the subject of media coverage reporting her apparent allergy to grass, but while an aversion to pollen may or may not have provided the animus, she approached the match with maximum intensity, forcing Gauff on to the back foot from the off with her forehand, a weapon that was as fast as it was precise and stayed consistently low.Gauff had the bigger serve, but it failed to rattle Yastremska on the defensive and the Ukrainian broke serve for 4-2 in the first set. In response Gauff simply put more power into her strokes, producing some mesmerising exchanges but also increasing the errors. Only rarely did she think instead to switch up her shot selection, with Yastremska much more vulnerable when forced to change her angles of approach before booming her drives.View image in fullscreenDayana Yastremska celebrates victory over Coco Gauff.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAGauff broke back at 4-5 and dragged the first set to a tie-break but any hopes of a revival were soon extinguished. In the break she served two double faults and in apparent slow motion, one even after a let of serve. It was like watching her match plans literally fall down around her, not to mention any sense of impregnability that she may have attempted to convey to her opponent. From there things only got worse.Broken at the first attempt in the second set, Gauff tried once again to plug herself into the mains but the outcome was even wilder. Yastremska broke again for 3-1 and then for 5-1 and a call from the stands of “Don’t worry Coco, don’t worry!” had a distinctly forlorn tone to it. For Yastremska, meanwhile, there was nothing but delight.The second day of competition atWimbledonsaw other high profile departures from the women’s draw too, including the world No 3 Jessica Pegula who was beaten in straight sets – 6-2, 6-3 – by Elisabetta Cocciaretto in just 58 minutes.Pegula praised her opponent: “She played absolutely incredible tennis,” she said, but she too was at a loss to explain her defeat. “Do I think I played the best match ever? No. But I definitely don’t think I was playing bad. I haven’t lost first round of a slam in a very long time, so that sucks.”Elsewhere, the two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova bade farewell to Wimbledon following a 6-3 6-1 loss to the 10th seed Emma Navarro. The 35-year-old wildcard, who returned to the tour in February following the birth of son Petr last summer, intends to retire after this year’s US Open. “I never dreamed of winning Wimbledon and I did it twice so this is something very special,” she told a grateful crowd.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Coco GauffWimbledonTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The case focused on Lia Thomas, the transgender swimmer who last competed for the Ivy League school in Philadelphia in 2022, when she became the first openly transgender athleteto win a Division I title.It’s part of the Trump administration’s broader attempt to remove transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports.Under the agreement, Penn agreed to restore all individual Division I swimming records and titles to female athletes who lost out to Thomas, the Education Department said. Penn also agreed to send a personalized apology letter to each of those swimmers.It wasn’t immediately clear whether Thomas would be stripped of her awards and honors at Penn.The university must also announce that it “will not allow males to compete in female athletic programs” and it must adopt “biology-based” definitions of male and female, the department said.Education secretary Linda McMahon called it a victory for women and girls.“The Department commends UPenn for rectifying its past harms against women and girls, and we will continue to fight relentlessly to restore Title IX’s proper application and enforce it to the fullest extent of the law,” McMahon said in a statement.The Education Department opened its investigation in February and concluded in April that Penn had violated Title IX, a 1972 law forbidding sex discrimination in education. Such findings have almost always been resolved through voluntary agreements. If Penn had fought the finding, the department could have moved to refer the case to the Justice Department or pursued a separate process to cut the school’s federal funding.In February, the Education Department asked the NCAA and the National Federation of State High School Associations, or NFSHSA, to restore titles, awards and records it says have been “misappropriated by biological males competing in female categories.”The most obvious target at the college level was in women’s swimming, where Thomas won the national title in the 500-yard freestyle in 2022.The NCAA has updated its record books when recruiting and other violations have stripped titles from certain schools, but the organization, like the NFSHSA, has not responded to the federal government’s request. Determining which events had a transgender athlete participating years later would be challenging.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsTransgenderCollege sportsSwimmingShareReuse this content"

The fighters have not agreed to a deal, but Paul and Ramírez stared each other down during the post-fight news conference.“I want tougher fighters. I want to be a world champion,” Paul said after outpointing Chávez, who had fought once in the previous four years. “Zurdo looked slow ... tonight. That’d be easy work, too.”While Paul’s ranking is a remarkable milestone for a social media behemoth and former Disney Channel star who only decided to become a boxer about six years ago, the WBA’s decision reflects Paul’s incredible financial potential more than his fighting résumé.Sanctioning body rankings are determined internally, so they can be changed on a whim, or to meet an opportunity to collect a big fee by sanctioning a fight – and Paul has uniquely become the most financially potent boxer to emerge in many years.Paul’s previous opponents include fellow YouTubers, an NBA player, several mixed martial artists and 58-year-old Mike Tyson – not a path that would lead to world rankings and title shots for any fighter without Paul’s fame and fortune.Hetook his only loss in 2023 against Tommy Fury– a relatively serious professional boxer, but nowhere near a title contender. Paul has called for a rematch, telling Fury to “stop running from me”.Chávez was by far the most accomplished actual boxer to share the ring with Paul, but the former WBC middleweight champion fought listlessly and tepidly for all but the final two rounds in front of a Southern California crowd desperately rooting on its Mexican hero.Paul reiterated Saturday night that he has been ordered by God to become a world champion, and he spoke of several accomplished veteran boxers as his potential next opponent.Ramírez (48-1, 30 KOs) would be Paul’s first step up to world-class opposition. Zurdo is a former super middleweight champion and current cruiserweight powerhouse who beat Yuniel Dorticos by decision in Anaheim.Nakisa Bidarian, Paul’s business partner, suggested Saturday night that Paul might be more likely to take a title shot against Badou Jack, the 41-year-old Swede who holds the WBC cruiserweight belt.“The biggest issue with that [Paul v Ramírez] fight is Zurdo didn’t show himself to be at all a promoter in this process,” Bidarian said. “Why aren’t we seeing more out of Zurdo? Why isn’t he more engaged with the fans? Someone like Badou Jack is someone that we want to have a conversation with.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It was a question of timing; he could have taken a deal with an even higher total value next summer.Based on the NBA’s most recent salary cap projections – the exact numbers will not be finalized until June 2027 – Gilgeous-Alexander would make somewhere around $63m in the first season and nearly $79m during the 2030-31 season. That would put him at an average payout of about $1m per regular season game, and would be the highest single-season salary in NBA history.Gilgeous-Alexander didn’t enter the league with superstar expectations. He was the 11th overall pick in the 2018 draft, and he was traded from the Los Angeles Clippers to the Thunder after his rookie year. He has been on an upward trajectory ever since, and Thunder general manager Sam Presti believes that will continue.“He’s gotten better every single year,” Presti said. “His mindset has allowed him to take these steps and also not – I don’t feel like his progress is, like, volatile. I don’t know if that makes sense, but I don’t feel like it’s built on things that can’t be repeated and built up again.”Presti referred to Gilgeous-Alexander as a “basketball artist” because he has the emotional intelligence to know when to call upon his various gifts.“I just think he’s got left and right brain working, and I think when you think about people that are extremely successful in what they do, they can’t operate all on one side or the other,” Presti said. “People have to have – to me, the great people in life, business, sports, any industry, have to be able to access both sides, a creative side and then also a very objective side.”The Thunder are set to be contenders for years. Their best player is in place long-term, all their major players are under contract through at least next season and Presti has a slew of draft picks stashed from previous trades.“We definitely still have room to grow,” Gilgeous-Alexander said after the Game 7 win over the Indiana Pacers. “That’s the fun part of this. So many of us can still get better. There’s not very many of us on the team that are ‘in our prime’ or even close to it.”Explore more on these topicsOklahoma City ThunderNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But while the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami chanted the Frenchman’s name, roaring as he made his way to the halfway line, and stood to hand him an ovation when he entered the fray, the excitement overflowing, it was the kid heading in the other direction for whom Rita Hayworth is family but most of them had not heard of a month ago, who had taken Real Madrid into the quarter-final.For all the focus on the most famous names, for all that this month, this experimental event, needs them, every tournament has its revelation: this World Cup has a 21-year-oldmadrileño. “I knew this competition was the opportunity of my life,” Gonzalo García said after he again showed that it is one he is determined, and equipped, to take hold of. TheReal Madridacademy striker, who had never started a game before arriving in the United States, scored his third goal here with a superb thumping header from a delicious Trent Alexander-Arnold delivery, doing what no one else could over 90 minutes here: beating the Juventus goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio.Football Daily | Al-Hilal and the trouble with underdog stories at the Club World CupRead moreA family of rugby players, bullfighters, and perhaps the most famous actor there ever was – García’s grandfather was Heyworth’s cousin – has a footballer too, and he looks like being some player. Good enough, says the Spain Under-17s coach, Hernán Pérez, to be Madrid’s striker for a decade to come. With the permission of Mbappé, of course. Xabi Alonso likes him, that’s for sure, even if he admitted that he never expected three goals from him, and García has been superb stateside. On a wet but mercifully lightning-free afternoon in Miami where a Madrid team that are progressing well kept hitting a wall, he was decisive once more, setting up a meeting with Borussia Dortmund – hi Jude, hi Jobe – or Monterrey – hi, Sergio Ramos – in the next round.In the end, Madrid deserved it, far the better side, Alonso praising his team’s ability to understand “when to speed up, when to slow down, how to control the game”. That said, it did take a while to gain control and the early moments of illumination came mostly from another kid, Juventus’s Kenan Yildiz, who combined often with Andrea Cambiaso and Randal Kolo Muani. The 20-year-old – left footed, small, socks half down, backside low – has been described by Kolo Muani as “magic” and there were moments he left his mark here.View image in fullscreenGonzalo García heads in Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross for the winner.Photograph: Marta Lavandier/APHe played a key part in what might have been the opener after six minutes, combining with Kolo Muani on a move that began way back by the Juventus penalty area and reached Madrid’s. There, alone before ThibautCourtois, Kolo Muani scooped over him but fractionally over the bar too. Next a neat turn saw Yildiz’s shot deflected wide, there was the time he slipped the ball between Alexander-Arnold’s legs, and smart footwork later took him away from the former Liverpool defender and Antonio Rüdiger for Cambiaso to cross. From another Cambiaso delivery, Francisco Conceição headed Juve’s second chance at Courtois.Madrid, playing with three central defenders, had control if not a huge amount of incision in those early phases. As the half went on though, openings appeared and increasingly often. In the middle of it all, Fede Valverde, as ever, was everywhere firing off shots. By the time he was withdrawn, exhausted, to applause in the 89th minute, the Uruguayan had racked up seven. “He makes life easier,” Alonso said.From one of them in the first half, Di Gregorio dived full length to save and the keeper would have a busy afternoon, sticking out a leg when Valverde got deep into the area and pulled back soon after. Next Arda Guler, growing into this in the playmaker role that looks increasingly like becoming his permanent place, lifted over his marker and almost got the ball across. Just before the break, Alexander-Arnold did, but his delivery raced right though the six-yard box.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And although Antonio Rüdiger and Courtois kicked each other as they swiped at a clearance, Alonso’s side got on top, soon dominating entirely. Trent fired over, Manuel Locatelli blocked Vinícius Júnior, and Bellingham and Dean Huijsen drew saves from Di Gregorio. Then the goal came, Alexander-Arnold’s lovely soft-shoed cross meeting García’s leap. Turning his neck, he thudded past Di Gregorio who could not fling up his arms fast enough.Madrid kept coming but the Italian pushed away Valverde’s overhead kick and stuck out a leg to stop Guler’s shot after Vinícius and Mbappé had opened up Juventus. When he reached Aurélien Tchouaméni’s late low drive, it took him into double figures but there was no reward. The one time he was beaten was enough, Madrid’s revelation there again.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Real MadridJuventusClub World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now the country will host one of the biggest events in the sporting calendarJonathan LiewTue 1 Jul 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 19.50 EDTShareIn 1957 the Swiss newspaper Sport published a short editorial under the headline “Women’s Football?” Furious that a women’s friendly between Germany and the Netherlands was being hosted in Basel, the writer mocked: “This event is not about football, but rather should be classified as an exhibition or circus performance.”On Wednesday evening, in front of a sell-out crowd, Switzerland will play their opening game of a home European Championship that will be one of the biggest sporting events held in the country. Sport newspaper, sadly, will be unable to chronicle the event, having folded in 1999. Life moves on you pretty fast.Women’s Euro 2025: Guardian writers’ predictions for the tournamentRead moreThe narrative arc of women’s football in Switzerland is one that will be familiar to the game’s pioneers across the continent: an agonising and incremental journey from apathy to hostility to mockery to inertia to change. Women were not allowed to play organised 11-a-side football until the late 1960s. Women’s leagues were not fully integrated into the Swiss football association until 1993. This, by the way, was three years after the north-eastern canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden became the last Swiss province to give women the vote.And so of course the opening nightof Switzerland’s summer partyis a moment to sense the sheer scale of progress, to salute the countless women who toiled in anonymity to make it possible, to admire the view from what the official Uefa branding so wittily describes as the “Summit of Emotions”. Switzerland has never been one of Europe’s major women’s football nations. And yet, without the benefit of a Wembley or Old Trafford, a land of 9 million people has ensured that ticket sales will surpass those of Euro 2022 before a ball has even been kicked.For a country where even the tournament organiser, Doris Keller, admits that “women’s football is not very developed”, where grassroots teams still fight for space amid the small pockets of usable terrain, where the term “men’s football” still draws raised eyebrows in a way it no longer does in Britain, this is an achievement in itself, whatever Pia Sundhage’s team achieve on the pitch. But of course England and the Netherlands cantestify to the transformative effectof a strong home performance, the sheer rarity of these moments when a successful side can refresh the parts of society that would normally be out of reach to them.View image in fullscreenLia Wälti is one of Switzerland’s standout players but the hosts enter the tournament as one of the biggest unknowns.Photograph: Philipp Kresnik/SPP/ShutterstockFor all their exciting individual talent, embodied in Lia Wälti, Géraldine Reuteler and the exciting teenage playmaker Sydney Schertenleib, the Swiss go into the tournament as perhaps one of its biggest unknowns. Can they take advantage of a kind draw and surf the patriotic wave to the knockouts? Or will a leaky defence, an injury-hit squad and Sundhage’s awkward tactics implode in embarrassing fashion?In one sense Group A – by far the weakest of the four – holds the key to the tournament, giving teams such as Belgium and Italy in Group B a viable path to the semi-finals if they can get in the slipstream of Spain. The world champions are still favourites, even if they disappointed at last summer’s Olympics and are fretting on the health of Aitana Bonmatí. But if 2023 proved anything, it is that this group of players can play through even the fiercest adversity, a self-driving car that knows how to right itself in the toughest moments.And this is perhaps the one aspect in which Spain remain well clear of the pack. Unlike most of their rivals, Montse Tomé’s side have a clear playing identity, an established coaching tradition, basic principles that reach all the way down to grassroots level and the fiercely competitive regional junior tournaments that have provided a regular pipeline of talent to the academies. More than any other team in world football, Spain have an idea of how Spain should play.By contrast, what is the identity of Sarina Wiegman’s England, beyond a kind of hard-running swagger? Or Christian Wück’s Germany, a team still awkwardly transitioning from old to new? Laurent Bonadei has tried to curb France’s traditional reliance on gifted individuals by dropping several big names for the tournament. Many of the medium-sized nations remain disproportionately reliant on gifted individuals.View image in fullscreenSpain remain well clear of the pack and will not be short of support in Switzerland.Photograph: Gabriel Monnet/APWhich is no criticism of any of these teams: by and large this is still an emerging sport, still near the start of its creative cycle, sparsely staffed and unevenly resourced. But it is fair to say that the explosion of playing talent has – for understandable reasons – not been met by a commensurate rise in the quality of coaching or ideas. As such a good proportion of success at this tournament will be defined by fitness and physicality, bolts of individual quality, rapid shifts in momentum, the teams best equipped at harnessing the vibes.In this sense, the increasingly uncomfortable wealth gaps at European club level may work as a kind of leveller for the international game. Barcelona’s dominance of Liga F is great for the Spanish national side, but great too for players such as Poland’s Ewa Pajor and Portugal’s Kika Nazareth who have been able to develop their game at the very cutting edge of the sport. Wales would not be at this tournament without England’s WSL. Pretty much every team at this tournament have a gamechanging player who can steal the show in an instant. This is the depth Emma Hayes was referring toin her Guardian columnwhen she predicted the highest-quality Euros we have seen.The flip side is that there are fewer mysteries than ever. It was only two tournaments ago when a largely unknown Austria side shocked the world by coming within a penalty shootout of the final. These days virtually every player is a known quantity, their data points logged and loaded, their strengths and weaknesses neatly packaged for video. And here perhaps is one aspect in which European women’s football has stolen a decisive march on the rest of the world, recalibrating the gravity of a sport that once revolved around the US and its enviable talent system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the 2019 World Cup, 13 of Australia’s squad played in America; by 2023 that was down to two. A third of Hayes’s US squad for the SheBelieves Cup this year was drawn from abroad.View image in fullscreenNorway train before facing Switzerland on the first night of the tournament.Photograph: Georgios Kefalas/APAnd when the NWSL became the first American major sporting league to abolish the player draft this year, it was a recognition of the increasingly fraught competition from European clubs for the best talent. Crystal Dunn (to Paris Saint-Germain) andNaomi Girma (to Chelsea)made the jump this year. Trinity Rodman says it will be “a matter of when” she plays abroad, and we can assume she is not envisioning a stint in the Liga MX Femenil.All of which is predicated on the presumption of permanent, inexorable growth. But there are no guarantees here. No growth is truly permanent. And as well as being a moment to savour the pace of progress, Euro 2025 comes at a critical juncture for the women’s game, an opportunity to forestall the inevitable tapering off.YouGov research published this week indicates that across major European nations, fewer people are intending to watch this tournament than the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand two years ago, despite the friendlier time zone. More than 80% of adults across the continent describe themselves as “not interested” in women’s football. In England,television audiences for the WSL fell 35%last season with no international tournament upon which to piggyback. All of which underlines the precarity of football’s brave new frontier. At what point does this thing hit its ceiling?Perhaps the major conclusion to draw from the WSL television figures is the continuing importance of international football in terms of driving interest. Arsenal’s players wererichly feted for beating Barcelonain May’s Champions League final, but for players such as Leah Williamson and Alessia Russo retaining the Euros would bring a different level of acclaim entirely. A first triumph since 2013 would transform the German game in a way no amount of Frauen Bundesliga marketing could ever manage.Over to the players, then. And of course every woman who ever kicked a ball in anger has always been aware on some level that they are playing for something larger: those who came before and those who will come after, those newly converted and those yet to be convinced, the imperative in a crowded marketplace to create not only competent sport but compelling product. Perhaps, as we reflect again on our wretched Swiss correspondent from seven decades ago, this event is part exhibition and part circus. But – and here’s the rub – it is also definitely about football.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The left-back is a target for Graham Potter and discussions have taken place over a deal.Slavia are reluctant to lose the Senegal international, who is comfortable as a wing-back, and want about £20m. West Ham have repeatedly made clear they are under pressure to sell before they buy. Incomings without significant sales would leave them at risk of breaching the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.Potter wants a left-sided defender, with Emerson Palmieri likely to leave.

The full-time whistle brought those scenes we know well from therealWorld Cup. Players on their knees: the victors turning to the heavens, the losers sucked into the dirt. Simone Inzaghi looked a particularly happy chap just weeks on from his nadir, that Bigger Cup embarrassment with Inter against PSG. Manchester City, the European heavyweights, had just been defeated by his brave underdogs, Al-Hilal. Yes, those same longshots who two years ago tried tobuy Kylian Mbappé from PSG for £259m, shortly after coming under the ownership of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.The PIF – which appears intent on clawing its mitts over sport – is the investment arm ofa journalist-killing stateand chaired by the big man himself, Mohammed bin Salman. The fund is also an official partner of Copa Gianni while a PIF subsidiary bought a $1bn stake in Dazn, the tournament broadcaster, earlier this year. They didn’t get Mbappé but they still nabbed Neymar. Al-Hilal may have delivered a sporting upset – “We knew we had to climb Mount Everest without oxygen and we were great,” proclaimed Inzaghi – but this isn’t a plucky underdog story. And no, that doesn’t make City a group of saints.It’s finally summer time for Pep Guardiola, though a nagging feeling will follow, the question left to be answered on how these few weeks in the USA USA USA will impact his side next season/this season (the lines feel blurred with this tournament). Prior to the Al-Hilal match he had wondered out loud if his club will be“destroyed” by the Copa Gianniwhen their regular commitments resume. An extra couple of weeks on the beach – the final is still another 12 days away – could end up being a decent consolation.Plenty of powerhouses remain, though they remain stuck on one side of the draw; PSG have Bayern in the quarters, with the winner potentially facing Real Madrid in the semi-finals. Chelsea supporters should perhaps allow themselves to believe; they must beat Palmeiras if they want to set up a possible semi-final clash withAl-Hilal. The gaudy wastefulness of a project that has turned Brighton into a de-facto academy against the pillar of a behemoth propaganda machine.

He just won’t play him.”The prediction was spot-on, with Chilwell quickly discounted from selection. It was nothing personal, though. The logic was merely that Maresca does not play with a conventional back four in possession but wants one full-back inverting and the other shifting inside to play as an extra centre-back in a 3-2-4-1 system.‘It’s not football’: Maresca furious after Chelsea’s two-hour weather delayRead moreIt is far from foolproof, as anyone who saw Malo Gusto’s disastrous first-half turn as an auxiliary midfielder in theConference League finalagainst Real Betis will confirm. Yet Maresca has his way of playing and is comfortable without overlapping full-backs. He has often had speedy wingers playing high, tasked with going one-on-one against a defender. Marc Cucurella has been the inverter from left-back. Instead of being a rampaging force from right-back, Reece James has often drifted infield.The effect is numerical superiority in the middle. The drawback is that wide players become isolated in Maresca’s team. Chelsea often struggled against low blocks during the second half of last season, particularly if it was a back five, and there was a lot of discussion about whether Mareca’s football was overly rigid.Qualification for the Champions League became a grind. Chelsea finished fourth and won the Conference League but there was an issue to address. How to be less predictable? Ponder that for a moment and the decision to derail Newcastle’s movefor Brighton forward João Pedrobecomes easier to understand.There will inevitably be accusations of stockpiling. The attack was already well stocked beforeLiam Delap joined from Ipswichand a deal for theBorussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens was agreed. There’s alsoEstêvão Willian, who joins from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup, and suggestions that Chelsea could sign another forward. They continue to monitor the Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and like West Ham’s Mohammed Kudus because of the Tottenham target’s ability to play in three positions.View image in fullscreenChelsea have agreed a deal for Jamie Gittens, who played for Dortmund at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Jess Stiles/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockDelap and Gittens were far obvious moves than João Pedro, though. Delap was needed to provide healthy competition for Nicolas Jackson up front and Gittens fills a hole given that Chelsea need at least one right-footed left-winger. The left-footed Pedro Neto and Noni Madueke are uncomfortable fits on the left. They prefer cutting inside from the right. Estêvão is another left-footer who cuts inside.Chelsea know something has to give. Geovany Quenda, another gifted young winger,joins from Sporting next summer. No wonder Chelsea will listen to offers for Madueke. A mission to trim the squad is under way; the arrival of João Pedro in a deal worth more than £50m is expected to result in Christopher Nkunku leaving.Nkunku scored the winner whenChelsea beat Benficain the last 16 of the Club World Cup but he is not quite right for Maresca. João Pedro is regarded as a better profile than the France forward and João Félix, who is also out of favour. Perhaps he will complement Cole Palmer, lifting the creative burden on Chelsea’s main man. Palmer needs opportunities to rest. It is going to be another gruelling campaign and Chelsea are mindful about the Champions League increasing the demands on their squad.Maresca will have to rotate more in the league and he will benefit from having different modes of attack. There is no point having an array of speedy wingers if they are effective only in transition. Chelsea need different angles in attack. They are probably not going to get much intricate link play from Delap, who is more of an old-school No 9. Jackson is better at dropping off, turning and playing reverse balls – as he did forNeto’s goal against Los Angeles FC– but is more chaotic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionJoão Pedro offers a different profile. He presses well, drops deep and could play with Palmer as a second striker. The Brazilian was adept at receiving possession and releasing Brighton’s wingers with clever angled passes. He could do the same for Gittens and Neto. Chelsea will hope they are signing a player who can draw negative opponents out, move defences around and create space for others. It is not the obvious move, but it feels like a canny one.View image in fullscreenJoão Pedro is not a prolific forward but is seen as a better fit to the profile that Enzo Maresca wants.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersIt is about options and collaboration. Neto has three goals in three appearances at theClub World Cupand is loved at Chelsea for his work rate. João Pedro’s output at Brighton was nothing spectacular – 30 goals and 10 assists in 70 appearances – but Maresca wants his attack to share the load and become more versatile.It helps to explain why Maresca has experimented in the US, hitting on a 3-2-4-1 in possession against Benfica, with Palmer’s role as an inside-left leaving space for Cucurella to maraud. Predicting Chelsea’s starting XI will become almost impossible. The system will be complex, leaving no space for someone of Chilwell’s profile. Sometimes it could be heavy on wingers, at other times there could be two No 10s. For a shape-shifter such as Maresca, it seems variety is the spice of life.Explore more on these topicsChelseaClub World Cup 2025Transfer windowFootball tacticsUS sportsClub World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A club famous for doing things differently have appointed Robbie Savage on a four-year contract, enthused by his sole, record-breaking season in the dugout at Macclesfield FC – the 50-year-old led the team to the Northern Premier League title after transitioning from the role of director of football – rather than fretting whether he is qualified for the job.“I know there will be a bit of scepticism because I’ve only had one year in management,” says Savage. “I know I will have to win fans over. But I’m not scared of that. I got released from the biggest football club in the world [Manchester United] at 19, told I wasn’t good enough. But I’ve always proved people wrong because I’ve got a great work ethic. I spoke to Brendan Rodgers, Martin O’Neill and Sean Dyche and they all said: ‘What an opportunity.’ Everybody wants to help me so that goes to show I must be OK because they’re willing to help.”Troy Deeney sacked after only 29 days as Forest Green managerRead moreIn many ways, Savage’s road to the Cotswolds began in earnest when his eldest son, Charlie, joined Forest Green on loan in January 2023, under Duncan Ferguson. Savage Sr sat alongside the Forest Green owner, Dale Vince, at matches and he remembers Charlie starring in the team that beat Sheffield Wednesday in League One a little more than two years ago and scoring a first career goal a couple of weeks earlier against Bristol Rovers. Forest Green also recently appointed Mark Bowen, Savage’s former Wales teammate, as director of football.Savage is the latest high-profile appointment, after Ferguson, who lasted six months, and Troy Deeney, who lasted 29 days. Savage succeeds Steve Cotterill, who reached the milestone of 1,000 games en route to the National League playoffs last season. “Robbie is not a high-profile manager, he is a high-profile person,” Vince says. “The media keep saying to me: ‘He has only managed at Macclesfield, does that worry you?’ It is a valid question but, no, it doesn’t.”Savage’s departure from Macclesfield was not an ordinary exit given he had a 10.9% stake in the club reborn four years ago after the collapse of Macclesfield Town. He previously spoke of building the club “from the first brick” with his best friend, Robert Smethurst, the co-owner. Savage concedes confirmation of his being removed as a director on Companies House last weekend hit home and he plans to sell his remaining shares in Macclesfield shares .View image in fullscreenRobbie Savage on the touchline at Macclesfield last season.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHe believes his experiences of being a part-owner at Moss Rose will help him as a full-time manager. “I’m not scared of taking risks. As an owner sometimes you can feel isolated if results go against managers; I’ve seen it and witnessed it. But we’re all in this as one. Whatever happens, I’m a football person. If results don’t go our way, I understand football. I can take it. I’ve sacked a manager when we’ve been top of the league [Danny Whitaker at Macclesfield]. So I get it. No problem. But one thing I couldn’t do with this opportunity with good people was not have a go.”Savage plans to immerse himself in the Cotswolds town. “I want to embrace the culture,” he says. “I’ll be moving here, I’ll be looking for a place. I’ve signed a four-year contract, I want to be here for four years. I want to take this club back to the EFL. It was the first village club to get into the EFL. When you walk into the training ground, you see the ambition and you want to be a part of that. Hopefully we can grow the fanbase as well … At Macclesfield in the league [when we started] we had an average attendance of 1,250 and when I left it was 3,150.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vince, who is working to turn discarded fishing nets and lobster pots from waters in Scotland into goal nets at Forest Green facilities, says of the stadium: “If we’re lucky, we’re a year away from starting work on it. It’s coming, we’ve got consent. There’s a road issue we’ve got to resolve. The stadium is part of the plan to get ourselves into the Championship.”Savage, Forest Green’s sixth permanent manager in two years, jokes he will be in the running to replace Pep Guardiola at Manchester City if he achieves the feat within his contract. Vince believes Savage’s positivity will permeate. “This was not part of why we recruited him but I saw him as a pundit whenMan United were playing Lyon[in the Europa League quarter‑finals],” Vince says. “There were only a few minutes left and all the other pundits on the panel were saying: ‘They’ve blown it.’ Not Robbie. He was like: ‘They just need two goals. They just need to get the ball to [Harry] Maguire.’ And they won. Imagine having that on your touchline.”Now it is a reality. “I’m not here because I know Dale, I’m not here because I know Mark Bowen,” says Savage, whose first game is a friendly against Slimbridge AFC on Friday. “I’m here because they believe in me and I believe in the project.”Explore more on these topicsForest Green RoversVanarama National LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rive Jazzy is in its fourth decade and there should be something for everyone. The Greasers will be on stage to set a tone before England face Wales on 13 July; this Friday anyone with a penchant for swing can turn up at Place du Molard to enjoy harmonies by the Hot Shooters.The more pressing hope is that there will be plenty of those on Switzerland’s football pitches across the next 25 days. At its elite level, the women’s game has never before been blessed with the depth of quality it can showcase this month. There is justified optimism that no weak link will stick out like a sore thumb among the 16 contenders in this European Championship; at the top end a valid expectation exists that, whileSpainare obvious favourites, at least three or four others are highly equipped to test that status vigorously.Women’s Euro 2025: your guide to all 368 playersRead moreIt will play out on a sweltering, but reassuringly stable, stage, whose surface-level figures promise steady evolution from the exuberance of Euro 2022. The fans have bought in: atmospheres will be lively and, crucially, inclusive. Ticket sales have topped 600,000, comfortably a record, and 22 of the 31 games are already sold out. While immersion in adelirious 87,000 Wembleycrowd at the final three years ago sparked some regrets that Switzerland cannot offer a similar theatre, one of the organisers’ priorities was to avoid the oscillations seen back then.This time there will be no attendance higher than the 35,689 able to fill St Jakob-Park, the Basel venue whose assignments include the final and Switzerland’s opening game against Norway on Wednesday, but nor should there be any analogue of the 3,859 who watched Belgium draw with Iceland at Manchester City’s Academy Stadium. It is unlikely any grounds will be less than one third full, as St Mary’s was when Northern Ireland faced Austria and Norway. The idea goes that this will be an event less given to sweeping statements, instead oozing sustainability and speaking confidently on its own terms of the standards on display.View image in fullscreenSwitzerland head coach Pia Sundhage brings a wealth of experience.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/APIf there are fewer extremes felt in the stands, those seeking different barometers of progress will expect similar from the matches. Thrashings help nobody. Uefa insiders are particularly keen to see evidence of the tighter competitive balance they believe has been facilitated by increased investment and a successful Nations League, so there is particular interest in how the newcomersWalesandPolandfare among what is otherwise a familiar lineup.Should they, as a minimum, keep scorelines respectable in fiendish groups, it will be tempting to wonder how those who fell just short might have fared. Can women’s football make a convincing claim to follow the men in expanding to a 24-team tournament? The surfeit of regular qualifiers is a valid criticism but Uefa requires confidence that others are ready to step up. Its “Unstoppable” strategy, which has catalysed investment across the continent, launched last year and now federations must do their bit. As one seasoned figure in the sport puts it: if Portugal can replicate their over-productivity in the men’s game with a competitive women’s programme, then what is stopping Croatia?These may be macro questions when the action is so close, but the sense of an inflection point is inescapable. Lise Klaveness, the Norwegian football federation’s president, put it well last month when emphasising the need “not to let the head move away from the body”. In other words, a top stratum that now regularly produces scintillating spectacles must not leave everyone else for dead. A €41m (£35.2m) prize pot, far removed from the €16m on offer in 2022, speaks well of the authorities’ intentions and is testament to those voices who have lobbied hard for greater spoils; so does a doubling of the pot available to compensate clubs for releasing their players. The difficulty may lie in ensuring that money does not widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.It is a valid concern, especially in an era when external parties are happy to test the game’s fabric by ploughing millions into events such as the World Sevens tournament that debuted in May. Euro 2025 is essentially a loss leader for Uefa, which projects a net €20m-25m deficit. That cannot hold for ever and some figures question whether maximum value is being extracted from a sport whose investment potential appears nowhere near exhausted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The winners of the Saudi King’s Cup will receive just over £1m. Prize money for theSaudi Pro Leagueis not disclosed, but by the most recent available figures (for 2022-23) is in roughly the same area. Weekly attendances at the King Saud University Stadium, where top-tier ticket prices start at about £12, range between 10,000 and 25,000, although of course you also have to factor in pie and programme sales above that.And so you really have to applaud Al-Nassr’s ambition in handing an estimated £492m to Cristiano Ronaldoover the next two years. Even if they sweep the board at domestic level, if they fight their way past Istiklol of Tajikistan’s 1xBet Higher League and Al-Wehdat of the Jordanian Pro League, if they extract maximum value from merch and sponsorships, you still struggle to see how they can cover a basic salary that comes to £488,000 a day, even before the bonuses and blandishments that will push the total package well beyond that.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo celebrates scoring for Al-Nassr against Al-Wehda in May.Photograph: ReutersAccording to reports, the deal also involves Ronaldo taking a 15% ownership stake inAl-Nassr, extra incentives for winning the Pro League or the Golden Boot, a private jet allowance, 16 full-time staff including two chefs and three gardeners, and a bonus for every time he successfully presses an opposition player. Last one was a joke, obvs. And amid the stultifying assault of numbers, Ronaldo’s new contract – announced to great fanfare last week – marks a significant shift in the evolution of the superstar athlete, a further blurring of the lines between what we used to call “sport” and what we used to call “the other stuff”.The first question to put: what exactly is Saudi Arabia getting for its money? Because of course Al-Nassr are a majority fund-owned club, an arm of the Saudi state, which is funnelling untold riches into its domestic league free from the encumbrance of cost controls or financial fair play rules. Ronaldo himself is in effect a Saudi employee, albeit one who has enjoyed much better fortune then most migrant workers who have entered the country in recent years.'I belong to Saudi Arabia,' Ronaldo stated proudly on announcing his new contract last weekOn the pitch, Ronaldo’s influence has been highly visible: 99 goals in 111 games under four coaches. Give him a half chance in a tight space and even at the age of 40, there are still few players you would back over him. At the same time Al-Nassr have won no major trophies since his arrival and the club’s two other big attacking talents, Jhon Durán and Sadio Mané, have found themselves overshadowed to such an extent that both may leave this summer. Let’s charitably describe this one as: jury out.In recent months there was talk of Ronaldo getting a short-term deal to play in the Club World Cup, a competition that would seem perfect for him: based entirely around celebrity power, influencer fame and a distinct lack of running. Politically and commercially, there was literally no reason for this not to happen. And so we can conclude that whilemany clubs were interestedin his star wattage, none were prepared to pay the going rate to remould their entire system around a 40-year-old striker who lost his last half-yard of pace in about 2017.But of course these days what Ronaldo can do on a football pitch is but a fraction of his total appeal. In an age when power itself is being reimagined along the lines of social media clout, when the attention economy and the actual economy are rapidly converging into one and the same thing, the fact Ronaldo is the most followed person on Instagram – and the third-most followed on X behind Elon Musk and Barack Obama – matters. In a way Ronaldo’s fame renders him a kind of one-man city state, an influencer first and an athlete second, his goals and assists entirely tangential to the eyeballs he can garner in the process.What we have, in essence, is the professional athlete reimagined as a kind of plutocratic demigod, able to construct entire new realities around themselves. One in which the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia will be “the most beautiful ever”, or where the Saudi Pro League is “one of the top five leagues in the world”, as he recently put it. “It’s highly competitive, and those who don’t know that simply haven’t played here.” Fundamentally, this is not true on any measure:Opta ranks the Saudi Pro Leagueas the world’s 29th best. And of course by his own criteria, Ronaldo would have had to play in all the others in order to make a reasoned assessment. But when you have 659 million Instagram followers, perhaps whatever you say becomes true simply by saying it.Which is not to say the football is an irrelevance. Football is clearly still inherent to Ronaldo’s self-image, albeit these days more as an adjunct to his power than as the source of it. Ronaldo still plays football in the same way that Donald Trump plays golf: as part of a broader cult of personality, something to get photographed doing, content for the feed. A branding exercise stripped entirely of context or objective judgment, complete with massaged numbers and a coterie of obedient applauding acolytes. As is the continuing fixation on his physique, the positioning of Ronaldo as a kind ofÜbermensch, a transcendent individual, a higher form of biology, albeit one that still possesses an unerring ability to put free-kicks straight into the wall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What they’re buying is Ronaldo the spiritual leader, the attention machine, the aura, the abdominals, the soft-power influence. They’re buying a place on his grid, the opportunity to allow one of the world’s most famous men to do their bidding. Perhaps it helps to think of his new contract as a kind of trade deal, a strategic alliance between two cynical regimes drunk on their own power and with largely congruent social views.View image in fullscreenA billboard welcomes Cristiano Ronaldo to Saudi Arabia after he joined Al-Nassr at the end of December 2022.Photograph: Amr Nabil/AP“I belong to Saudi Arabia,” Ronaldo stated proudly on announcing his new contract last week. And of course many star athletes in many sports have succumbed to the lure of the Saudi riyal, and will continue to do so. But there is a tonal difference between taking the money of a rogue state and actively advocating for them on the broadest possible stage. For years we have spoken of Saudi investment as a kind of moral dilemma, a fine balance of pecuniary motives, reputational concerns and human rights. For Ronaldo, it is clear that no such dilemma exists.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Seven Australians had lost in Monday’s calamitous start, with only an injured Jordan Thompson battling through, but there’ll now be five in the last-64 draw.Alexei Popyrin crashes out of Wimbledon after losing to world No 461Read moreSixteenth seed Kasatkina became the first and only one of the seven Australian women to progress with her 7-5, 6-3 victory over Colombian Emiliana Arango.Beaten in three matches on grass this season, she laboured against the world No 76, revealing she had been so nervous in her firstWimbledonappearance since switching allegiance to Australia that she vomited outside just before entering Court 14.“A lot of people saw it five metres from the court. I vomit, so just before entering the court, yes, the little accident happened, like, completely out of nerves,” Kasatkina explained.She dished up 11 double faults and 38 unforced errors against Arango, but the South American contributed to her own defeat, making 39 errors of her own.De Minaur was far more authoritative in his first grand slam outing since taking a break after hiscalamitous second-round exitat the French Open, beating Spain’s Roberto Carballés Baena 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2) in two hours 25 minutes.View image in fullscreenAlex de Minaur in action during his first round win against Spain’s Roberto Carballes Baena.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersEven a delay while an unwell ball boy was replaced, just before he was to serve to stay in the third set at 5-6, didn’t faze the 11th seed. De Minaur’s form was sharp enough, given his lack of match practice on grass.“It felt like a very solid match against a tough competitor, and there was a little bit of everything. There was some really good tennis, some tough moments, which I played through,” said De Minaur, thrilled to have his family watching from courtside.“At the end I had to lift my level when I needed it and played some clutch tennis to finish it off. So overall, quite happy.”The chances of an all-Sydney second-round meeting were extinguished, though, after Adam Walton, having battled back from two sets down, lost 6-3, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 6-7 (5-7) 6-1 to Frenchman Arthur Cazaux, who will face De Minaur for the first time.Vukic beat Chinese Taipei’s Chun-Hsin Tseng 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5) in just over three hours, setting up a daunting meeting with world No 1 Jannik Sinner, who defeated Italian compatriot Luca Nardi 6-4, 6-3, 6-0.It will be the second year running Vukic has drawn a big gun in the last 64 after impressing while losing to champion Carlos Alcaraz in 2024.“I’ve really nothing to lose,” Vukic said. “He’ll be the one feeling the pressure. If there’s a surface to play him on it’s probably this one because it is a bit more random, so more upsets can happen. Hopefully, I can be one of those.”Sinner agreed that “he has has nothing to lose, things won’t be easy for me”, while adding: “Australian tennis is in a good spot, they have some good players.”Hijikata was delighted with his crushing 6-3, 6-1, 6-1 win over 34-year-old Belgian veteran David Goffin.“It’s pretty rare to have a match like that where it’s all smooth sailing, and maybe a little unexpected, considering I feel I haven’t been practising that well,” said the first-time Wimbledon match-winner.Next he’ll face Ben Shelton, the American 10th seed who proved a younger, superior mirror image of Alex Bolt, defeating the Murray Bridge qualifier 6-4, 7-6 (7-1), 7-6 (7-4).Beyond Kasatkina’s win, it was a chastening day for the Australian women’s challenge, with the biggest disappointment being 19-year-old new Eastbourne champion Maya Joint’s fairly routine 6-3, 6-2 defeat to a teak-tough first-round opponent, Russian 19th seed Liudmila Samsonova.It was deja vu for Joint, who had won the Morocco Open in Rabat the weekend before losing in the first round at Roland Garros.“It’s something I hope to get used to, but it was a lot different from the last time when I was coming from Morocco,” the teenager said. “I obviously expected to do a bit better, but Liudmila played really well.”Priscilla Hon went down 6-2, 7-5 to Russian 18th seed Ekaterina Alexandrova, while fellow debutant, Sydney’s James McCabe, was well beaten 6-1, 6-4, 6-3 by Hungary’s world No 58 Fabian Marozsan, after he’d arrived later than he had hoped for his match after his car got stuck in a traffic jam.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025TennisAustralia sportAlex de MinaurWimbledonnewsShareReuse this content"

And it has been bloodier than any grand slam in history. On the men’s side, four of the top 10 have been knocked out in the first round. Another four have also fallenin the women’s singles. That makes eight top-10 players in total, a record in the Open era.And yetNovak Djokovicsurvives despite looking desperately wobbly against Alexandre Müller. Despite needing a doctor’s attention for a stomach bug. Despite squandering 20 out of 27 break points and six set points in the second set.Coco Gauff knocked out of Wimbledon in first round by nerveless Dayana YastremskaRead moreOf course he survived. The four horsemen of the apocalypse could ride throughWimbledonand he would still emerge from their dust, ready to fight on. And while it took over three hours, as well as plenty of unexpected detours, Djokovic was certainly delighted to come through 6-1, 6-7 (7), 6-2, 6-3 and to be given a hero’s ovation afterwards on Centre Court.“To be quite frank, I went from feeling my absolute best for a set and a half to my absolute worst for about 45 minutes,” he said. “Whether it was a stomach bug, I don’t know what it is. The energy kicked back after some doctor’s miracle pills, and I managed to finish the match on a good note.”There was no sign of the drama that was to follow in the first 30 minutes. Müller, the world No 41, had to save three break points in the opening game and, having done so, then promptly lost the next six games.It was vintage Djokovic. And while Müller steadied the ship in the second set, at 4-5 the Frenchman’s serve suddenly went awol and he found himself three set points down at 0-40.But then came the first surprising plot twist. Instead of pouncing, Djokovic blew all three chances – and then a fourth later in the game – as the second set drifted to a tie-break.Incredibly, Djokovic then blew two more set points before Müller seized the day and levelled it up at one-set all. Suddenly the Serb looked weary and wobbly on his feet, while Müller was rattling in winners from both sides.For a brief moment there seemed to be a real possibility that the greatest player in the game could be joining the other top-10 seeds on the men’s side – Alexander Zverev, Lorenzo Musetti, Holger Rune and Daniil Medvedev – in going out.Yet Djokovic dug in, fought back, and was suddenly flying again. “I knew that something was off with the stomach so hopefully when that calms down the energy will come back,” he said. “And that’s what happened.”View image in fullscreenThe tall Arthur Rinderknech beat Alexander Zverev in five sets over two days.Photograph: PSNEWZ/Sipa/ShutterstockNext up is Britain’s Dan Evans, whose best days are surely behind him at 35 – although he is one of the few players to hold a winning record against Djokovic, having beaten him in Monte Carlo four years ago.But having come through a mini-crisis, Djokovic can see sunnier days ahead. “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think I had a chance,” he insisted. “Come on! I think I always have a chance. I feel I have earned the right to think I can go all the way to the title.”Earlier there was a major shock as Müller’s compatriot Arthur Rinderknech knocked out Zverev 7-6 (3), 6-7 (8), 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-4 in a sprawling match that started on Monday night and lasted close to five hours. The 29-year-old has long been the journeyman’s journeyman and has never got beyond the third round of any grand slam. But against Zverev he was inspired, hitting 79 winners including the cross-court backhand that brought victory. “It’s definitely the biggest win of my career,” said Rinderknech, ranked 72 in the world.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Novak DjokovicWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

She will be assessed over the next 48 hours to determine the extent of the injury.At Bristol it was a case of deja vu as England once again inserted India, conceded far too many runs for comfort, and failed to get within touching distance of their target after a tumble of early wickets.England v India: second women’s T20 cricket international – liveRead moreTammy Beaumont’s first T20i half-century since September 2021 brought a glimmer of hope to the chase, but she was run out by the bowler Radha Yadav in the 12th over and England were left with too much to do at the death, despite a late flurry of boundaries from Sophie Ecclestone who was run out for 35 off the final ball of the innings.Beaumont described her contribution as “bittersweet”. “I’m doing a new role, with Heather [Knight] out injured,” she said. “I’m loving having to think differently about batting in T20 cricket again. But for me it’s never as satisfying when we’re on the losing side.”Up top, Danni Wyatt-Hodge avoided the ignominy of a fourth successive duck thanks to a tickle off an inside-edge, but then plonked her next ball into the hands of mid-off, doing nothing to dispel the question marks hanging over her current place at the top of the order.The India captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, returning to the fray after missing the first T20 with a head injury, then held on to a fantastic catch running round from mid-on to see off Sciver-Brunt, leaving England three down in the first four overs.Earlier, the absence of Sciver-Brunt from the field meant the stand-in skipper, Sophia Dunkley, was tasked with the official responsibility of rotating the English bowlers and somehow stemming the Indian flow – although in practice, it appeared to be mostly Ecclestone who took charge.Despite the loss of three Indian wickets in the powerplay – including Saturday’s centurion Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet herself – India rampaged their way to 181 for four.View image in fullscreenIndia’s Jemimah Rodrigues on her way to a fine half century in Bristol.Photograph: Nigel French/PAThe huge acceleration between overs eight and 20 came courtesy of half-centuries from Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur. For the 25-year-old Amanjot, who scythed the English spinners with ease, this was a proud moment: her first 50 for her country.“It is the first of many,” Amanjot said. “I want to do it more for India.

But Richa Ghosh then flailed her way to 32 from 20 balls, helped by a let-off on 12 by Beaumont, who somehow stumbled at square leg and let the ball slip through her cupped hands.Earlier, after a rogue opening over from Alice Capsey which went for 11 runs courtesy of two beautiful cuts for four by Mandhana, England’s three quicks had dominated the powerplay, taking a wicket apiece.Shafali Verma departed after fending off a Filer bouncer, before Bell and Emily Arlott held on to catches at mid-on and short fine leg which were tougher than severalEngland put down on Saturday.“Compared to the last game, there were certainly signs of fight from the team.

I don’t see any other places, to be honest.“In the past the relationship with the Silverstone promoters has been intense and they know that. Our approach is to find the best situation. I don’t see Silverstone not being able, if they want, to do what others have already done. We’ve done already last year a big step, never done before.”The meeting on Wednesday, to celebrate F1’s 75th anniversary, will include senior figures from F1, including drivers and team principals as well as apprentices and members of the all-female F1 Academy. It is hoped to be part of a developing relationship with the government to work better with the sport, notably in areas including infrastructure and over the effects of Brexit on F1, with seven of the 10 teams based in the UK.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton celebrates winning the 2024 British Grand Prix.

What’s more, the total of seven British men into round two is the best at any grand slam event since Wimbledon 1997.Another searingly hot day began with a check through the history books to find out the highest number of British first-round winners in the Open era, which was 13, in 1968. That always looked out of reach but Pinnington Jones’s brilliant 7-6 (4), 6-3, 7-5 win over Tomás Martín Etcheverry, the world No 53 from Argentina, took the tally into double figures.Jack Draper coolly handles Wimbledon pressure by marching past Sebastián BáezRead moreYet another product of Texas Christian University, where Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley studied, Pinnington Jones played stunning tennis on his Wimbledon debut, winning five straight games from 5-2 down in the third set for victory.Evans saw off another British player in Jay Clarke, a 6-1, 7-5, 6-2 win setting up a clash with Novak Djokovic, the seven-time champion. “I’ve got a lot of respect for Novak, he’s a great champion,” Evans said. “He’s done pretty much everything in the game. But it’s also my chance to win the match.“I have to be competitive, I have to play my game, I have to be myself. I can’t go into my shell and have too much respect. I’m looking forward to it.”View image in fullscreenBritain’s Jodie Burrage battles against Caty McNally but went down 6-3, 6-1.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersOf the six British players to lose, only Jodie Burrage was truly gutted by her performance, an ankle injury – picked up, she said, in an accident by the media centre on Friday – hampering her in a 6-3, 6-1 defeat against Caty McNally, of the US. Breaking her bracelet when she banged her racket into her left hand did not help her mood. “At least it wasn’t the expensive stuff but yeah, that was tough,” she said, forcing a smile. “It’s completely done. I’ve got another one at home, so you’ll see that one in the next few days.”George Loffhagen and Fran Jones also won sets but could not convert them into victories, while Johannus Monday was outplayed, not surprisingly, by the No 13 seed, Tommy Paul. “It was a very difficult match,” said the 6ft 6in Monday. “I felt a lot of pressure. I just tried to savour the moment.”Heather Watson, appearing at Wimbledon for the 15th time, went down 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 to the No 23 seed, Clara Tauson, a clear missed opportunity. “I let that slip through my fingers,” she said.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Draper took his first step forward at his home grand slam as one of the best players in the world by defeating the Argentinian Sebastián Báez with a dominant performance, establishing a 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 lead by the time his opponent retired because of a leg injury.Wimbledon diary: anyone for air-con? Don’t bank on finding much ice at SW19Read more“I obviouslywas aware of the buildupand all that sort of stuff,” said Draper. “I think my preparation has been really good. I feel confident. So I’m not thinking too much about that. At the end of the day, I focus on the things that I can control. I’m doing all the right things on a daily basis and giving myself the best chance to go out there and do the best I can. That’s all I can do.”This occasion had been a long time coming. Over the past year, Draper has enjoyed a long-awaited breakthrough in the sport after struggling badly with injuries and physical problems during his first years on the tour. He is now the world No 4, a contender for every tournament he enters, a grand slam semi-finalist at the US Open and a Masters 1000 champion at Indian Wells.While most British players usually enjoy some of their first notable results atWimbledon, an unusual part of Draper’s rise is how all of his success has so far come elsewhere. Despite his significant capabilities on grass, he has already equalled his best showing at Wimbledon with this victory. On Thursday, he will attempt to break new ground by passing the second round for the first time. His ambitions, however, are far greater.View image in fullscreenJack Draper serves against Sebastián Báez.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAt No 38, Báez is one of the highest-ranked opponents a seeded player could have faced in round one but specialises in grinding opponents down in bruising, attritional clay-court battles. Not only is he uncomfortable on grass, a surface on which he has won just three matches, Báez is also in poor form and he arrived on No 1 Court on a six-match losing streak.If Draper was feeling the nerves of this occasion, they did not last long. After spraying two forehands well long in the first few points of Báez’s opening service game, by the end of it the 23-year-old had already found his range on his forehand and he dominated almost every point with his superior weight of shot. He set the tone with an immediate break.Draper served brilliantly, breezing through his service games, and overwhelmed his diminutive, underpowered opponent with his forehand aggression. For his part, Báez’s performance reflected his struggles on the grass courts. He looked completely rushed for time against Draper’s imperious shots.Quick GuideWimbledon: Wednesday's order of playShowCentre Court(1.30pm BST start)A Sabalenka (1) v M Bouzkova (Cz)O Tarvet (GB) v C Alcaraz (Sp, 2)E Raducanu (GB) v M Vondrousova (Cz)No 1 Court(1pm BST start)C Norrie (GB) v F Tiafoe (US, 12)K Boulter (GB) v S Sierra (Arg)T Fritz (US, 5) v G Diallo (Can)Other courts to followhereWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After a heavy fall late in the first set, Báez eventually called for the physio while trailing by a break at 2-1 in the second set and he called out the physio again during the changeover after losing two further games. Across the net, Draper continued to pile on the pressure, rolling through to a two-set lead. After Draper sealed a break early in the third set, Báez finally opted to retire.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think I’ve still got so much to unlock on the grass. I think that’s really exciting for me. I love Wimbledon. I think if there’s any tournament I want to play my best in, any tournament that I want to win, it’s this one. I’m going to do everything in my power and everything in my control to get to that point.”During the match, there were a few amusing reminders that Draper and the Wimbledon public are still growing accustomed to each other. As the crowd was repeatedly caught out by the trajectory of his spectacular heavy topspin forehand, at one point the sound of a cork popping out of a champagne bottle echoed across the court, prompting Draper’s head to spin round in search of the disturbance.This is a regular occurrence at Wimbledon, of course, but with every victory he will get a little more used to everything that comes with performing on the courts he has dreamed of competing on since he was a child.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Jack DraperWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Before asking: “Did I really just see that?”And so to No 1 Court, where the 6ft 8in Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard sent down a 153mph thunderbolt to record the fastest serve in Wimbledon’s 145-year history – beating Taylor Dent’s record by 5mph.For good measure, he also powered in a 146mph second serve before predicting it was possible for someone like him to serve far, far quicker in the future. “The players are stronger,” he said. “They have bigger shoulders, so I don’t know – 260 or 270km/h (161-167mph) is maybe the next one.”Ultimately it was all to no avail as the 21-year-old lost an epic to the fifth seed, Taylor Fritz, 6-7 (6), 6-7 (8), 6-4, 7-6 (6), 6-4. But Mpetshi Perricard’s serve provoked similar levels of awe to watching Mike Tyson’s volcanic uppercuts, Jonah Lomu running over opponents and Usain Bolt obliterating the 100m world record while slowing down. It really was that special.The irony is that while Mpetshi Perricard hit 37 aces in the match, his record-breaking 153mph serve was actually returned and he lost the point. “I didn’t check the speed, to be honest,” he said afterwards. “It comes naturally. But we don’t train this part of my game a lot. It’s about 90% on the baseline, 10% on the serve.”The high-quality match resumed at two sets all, having been suspended 45 minutes before the 11pm curfew. Fritz had wanted to play on, feeling that he had the momentum. But the 17-hour break did nothing to disturb the familiar pattern with both players continuing to dominate serve in the fifth set. The American was no slouch in that regard, sending down 29 aces in total and denying his opponent a single break point.It was a match of impossibly fine margins. Yet at 5-4 down in the fifth set, Mpetshi Perricard’s serve suddenly let him down. He started with a double fault, before failing to find a first serve in the next three points. Fritz scented blood. And when Mpetshi Perricard sent a forehand long – one of 63 unforced errors across the match – it was over.Yet afterwards the Lyon-born youngster promised he would stick with his no compromises approach. “I don’t know if you saw the match, but every time there is a rally and it’s over five shots, I’m not the best one,” he said, smiling. “I think it’s better for me to play under three or four shots. So that’s why I’m going full-out sometimes.”He also believes he can develop a game that will one day enable him to win Wimbledon. “I think it’s a dream of all the other players in the draw to win this grand slam, so yeah,” he replied.Fritz, meanwhile, was delighted to get through to the second round, where he will face the dangerous Canadian Gabriel Diallo. But when asked what it was like to survive facing the biggest server in tennis, he was surprisingly sanguine. “I don’t really mind it because it actually gives me absolutely zero time to think,” he said. “Normally when I start thinking, that’s when I mess things up. I’d much rather deal with the speed than the spot.”And before he left, Fritz even had some words of advice for his opponent. “If he did 153mph, he could potentially do close to 160 in the right conditions,” he said. “The question I have is: Why? There’s no point. It’s much better to hit 140 to a spot than just hit the ball and serve as hard as you can.”Mpetshi Perricard might not ­necessarily agree.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Houston Rockets continued their offseason overhaul. And Orlando and Atlanta made moves with eyes on contending this coming season as the NBA’s free agency period got underway Monday.The Spurs lured center Luke Kornet away from Boston with a four-year, $41m deal, a person with knowledge of the agreement told the Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team cannot announce the deal until the league’s signing moratorium for most contracts is lifted on Sunday.Thunder sign Shai Gilgeous-Alexander record $285m supermax extensionRead moreKornet was part of Boston’s 2024NBAtitle team and has shot 68% from the field in 205 games, mostly off the bench, over the last three regular seasons. He figures to add frontcourt depth to the Spurs, who are hoping to have Wembanyama – the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year and an All-Star this past season – back and ready to go after he was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in a shoulder back in February.The Rockets, meanwhile, added veteran forward Dorian Finney-Smith on a four-year, $53m deal shortly after free agency opened. ESPN first reported the deal, and a person with knowledge of the agreement confirmed the terms to AP.Houston becomes Finney-Smith’s fourth team after stints with Dallas, Brooklyn and the Los Angeles Lakers. He’ll be added to a Rockets club that earlier this summer landed Kevin Durant in a blockbuster trade with Phoenix, though that deal cannot receive formal approval from the NBA until next week.Finney-Smith averaged 8.7 points and was a 41% shooter from three-point range this past season.ESPN also reported that the Rockets’ run on free agents continued with the addition of center Clint Capela, who spent the first six years of his career in Houston before playing for the last five seasons in Atlanta. Capela agreed to a three-year deal with the Rockets, ESPN said.Dallas, which needed some point guard help especially because the newly re-signed Kyrie Irving – rehabbing from an ACL tear – may not be ready to play until about midseason, agreed with D’Angelo Russell on a two-year contract worth nearly $13m.NBA draft winners and losers: Mavs’ shot at redemption and the strange tale of Ace BaileyRead moreRussell would be part of the backcourt depth on a club with an imposing front line that, if healthy, would include No 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg, 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis and promising young center Dereck Lively II.Atlanta added Nickeil Alexander-Walker from Minnesota on what will be a four-year, $62m deal following a completion of a sign-and-trade with the Timberwolves. Minnesota will get a draft pick, cash considerations and will create a trade exception once the deal is finalized, a person with knowledge of the move told AP.The Magic, meanwhile, added Tyus Jones on a one-year deal. He joins an Orlando roster that already landed Desmond Bane from Memphis in a trade, and the Magic – who played long stretches last season without Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs because of injuries – should be a legit East contender this season if healthy.It was a big night for the Jones family: Tyus Jones’ brother, Tre Jones, agreed Monday on a three-year deal to return to the Chicago Bulls.The free agency period officially opened at 6pm ET on Monday, but in actuality, was rolling long before that.LeBron James hasalready opted in to a $52.6m dealwith the Los Angeles Lakers for this coming season, the Rockets traded for Durant – not a free agency move, obviously – and the Los Angeles Clippers saw James Harden decline his option in return for a new deal and a raise. There was even a surprise addition to free agency, with Portland announcing it has bought out the contract of former No 1 pick Deandre Ayton, allowing him to sign with any team he chooses.And on Monday, even before the shopping window officially started, more deals: Nicolas Batum will come back to the Clippers, his agency said, on a two-year deal, while Joe Ingles agreed to return to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Deals like those could get done before the official start time because teams are allowed to negotiate with their own free agents once the NBA finals are finished.In other deals confirmed by AP on Monday night:The Los Angeles Clippers added Brook Lopez – most recently of Milwaukee – on a two-year deal worth about $18m.Veteran guard Bruce Brown returned to the Denver Nuggets, a team he helped win the 2023 NBA title.Center Kevon Looney agreed to a two-year deal with New Orleans, after he spent his first 10 seasons with Golden State.Guard Caris LeVert will sign a two-year deal worth nearly $15m annually with the Detroit Pistons, a team that won 14 games in 2023-24 and then won 44 games to earn the No 6 seed in the Eastern Conference this past season.Luka Garza joined Boston, after the Celtics lost Kornet, on a two-year, $5.5m deal, agent Mark Bartelstein said.The NBA announced Monday that it has set the salary cap for the coming season at $154.647m, the maximum allowed 10% increase over the level for this past season.The tax level for the 2025-26 season is $187.895m, the league said.Julius Randle returns to the Timberwolves with a potential $100m deal.Bobby Portis stays with the Bucks, keeping the popular sixth man in Milwaukee.Duncan Robinson terminates his contract with the Heat, though he may return.In very specific situations, teams can announce signings when completed. But in most situations, and this even applies to some draft-related trades (such as the one involving Durant going to Houston), teams won’t be able to announce those until at least 6 July.Explore more on these topicsNBASan Antonio SpursHouston RocketsAtlanta HawksOrlando MagicDallas MavericksVictor WembanyamaShareReuse this content"

Amid an acute shortage of prison places and probation officers under severe strain, ministers told the companies they wanted ideas for using wearable technologies, behaviour monitoring and geolocation to create a “prison outside of prison”.Those present included representatives of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Palantir, which works closely with the US military and has contracts with the NHS. IBM and the private prison operator Serco also attended alongside tagging and biometric companies, according to a response to a freedom of information request.Mahmood told the tech companies she wants “deeper collaboration between government and tech to solve the prison capacity crisis, reduce reoffending and make communities safer”. She invited them to “scale and improve” the existing use of tagging “not just for monitoring but to drive rehabilitation and reduce crime”. The prisons minister, James Timpson, called for a “tech-led approach to justice”.The initiative is the latest sign of the Labour government’s embrace of the technology industry to help deliver efficiency savings in creaking public services from schools to hospitals. In January, Keir Starmer declared that AI was a way “to transform our public services” and spoke about “totally rewiring government”.The push by the Ministry of Justice follows last month’sreview of sentencingby the former justice secretary David Gauke, which called for fewer short prison sentences and the greater use of AI as well as possible wider use of facial recognition technology in public to help cut the overcrowded prison population by almost 10,000.At the meeting last month, which was hosted by the industry lobby group Tech UK, ministers asked the tech companies what a “digital, data and technology-enabled justice system” could look like in 2050. Responses included: “Real-time behaviour monitoring and subcutaneous tracking” to support the health, and “behaviour management” of people under the control of the criminal justice system; artificial intelligence advisers to support offenders’ rehabilitation; and robotics “used to manage prisoner movement and containment” including “self-driving vehicles [to] transport prisoners”.Human rights campaigners called the ideas “alarmingly dystopian” and warned that the meeting suggested the government may be “getting too close to the tech giants”. A second meeting with tech companies is scheduled for Tuesday, with Lord Timpson due to hear 20-minute pitches for new ideas at what officials are calling an “innovation den”.A government source stressed the ideas raised so far were hypothetical talking points to bring about conversations about the future of offender management to better protect the public.The justice secretary has previously said she is “not squeamish” about using technology such as “gait recognition”, a type of biometric monitoring of humans’ unique movement patterns, which some believe could help prevent violence in jails before it happens.An MoJ spokesperson said: “As the public would rightly expect, we continue to explore technology that will help us cut crime, effectively monitor offenders and keep the public safe.”Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a non-profit organisation campaigning for fairer use of technology which obtained the FoI response, called the suggestions “alarmingly dystopian”. “It is chilling to know that justice ministers have sat with the tech sector to discuss using robots to manage prisoners, implanting devices under people’s skin to track their behaviour, or using computers to ‘predict’ what they will do in future,” he said.Other suggestions from the tech companies included using high-powered quantum computers to “analyse past data to predict future behaviours and create diversion paths” and to automate sentencing calculations in the overstretched probation service.But there were also fears raised about the consequences of relying too much on technology. One response recorded in minutes was that: “If misapplied, these technologies could lead to dystopian outcomes that are difficult to reverse.”Campbell said: “The idea that tech companies can produce tools to ‘predict’ crime has been discredited time and again – it is disappointing to see that they are continuing to push it – and that the MoJ is so willing to listen.”Tech UK, which hosted the meeting, said it was part of efforts to create a fairer, better and more effective justice system. A spokesperson said: “It is essential that the future of justice is shaped with transparency, accountability, and public trust at its core.”Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment. Serco said: “We will not be commenting on this activity”.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationShabana MahmoodUK criminal justiceArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Ministers even have access to an AI tool that is supposed to provide a “vibe check” on parliamentary opinion to help them weigh the political risks of policy proposals.Again and again, ministers are turning to technology to tackle acute crises that in the past might have been dealt with by employing more staff or investing more money.The push to digitise government, which is led by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and his science and technology secretary, Peter Kyle, has brought the government into close contact with the biggest US tech companies. Google, Microsoft, Palantir, IBM and Amazon were all in attendance at a Ministry of Justice roundtable discussion last month. Starmer and Kyle are not alone. Countries from Singapore to Estonia have been increasingly embracing AI in public service delivery.Jeegar Kakkad, a director at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change – one of the organisations arguing for greater use of technology and which is part-funded by tech firms – put the argument like this: “Our systems are broken. They cannot keep up with demand. You have a couple of choices: keep trying to make a broken system work with traditional approaches – more money, more immigrants to fill the gap in the workforce – or you have to usetechnology.“I think the answer is technology, but we have to make sure we have agency in how we design these systems, they are human-designed and we put rules in place.”Kyle has recently been at pains to stress that the government is doing everything it can to enable big tech firms to thrive in Britain. At London Tech Week last month, he told executives about regulation and planning policies designed to make their businesses run better, saying: “All of this adds up to a government that is on your side.”When it comes to injecting technology into public services, ministers face a choice: whether to “build or buy”. The temptation is often to issue contracts to private companies to achieve the fastest and greatest impact. For the tech companies, a huge pot of revenue is at stake. The value of UK public sector tech contracts rose to £19.6bn last year, up from £14.4bn in 2019, according to Tussell, which researches government contracts.But introducing AI and automation into public services is riskier than using it to help drivers navigate busy roads or recommending songs to music fans. When citizens interact with public services they are often at their most vulnerable.For example, last week the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent research body,foundthat 59% of the public were concerned about the idea of AI being used to assess welfare eligibility, compared with 39% of people worried about the use of facial recognition technology in policing.And the public is also showing signs of concern about the motivations of private technology companies. The same polling found the public was significantly less likely to trust private companies to deliver technology that could assess welfare eligibility or predict the risk of cancer than government bodies (although governments are less trusted than academics and not-for-profits).The institute urged MPs to launch a review of the “role of technology companies and the bodies funded by them in shaping the policy and media narrative on the benefits of public sector AI; and the effectiveness of existing measures that aim to tackle conflicts of interest and ‘revolving door’ dynamics between government and the technology sector”.It said: “At a time when AI is being offered as a solution to a wide range of public sector problems, the public are concerned about the motivations of private sector involvement. The public expects transparency and that public sector AI prioritises people over profit.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Civil serviceLabourTechnology sectoranalysisShareReuse this content"

That’s the question posed by Moonlight Peaks, the gen Z-coded, achingly TikTok-ready supernatural life sim. Inspired by the popularity of “cosy games” such as Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, Moonlight Peaks drapes you in the cape of Dracula’s daughter, who has fled her father’s corpse-ridden home to start a new, peaceful life.Soon, she settles among werewolves and witches in the supernatural farming town of Moonlight Peaks, where she grows crops and rears animals instead of subsisting on the blood of innocents. Both cosy and creepy, the game has you creating your own plant-based blood substitutes, befriending the town’s residents and fixing a whole host of problems left in daddy Dracula’s wake.While farming and decorating make the core of the game, its creators tell me there are a surprising number of story-led quests to find. “We joke that you’re the town therapist,” says Mia Boas, art director, “because you arrive and have to help everyone solve their family issues.” From calming worried werewolves to quelling quarrelling mermaids and even flirting with the grim reaper – plus flower-arranging and embroidery minigames - developer Little Chicken promises there will be more than just perfecting your haunted homestead.“We decided it should be a cute and cosy experience, through and through,” says Yannis Bolman, CEO game director. “When we first started out, we had a mechanic where you could bite every bystander. It just felt off, because you’re trying to make friends with these people, and then you’re biting them? It just felt really weird.”Like any social-media-friendly life sim, Moonlight Peaks has a range of romance options for players to sink their teeth into. “Once you become romantically interested, you can go on dates like stargazing, marshmallow roasting … And if you do well enough, you can get married,” says Bolman. “The ultimate step is, you can turn them into a vampire, too. But you’re biting them with consent, of course. They’llaskyou to bite them.” In an adorable touch, finding your fanged soulmate turns your home’s single coffin into a double.Bolman and Boas tell me that fan feedback has helped guide the direction of the game, which is already attracting an excitable – and predominantly female - fanbase. With a vibrant art style that looks surprisingly slick considering the size of its team, Moonlight Peaks looks set to fill a Twilight-shaped gap in the sim market.Moonlight Peaks is out onPCin 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCShareReuse this content"

From the French government’s decision to close schools to thebans in most of Italyon outdoor work at the hottest time of day, the immediate priority is to protect people from extreme heat – and to recognise that a heatwave can take a higher toll than a violent storm.People who are already vulnerable, due to age or illness or poor housing, face the greatest risks from heatwaves. As well as changes to rules and routines, public health warnings are vital, especially where records are being broken and people are unfamiliar with the conditions. In the scorching European summer of 2022, an estimated68,000 people dieddue to heat. Health, welfare and emergency systems must respond to those needing help.Less direct harms include losses in agriculture. In the UK, the British Retail Consortium has blamed reduced crop yields, due to hot weather, forrising food price inflation. Wildfires – such as the one in Chios,Greece, last week – menace buildings, landscapes and wildlife as well as human lives.Last year, the UK government faced strong criticism from the advisory Climate Change Committee forinadequate adaptation plans. Apart from an increase in spending on flood defences, Labour has so far donelittle to rectify this. The current heatwave ought to change that. With a heat dome that draws in and traps warm air affecting almost all of France, as well as countries further south, the need to prepare is obvious.Good information enables sensible planning; this includes reliable forecasting as well as attribution studies that explain how global heating makes destructive weather more likely.Recent extreme weather in the US, as well as in Europe, highlights the folly of Donald Trump’s cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.By withdrawing from the Paris agreement, Mr Trump has made the US a global outlier. But while the EU remains committed to net zero by 2050 – and states are due to discuss aninterim target for 2040this week –support for net zero policieshas been eroded in some European countries too over the last few years, particularly where far-right populist leaders have targeted them.Could the current dangerous heat help to refocus minds? Portugal and Spain both recorded new records at the weekend, withtemperatures over 46C. This week, scientists at a conference in Exeter are gathering to discuss climate tipping points. Generally this term refers to the passing of dangerous limits – such as melted ice sheets – after which catastrophe becomes much harder to prevent. ButProf Timothy Lentonpoints out that it can also be used positively. Two examples are the accelerating uptake of solar power and electric vehicles.As well as supporting people to cope with the heat, and promoting adaptations of various kinds (for example, in building and urban design), European leaders should use current conditions to remind the public how much is at stake, and reinforce the importance of ambitious, achievable targets. Climate despair is deadly, but the anxiety produced by recognition of the risks can be harnessed to positive effect. As well as a problem to be dealt with, the heatwave could be viewed as a teachable moment – when the public becomes more receptive to the pressing case for change.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now the US supreme court has struck another blowTue 1 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 17.20 EDTSharePlanned Parenthood, the massive, 108-year-old network of women’s and reproductive health clinics that operatesalmost 600 health centersacross the United States, may not survive the Trump administration. Long a hated symbol on the right, and unable to summon enthusiastic support from the left, the medical network has nevertheless remained a symbolic and material cornerstone of women’s equality, serving millions of patients – many of them indigent or low-income – each year, and housing one of the biggest feminist and pro-choice lobbying and litigation shops in America, in addition to being one of the nation’s largest healthcare providers.Since returning to power in January, the Trump administration has made repeated cuts targeting Planned Parenthood’s clinics, excluding the group from the vastTitle Xfamily planning program, on the pretext of scurrilous claims that they have violated federal anti-discrimination law by adopting resolutions stressing their “commitment to Black communities” and by providing medical treatment to undocumented immigrants.Now, the supreme court has struck another blow. Last week, the court ruled that patients cannot sue to challenge their states’ exclusion ofPlanned Parenthoodfrom their Medicaid programs. The ruling threatens to transform the Medicaid program, giving states leeway to ban Medicaid reimbursements to any practice that provides politically disfavored medicine – notably abortion, but potentially also including contraception, IVF, gender-affirming care, or HIV treatment. The court functionally nullifies a clause in the bill that established the Medicaid program, which gives patients the right to seek care from “any qualified provider” of their choosing. Now, the choice of provider can be dramatically limited by the state on the basis of that provider’s political beliefs.The ruling also dramatically weakenssection 1983of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, a landmark Reconstruction-era law that allows for citizens to sue states that deprive them of federally protected rights – raising the troubling prospect that the court will look askance at citizens’ ability to enforce their constitutional rights against states that are disdainful of them. In the process, the court provided states with yet another way to choke off Planned Parenthood’s funding, and to deprive their residents – particularly women – of the healthcare that they need to live safe, healthy and dignified lives. Many states – most – will now probably proceed to do so.The case,Medina v Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, concerns South Carolina’s decision to exclude Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. State funding of abortions is not at issue: abortion isbanned in South Carolina, and even before it was, the state did not provide Medicaid coverage for abortions out of its state funds. (Federal money is not used to pay for abortions, either: a budget rider known as theHyde Amendmenthas prevented federal Medicaid funding from covering abortion care since 1977, in effect prohibiting low-income women from accessing the procedure under their government healthcare plans.)What is at issue, rather, is whether Planned Parenthood, which provides a wide array of services for a disproportionately low-income clientele, can be prohibited from receiving reimbursement for other services that they provide – like pap smears, prenatal care and STD testing. Planned Parenthood challenged their own exclusion by the law in tandem with a Medicaid patient who went to them seeking birth control; because she chose a provider that her state government had a disdain for, she was denied. The suit questioned whether the plaintiffs could sue to enforce the right of patients to choose their own providers. Writing for the court’s six-justice majority of Republican-appointed judges, Neil Gorsuch found that they can’t.In practice, this decision enables an aggressive expansion of the states’ power to put the political preferences of Republican lawmakers between women and gender-nonconforming people and their doctors. Delivered the day after the third anniversary of Dobbs, the decision expands the court’s attack on abortion rights by granting states broad latitude to exclude abortion providers from the government subsidy programs that structure much of American healthcare: in practice, this will make abortion provision even more prohibitively expensive and onerous for doctors and practices, and will shutter many clinics.The result is a de facto ban not just on abortion, but on any healthcare provision by pro-choice providers for vast swaths of American womenThe ruling also comes on the heels of Skrimetti, the court’s ruling upholding bans on transition-related healthcare for minors, on the absurd claim that such laws are somehow not sex discrimination. Collectively, the cases illustrate a judicial agenda that is not just vehemently anti-choice, but aggressively gender prescriptive: willing to use the levers of medicine and its regulation to enforce a narrow and regressive vision of gender roles, from identity to sexuality to gestation.The decision comes at a moment when Donald Trump’s domestic policy agenda, known humiliatingly as the “big, beautiful bill,” is working its way through the Senate, which among other things is considering a provision to ban Planned Parenthood from all Medicaid reimbursements nationwide. The organization has said that as a result of the supreme court and Trump administration actions, nearly a third of their clinics – about 200 – may have to close; the group has already decided to close 20 clinics just this year.The result is a de facto ban not just on abortion, but on any healthcare provision by pro-choice providers for vast swaths of American women. One in three women in the US has received services from Planned Parenthood; more than half of American Black women have. When combined with the independent reproductive health clinics that will also be excluded from Medicaid due to their abortion politics, that number rises higher.These Medicaid-enrolled women have now been denied the right to choose a doctor for their most intimate care based on their own comfort and values: instead, they will be forced to choose one based on the whims and bigotries of elected Republicans. In her dissent for the court’s three Democratic appointees, Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the decision will strip patients “of a deeply personal freedom: ‘the ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable’”.Instead, those vulnerable patients will probably be pushed, in growing numbers, toward religiously affiliated groups that deceive rather than treat. While abortion-providing medical practices like Planned Parenthood are being pushed out of Medicaid, the program is giving more and more money to crisis pregnancy centers, the Christian fake clinics that lure in frightened women, lie to them about their health, do not provide comprehensive care, and often lack any doctors on staff. These fake clinics, which are lavishly funded and outnumber real reproductive health centers nationwide at a rate of three to one, are not a substitute for real healthcare. But they are a means of restricting women’s freedom. For the court, that’s good enough.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsPlanned ParenthoodOpinionTrump administrationUS supreme courtcommentShareReuse this content"

Make it stop!Tue 1 Jul 2025 07.36 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 12.47 EDTShareIs your name Barron, Donald Jr, Eric, Ivanka or Tiffany Trump? No? Then I regret to inform you that President Donald John Trump is almost certainly not your daddy. I say “almost certainly” because narcissistic billionaires do have a nasty habit of spawning willy-nilly. Just look at Elon Musk and Pavel Durov – the latter is the Telegram founder, who hasmore than 100 childrenin 12 countries via sperm donation.Still, unless you are a veryhigh-IQindividual, with an orange glow, an insatiable appetite for money-making schemes, and a weird belief thatyou invented the word “caravan”, I think it’s safe to say that you’re probably not Trump’s offspring.Why am I taking great pains to spell this out? Because a disturbing condition called Trump daddy derangement syndrome (TDDS) is sweeping the world – the main symptom of which is an irresistible urge to call the president of the United States “Daddy”.Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson bears some blame for the spread of this ailment. While speaking at a Trump rally last October, Carlson delivered an unusual speech in which he compared the US under Trump to a patriarchgiving his naughty teenage daughtera “vigorous spanking”. Rather than immediately losing the contents of their stomach because of this imagery, the Maga-loving crowd lapped it up. When Trump came on stage later they yelled “Daddy’s home!” and “Daddy Don!” Which, of course, plays right into Trump’s self-mythologising as a hypermasculine strongman who will be aprotector of women“whether they like it or not”.While TDDS remained fairly dormant for a few months after that, it seems we are suffering a new outbreak. Last week, Nato secretary general Mark Rutte addressed Trump’s comments about Israel and Iran not knowing “what the fuck they’re doing” byhelpfully explaining that: “Sometimes Daddy needs to use strong language.”And sometimes a Nato chief needs to watch their language. After his comments caused a social media storm, Rutte rapidly back-pedalled. “The daddy thing, I didn’t call him ‘Daddy,’” Ruttetold reporterslater that day, despite being on the record saying just that. “Sometimes, in Europe, I hear … countries saying: ‘Hey, Mark, will the US stay with us?’ And I said that sounds a little bit like a small child asking his daddy: ‘Hey, are you still staying with the family?’ So in that sense, I used ‘daddy’ – not that I was calling President Trump Daddy.”Nice try, Mark, but I’m not sure that makes things better. Rutte, a Dutchman, is basically calling Europe a helpless child who needs Trump’s approval.Whatever Rutte meant, Trump and his followers seem to have taken “daddy” as a compliment. Last week Jonathan Lindsey, a Republican lawmaker, told fellow Michigan senate members that a lot of Americans see Trump as a father figure and more people should start referring to him as “Daddy”. Gay Democratic Michigan senator Jeremy Mossthen replied: “You don’t want to know what daddy means in my community.” Just to spell it out, “daddy” has been gay slang for an older man, often monied, who is sexually involved with a younger man for almost as long as Trump has been alive.Meanwhile, Trump spoke approvingly of Rutte’s comments,saying: “I think he likes me.”He added: “If he doesn’t, I’ll let you know. I’ll come back and I’ll hit him hard, OK? He did it very affectionately. Daddy, you’re my daddy.” Trump’s fundraising operation is also flogging T-shirts with his mugshot and the word “DADDY” on themfor just $35. Sigmund Freud, sadly, could not be reached for comment on all this. But if he were available, I think even he might have said: “Mummy, please make this stop.”Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsNatoMark RuttecommentShareReuse this content"

Often, it’s discouraging – like the moment my partner and I saw Hillary Clinton’s team selling lawn signs for $25 instead of blanketing Philadelphia by distributing them free, and predicted she’d lose. But the lessons of Zohran’s victory are hopeful for the left and theDemocrats– if the party takes them to heart.Socialism is practical“A city we can afford.” Zohran’s slogan is unremarkably moderate and unabashedly progressive. In a city whose median income isrising sharplyin spite of a25% poverty rate, only the rich are comfortable, while everyone else, from students to firefighters to families with more than one kid struggle – or leave.Asked by a localFox TV interviewerwhat a democratic socialist is, Mamdani answered: “To me it means that every New Yorker has what they need to live a dignified life – it’s local government’s responsibility to provide that.” His platform includes a rent freeze on the city’s 2.3m regulated apartments; free childcare starting at six months; no-fare buses; and a $30 minimum wage – about the city’sliving wage– by 2030. Basically, he believes life in the city can be easier and happier.This platform resonates. When you canvass, you ask people what concerns them. A woman with a baby on her hip nodded toward the baby and sighed. I got what she meant. At a shabby industrial building surrounded by new glass towers, a woman descended four flights because the landlord won’t fix the buzzer, or anything else; he’s trying to push out the tenants and sell the lot. She said cheap rent allowed her to start a business, which she feared Mamdani would tax to death. I told her he supported a crackdown on bad landlords and commercial rent control. “Hmm,” she said. By the conversation’s end, I entered “leans yes” in the canvassing app.Mamdani’s ideas are not pie-in-the-sky. The rent guidelines board, appointed by the mayor, voted 0% increases on some leases in 2015,2016, and on all leases in2020, during the pandemic. The Democratic mayor Bill De Blasio gotuniversal pre-kindergartenstaffed, funded and full almost immediately upon election in 2014.Chicago and Atlantamay be moving ahead with municipal groceries. A 2023 pilot program waiving fares on five New York bus routes waslargelysuccessful, and its failures can inform the next attempt.How would Mamdani pay for all this? Impose a 2% tax on the top 1% residents earning more than $1m annually; and raise the top corporate tax rate to match neighboring New Jersey’s, to 11.5% from 7.25%.New York has the resources. Nationally, corporate profits have risen80%since the pandemic. In New York, 34,000 households, a thin skin on the Big Apple, take home 35% of the earnings. Other cities and states have tapped the windfall that companies and the rich have reaped from federal income tax cuts. Combined with such Republican-sounding ideas as eliminating waste in procurement and boosting small business by cutting red tape, Mamdani says these reforms can bring in $10bn in revenue, pay for the services that improve city life and ultimately grow the tax base.“From each according to their ability, to each according to their need”: that’s socialism 101. “The greatest good for the greatest number”: old-fashioned utilitarianism. These policies are also sensible municipal management.Moral integrity is good politicsSince founding his college’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, Mamdani, an east African Muslim, has been a vocal critic of Israel’s occupation. A week after Hamas’s attacks – which he calls a war crime – he joined Jewish Voice for Peace in a protest of Israel’s outsized response. For this position, his closest rival, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, and therightwingpresshave hammered Mamdani as an antisemite and aHolocaustdenier; on one mailer, his photo was doctored to make his beard bushier and longer. Cuomo kept mispronouncing his name, insinuating that Zohran Mamdani is inscrutably, dangerously foreign.Establishment Democrats –Kamala Harris,Cory Booker– keep running from condemnation of what most of the world calls Israel’s crimes against humanity. This is not just a moral failing. It’s politically unnecessary. A recentPew pollfound that almost seven in 10 Democrats – and half of Republicans under 50 – have negative views of Israel. In a couple of months of canvassing, I met only two people who wouldn’t vote for Mamdani because of his position on Israel-Palestine. One had Hebrew tattooed on his forearm. Among the volunteers, several of whom were drawn to Zohran for his stance on Palestine, were Jewish people.The question may be moot. In anEmersonpoll, 46% of New York voters said their candidate did not need to be pro-Israel. The journalistPeter Beinartbelieves that Mamdani’s victory suggests that the movement for Palestinian freedom has entered mainstream politics and can be an asset to Democrats.Confronted repeatedly by false accusations of antisemitism, Mamdani has beenfrustrated and hurt. Yet he is neither defensive nor evasive. “At the core of my position about Israel, Palestine, anyplace in the world, is consistency, international law and human rights,” he told Fox. “I believe that justice, freedom, safety – those are things that should be applied to all people.”In hisvictory speech, he said: “I cannot promise that you will always agree with me, but I will never hide from you.” He would “wrestle with” opinions that differed from his own, he added, implying he meant feelings about the Middle East.Mamdani is a gifted politician – and an honest man who doesn’t dismiss those he disagrees with. A person can be all these, and win.Fear doesn’t always rule electionsMamdani’s campaign was partially, appropriately, fueled by economic anxiety. But try as his detractors did to shift the focus, it was not fueled by fear of crime. He does not advocate defunding the police. Instead, he’s proposed a department of community safety, to deal with volatile mental health crises in the subways and to attack hate crimes at their source, leaving cops to pursue violent crime. He recognizes that good public services and personal economic stability, not more police, constitute public safety.More striking, Zohran mobilized civic pride, solidarity and joy. These too are winning political emotions.Young people represent the crises facing working AmericansAt the beginning of a canvassing shift, everybody introduces themselves and says why they’re there. I am usually the oldest. As a white person, I’m one of maybe half the group. Many of my comrades’ genders are less recognizable than my own. As a homeowner with an adequate income, I’m in the minority.“I can’t even afford the Bronx” – the cheapest borough for renters – a recent college graduate with her parents moaned, to knowing laughter. A pregnant woman has “a panic attack” whenever she contemplates paying for daycare. A man in his 30s who drives an Uber 12 hours a day would like to be home when his kids are awake. A first-generation Chinese American fears for her undocumented parents and feels an obligation to elect someone who will protect them.Their jobs are precarious, their credit cards overcharged. They have no health insurance and wonder if they’ll ever retire their student debt. They come from mixed immigration status families and imagine middle age on a broiling planet. And they are the young voters who turned out overwhelmingly for a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. If the Democrats want the same results, they need to offer these voters, who personify America’s troubled working and middle classes, a progressive vision.People can overpower moneyMamdanicrushedit inpresumedCuomo strongholds throughout the five boroughs. Of course, he ruled in the youth-dominated “commie corridor” from Astoria, Queens to Bushwick, Brooklyn (80%). But he also carried communities such as Asian Flushing, Sunset Park, Elmhurst, and Chinatown Queens, by no means presumed progressive.In February,Cuomo polled at 33% of potential votes; Zohran had 1%.By primary day, the pro-Cuomo Super Pac, bankrolled bybillionairesincluding Trump supporters like Wall Street bigwig Bill Ackman, had spent $25m, largely on smear ads. Mamdani’s Pac spent $1.2m, and a Working Families party-affiliated Pac put in $500,000.Mamdani had as many as 50,000 volunteers, who knocked over a million doors. Cuomo avoided the public and the press.Money isn’t everything.We don’t have to settle for the lesser of two evilsThe general election will be tougher. Mamdani beat a badly compromised rival with only432,000 votesin a city with4.7 million “active voters” in 2024, not all of whom vote. If Cuomo runs as an independent, he will double down on the Islamophobia and red-baiting. So will the now independent mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the quasi-vigilante Guardian Angels. The Republican party is already making Mamdani the poster boy of a Marxist, terrorist,criminal immigrantDemocratic party. Wall Street ispreparing for battle.But whether Mamdani wins or loses, pundits on all sides will avow that what happens in liberal New York stays in liberal New York. It can’t transplant to national, or even statewide, elections. That’s a cynical error.In his primary night speech, Mamdani promised to use his office “to reject Donald Trump’s fascism, to stop masked Ice agents from deporting our neighbors, and to govern our city as a model for the Democratic party. A party where we fight for working people with no apologies.”This is not today’s Democratic party. But it has everything to gain from watching Zohran Mamdani and the extraordinary coalition of superhumanly enthusiastic volunteers he has inspired. Theirs are the faces of a political party that democracy, and Americans, deserve.Judith Levine is Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist, and author of five books.

He needs to give his old supporters new reasons to keep him in officeTue 1 Jul 2025 14.51 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 19.08 EDTShareWhen politicians can’t admit they are losing, they say they are listening. Your anger has been heard, says the contrite minister after a byelection drubbing. We are addressing the concerns, says the government spokesperson on theeve of a backbench rebellion. Sometimes, it is even true. Usually, it is too late.The optimal time for Downing Street to have started paying attention toLabourMPs’ complaints about disability benefit cuts was before the uprising threatened to torpedo a flagship government bill.It wasnot, in the end, sunk, but it is listing low in the water. A humiliating Commons defeat was averted on Tuesday night byrolling concessions, diluting and deferring the policy with mounting, chaotic urgency as the vote drew near.49 Labour MPsstill voted to kill the bill anyway.Serious engagement on the substance of the rebels’ complaints only began once it became clear they were legion and resistant to the conventional whips’ arsenal of threats, pleas and career-advancing inducements. By that stage, relations between No 10 and the backbenches were befogged with suspicion and resentment.Withdrawing financial support from people with disabilities was always going to be a hard sell to Labour MPs. Blurring the line between reform and fiscal parsimony didn’t help. It is hard to persuade sceptics that the Department for Work and Pensions will prioritise compassion when cost-cutting under Treasury duress clearly dictates the pace and scope of policy. That mistrust aggravates misgiving about Keir Starmer’s strategy and the faultiness of his political antennae.Internal anxiety about Labour’s purpose has grown as the party’s popularity has shrivelled. There are many reasons for the steep collapse in support since the election. Two of the most commonly cited are lack of rigorous policy preparation in opposition and Starmer’s struggle to inspire audiences with a clear sense of what he wants from power.Those might be the same problem. Vagueness on substance, ruthless message discipline and a horror of loose leftish talk that might spook swing voters were vital components in a campaign for ousting the Tories.Last year’s election-winning strategy neutralised potential concerns about the prospect of a Labour government, but without generating enthusiasm for the idea. Starmer was the instrument of a broad but incoherent anti-Conservative coalition that lost its galvanising energy as soon as the exit poll was published.Arguably, the dissipation happened even earlier. The sense of an imminent Labour landslide, with weeks of headlines forecasting Tory annihilation, may have depressed turnout and encouraged left-leaning voters to prefer independents and Greens, safe in the knowledge that they wouldn’t wake up on 5 July to find Rishi Sunak still in charge.Labour could find the money it wants without raising taxes. This is austerity by amnesia | Randeep RameshRead moreTo a new government with a majority of 174, that looked like negligible voter attrition at the margins. The scale of the victory seemed to promise at least two terms in power. The official opposition was still the Tories, althoughReform UKwere already making menacing noises in the wings.Downing Street strategists were not worried about an exposed left flank. They could see frustration on that side of the spectrum where many had hoped Starmer’s pre-election insipidity was a feint, but the more pressing concern was an ongoing mission to persuade voters in Labour’s “red wall” heartlands that the party really was for them. That focus intensified onceReform started topping opinion polls.But messages calibrated to Nigel Farage’s potential recruits – reluctance to speak ill of Brexit; apugnacious tone on immigration– failed to seduce the target audience whiledriving defections to the Lib Dems and Greens. MPs started warning that this would cost Labour seats. Downing Street didn’t listen.That may now be changing. The rebellion on benefit cuts, coinciding with the first anniversary of the election, demands some strategic introspection.No one can pretend things are going well. Steps the government has taken that ought to be popular with the party’s base – big cash infusions for the NHS, transport, social housing; expanding provision of free school meals – haven’t registered amid the rage against cuts elsewhere.Farage has seized the mantle of radical changemaker, at least in that corner of the political market where change implies tearing down institutions and breaking rules without much thought (or honesty from the leader) about what might replace them.Starmer can’t compete in a game of system-smashing. He is a pragmatic fixer by nature and also prime minister – the apex of the system being targeted. While he also can’t ignore the concerns of Reform voters, polling evidence suggests they are a smaller, less biddable component of Labour’s potential electorate than the liberal-left defectors.Arecent poll commissioned by Stanley Greenberg, a veteran US Democratic party strategist with close ties to Labour, found that almost 15% of current Lib Dem voters and 10% of Greens say there is a fair chance they could back Starmer. The equivalent numbers for Tory and Reform are 3% and 1% respectively.The same poll looks at issues that animate swing voters and the messages that might appeal to them. Unsurprisingly, the NHS and cost of living crisis are top of everyone’s list. Immigration is also crucial. There is no path to a second term that doesn’t include credible reassurance that the nation’s borders are securely managed.But there are also fruitful areas where Starmer could lean more to the liberal-left in terms that retain mass appeal. One is urgency around the climate crisis (as long as it is made clear that consumers won’t be overburdened but will benefit from lower energy bills). Another is greater clarity about the destabilising effects of Donald Trump’s misrule in the US, and the necessary mitigation through closer strategic alignment with Europe. Trump is reviled by supporters of every UK party, including Reform. The only foreign leader who beats him at repelling British voters is Vladimir Putin. Farage has publicly admired them both.Given Greenberg’s connections, it is safe to assume his polling and the strategic avenues they illuminate have been seen and taken seriously in Downing Street. The core observation will come as no surprise to Starmer’s team. Local elections earlier this year had already revealed the fractious condition of British politics. Also, amid the volatility, a pattern of coalescence into two blocs – a liberal-progressive constellation of Labour, Lib Dem and Greens facing a populist-nationalist insurgency motored by Reform,with the Tories in a sidecar.Recognition of that dynamic explains Starmer’s tendency to name Farage as his main rival and treat Kemi Badenoch as an irrelevance. On one level, that is just a description of facts as they appear from current polling. But it also anticipates a general election campaign, where Labour maximises tactical support from Lib Dems and Greens. The assumption is that a litany of grudges against the prime minister will be set aside once the task in hand is blocking Farage’s entry into No 10.It is a plausible bet but not a certain one. If Labour continues to aggravate its former supporters at the current rate there is a serious risk of them casting a protest ballot elsewhere or staying at home when the anti-Reform clarion summons them to action.Four years remain before that call goes out. There is still time for Starmer to position himself as the candidate of a mainstream majority that doesn’t want Britain to follow the US down the path of bigoted venality, climate denialism and democratic decay. But if the prime minister really does envisage the next election as a head-to-head battle for the soul of British politics, he needs to get cannier at picking fights he can win, while also giving his longsuffering supporters something to cheer. His current method seems likely to do neither.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Raf Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government, its current policies and plans for the next four yearsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The memory of his kindness kept me going | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreIt seems to me that the doctor is having a one-way conversation, the kind I am about to have with my patient.Following a bad fall months ago, my patient can’t speak or move. I wonder what “further functional decline” could possibly entail but her nursing home has sent her to emergency. She has pneumonia and a high sodium level not compatible with life. Yet, when I stand next to her and take her hand in mine, she smiles at me, displaying not an iota of distress.The mild pneumonia might not take her life, but the untreated sodium level almost certainly will. What to do? Antibiotics and fluids or not?“What would you like me to do?” I muse, hoping she will magically answer.She smiles benignly. I am torn.The doctor in the adjoining cubicle clearly doesn’t want her patient undergoing CPR. I can’t see how “saving” my own patient from death would accord her better quality of life. Each doctor is making an irrevocable decision about a patient, its enormity compounded by the fact that both patients have limited capacity to participate in the conversation.But what if the patient asked, “Doctor, if you were in my situation, what would you do?”Do doctors treat patients in the same way they would want to be treated at the end of life?Anew studysheds some light on this issue.Researchers surveyed 1,157 doctors including GPs, palliative care physicians and other medical specialists working in diverse areas including Canada, Belgium and Italy, as well as the American states of Oregon, Wisconsin and Georgia, and the Australian states of Victoria and Queensland. These communities range from being socially progressive to religiously conservative to secular, with varying laws around assisted dying.The study presented doctors with two end-of-life scenarios. In one, they have Alzheimer’s disease. They don’t recognise loved ones, refuse oral intake and are more withdrawn. In the second, they have advanced cancer not amenable to treatment. They are experiencing severe pain and agitation, have a prognosis of no more than two weeks, and are competent to make decisions. In each case, a palliative care provider and the option of inpatient hospice is available.With preferences for end-of-life decisions including CPR, hydration, tube feeding, intensifying symptom alleviation, deep sedation until death and, where legal, assisted dying, doctors were asked to rate their own preferences from “a very good option” to “not at all a good option”.Across all jurisdictions, physicians universally rejected the idea of CPR and mechanical ventilation (preferred by less than 1%), tube feeding (less than 4%) and intravenous hydration (about 20%). Of all physicians, over 90% considered it important to intensify symptom relief and just over half considered euthanasia a good or very good option. Notably, a third of physicians would consider using medications at their disposal to end their own life.There are many interesting findings (regrettably, behind a paywall) but the bottom line is that when it comes to their own end-of-life care, doctors use their lived experience of medicine to choose differently, and arguably, more wisely.This should give patients and doctors food for thought.We are living in an era of medicine that often conflates more with better, an especially vexed issue at the end of life. In my own field of oncology, despite real concerns abouttime toxicity, overtreatment is believed to be a professionally sanctioned approach. No oncologist wants to be seen to “do nothing” even if eschewing aggressive and harmful treatments in favour of quality of life is the opposite of doing nothing.But the more I look around, I can’t help thinking that oncologists are unfairly cast as the worst offenders whenevidenceof futile interventions is rife across healthcare.How do grossly impaired patients end up being tube-fed? Why are frail, elderly people attached to ventilators? Why do unconscious patients receive antibiotics in their final days? Frankly, these events happen because patients or relatives demand them, and doctors find themselves unwilling or unable to say no.As doctors, we review morbidity and mortality regularly – but we need a better way of respecting the patient voice | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreThe desire for agood deathis as universal as the fact of dying. The researchers of this study should be commended.If I were a patient, here is how I might use the study findings to help myself.Instead of directly asking my treating doctor(s) what they would do in my situation (and risk a non-answer), Iwould inquire what factors they would consider in reaching a crucial medical decision. I would acknowledge that personal preferences vary and explain that their library of experiences might deepen my understanding of what to do.As a physician, this study reminds me of the privilege of my role which gives me a sound basis for making highly consequential decisions.The question is how to use my knowledge and experience to empower my patients without blurring the line between personal bias and professional guidance. I believe this is possible by listening carefully to patients’ stated goals and including the views of their loved ones. These conversations need time and trust, which is what underpins good doctor-patient communication.End-of-life decisions are a sensitive and complex situation, but one thing is evident to me.If doctors clearly favour less aggressive measures at the end of life, their patients deserve to know why.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

On Saturday, Bobby Vylan, the frontman of the rap-punk duo Bob Vylan, chanted “death, death to the IDF” – referring to the Israel Defense Forces – from the West Holts stage at Glastonbury, and members of the crowd joined in. The performance was livestreamed by the BBC.A day earlier,the Israeli newspaper Haaretz revealedthat Israeli soldiers and officers had confessed that they had been ordered to shoot at unarmed Palestinians as they queued for aid. Last month, about 600 desperately hungry Palestinians, including many children,were killed this way.Five words on one hand. Six hundred killed on the other. Which story is dominating the front pages of British newspapers, leading news bulletins, provoking relentless push notifications by theBBCand causing the prime minister and an endless parade of frontbenchers to condemn such an outrage? It is, of course, more than anything else Vylan said, those five words. How morally lost is a society in which a chant against a genocidal foreign army provokes a political and media firestorm, but the intentionally starved, unarmed human beings being mowed down on the orders of the IDF high command do not?There is a genocide happening in Gaza: that is the consensus of genocide scholars, including those in Israel. This one word, genocide, can only go so far in conveying what is happening in Gaza. Genocide means wiping out the pillars of civilisation – from homes to schools to agriculture – and forcibly driving people from their land. It means food, water and healthcare being denied. It means entire families being wiped out by indiscriminate bombing. It means babies being burned alive and suffocating under rubble.If we must focus our fury at words, look to the genocidal statements proudly delivered by Israeli politicians. The Israeli finance minister declaring in May that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed”. Or this weekend, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir,demanding a permanent endto all aid to Gaza, which in practice means death to Palestinian civilians. These statements are underpinned by firepower and they mean actual fatalities. Britain continues to provide crucial parts to the Israeli military, which acts on these words.And that’s what this is really about: a campaign of deflection from Britain’s complicity in the crime of the century. Facilitators of genocide are presented as the morally upstanding moderates, while opponents of genocide are labelled as hateful, dangerous extremists. That’s why British citizens serving in the IDF are not under criminal investigation for war crimes committed in Gaza, while the government has begun the process ofproscribing Palestine Action, which would place it in the same legal bracket as Islamic State and violent neo-Nazis,after its activists threw paint at military planes.Avon and Somerset policehave announced a criminal investigationinto the Glastonbury performances of Bob Vylan and Kneecap. Welcome to Britain in 2025, where musicians angry at genocide are dragged through the justice system, while politicians facilitating genocide walk free. Meanwhile, the government minister Lisa Nandydelivered an outraged statementto the House of Commons about Bob Vylan and the BBC’s decision to livestream their set – deemed a better use of parliamentary time than how the people of Gaza can be saved from what the head of the Red Cross has called “worse than hell on Earth”.The BBC and Glastonbury have issued statementsdeclaring Vylan’s chant to be antisemitic. It seems to me far more offensive to conflate Jewish people as a whole with an army whose actions have led the international criminal court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister for war crimes and crimes against humanity.Bobby Vylan has just releaseda statement making clear he is opposed to “the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people”. Instead, he makes clear “death to the IDF” means “the dismantling of a violent military machine”. Amen: the IDF should be dismantled. An army that commits genocide has forfeited its right to exist. It should be replaced with a force capable of protecting the security of all people who live between the river and the sea, whatever their ethnicity or religion, which probably means an international peacekeeping force.I also believe people shouldn’t die. The war in Gaza, which has led to the murder of tens of thousands of Palestinians, has also resulted in hundreds of IDF soldiers being killed. Ask those who joined in with Vylan’s chant if they supported sending the IDF into Gaza, and you will hear a unanimous “no”. If they had been listened to, as well as preventing genocide, those Israeli soldiers would still be alive.Millions of people have watched the livestreaming of obscenities in Gaza. They expect, quite rationally, their politicians to share their outrage: instead, they note that their politicians continue to arm the perpetrators. They expect their media to hold power to account, at home and abroad: instead, they see the whitewashing of horrors. What underpinned the chant was revulsion at crimes against humanity and frustration at politicians.You really can only turn the world on its head for so long. In the end this crime is too obscene, too documented, too unapologetic to get away with. One day there will be a reckoning, and those who facilitated the annihilation of Gaza will find themselves being made to account for what they said and did, rather than those who stood against it.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And for Orbán and his nationalist party, Fidesz, the public defiance of Pride organisers, European diplomats and those of us who filled the streets in spite of threats of facial-recognition surveillance,arrests and fines has dented his strongman reputation.A general election in Hungary is slated for April 2026. In Péter Magyar, the leader of the main opposition party, Tisza, Orbán is up against his toughest political opponent since gaining power in 2010, and at present he’s doing badly. Polls from June put Orbán15 points behindMagyar. But western democracies would be wise to keep their guard up during Orbán’s laboured, last breaths in power. Boxed into a corner, he will be looking to ignite a new fight against a common enemy.We can expect a more vicious, angry assault on LGBTQ+ rights in Hungary. He will lead a louder rallying cry against European interference in the country. Orbán needs a crisis to galvanise his country behind him. This includes groups such as the far-right Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement (Hatvannégy Vármegye Ifjúsági Mozgalom, or HVIM), which led counter-protests during Pride to “defend the sanctity of traditional family values” against the “satanist” and “deviant” LGBTQ+ community.During a counter-protest on Saturday, I asked Gábor Kelemen, HVIM’s vice-president, what exactly the Hungarian values are that he’s worried will be taken from him by the LGBTQ+ community. “The traditional Hungarian values are very easy,” he answered, flanked by a dozen young men in matching T-shirts. “We are a Christian country. The family is defined by a man and a woman and children. That is it.”The protection of traditional families is a common anti-LGBTQ+ message pumped out by the government, whichcontrols roughly 90% of all media in Hungary. David Bedo, 32, is a member of Hungary’s national assembly and a founder of the liberal Momentum party. In a quiet cafe in Budapest, he described to me how he was all too familiar with Fidesz’s Russian-inspired constitutional overhauls and its propaganda machine. He is “no longer surprised with anything Orbán does”.1:52Tens of thousands march against Hungary's government for LGBT rights – videoIn March, Bedo and five other lawmakersset off smoke bombsinside the Hungarian parliament chamber while Fidesz’s supermajority flexed their control of the rule of law to ban Pride within 48 hours of the proposal being announced. Since then, new bills have been submitted to parliament, including legislation that would allow the government to monitor, penalise andpotentially ban organisationsincluding Hungarian NGOs and media outlets that receive any sort of foreign funding. If passed, this will kill off most of Hungary’s civil rights organisations and what’s left of its independent media. “So, yes, I wouldn’t be surprised if there won’t be an election,” Bedo added bluntly. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they ban Tisza and imprison Péter Magyar.”So how isHungarygetting away with it? Critics believe the European Commission should have introduced interim measures against Hungary when Fidesz passed laws restricting LGBTQ+ information in schools and the media in 2021. Far-right parties across Europe have been emboldened by the absence of firm, timely action against Hungary. LGBTQ+ communities will be the first of many threats they’ll fabricate to paint democracy as the enemy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In seven European countries, “LGBTQ propaganda” laws have been enacted or proposed, criminalising visibility and restricting discussion of LGBTQ issues. Attempts to introduce legislation excluding LGBTQ+ topics from sex education were recorded in Bulgaria, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and Turkey. In Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal, local authorities have reported “a significant increase in crimes motivated by perceived sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression”, the report noted.While contexts differ in each country, creating division remains a common tactic. Democracy invites debate, and meaningful debate ensures a range of voices and identities are heard. The appeal of authoritarianism is as much about uniting behind one shared identity as it is about attacking other identities perceived as threatening or destabilising.You don’t need to look much further than Hungary to see that once an autocratic state is set up, it’s very hard to reverse it. Allowing Orbán to undermine our fundamental rights was a mistake. If we now choose to turn a blind eye to the right’s weaponisation of LGBTQ+ rights, the gradual loss of our democratic rights will be on us.Gordon Cole-Schmidt is a freelance journalist specialising in international human rights and world affairsExplore more on these topicsHungaryOpinionLGBTQ+ rightsViktor OrbánThe far rightEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps we should build a special one for all the people we keep criminally investigating for saying, rather than doing, bad things. I’m pretty sure they have a few of those types of prisons in other countries. Although, it must be said that those are normally countries run by people we consider bad. Confusing! But look, maybe we’re becoming the sort of country where we imprison lots of people for saying awful things. I don’t …lovethis look for us, I have to say. But no doubt someone has thought it all through very, very carefully.If so, they could put the two nasty idiots from Bob Vylan in it. Obviously all of Kneecap, too. Maybe those guys would have their cell on the same landing as Lucy Connolly, thewoman who was imprisonedfor two years and seven months for a repulsive tweet in the wake of the Southport child killings. They could be joined by whoever at theBBC didn’t pull the Glastonbury live streamon Saturday after Bob Vylan started their repulsive chants, given that Conservative frontbencher Chris Philp is now officially calling for thecorporation to be “urgently” investigated. I see Chris is also calling for the BBC to be prosecuted – so I guess he’s already done the police investigation for them, and all at the same time as absolutely aceing his brief as shadow home secretary for where-are-they-now political outfit the Conservative party.In terms of Spewing Hate Into The Nation’s Living RoomsTM, it must be said that the footage of Bob Vylan’s offending set is still embedded into multiple stories on the MailOnline website, all containing an exhortation to “watch the full video”. Should whoever is leaving the videos up on MailOnline also be investigated and prosecuted? Perhaps Chris Philp could adjudicate. Either way, let’s keep a cell or five for them in the special new prison. After all, why on earth shouldn’t we imprison a few journalists, too? In for a penny, and so on.Listen closely to the Kneecap furore. You’ll hear hypocrisy from all sides | Dorian LynskeyRead moreNeedless to say, embattled prime ministerKeir Starmer has made timeto have plenty of official views not just on the behaviour of the two bands, but on any future decisions to book them. If all you have is a hammer, everything is a nail – and if your big job before politics was being director of public prosecutions, then I’m sure everything looks like a prosecutable offence.It certainly did to the prime minister after last summer’s riots in the wake of the Southport murders, when Starmer seemed to relish the response happening the best way he knew how: by rushing it through the courts. Connolly was one of those prosecuted, in her case for a manifestly revolting and racist but also clearly tossed-off post responding to a false rumour the killer was an asylum seeker, saying people could set fire to asylum hotels “for all I care”. She admitted inciting racial hatred in court, but has since becomesomething of a cause celebrefor the fact that she is a mother with an otherwise clean record (and one who had lost a young child herself), and that she has got a harsher sentence for this tweet that she later deleted than some convicted rapists.I wrotein the immediate wake of the riots that it was clear that something big had happened in the UK – though it wasn’t yet precisely clear what. Unfortunately, the prime minister seemed to think it was fairly simple. “Let me also say to large social media companies and those who run them,”he said, albeit to some reporters instead, “violent disorder clearly whipped up online: that is also a crime. It’s happening on your premises, and the law must be upheld everywhere.”Sadiq Khan seemed to thinkit was something to do with the Online Safety Act not being “fit for purpose”.View image in fullscreenLucy Connolly was jailed as a result of her tweet about asylum-seekers in the wake of last summer’s Southport murders.Photograph: Northamptonshire Police/PAIn more successful hot takes, it was also the moment that Elon Musk test-drove his epithet “two-tier Keir”. That one has stuck, and it will stick even harder if, for example, sublebrity band Bob Vylan don’t get the book thrown at them in the same way that no-mark Lucy Connolly did. To be clear, I don’t think any of the aforementioned lot ought to be in prison, however vile and unacceptable their behaviour was. But if you don’t deal with them in pretty much the same way, then people are going to be talking far more loudly about two-tier justice again.This type of talk has already reached all the way into the Oval Office where, in February, vice-presidentJD Vance suggested to Starmerthat the UK had a free speech problem. You might have seen that Bob Vylan have just promptlyhad their US visas revokedfor what the deputy secretary of state called “their hateful tirade”. But we can’t expect consistency from the Trump administration.What we expect of our own country is infinitely more important. I used to think masses of legislation around what horrible things people could or couldn’t say was a niche-application civilisational advance, but I have changed my view, and now fear we are sleepwalking towards a society where half the people will think certain incarcerated miscreants are political prisoners, and the other half will think a different bunch of incarcerated miscreants are political prisoners. I am very much for living in a country where we don’t think we have political prisoners at all. Getting there isn’t simple – but stopping travelling in the wrong direction would be a good start.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That war is over – it seems ours will never endHassan Abo QamarFor two years, we’ve waited for a final ceasefire that has never come. Peace will be delayed as long as our lives are considered disposableTue 1 Jul 2025 06.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 06.23 EDTShareLast Tuesday night, Donald Trump announced on social media that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire, ending what he called a “12-day war”. It was the second war this year, after India and Pakistan’s four-day conflict, tostart and end under Trump’s watch. They followed another, earlier conflict betweenLebanon and Israelduring President Joe Biden’s term.Here in Gaza, all eyes were fixed on the Iran-Israel conflict. Even cut off from the internet, people found ways to follow the news – on the radio, or by catching weak phone signals by climbing to high rooftops or walking near the sea, or just by staying up all night watching the sky, where some of the missiles launched from Iran could be seen from Gaza. Many wondered if Trump, the man who once promised to stop “endless wars”, would seize the moment to stop not only war on Iran but also the genocide in Gaza.For 12 days, we finally witnessed a real power in the world enter a war with Israel, the same country that has starved us, bombed us and killed us. But does that really make any difference for us in Gaza? Even if Israel were bombed byIranuntil the last day of our lives, nothing would bring back our beloved ones, our homes, our warm city.Two years of our lives have passed like decades. But in just 12 days, that war was over. Trump declared the strikes a complete success against a “nuclear threat”, even asinternational inspectors disagreed. The assault on Iran has ended. The assault on Gaza, the tiny coastal strip with no army and no air force, hasn’t.Trump has brought no change for us. No relief. Only escalation. In just six months, he has failed – or rather, never even tried – to end the war in Gaza. On the contrary, he has become one of its main enablers, sending Israel all the weapons it needs to keep it going. And yet, he offersstatements of optimism, claiming that “I think great progress is being made on Gaza” and that his special envoy Steve Witkoff had told him “Gaza is very close.”Similar optimism was expressed one month ago, when Witkoff spoke of having “very good feelings” about the chances for reaching a temporary ceasefire. A ceasefire that, ultimately, never materialised.I remember the early months of the war when my little sister asked: “Why do their wars end so quickly? Why isGazathe exception?” These questions echo through every household in Gaza. Back then, we believed it was just a matter of time; that international law would step in. But over more than 600 days we have seen the same pattern repeat again and again – destruction, death, then negotiations, ceasefire talks, “breakthroughs”, then more deaths. Delegations fly to Doha and return empty-handed. This isn’t because peace is impossible. This is because the genocide in Gaza doesn’t inflict real political or economic costs on those in power. Unlike Iran, Gaza poses no strategic threat; it cannot block trade routes such as the strait of Hormuz, nor does it have the means to inflict meaningful damage on Israel. The international pressure is weak, mostly limited to statements rather than sanctions, and thus easily ignored.For Israel’s leadership, peace in Gaza simply isn’t profitable. In fact, continued assault serves political interests, especially those of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who isdoing everything he canto avoid early elections while he faces corruption charges, which he denies.We’ve come to understand the bitter truth: our lives are conditional. Our dreams, our futures – all worthless unless they serve geopolitical interests. Our suffering is tolerated. Our justice, indefinitely delayed.Famine and malnutrition are now widespread. Electricity has been cut for nearly two years. Generations of students have lost access to education. Municipalities have collapsed. The healthcare system is overwhelmed. Daily life has disintegrated. Gaza’s streets, once calm, are now haunted by fear. Bombings are no longer the only threat: at night, people face theft, assault or even murder. Lawlessness is growing. Gangs operate openly. Israel shows no interest in restoring order. Chaos serves it better.Look into people’s eyes. In everyone, from the smallest child to the oldest grandparent, you’ll see blank stares, hollow gazes. Eyes stripped of light. Waiting. Not necessarily for death, but for something to end.Gaza longs for what all people long for – to breathe, to live, for peace. Butrealpeace cannot be declared from podiums while bombs fall from planes. It cannot be promised in speeches while crossings stay closed. It cannot exist without an immediate, unbroken ceasefire.A ceasefire that would allow Gaza’s sky at sunset to be dotted with children’s kites floating gently over the rubble. For a moment, they would watch them fly and think: maybe not everything up there means death. Maybe, just maybe, there’s an angel, too.All we want is what all people want: for this nightmare to end. For warplanes to leave. For tents to become safe, warm homes again. For the soft coastal breeze to blow away the smell of blood.And maybe justice is not scheduled for today.But I still believe: one day, we will see it.Hassan Abo Qamar is a Palestinian writer and journalist based in GazaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s how we rescue pop in BritainEamonn FordeThanks to streaming, the charts are dominated by albums from years ago. Australia has shown how to give new artists a chanceTue 1 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 12.46 EDTShareLooking at theTop 40 albumsin the UK this week, it is clear that the charts have become a mausoleum. There are solid showings from Oasis (a compilation album originally released in 2010 and two studio albums from 1994 and 1995), Fleetwood Mac (a compilation from 2018 and a studio album from 1977), Abba (1992), Michael Jackson (2005), Elton John (2017) and Eminem (2005). A quarter of the UK’s Top 40 albums were originally releasedover a decade ago.Are our music tastes becoming increasingly nostalgic? The number of people who turned out to see Rod Stewart playing the legends slot at Glastonbury certainly suggests that. But there’s also another possibility: music streaming is causing the charts to spiral backwards into the past.The UK charts date back to 1952, when the New Musical Express, now known as NME, would phone a handful of record shops to ask what was selling best. Since then it’s become more professional: the Official Charts Company (OCC) took over the charts in the 1990s, and as of 2004,it began to factor in download sales. The biggest transformation arrived in 2014, when streaming data started to be included in chart ratings. Though streaming arguably saved the record business (artists and songwriters arguethey are not seeing much of that upside), it also suffocated the charts.Part of this is becauseUK chartstoday reflect two very different dynamics: mega-acts with phenomenal streaming play counts that keep on snowballing (Sabrina Carpenter or Ed Sheeran, for example), alongside acts who can marshal their fans to buy a physical version of the album on release week, charting high but plummeting the next week (basically every indie band). As they currently exist, the charts paper over this unholy bifurcation, on the one hand measuring listens and on the other measuring purchases.The problem lies in trying to perfect a formula for what the OCC calls “album stream” units. This involves counting up the 16 most-streamed tracks from any album and dividing that by 1,000, the result being the “same” as a CD, LP or download sale of that album. But since the data that the OCC receives from retailers and streaming servicesisn’t accurate enoughto tell whether someone has played Bohemian Rhapsody on Queen’s Greatest Hits album, say, or from the studio album where it first appeared, it means that the individual track streams count towards the chart position of entire albums – so Queen’s Greatest Hits moves up the charts, even if people have only been listening to one particular track.Streaming has made listening more chaotic and less structured. Rather than just listening to a single album from start to finish, we encounter individual songs through playlists and algorithmic recommendations. Meanwhile, since every song is available to listen to, everything can theoretically count towards the charts at any time. This was not always the case. In 1994, Wet Wet Wet’s cover of Love Is All Around was at No 1 in the UK for 15 consecutive weeks. It might have been longer,but the band and their label stopped manufacturing copies to kill demand, fearing the song had become too popular and ubiquitous. That was possible in the days when only physical sales counted towards the charts.The OCC is in a tricky position. It has to please both the record companies and the retailers and streaming services that fund it, which have very different objectives. There has always been a precarious relationship of mutual dependence and distrust between record labels and music retailers, and the OCC’s chart committee is made up of both sides. The record companies tend to favour fewer restrictions on how they market and promote records, alongside boundless support for their priority releases; the retailers and streamers, on paper at least, want less label interference in how they pick what to support. Sometimes they find consensus; other times they do not.Yet the doldrums of the UK album charts isn’t inevitable. The UKsingles chartis more fluid, with a complex mix of risers, fallers, non-movers and new entries. Most tracks on this week’s singles charts were relatively new (with the exception of Black Eyed Peas’ Rock That Body at No 31, which was originally released in 2010). It’s fair to say that the listlessness of the UK charts is very much an album charts problem. Singles charts aren’t weighed down with records from generations ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is, however, a way forward. TheAustralian Recording Industry Association (ARIA)is doing something about its music charts – and the UK should take note. From September, its main album and singles charts will only include music released in the past two years, with a separate chart quarantining all the timeworn releases.There are exceptions for those catalogue tracks that have a second chart life from out of nowhere, perhaps because they’ve gone viral on TikTok. So long as they’ve not been anywhere in the Top 100 for the past decade, they can still appear on the charts – but they can’t stay there for ever.It is a long overdue corrective and will hopefully be something the UK chart can learn from if it is to avoid collapsing into irrelevance. The OCC already publishesa multitude of charts by genre, so separating out the fresh from the greying will not be a stretch. Like the weather, talking about the charts was once a collective British pastime. But in becoming sluggish and shackled by the past, the charts risk being the two things that pop music itself should never be: old and boring.Eamonn Forde is a music business and technology journalistExplore more on these topicsUK chartsOpinionPop and rockMusic industrycommentShareReuse this content"

The company tells me it plans to move in a different direction. That dreaded phrase marks the end of 16 remarkable years, during which the trust sponsored some of the most influential research into inequality and its financial causes.Aberdeen is a wealth management and investment company. I admired its willingness to fund research not in its own immediate interest, but for the sake of social improvement, as a sign that decent capitalism was possible. Now that’s over. The mood has changed. Wildfires started by President Trump are engulfing global companies as his administration attempts tobar asset and retirement plan managersfrom considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investment decisions and targets private sector diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiativeswith executive orders. Companies doing good are at risk. I ask Aberdeen if that’s why it has shut down the trust. It denies it strongly, saying it is just a “natural evolution”.Expect an explosive backlash. Just look at the list of research organisations it has previously given funding to but is now casting off: the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the Resolution Foundation, the Royal United Services Institute, Bright Blue, the New Economics Foundation, the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation (CenTax), the Child Poverty Action Group, the High Pay Centre and Transport for All. It has also funded funeral poverty research by Quaker Social Action and consumer research by Which?. The trust has £3.6m of grants promised, in a field where small sums for social research projects can profoundly affect policy and politics. Paul Johnson, the outgoing IFS director, says this money is “a crucial part of the UK’s research funding infrastructure focused on improving the financial security of those on lower incomes”. He talks ruefully of billions of pounds for scientific research but a pittance for social research. “We have no Large Hadron Colliders.”Aberdeen should beware the swathe of distinguished economists, researchers, academics, public servants, public thinkers and charitable entrepreneurs it has unthinkingly cut off in this political assault. The trust was founded in 2009, using unclaimed assets after the demutualisation of Standard Life, which later merged withAberdeen Asset Management. Last week, its website shut down instantly, with the misleading notice “Please bear with us and we will aim to resume normal service as quickly as we can”. There will be no normal service.David Norgrove, the summarily sacked chair, is not going quietly. Neither is he someone to be treated so high-handedly. He is a former chair of the UK Statistics Authority, the Pensions Regulator, the Low Pay Commission, the M&S pension fund, the Family Justice Review and more. He is outraged at how the trust was cancelled in a day. “Shoddy behaviour,” he says to me, then adds: “Abrupt, rude, ungracious.” This will, he says, “be damaging to them”.Aberdeen did lose£5bn in net outflowsin the first quarter of this year – its share price has somewhat revived since – but says all the funds will still go to charity. I ask if there is a guarantee that the latest £3.6m of grant funding letters will be honoured. The reply is weaselly: “The various funding relationships will be under review and that will include looking at what contractual commitments are in place, so it’s too early to be definitive.” CenTax is a grant recipient left in limbo over the future of its promised three years of funding. This week the trust was about to start on another £2m round: due for grants were the Living Pension Foundation, to sign up 500 companies to join Aviva, L&G and others pledging more livable pensions. The Child Poverty Action Group will now get no funds for an annual forensic review of child poverty strategy, nor will the High Pay Centre receive money for research into remuneration committees that focuses on entire workforces, not just top executives.Why is Aberdeen trashing its reputation? Because times have changed. Doing good is not fashionable in the business world. Johnson says: “I presume some of the trust’s funding is not compatible with Aberdeen. It’s an overreaction to our research on pension tax relief, or the Resolution Foundation’s work in wealth tax reliefs.” Most social research is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Nuffield Foundation, but he says after the trust, there are “no significant others”. Aberdeen says the only reason for the change is to divert its funds to a conventional charitable foundation that supports individuals, such as young unemployed people – although this is funding that won’t lead to a larger questioning of social, financial or tax systems.The company is already famous for idiocy – it abolished the Es in its name in 2021 to become the unpronounceable “Abrdn”, claiming it was a “modern, agile, digitally-enabled brand”.Mocked for “irritable vowel syndrome”, it joined disaster rebrands such as Royal Mail’s Consignia and PwC Consulting’s Monday. It makes you question any decisions their boards make.But this is serious. It’s a symptom of darkening business attitudes.Research this month showsthat 56% of senior financial professionals in the UK now “believe their leadership will place less focus on ESG principles over the next five years”. WPP, one of the largest media companies in the world,removed all mentions of DEIfrom its latest annual report. Research by the Observer found that mentions of ESGdeclined by 22%in last year’s annual reports from FTSE 100 companies. Amazon is scaling back its DEI policy, calling this civilisational regression an “evolution”.Former trustees suggest Aberdeen may have had complaints from clients who hate research about poverty and wealth that exposes unjust tax reliefs for the rich. When I ask, its press officer does admit he sometimes has to tell journalists from the Telegraph and others that Aberdeen Group plc is not responsible for the research its trust may fund: every trust-funded report has a disclaimer saying the trust is entirely independent of the company. This turns out, sadly, not to be true, since Aberdeen can cancel it at whim.This week will mark the launch in Westminster of a trust-funded two-year commission into pensions by the IFS, with the former minister David Gauke chairing its advisory committee and Torsten Bell, the pensions minister and former head of the Resolution Foundation, speaking. The chair of Aberdeen Group, Douglas Flint, who is due to attend, may find himself less in favour than when he was invited to join Labour’s City advisers as part of a financial services review. He lobbies forless regulation of banks, calling the post-financial-crash restrictions ”disproportionate”. If I were him, I wouldn’t dare turn up.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsResearch fundingOpinionAberdeen Asset ManagementcommentShareReuse this content"

After Britain, France had thesecond biggest colonial empire.We know that 1.38 million peoplewere deportedin at least 4,220 documentedFrench slave trade expeditions. Yet the stories of the lives of those people are almost entirely absent from the French collective imagination.Growing up in France, the only images of this crime against humanity I ever saw on screen were in US-made films. I learned about it from the 1970s TV series Roots and from Steven Spielberg’s movie Amistad. Today in France, Hollywood films such as12 Years a SlaveorDjango Unchainedare still the references when it comes to depicting the horrors experienced by enslaved people.Despite the efforts of French film-makers with personal histories rooted in slavery – such asGuadeloupean Christian Lara(Vivre Libre ou Mourir, 1980, Bitter Sugar, 1998) or Martinican Guy Deslauriers (Middle Passage,2000) – slavery as a French phenomenon remains almost invisible on our screens. Paradoxically, the first mainstream and commercially successful film set in the context of French Caribbean enslavement (Case Départ, 2011) was a comedy that failed to engage with the structural nature of the oppression it depicted.So when I finally got to see a story on the big screen about the victims of French slavery, set in the French colonies, the effect was profoundly moving. The film-maker Simon Moutaïrou told me when Iinterviewed himlast year aboutNo Chains No Masters: “As a young cinephile, I was always struck by the absence of this subject – slavery,marronage– in French cinema.”For the first time in French film, the story of the victims of slavery in the 18th century – onIsle de France(now Mauritius) in the Indian Ocean, then a possession of the French crown – was being told. Beyond its polished aesthetic, which portrays Black bodies in an unusually sublime way, the director’s decision to focus onmarronage– the escape of enslaved people from being their oppressors’ property – the inclusion of African languages such as Wolof and the addition of a spiritual dimension all give this film a unique tone.Only this year, a biopic was at last dedicated to a monumental figure, one who should be a source of French national pride.With Fanon, the Guadeloupean film-maker Jean-Claude Barny (director ofTropiques Amers, a pioneering 2007 TV miniseries on slavery in Martinique) brings his signature cinematic talent to the extraordinary story ofFrantz Fanon.View image in fullscreenZion (2025) is a gripping thriller set in Guadeloupe.Photograph: Kiss FilmsFanon, a Martinican-born psychiatrist, wrote about the psychological effects of colonialism – drawing from his experience as a caregiver in Algeria – but he also walked the walk.He joined the Algerian revolution against France and became a spokesperson for the FLN (National Liberation Front). Fanon died in 1961, a year before Algeria’s liberation in 1962 – but in just two books, he managed to inspire liberation and anti-colonial movements across the world. And yet, in France, not a single school bears his name. In 2019, the city council in Bordeaux – a city deeply mired in the legacy of slavery, colonisation and the exploitation of Martinique and its people – approved a proposal to name an alley after Fanon, but the mayor, Alain Juppé, a former prime minister,overturned the initiative.Barny’smoving filmbegins with Fanon’s arrival in Algeria, and traces the painful journey of a psychiatrist who is committed, body and soul, to a country fighting to free itself from colonial rule. The film creates a powerful resonance between two territories – Fanon’s native Martinique, shaped by slavery, and Algeria, brutallyinvaded and suppressedby French troops in 1830.Despite facing anti-Blackness, Fanon took notes throughout his mission, documenting with surgical precision the colonial situation that would give rise to his most powerful work:The Wretched of the Earth. The film does not omit the valuable contribution of Fanon’s wife,Josie Fanon, as it captures the early stirrings of revolution. It immerses us in the weight and torment of oppression – palpable and ever-present. The daily reality of deadly, senseless repression is laid bare in its rawest brutality. But, as Fanon’s words – woven in to the very structure of the film –remind us: “The colonised is dominated but not domesticated.”The effects of slavery and colonialism are still visible in former colonies that are now full French departments and suffer from the same glaring abandonment. In Guadeloupe,staggeringly high unemploymenthas left many young people in a state of hopelessness and disarray.Nelson Foix, a Guadeloupean film-maker, has dedicated his new filmZionto the island’s youth, drawn to delinquency in a place where opportunities are scarce. In a gripping thriller shot in Creole and backed by an entirely local production – including the Paris-based producerLaurence Lascary, who is of Guadeloupean heritage – Foix paints a stark portrait of an island still caught in a colonial dynamic.Under the guise of a gangster story – with guns and high-speed chases – Zion lays bare the high cost of living, constant water shortages, social uprisings, police repressionand thestate-enabledpoisoningof the land witha toxic pesticide called chlordecone, used on banana plantations.All of it is infused with a mysticism that blends Catholicism and ancestral beliefs, resulting in a dazzling cinematic experience.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These films are still pushed to the margins of a public space that is clearly not ready to make room for overdue and compelling narratives.Yet, despite a limited theatrical release – and suggestions of a “boycott” by some cinemas – the remarkable Fanon is enjoying the public success it deserves.As for Moutaïrou, he cast two white film stars – Camille Cottin (known for the international TV hit Call My Agent) and Benoît Magimel – in supporting roles, yet media coverage of this cinematic event has been astonishingly minimal. According to the film-maker, social media has allowed the film tofind its audience.Afterbreaking box-office recordsin the French Antilles before its release in mainland France, Zion has emerged as thesurprise hit of the year. For once, the French Caribbean islands are shown without the usual emphasis on postcard-perfect scenery.While colonial history remains a blind spot for French cinema, audiences are more than ready to face up to it– and there’s no shortage of talent to make that happen.Rokhaya Diallo is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionSlaveryColonialismEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

AsUSAIDwas formally shut down on Monday, a once-in-a-decade development financing conference was kicking off in Seville. But while initially intended to move the world closer to its ambitious 2030 sustainable development goals, it now looks more like an attempt to prevent a reversal of the progress already made.A studypublished in the Lancetpredicted that Donald Trump’s aid cuts could claim more than 14 million lives by 2030, a third of them among children. For many poor countries, the scale of the shock would be similar to that of a major war, the authors found. More than four-fifths of the US agency’s programmes have been cut, with surviving projects folded into the state department.The US was by far the world’s largest donor to global development – though its contributions were a fraction of the G7 target of 0.7% of GDP. Yet the damage does not end there. Its move encouraged others to follow suit. The UK, Germany and France are slashing their aid budgets to spend more on defence. Oxfam says that the collective retrenchment by G7 nations isthe biggest aid cut since 1960, with spending 26% lower in 2026 than it was last year. Don’t expect China or the Gulf states to fill this gaping hole.It is not just grim news for aid recipients. It bodes ill for all. It would be naive to imagine that aid is a high‑mindedly altruistic endeavour. Just as conflict breeds hunger and poverty, so injustice and deprivation breed instability and a more dangerous world. Slashing health budgets also increases the risks of another global pandemic.Developing countries hoped that the UN- and Spanish-hosted International Conference on Financing for Development would at least see a willingness to tackle an international financial system stacked against the global majority. Instead, the US, UK, EU and others shamefullyacted as blockers, watering down the language on a UN intergovernmental process to tackle the debt crisis. The US reportedly proposed 400 amendments across a multitude of issues to the conference’s outcome document beforepulling outentirely. Others will need to be held to their too-limited commitments.More thantwo-fifths of the global populationlive in low income countries whichare in debt distress or close to it. Many poor African nations are spending more on debt financing than they do on health or education. Contrary to popular perception – and any sense of justice and decency – wealth is flowing from them to developed nations. The UN says that servicing debt cost developing countries $847bn last year, rising to $947bn this year.Yet developed countries are choosing to shore up an unfair global financial system. The keenness of the UK and others to focus on private sector‑oriented solutions looks like better news for the City than developing nations. The promise that private finance would turn “billions to trillions” was enthusiastically promoted a decade ago, yet largely failed to materialise.Despite the enduring inequality, the last few decades saw extraordinary progress in areas such as cuttingchild mortality. For all their flaws, USAID-funded programmes alonesaved almost 92 million livesover 20 years. We know that remarkable leaps in human wellbeing are possible. We will all regret it if, in this time of conflict and crisis, we slam the door shut on such advances and block out the call of justice.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As Mountainhead takes him into new territory, he talks about his nuanced view of the world’s richest man – and why a bonnet drama may be nextTue 1 Jul 2025 11.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 16.54 EDTShareWhen he gets to his London office on the morning this piece is published,Jesse Armstrongwill read it in print, or not at all. Though the building has wifi, he doesn’t use it. “If you’re a procrastinator, which most writers are, it’s just a killer.” Online rabbit holes swallow whole days. “In the end, it’s better to be left with the inadequacies of your thoughts.” He gives himself a mock pep talk. “‘It’s just you and me now, brain.’”Today, the showrunner of Succession and co-creator of Peep Show is back at home, in walking distance of his workspace. He could be any London dad: 54, salt-and-pepper beard, summer striped T-shirt. But staying offline could feel like a statement too, given Armstrong is also the writer-director ofMountainhead, a film about tech bros. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Open AI’s Sam Altman, guru financiers Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen: all these and more are mixed up in the movie’s characters, sharing a comic hang in a ski mansion. Outside, an AI launched by one of the group has sparked global chaos. Inside, there is snippy friction about the intra-billionaire pecking order.It must be delightful to really believe it’s all going to be fine, that AI’s going to cure cancerMountainhead feels like a pulled-back curtain. But Armstrong also resisted another rabbit hole: spending time in Silicon Valley for research. He tried that kind of thing before. Contrary to rumour,Successionnever did involve backdoor chats with the children of Rupert Murdoch. Once the show became a phenomenon, though, he did meet with masters of finance and corporate media, picking their brains for insights at luxe New York restaurants. “And they’d be charismatic, and namedrop the 20 most famous people in the world, and I’d feel this buzz of excitement by association. Then later I’d look at my notes, and what they’d actually said read like complete inane bullshit. ‘Make the move!’ ‘Be the balls!’”View image in fullscreenSki mansion schemers … from left, Cory Michael Smith, Steve Carell, Ramy Youssef and Jason Schwartzman in Mountainhead.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All Rights Reserved.So Armstrong returned to his office and, more generally, his kind. “I’m a writer,” he says, “and a writer type. And I’m happy with other writer types.” In America, when Succession exploded, you could sense an assumption the mind behind it must be an English Aaron Sorkin: a slick character as glamorous as the world he wrote about. Instead, here was the dry figure who compares making Mountainhead to an early job at budget supermarket Kwik Save. (Both, he says, boiled down to managing workload.)Rather than stalk Sam Altman, he read biographies and hoovered up podcasts. Amid the oligarchs’ tales of favourite Roman emperors, he kept finding a common thread: a wilful positivity about their own effect on the world. “And it must be delightful to really believe, ‘You know what? It’s going to befine. AI’s going to cure cancer, and don’t worry about burning up the planet powering the AI to do it, because we’ll just fix that too.’”Part of the trick, he says, is perspective. At a certain level, money and power give life the feel of an eternal view from a private plane. “Whereas reality is standing in the road, dodging cars, thinking ‘Oh God! This is fucking terrifying!’”Success and Succession have not made Armstrong an optimist. But they did give him the professional heft to direct Mountainhead as well as write it, and to do so at unprecedented pace. Film and TV move achingly slowly; it was last November that he decided he wanted to make a movie about the junction of AI, crypto and libertarian politics. By May, he was preparing for it to come out.He says now he wanted Mountainhead to be “a bobsleigh run. Short, and slightly bitter, and once you’re on, you’re on.” His voice quickens recalling a first meeting with Steve Carell, who he wanted to play Randall, “the group’s dark money Gandalf”. This was January. Without a script, Armstrong could only tell the actor the story he’d loosely planned. Carell sat in silence. “I thought, ‘Well, this has gone very badly.’” Then he said yes. “At which point it was like, ‘Fuck. This is actually going to happen. Now I have to write it.’”View image in fullscreenCocooned world … Succession.Photograph: Home Box Office/Graeme HunterBy March, the film was being shot in a 21,000 sq ft mansion in Deer Valley, Utah, then on the market for $65m. Carell aside, the cast included Cory Michael Smith, Ramy Youssef and Jason Schwartzman. For Armstrong, directing his first feature on a berserk turnaround was made easier by a deep fondness for actors. Standing in front of a camera, he says, paralyses him with self-consciousness. “So I honestly find what they do magical.”His own lack of talent as a performer proved important to the younger Armstrong. Between 1995 and 1997, he worked as an assistant to Labour MP Doug Henderson. It was an interesting time to have the job, with Tony Blair about to enter Downing Street. Is there a Sliding Doors world where a rising star assistant becomes an MP himself? One where, by now, Jesse Armstrong is home secretary?He shakes his head for several seconds. “I just wasn’t good at the job. Fundamentally, I didn’t understand politics.” He knows it sounds odd, having later written for insidery Westminster comedy The Thick of It. “But I couldn’t do the acting. I didn’t get it. I always thought like a writer, so in meetings where I should have been building my career, I’d just be thinking, ‘That’sweird.That’sfunny. Why did you saythat?’” (Armstrong once wrote for the Guardianabout a meeting with then Conservative minister Ann Widdecombe, in which she sat under two posters: one a lurid anti-abortion message, the other Garfield.)You can see Super Hans arriving at Mountainhead on a scooter, delivering the ketamineInstead, he segued into comedy, and soon after Peep Show, the beloved squirm of a sitcom co-written with Sam Bain. At first glance, Succession is the obvious prequel to Mountainhead, a former newspaper empire giving way to tech superpower. But Armstrong sees a closer link between his new film and Peep Show: “Because it’s about men, and male hierarchies, and the pathos of men trying to connect.”He is tickled by the thought of his own story world, in which characters from different projects collide. “You can see Super Hans arriving at Mountainhead on a scooter, delivering the ketamine.” Then he pauses, suddenly anxious. Could he make sure I’ll mention Bain if I talk about Peep Show? “Because it was always Sam’s show as well.” And Hans owed so much to actor Matt King too, he says, “and then, of course, there’s David Mitchell and Robert Webb.”Mountainhead review – tech bros face off in Jesse Armstrong’s post-Succession uber-wealth satireRead moreShould Armstrong ever make an Oscar acceptance speech, we will be there a while. Making sure due credit is given is of a piece with his near-pathological modesty. (He is a keen footballer. Which position? “Terrible.”) Being fair-minded matters too. He adds a postscript to his memory of leaving Westminster. “I’d also say I don’t in any way feel superior to people who do make a career in politics. I still believe we need good, professional politicians.”Turning back to Mountainhead, his even-handedness reaches a kind of event horizon. Armstrong, it transpires, feels sorry for Elon Musk. “Musk has done huge damage in the world, particularly with Doge, but I have a lot of sympathy for him.”The owner of X was brutally bullied as a schoolboy and according to a 2023 biography, had a difficult relationship with his father. “This is a traumatised human being,” says Armstrong. Still, not every bullied child ends up making apparent Nazi salutes onstage. “Yeah. That wasn’t great.”View image in fullscreenIvory tower … with Steve Carell on the Mountainhead shoot.Photograph: Macall Polay/PRBut there are other sides to Armstrong. For all the hints of bumble and awkwardness, he has also had the discipline to build a stellar career. And the more measured he is in person, the more Mountainhead feels like the work of a grinning Id, rising up to take a scalpel to his subjects, with their pretensions to philosophy, and dark indifference to life. (“I’m so excited about these atrocities,” a character beams as the world goes violently awry.) But his sympathy has its limits. “I do think the cocoon they’re in makes it hard for them to remember other people are actually real. But they’ve also been quick to give up trying. And some definitely feel the superior person shouldn’t have to try anyway.”More to the point, though, Armstrong finds the tech moguls funny. Much of the grimness of a Musk or Thiel is also brilliantly ridiculous: the epic lack of self-knowledge, the thinness of skin. Having studied them as he has, would he expect his real-life models to be enraged by the film?“Oh no. They’d instantly dismantle it in a way that would be 50% completely fair, and 50% totally facile. But they wouldn’t see any truth to it.”Still, Mountainhead is something very rare: a movie that feels as contemporary as TikTok. For Armstrong, after Succession and now this, you might think stories about the moment had become addictive. He frowns. Is a period piece next, in fact? Victorian bonnets? “Maybe. Genuinely maybe. Because I’m not actually that drawn to ripped-from-the-headlines ideas.” The frown deepens. “Am I not? I don’t know. I’m losing faith in my own answer, because I evidently am. I mean, I’m not going to claim I don’t like writing about right now. But honestly, at the same time – I’d be pleased to get out of it.”Mountainhead is available to own digitally nowExplore more on these topicsMountainheadJesse ArmstrongSuccessionTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

There are various high-up platforms around the site, and of course there are the hills that give a view down into the valley where the festival nestles. But for much of the weekend you are in a crowd, looking up. Guardian photographer David Levene therefore used an eight metre-high “monopod” – a sort of highly stable pole with his camera stuck on top – to create elevation and give us a better sense of the scale of the crowds.View image in fullscreenPennards Hill campgroundPhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianView image in fullscreenPennards Hill campgroundPhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianI wanted to get a slightly different viewpoint of the things that have become very familiar to our readersDavid LeveneThe crowds pack in tightly during the big stage events, such as Rod Stewart on Sunday afternoon, which was many festivalgoers’ main event of the weekend – even if the Guardian gave it a mixed review.View image in fullscreenFans watch Rod Stewart on the Pyramid stagePhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianView image in fullscreenThe audience during Wolf Alice on the Other stagePhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe various routes through the festival remain busy at all hours, and can be disorienting as people follow the crowds or a map.

Now, 20 years on, Hicks is performing her beloved jazz standards on stage – and remembering those who saved her lifeEmine SanerTue 1 Jul 2025 10.34 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareWhen Gill Hicks takes to the stage, she says with a small laugh that she hopes she can get through just the opening number, “without breaking down in a heap”. It will be emotional. Wryly titled Still Alive (and Kicking), the show is Hicks’s own way to mark the 20th anniversary of the suicide bombings on London’s public transport that killed 52 people, and injured more than 700 – Hicks, a survivor, lost both her legs. In her show, she weaves her story of survival and resilience around singing the jazz standards she has always loved.She has already performed a version of it in Australia, where she now lives, but for its London outing she hopes around 20 members of the medical and emergency teams who attended that day will be in the audience. “They are extraordinary,” she says, “and their actions not only saved my life that morning, but I honestly believe they have saved me every single day since.”After using her scarf as a tourniquet around what was left of her legs, Hicks made what she describes as a contractThat July morning, Hicks was on her way to work when one of the four suicide bombers who targeted London detonated his bomb in her tube carriage, somewhere between King’s Cross and Russell Square. Hicks is believed to have been the last survivor pulled from the wreckage some 40 minutes later, her injuries so bad that when she arrived at hospital she was simply labelled: “One unknown, estimated female”.Before that, lying in the dark smoke-filled carriage, having used her scarf as a tourniquet around what was left of her legs to stop the bleeding, Hicks remembers making what she describes as a contract. She would get the chance to live, and she would make it count. “That’s really helped me continue to get up every day regardless of the situation I’m in. There’s a purpose and an absolute sense that there’s things to be done that help remind us of our shared humanity.”View image in fullscreenHeld with love and intention for survival … Hicks and PC Andy Maxwell, who came to her aid.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAShe had lived in London for more than 20 years, working in architecture and design, then after the bombings dedicating her time to organisations that promoted peace, before moving to Australia in 2013, the same year she had her daughter. The last time Hicks came to London was in 2015 to commemorate 10 years since the bombings. But she doesn’t associate the city with trauma. That has been a conscious choice, she says. “That’s the one power that we all have, to be able to choose how we react and how we respond. Part of the honour of life for me is constantly choosing to live from a place of gratitude and positivity.”Twenty years, she says, is long enough to consider the depth of the impact on her. “With the nature of my disability, I’m never detached from what’s happened,” she says. Forgiveness hasn’t felt necessary, or even possible given the man who blew up that tube carriage died in the blast, “so he’s taken away this exchange. It’s also made me feel I don’t have to really consider my feelings about him. I have to instead focus on what I do with my life, and how do I honour my life?” She is also always aware of those who didn’t come home that day.When something like this happens, it’s so easy to lose yourself, because your identity is skewedThe idea of “healing” or “recovery” is difficult – “My legs won’t grow back. I live in quite a lot of constant pain” – but for Hicks, the arts have been part of reclaiming her sense of self. She was a jazz musician before the bombings, but she never thought she would be able to sing or perform again. Her injuries left her with hearing loss, and one functioning lung. “It took me months to learn how to speak again,” she says. “When something like this type of life-altering event happens, it’s so easy to lose yourself, because your identity is skewed. Suddenly you’re a disabled person, so that’s one label. You’re a double amputee, that’s another. You’re a survivor, or are you a victim? I’ve been given a new life, but it’s this constant struggle of how do I do this?” The arts, including her vibrant paintings (which will be projected during the show) and working with the violinist Julian Ferraretto (also part of the show) represented “this beautiful piece of life before, that came back but with a different meaning, so it’s actually more powerful”.Instead of thinking about the hate and extremism of that catastrophic moment, Hicks prefers to focus on the love and compassion she was shown in the months and years afterwards. She tracked down as many people involved in her care as she could, “to look into their eyes and say thank you.” Several, including one of the first paramedics who entered Hicks’s carriage, have become close friends.This is what she wants her show to bring to people. “Through the addition of music, it becomes a real celebration of not only life, but of who we are as human beings – the extraordinary, unconditional love that I was shown as a person without identity, ‘One unknown, estimated female.’ To think that my body wasn’t just passed from one person to the next, it was absolutely held with love and intention for survival. Who I am today is because of how powerful that love and care was on that morning. I think the undercurrent for me of 20 years is: how do I tell that? How do I be the reminder?”Still Alive (and Kicking) is atWilton’s Music Hall, London, on 9 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageJazz7 July London attacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It sounds almost nothing like the original – what would Cilla Black think?Stuart HeritageTue 1 Jul 2025 06.55 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 07.30 EDTShareGood news: Blind Date is returning to our screens. Weird news: it won’t be on television, you probably won’t watch it and it may not technically count as Blind Date. But let’s concentrate on the good news first.On Monday, Disney+ announced three new unscripted TV shows. One is a sort of Made in Chelsea spin-off about parenthood, another sounds like The Kardashians except it has Wayne and Coleen Rooney in it, and the third is the return of Blind Date, which Disney calls the “ultimate dating series”.No host or release date has been revealed yet, but that doesn’t matter. It’s Blind Date, for crying out loud. Everyone knows Blind Date. A person has to pick the most desirable option from a panel of three strangers who are hidden from view. Once they have matched, they go on holiday and then report back. And that’s it, over and over again.If that seems slightly staid, that’s because it is. Even in its day, there was something uncomfortably robotic about Blind Date. The dates were chosen through a stilted exchange of scripted lines, and the contestants themselves were so relentlessly chaste you might as well have been watching footage of toddlers visiting a zoo. It was a classic of the terrestrial-era form: “Was it good or was it the only thing on?”View image in fullscreenBlind Date 1999 … Cilla introduces ‘the girls’, Sally, Sabrina and Rachel.Photograph: ITV/Rex ShutterstockIt is also a good example of the changing television landscape. In its prime, when it was presented by the now late Cilla Black, Blind Date was watched by 18.2 million viewers. When that run ended in 2003, the figure had plummeted to 5 million. That was still 3 million more than the number who tuned in for the 2017 revival on Channel 5, hosted by Paul O’Grady. If the new Disney version gets even a quarter of that figure, it will probably be deemed a success.More pressingly, we now live in a firmly post-Blind Date world. In the years since Cilla ruled the airwaves, the dating show spectrum has burst into a dazzling kaleidoscope. Simply having a brief verbal exchange with some strangers, then spending a long weekend in Benidorm will no longer cut it. In the last 15 years alone, we have had karaoke-based dating shows (Sing Date), sensorily deprived dating shows (Dating in the Dark), neurodiverse dating shows (Love on the Spectrum), dating shows for exhibitionists (Naked Attraction) and dating shows for people who wish that the human-trafficking scene from Taken was a fully immersive entertainment experience (Take Me Out).This is only the tip of the iceberg. For decades, the format has adopted reality TV with The Bachelor, Love Island and countless others. There is even Married at First Sight, which seems less designed for singletons than for all their judgmentally dismissive friends.View image in fullscreenBlind Date 1997 … Kevin and Sarah with Cilla.Photograph: ITV/Rex ShutterstockIn this landscape, Blind Date looks woefully outdated. Perhaps this is why the new iteration is promising a fleet of changes. To quote the press release: “Our daters will see if for ever love can truly grow as they spend the summer living together, but potential new partners are always lurking behind the wall.” Which does sound like a comprehensive overhaul, dragging the show into the 21st century by lingering on the relationships rather than the very first interaction. It also – almost! – hints that the contestants might be sexually attracted to each other this time around, which will make a change from the Cilla era, which tended to vault from polite conversation straight to marriage.Strangers marrying on TV? I think it’s fair to say I’m hookedRead moreThen again, this new format has an air ofShip of Theseusabout it. What Disney seems to be making has so little in common with the original Blind Date that it doesn’t seem much like Blind Date at all. It sounds a bit like Frankenstein’s monster, with so many ungainly new elements bolted on that it is destined to rise up one day and murder its oppressors. It goes without saying that the new version may be exactly what the current television landscape requires – and that it could end up running as long as the original. But still, what would Cilla think?Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDatingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Andy Ferguson, one half of dance duo Bicep, walks around in its towering shadow recording these eerie sounds. “Everyone comes back changed,” he says ofGreenland. “Seeing first-hand climate change happening like this.”It’s April 2023 and, in the wake ofBicep’s second album Islescementing them as one of the leading electronic acts globally, Ferguson has travelled to Greenland as part of a project to collaborate with Indigenous musicians and bring the momentous struggle of this region – and even the planet – into focus.The project will take two years to come to fruition but next month sees the release of Bicep’s first soundtrack and accompanying filmTakkuuk, pronounced tuck-kook. It’s an Inuktitut word that came from throat singing duo Silla, one of the Indigenous collaborators: “It translates to literally ‘look’ but has the connotation that you’re urging someone to look at something closely,” says Silla’s Charlotte Qamaniq. “The Arctic climate is changing rapidly so in the context of the project it’s: ‘look, the adverse effects of climate change are obvious.’ But it’s also: ‘hey, look how cool Inuit culture is!’”View image in fullscreenA member of the expedition team dwarfed by an Arctic glacier.Photograph: Charlie MillerI join Ferguson on this first trip along with representatives from EarthSonic, a non-profit organisation dedicated to raising awareness about the climate crisis through art projects. Ferguson’sBiceppartner Matt McBriar stays home ahead of the birth of his first child.When we land at Kangerlussuaq airport, first opened as a US airbase in the second world war, it’s -10C, bright and crisp. Ferguson is staying with our driver Evald who, on learning that Ferguson and I are Man United fans, exclaims: “Manchester United is my religion! Old Trafford is my church!” His home has a huge Lego model of the stadium. Across the next week we see the northern lights – in Inuit myth, it’s dead souls playing ball with a walrus’s head – and ride dogsleds and snowmobiles, but there’s a sobering tone to the beauty and adventure.Russell glacier is a 20km journey by four-wheel drive on a rough dirt road. The ice sheet covers 80% of the country, but loss of ice from Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has quadrupled since the 90s due to climate change, and is the principal driver of rising sea levels. Scientists predict if the world continues on a course towards 2.5C heating it will take us beyond a tipping point for both ice sheets, resulting ina catastrophic sea level rise of 12 metres. Standing under a vast glacier that is hundreds of thousands of years old, but which could disappear within my daughters’ lifetime, is discombobulating.View image in fullscreenBicep performing at Sonar festival in June.Photograph: Alejandro García/EPANext morning it’s on to Sisimiut forArcticSounds, a showcase for music from across the Arctic region and beyond. Sisimiut is Greenland’s second city, home to 5,000, and a thriving metropolis compared with Kangerlussuaq. Rock and metal are the most popular music, alongside rap and other Indigenous music and the standout acts include an incendiary performance by Greenlandic rapper Tarrak. “Seeing Tarrak perform was so powerful,” Ferguson says, with “everyone chanting in this language I’d never heard before. It felt punk. It’s rare to see that nowadays when everything is so homogenised.”The project is allowing Bicep to flex different musical muscles. Playing a simultaneously melancholic and euphoric style of tech-house and electronica, Bicep broke through in the mid-2010s. Their track Glue became a ubiquitous rave anthem among gen Z, and led to the success of Isles, which reached No 2 in the UK charts and earned them two Brit award nominations. Everything was rosy, but it was, in Ferguson’s words, “all sugar, no sour”, so they created alter egos Chroma and Dove to show their harder, headier side. The Arctic was an opportunity to challenge themselves again.After Ferguson returned from Greenland, the first thing Bicep did was construct a drum kit from ice samples and other field recordings of local sounds including husky chains, then created demos, “really just chord structures we know we can write around” and sent them to the Indigenous artists. They didn’t expect to get almost full songs in return, but on hearing what came back, the duo realised “we needed to step back and not be the focal point”. A gig on a glacier had been one initial mooted idea, but the Greenland trip made it obvious such a gig would be “tone deaf”, says Ferguson. Through conversations with Indigenous artists, “it became clear this needed to be us shining a light on them”.At times, progress seemed suitably glacial, but eventually a collection of Indigenous artists from Greenland and the wider Arctic region recorded their contributions at Iceland Airwaves festival in Reykjavík in November 2023, where many of them were in town performing, including Tarrak, Silla, vocalist Katarina Barruk and more.View image in fullscreenA still from the Takkuuk film and installation project.Photograph: EarthSonic / BICEPWhen I catch up with Ferguson and meet his Bicep-mate McBriar in late 2024, they’re buzzing about the results, and by late May, I’m finally able to hear the full thing in their Shoreditch studio. From the first bars of opener Sikorsuit, featuring Greenlandic indie band Nuija, it’s clear the duo have managed to pull myriad styles and dialect into a cohesive whole. “It doesn’t sound anything like us – and it doesn’t sound like them,” McBriar says. “That’s what you hope to achieve from a collaboration.”Tarrak collaboration Taarsitillugu opens with a sparse breakbeat and becomes a full-on rave banger, while on her track Dárbbuo, Barruk sings in Ume Sámi, an endangered Uralic language spoken by fewer than 20 people. “I went in to the studio and just poured my heart out because of the tragic state the world is in,” she says, “then Matt and Andy worked their magic.”There was synchronicity, despite different languages. “It shows a strong connection between us Indigenous sister and brothers,” explains Barruk, who is Swedish. “Without me knowingtakkuukmeans look, I created lyrics which ask the other person tovuöjnniet, to see, so one doesn’t need to feel so alone. Alone in the fight for our lands, our ways of living, our language, culture and taking care of the Earth.”As the project developed it was clear it needed context, so Bicep asked Zak Norman, who designs their brilliant on-stage visuals, to create an immersive installation. Norman worked with Charlie Miller, a documentary film-maker who went on the original Greenland trip, on a film that introduces the artists and explores the displacement and marginalisation of their communities, cultures and language. Norman used adapted infrared cameras to give the footage otherworldly pink and purple hues, reminiscent of Richard Mosse’s 2013 video artwork The Enclave. The film is a series of vignettes for each track, and it certainly deepens the music, with eerie landscapes layered with interviews. The work will premiere on the giant wraparound screens at London’s Outernet next month, before touring venues and festivals across the world.View image in fullscreen‘We have to be aware of people trying to divide us’ … Tarrak.Photograph: Charlie MillerThe project has taken on yet another hue in the wake of Donald Trump’s recent expansionist proclamations. “It’s a circus,” says Tarrak. “The first time Trump asked to buy Greenland [during his first. term as president] we took it as a joke. Now I can see there’s some seriousness – but it’s still just weird, in 2025, to try and buy a country. I know they’re more interested in what’s under the ground than the people, but we have to be smart about it as Greenlanders, stick together and be aware of people trying to divide us.”Bicep experienced their own existential crisis whenMcBriar had to have surgery for a large tumouron his brain’s pituitary gland last year, from which he’s thankfully made a good recovery. They’re now deep into their third album proper, though it won’t see daylight from their basement studio for at least another year. “We wrote [Isles] pre-pandemic so it’s a complete different world now. With Chroma we wanted to get that aggression out and cleanse ourselves of what we wanted to do, just straight club tracks. Now I think we’re coming full circle.”How will you judge the success of Takkuuk, I ask. “You can’t quantify awareness,” says Ferguson. “If it starts people on a journey to learn more about Greenland then it’s achieved something.Andy Ferguson of Bicep’s listening diary: ‘I tend to let the algorithm start me off down a little wormhole’Read more“It’s easy to switch off with climate change, I switch off myself sometimes,” he continues. “But if you start telling the story in different ways, different narratives, ways people can visualise it, at least it’s a start. Because for the next generation it’s going to be the focal part of their life.”Takkuuk premieres at Outernet, London, 3 July, then tours.

These glamorous 1930s capers starred the debonair duo of William Powell and Myrna Loy as frisky husband-and-wife sleuths Nick and Nora Charles, who solve crimes while cracking wise and necking cocktails, accompanied by their precocious wire fox terrier Asta. There were six films in the original run, starting with 1934’s The Thin Man, an adaptation of the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name, and ending in 1947. The perfect recipe for a new Thin Man film would comprise two charismatic movie stars with sizzling chemistry, the kind who look stunning in evening dress, but who can also ad lib their own gags, a cavalcade of plot twists and saucy co-stars, a happy ending, and of course a scene-stealing pooch. It’s good, old-fashioned fun, but that’s why it’s so timeless, and a formula that can run and run – until the ice bucket is empty.Pamela HutchinsonWild ThingsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cinetext/Columbia/AllstarWild Things is a movie Film Twitter might say they just couldn’t make any more, which is pretty much the best reason to give it a try. The gloriously trashy original, which spawned a series of straight-to-DVD sequels, starred Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, Matt Dillon and Kevin Bacon (shocking audiences by showing off all his meat) as exceptionally hot grifters using their sexual currency to break open trust funds. Wild Things was the neo-noir driftwood arriving after a wave of 90s erotic thrillers, when Girls Gone Wild was a thing and wet T-shirt competitions were peaking. That vibe is built into the movie’s lurid south Florida aesthetic, which was an ogle fest certainly, but also deceptively clever and sensational with its knowing high camp performances and over-the-top accumulation of double and triple crosses. Wild Things is exactly the franchise to revisit now that we’re in a moment when the erotic thriller is making a comeback (think Halina Reijn’s smart and subversive embrace in Babygirl). It’s got the room to improve and challenge what the original had to offer, but also embrace what it did well, showing a lot of skin but only revealing the true nature of its plot and appeal just when we thought the movie – and its moment – was over.Radheyan SimonpillaiTorchy BlaneView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Donaldson Collection/Getty ImagesLook, I frankly can’t conceive of a hunger for reviving any long-running franchise of the past half-century. Pretty much all of them have had their turn at this point. So let’s take it back a bit further and yield the floor to Torchy Blane. This lady reporter and de facto gumshoe was played mostly but not exclusively by Glenda Farrell and featured in nine feature films released between 1937 and 1939, starting with the aptly titled Smart Blonde. Feature films meant something a little different back then; these B-movie mysteries and light adventure thrillers hovered around the 60-minute mark. They’re also the kind of personality-driven plots that are more typically run into the ground by network TV. But wouldn’t it be fun to see a true big-screen star like Amy Adams, Emma Stone or Zoe Saldaña cracking cases every year or two without the TV commitment or the obligations of brainless spectacle? Hire Torchy at an imperiled publication and bring back the crisp, short, well-made mystery picture! If the execs need a craven superhero connection, consider this: Torchy supposedly helped inspire the comics character Lois Lane. Whaddaya need, a road map?Jesse HassengerA Nightmare on Elm StreetView image in fullscreenPhotograph: FlixPix/AlamyThere’s nothing official yet on the books for a return to Elm Street but given the unending churn of horror resurrections (Screamcontinues, Halloween is gettinganother do-over, Friday the 13th isheading to TV, Texas Chainsaw has inspired afrenzied auction), something must be edging closer. The delay might be down to how nightmarish the last attempt was – 2010’s drab and unscary retread, loathed by critics and disowned by lead Rooney Mara – but also how difficult it is to reinvent Freddy Krueger for a modern audience. A violent, sleepover-ruining villain had turned into a quippy, exhaustingly over-merchandised joke and those wishing to bring him back have surely been having sleepless nights trying to figure out the right balance. But there remains something terrifying, and endlessly inventive, about the engine at its core, allowing for a smart, visually ambitious film-maker to go wild on a new canvas. There’s also mileage in exploring, and potentially tweaking, Krueger’s cursed backstory for an even more divided small-town America (what if an outsider was framed for the wrongdoings of a corrupt community and returned with a vengeance?), finding nasty new ways to keep us up all night.Benjamin LeeAustin PowersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: New Line Cinema/Allstar“One million dollars!” In the ’90s, the Austin Powers franchise rightly achieved heavy cultural weight and widespread memeification for the way it hilariously dismantled spy thriller tropes while lambasting the uptight and power-hungry 1% – far before it was trendy to do so. But that was 20 years ago. As oligarchs today melt the ice caps to force-feed us self-driving cars and AI slop, and while Donald Trump amasses a Dr Evil–worthy group of sycophants in the executive branch, what could be more timely than a reboot of the Austin Powers series? In times of political upheaval and social unrest, comedy has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to speak necessary truths in a way that resonates broadly; even more importantly, mockery and laughter are proven deterrents against authoritarian regimes.Veronica EspositoThe GodfatherView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Paramount/Kobal/ShutterstockI can personally live without movie franchises: I lost interest in Star Wars halfway through Return of the Jedi, gave up on Alien after Resurrection, and actually fell asleep during Matrix Reloaded, it was such a letdown. Recapturing lightning in a bottle is a task seemingly beyond everyone except James Cameron (I’ll grant that Aliens and T2 are top-notch exceptions to the rule). The Godfather – not really a franchise as such, but in effect the inventor of the modern film series – is the biggest conundrum of them all. Godfathers 1 and 2 are both brilliant, which makes the awfulness of part III one of the most baffling disasters in cinema history. (Even more baffling, where did Sofia Coppola find the confidence to be such a great director herself after being so badly exposed as an actor, by her own dad.) Well, history records that Coppola – still then a film-maker to be reckoned with – only did part III to get out of a financial hole; and it also records he did discuss a fourth film with Mario Puzo, but it hit the buffers when the author died in 1999. So my vote is: if we can guarantee Godfather 4 is as good as 1 or 2, then please can we have it? If not, forget about it.Andrew PulverThe Brady BunchView image in fullscreenA still from the film, The Brady Bunch Movie.Photograph: Elliott Marks/taken from picture libraryThe most incisive movie franchises reflect the time they arrived. By that measure, this would be the ideal moment to resurrect The Brady Bunch series. The original TV version of the show, which aired between 1969 and 1974, couldn’t have been more popular, or more insipid, inspiring no fewer than five spin-off specials for the small screen, each dimmer than the next. In stark contrast, the movie series, which spawned three projects between 1995 and 2002, took a far more sophisticated and satirical approach, positioning the naivety and self-absorption of its ’70s characters as hilarious foils to the larger world they now found themselves in. Fast forward several decades to the reactionary age of Trump. In key ways, today’s climate echoes the Nixonian era of the original TV series, which had been conceived, in part, to reasserted “traditional values” in the wake of the 60s revolution. But there’s a built-in twist with this franchise: The Bradys were always kind people at heart, so placing them in the context of today’s cruel cultural backlash could open up a whole new layer of nuance, allowing the family to find a sweet and funny balance between their simplistic notion of “normalcy” and the complex world we actually live in.Jim FarberWayne’s WorldView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ronald GrantIt has been over 30 years since Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar partied on from the basement set of their public access show in Aurora, Illinois, and the Saturday Night Live stars who originated them, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey, are not exactly at the peak of their fame. But that’s exactly why a new Wayne’s World is a promising idea: Just as Wayne and Garth are on the wrong side of middle age, nostalgic for their brief time in the national spotlight, rock music itself has been on the decline, relegated mostly to legacy tours aimed at gen-Xers with deep pockets and bad backs. That may sound like a melancholy premise for a franchise built on silly banter and pop-culture references, but a YouTube-channel revival of Wayne’s World seems plausible, as does the hilarious disconnect between old guys looking to “party on” and a younger generation unaccustomed to guitars getting plugged into amplifiers.Scott TobiasSpeciesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto/AllstarIf the three intervening decades since the release of Species – a period of time that’s yielded Scarlett Johansson in Under the Skin, Sally Hawkins’s fishy fornication in The Shape of Water, and not one but two azure-skinned, kinda-nude Mystiques – have taught us anything, it’s that the viewing public’s desire to make it with not-quite-human organisms is only growing in ardor. That’s the sturdy foundation upon which Roger Donaldson’s admirably smutty sci-fi staple of adolescent sleepovers was built, its servicing of peculiar fetishes less out of joint with the present than the conditions of its making. That MGM would throw $35m (in 90s dollars!) at a softcore B-movie scans as utterlyaliento today’s studio protocols, and as such, a similar investment would be the ideal tonic for an anemic summer movie landscape. Right now, every tentpole is grasping for an air of can’t-miss ceremony, which leads to leaden seriousness and self-importance; the people crave base pleasures, the dumb horny fun of getting ravished by a sextraterrestrial. (And just think of how well the novelization will sell with fan-fiction types.)Charles BramescoShanghai NoonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Touchstone/AllstarHow well do Shanghai Noon and Knights – the Owen Wilson/Jackie Chan martial arts/western buddy movies from the earlier noughties – stand up, 20 odd years on? A brief gander at the trailers feels … unencouraging but at the time I remember really liking these for their loose limbs and nimble feet, charming performances and some surprisingly good jokes. The first was set in the old west and had a lot of broad stroke nudge-nudge genre nods, the second in Victorianish London, with ribald support from Gemma Jones, Aidan Gillen and a very young Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Charlie Chaplin. A third was reportedly planned a few years later, set in Mexico, but it never happened because Jackie Chan “lost interest”. Maybe the healthy box office for the Karate Kid reboot might reignite that? Perhaps Owen Wilson is finding his mojo again, post Stick? Either way, it’s one breezy bit of entertainment I’d happily lap up again.Catherine ShoardExplore more on these topicsFilmfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The decision was taken that the footage of Bob Vylan would not be made available on the broadcaster’s on-demand service.But the live stream of the West Holts stage where Bob Vylan performedcontinued to be aired for a number of hours after the incident, allowing anyone watching the broadcast live to rewind it.The band put out a statement on Tuesday saying they were “not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group”. In an Instagram post they said: “Today a good many people would have you believe a punk band is the number one threat to world peace. Last week it was a Palestine pressure group, the week before that it was another band.“We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people. We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine. A machine whose own soldiers were told to use unnecessary lethal force against innocent civilians waiting for aid. A machine that has destroyed much ofGaza.“We, like those in the spotlight before us, are not the story. We are a distraction from the story and whatever sanctions we receive will be a distraction.”The Irish rap trio Kneecap, including the member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, who appeared in court earlier this monthcharged with a terror offence, took to the stage directly after Bob Vylan and led chants of “Free Palestine”. Their performance was not livestreamed.The BBC did not offer any explanation for the decision made after consultation with Davie.The broadcaster has already issued an apology on behalf of its staff running the live operations for failing to pull away from the performance of Bob Vylan during the chanting, describing the scenes as “utterly unacceptable”.A BBC spokesperson said: “The director general was informed of the incident after the performance and at that point he was clear it should not feature in any other Glastonbury coverage.”Sir Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, said the incident was a “national shame”.He wrote on X: “The airing of vile Jew-hatred at Glastonbury and the BBC’s belated and mishandled response, brings confidence in our national broadcaster’s ability to treat antisemitism seriously to a new low.“It should trouble all decent people that now, one need only couch their outright incitement to violence and hatred as edgy political commentary, for ordinary people to not only fail to see it for what it is, but also to cheer it, chant it and celebrate it. Toxic Jew-hatred is a threat to our entire society.”Avon and Somerset police said on Monday they hadlaunched an investigationinto both performances after reviewing video footage and audio recordings. A senior detective has been appointed to lead the investigation.A police spokesperson said: “This has been recorded as a public order incident at this time while our inquiries are at an early stage.“The investigation will be evidence-led and will closely consider all appropriate legislation, including relating to hate crimes.”Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said he had been shocked by the behaviour of some at the festival.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “There are some lessons, I think, for broadcasters from this, but let’s also not shy away from the issue, which is people in a crowd glorifying violence.“I don’t think it’s something we’d associate with any music festival, but it’s a wider societal problem.“It’s possible, I think, to be completely concerned by the scenes in Gaza and not stray into the kind of behaviour and endorsement that we saw with that performance.“And I’m deeply shocked to be honest, that people would even not realise what I think they’re participating in when they do that.”Writing on Instagram, Pascal Robinson-Foster, who performs under the name Bob Vylan, wrote: “Teaching our children to speak up for the change they want and need is the only way that we make this world a better place …“Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to when we want and need change. Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organising online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.”The band is due to perform on 5 and 6 July at Victoria Warehouse in Manchester. The Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester & Region has urged the venue to call off the show.A Greater Manchester police spokesperson said: “We are aware that Bob Vylan will be performing in Manchester at the weekend.“Greater Manchester is famous for promoting music of all genres and we welcome all artists to our region. However, we will act immediately on any reports of commentary or actions that could be breaking the law.”Explore more on these topicsBBCTim DavieGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalFestivalsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

If you decide you are done for the day, send me another note and I’ll bring you back out to end the day,” Arun Subramanian told jurors after 5pm on Tuesday.Shortly after, the jurors sent the court a note saying that they had concluded for the day, and would resume deliberations on Wednesday morning.Combs, 55, wasarrested in Septemberand faces five felony counts: one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and denies all of the accusations against him.If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.Late on Tuesday afternoon, jurors sent their sixth note to the court. They indicated to the judge that they had reached a verdict on four of the counts but were unable to reach a consensus on the racketeering charge due to some jurors with “unpersuadable views”.In response, both prosecutors and Combs’s defense team asked jurors to keep deliberating on the remaining charge. There was discussion on whether to read jurors anAllen charge, more colloquially known as a “dynamite charge”, which is further instruction to encourage those in the minority to reconsider their position.Of the charges Combs faces, racketeering conspiracy is the most complicated because the jury must decide whether Combs ran a “racketeering enterprise” and also whether he was involved in committing some or all of various types of offenses, like kidnapping and arson, according to the Associated Press.The 12-member jury – composed of eight men and four women –began deliberating on Mondayfollowing closing arguments, which concluded last week, and detailed instructions from the judge.Roughly an hour into deliberations on Monday, jurors sent a note to the court raising concerns about one of the jurors – Juror 25 – stating that they believed that the juror “cannot follow your honor’s instructions”.Fake, AI-generated videos about the Diddy trial are raking in millions of views on YouTubeRead moreSubramanian, who is overseeing the case, responded to the jurors with a note reminding them of their duty to deliberate and obligation to follow his instructions on the law. He also instructed them to refrain from sharing any details about their discussions in future notes.Before adjourning for the day, the jury sent another note to the court, this time requesting clarification on what qualifies as drug distribution – an allegation tied to the racketeering conspiracy charge.The jurors asked whether giving drugs to someone who asked for them qualifies as distributing controlled substances. The judge said that he would respond on Tuesday morning.The jury deliberated for five-and-a-half hours on Monday without reaching a verdict, and adjourned at 5pm ET.On Tuesday morning, the judge conferred with both sides and sent the jury a note pointing to a passage in the charging document.The passage reads: “The word ‘distribution’ means actual, constructive, or attempted transfer. To distribute simply means to deliver, to pass over, or to hand over something to another person, or to cause it to be delivered, passed on, or handed over to another. Distribution does not require a sale.”About 10.30am ET on Tuesday, the jury submitted another note to the court, this time asking for transcripts of testimony given by two witnesses: Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, one of Combs’s former girlfriends and the government’s key witness in this case, and Daniel Phillip, who testified that he was hired to participate in the so-called “freak offs”.The judge ordered the excerpts of transcripts to be sent to the jury by 1pm ET.Central to the government’s case are accusations that Combs used violence, intimidation, money, threats and power to force and coerce two of his former girlfriends into participating in highly orchestrated drug-fueled sex marathons with hired male escorts, known as “freak-offs”.Prosecutors allege that for more than two decades, Combs led a criminal enterprise – aided by employees and associates – that engaged in and worked to cover up a range of crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, drug distribution, arson and bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice.Throughout the seven-week trial, the defense maintained thatall sexual encounters were consensual and part of what they described as a “swingers lifestyle”. They argued that no criminal conspiracy existed and that Combs was being unfairly prosecuted for his “private” and “personal” sex life.His lawyers have acknowledged past instances of domestic violence, but they have denied any acts of sex trafficking or coercion.The trial beganon 12 May, and jurors heard testimony from 34 witnesses, includingtwo of Combs’s former girlfriends, multipleformer employeesand assistants, several male escorts, stylists, hotel workers, law enforcement agents and well-known figures such as therapper Kid Cudiandsinger Dawn Richard, among others.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsUS crimeNew YorkLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

During the short set, Mercury had 72,000 people clapping as one. Speaking tothe Radio Times, Taylor, the band’s drummer, said: “During Radio Ga Ga, it did seem that the whole stadium was in unison. But then I looked up during We Are the Champions, and the crowd looked like a whole field of wheat swaying.”The performance might never have happened, too, if it were not for the persuasive powers of May, Queen’s lead guitarist. “We weren’t touring or playing, and it seemed like a crazy idea, this talk of having 50 bands on the same bill,” May said. “I said to Freddie: ‘If we wake up on the day after thisLive Aidshow and we haven’t been there, we’re going to be pretty sad.’ He said: ‘Oh, fuck it, we’ll do it.’”View image in fullscreenMercury was told by Geldof to focus on playing Queen’s hits.Photograph: Brook Lapping/BB/Band Aid TrustHe added: “It was one of the few moments in anyone’s life that you know you’re doing something for all the right reasons.”The singer was not the only one who wasn’t immediately convinced thatQueenshould even play that day. It has previously been reported that Geldof was reluctant too.Speaking toMojo magazineearlier this month, the promoter Harvey Goldsmith said he and Geldof were working together on the lineup. “Being the producer, I understood how slots work and who went where. I was also dealing with the technical side: we were doing two shows [London and Philadelphia] and had to stay strictly to time because of the satellite.“I thought about it, and said for the late afternoon slot the perfect act would be Queen. Bob said: ‘No, they’ve peaked. I don’t think they should play! I said to Bob, I really think they’ll be perfect to go on in that 5.30, 6 o’clock type slot – knowing Freddie as I did, I knew they’d really make a show of it.Explore more on these topicsFreddie MercuryBob GeldofQueenLive AidnewsShareReuse this content"

The figure includes £5.1bn spent directly by music tourists on tickets, food and drink, merchandise, travel, parking and accommodation.It also includes £4.9bn classified as indirect spending such as on fencing and security at concerts.While the additional 4.3 million music tourists that attended gigs and concerts last year helped fuel the record £10bn spend, it has also been boosted by the impact of inflation on accommodation, travel and food and drink as well as soaring ticket prices.This year, Oasis fans are expected to splash outmore than £1bn on the reunion tour, more than £766 a person across the 17-date tour.The report highlights the dominance of London, which is home to big arenas such as the O2 and Wembley, which drew 7.5 million music fans and accounted for £2.7bn of the total £10bn in revenues. The capital was followed by the north-west of England, with 3.3 million visitors and £1.2bn in revenues, and the south-west of England, with 2.5 million music tourists and £1.1bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The detail about the bathtub is astonishingRebecca NicholsonTue 1 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 00.01 EDTShareNetflix is not always known for its restraint in the documentary genre, but with its outstanding recent filmGrenfell: Uncovered, and now Attack on London: Hunting the 7/7 Bombers, it appears to be finding a new maturity and seriousness in the field. There have been plenty of recent documentaries on the subject of the attacks and the sprawling investigation that followed – no surprise, given that it is the 20th anniversary this week – but there is still real depth to be found here.Over four parts, this thorough series unravels the initial attacks on the London transport system, which killed 52 people and injured more than 700, then follows that febrile month into the failed bombings of 21 July, and then thepolice shooting of the innocent Jean Charles de Menezes, a day later. The first 25 minutes or so simply recount those first attacks, compiling the story using phone pictures, news footage, occasional reconstructions, the infamous photographs of the injured pouring out of tube stations and accounts from survivors and the families of victims. Though it is by now a familiar story, this evokes the fear, confusion and panic of that day in heart-racing detail.View image in fullscreenJean Charles de Menezes, who was shot dead by police, after being mistaken for a suspect.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixIn those details, it is unsparing and frequently horrifying.Daniel Biddle lost his legs in the explosionat Edgware Road. His memory of locking eyes with the man who would shortly detonate the bomb in his bag is chilling, and his account of his fight to survive is as gripping as it is brutal. Others talk about the chaos, the noise, the screaming. One woman, who had managed to jump on the 30 bus near Tavistock Square in all of the transport disarray, recounts getting a text from her boyfriend at the time, saying: “You were right, they were bombs.” She had just put her phone back in her pocket after reading it, she says, when the bus exploded.Those attacks led to the largest criminal investigation ever seen in the UK, which is the primary focus of all four episodes. These were the first suicide bombings to take place on British soil, and police did not know, immediately, that the bombers had also blown themselves up. The revelation about how they came to suspect this – from evidence gathered in one of the tube carriages – is gruesome and fascinating. Explosives expert Cliff Todd talks of material and techniques he had never seen before, and the work that went into tracking down those responsible – and attempting to prevent further attacks – is astonishing in its scale and reach.This is not simply a police procedural – and that strengthens it greatly. It is impressively comprehensive, taking in the political and media climate of the time. There are interviews with Eliza Manningham-Buller, then director general of MI5, as well as the former prime minister Tony Blair. It even puts the crucial question to Blair: did the invasion of Iraq in 2003 lead directly to these attacks in Britain? His answer is politician-like and broad, but at least it asks the question, and offers context to attacks that did not happen in a vacuum.Another survivor,Mustafa Kurtuldu, recalls his experience of being on the tube near Aldgate when his train was blown up. When he was finally removed from the carriage and taken out of the station, police searched his bag. There is footage of an appearance on GMTV, just days later, when the presenter asks him how he feels about the attacks, “as a Muslim”. When the investigation moves to Beeston, in Leeds – where two of the four attackers were from – a youth worker in the Muslim community talks about the realisation that, as after 9/11, he would be asked, once more, to apologise for the actions of extremists.The third episode deals with the failed attacks on 21 July. There are eyewitness accounts of the explosions that went wrong – chilling and eerie, in their own way – the subsequent hunt for the four men who escaped is, again, astonishing in its scope. The next day, the 27-year-old Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes was on his way to work when he was described as behaving in an “edgy” manner by police who had mistakenly identified him as a suspect. He was shot dead. One of the officers who pulled the trigger speaks here, his identity disguised.Again, the strength of Attack on London is in the details. When officers finally caught up with Yassin Omar – who had attempted to blow up Warren Street and had fled to Birmingham disguised in a burqa – he was standing in a bath with a backpack on. Fittingly, though, this does not end with the attackers, but with the survivors and their relatives. It strikes a careful balance throughout.Attack on London: Hunting the 7/7 Bombers is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV review7 July London attacksreviewsShareReuse this content"

Even though the film’s publicity really did not want you to know about it, this is a film in which Rachel Zegler will not stop singing. But forewarned is forearmed, and once the shock of the genre has worn off, what’s left might be the best Hunger Games movie yet.

Bundy was handsome, charming, extremely intelligent and sociopathic – “a sexual virus masquerading as a person”. There is persuasive evidence that he began killing much earlier but never this gluttonously. Almost all of his victims had long brown hair, parted in the middle. Sometimes he broke into the women’s houses while they slept, or snatched them off the street. Sometimes he would put on a sling or plaster cast and lure them into his car to help with some fabricated task. If one refused, he tried another, convinced that he would never be caught because they would never be missed. “I mean, there aresomany people,” he reasoned. “It shouldn’t be a problem.” Fraser lived on Mercer Island, Washington, near Bundy’s first hunting grounds. Recalling the moment he was first charged with murder in October 1976, she writes: “Everybody knows somebody who knows somebody who almost went out with Ted Bundy.”Bundy was one of at least half a dozen serial killers active in Washington in 1974. Within a few years, the state would produce the similarly prolific Randall Woodfield, known as the I-5 Killer, and Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer. Its murder rate rose by more than 30% in 1974 – almost six times the national average. In Tacoma, the city where Bundy grew up, Ridgway lived and Charles Manson was incarcerated for five years before starting his Family, murder was up 62%. It was as if a malevolent cloud had enveloped the region.Fraser argues that the epidemic was related to a real cloud, containing sulphur dioxide, arsenic and lead, which emanated from the smokestack of a smelting facility in Ruston, outside Tacoma. Nobody knows what cursed constellation of genes, upbringing, social circumstances, brain chemistry and plain old evil makes serial killers do what they do, but Fraser advances the lead-crime hypothesis. Lead in the blood has been shown to deplete brain volume in the part of the prefrontal cortex that regulates behaviour, especially in men. Today, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) defines more than 3.5 micrograms of lead per decilitre in a child’s blood as a cause for concern; the CDC’s first “safe” threshold, in 1960, was 60 micrograms. Yet as far back as the 1920s, doctors observed that lead poisoning from paint made children “crazy-like”. Fifty years later, the Ecologist asked “Does lead create criminals?” and the CDC connected lead to “functional derangements”.It is as haunting a nonfiction book as I have read in a long time. It gets into your bloodIt was also connected to money. The Guggenheim dynasty built its fortune on mining and smelting metal – its company Asarco was once responsible for 90% of US lead production. Asarco acquired the Ruston smelter in 1905 and converted it to refine copper, bleeding waste metals into the sky through what was for a while the world’s tallest smokestack. “The unwitting populace breathes [lead], eats it, and becomes it,” Fraser writes. In 1974, researchers found that the Ruston smelter was pumping 25lbs of lead dust and 58lbs of arsenic into the air every hour. That same year, Asarco celebrated its 75th anniversary by reporting record profits.Murderland sets its sights much higher than true crime. LikePrairie Fires, Fraser’s Pulitzer prize-winning 2017 biography of Laura Ingalls Wilder, it’s a big, ambitious story about the United States and the people it breeds. Then again, wasn’t it a work of true crime, Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood, that kickstarted literary nonfiction 60 years ago? Two recent tales of money and murder –Patrick Radden Keefe’s Empire of PainandDavid Grann’s Killers of the Flower Moon– also border Murderland. It is as hauntingly compulsive a nonfiction book as I have read in a long time. It gets into your blood.The occasional overripe passage and portentous epigram (Dante, Dostoevsky) is a small price to pay. Fraser’s lyrical present-tense prose is urgent yet tightly controlled as she digs into newspaper archives to create a pin-studded map of a country losing its mind. The bravura section about 1974, that annus horribilis, uses immersive day-by-day storytelling to braid the killings with the unravelling of President Nixon, the kidnapping of Patty Hearst and Fraser’s own coming of age on Mercer Island, where she dreams of killing her father, a violent, autocratic Christian Scientist. By evoking the victims’ lives and treading lightly around their grisly deaths, she avoids the clammy voyeurism that makes so many serial killer histories feel sordid.Fraser’s narrative map is criss-crossed with red threads. She pulls in erstwhile Tacoma residents such as Dune creator Frank Herbert, who said that his home town’s air was “so thick you can chew it”, and Dashiell Hammett, who fictionalised the city as “Poisonville” in Red Harvest. We meet Thomas Midgley Jr, the “one-man environmental disaster” responsible for both leaded gasoline and ozone-shredding chlorofluorocarbons, and Clair Patterson, the former Manhattan Project geochemist who used lead levels to accurately calculate the age of the Earth and then successfully campaigned to undo Midgley’s sin. We jump back to the second world war, whose ravenous appetite for lead and copper fuelled an environmental catastrophe. I wasn’t quite persuaded by the subplot about the Lake Washington Floating Bridge, an engineering atrocity whose careless design killed more people than Bundy, but I was never bored.Fraser evokes the fear and vulnerability of the age of serial killers – a time of unguarded hitchhikers, unlocked windows and police officers who have no idea who they’re dealing with. Most perpetrators of sexual violence are known to their victims, but in the US during the 1970s, almost 300 men were compulsively trolling for strangers to abuse and kill. That number plummeted, along with the overall crime rate, during the 1990s, which happened to be after lead was removed from gasoline and most of the big smelters closed down. The one at Ruston fell silent in 1985, thanks more to market forces than to regulation: the price of copper had crashed.Can the serial killers’ crimes be solely explained by the air they breathed, the water they drank and the metal in their brains? Surely not, but Fraser demonstrates enough correlation to make lead pollution a likely contributing factor. Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker, who terrorised California in the mid-80s, grew up near Asarco’s smelter in El Paso, Texas. Gary Ridgway was exposed to lead paint for three decades in his job spray-painting trucks. James Oliver Huberty, who shot dead 22 people in a McDonald’s in California in 1984, was riddled with cadmium from his work as a welder. He had complained that the fumes were “making me crazy”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The incompetence of law enforcers is twinned with the weakness of environmental regulators. The killers’ contempt for individual human lives finds an echo in the ruthless amorality of the corporations. In 1973, a fire destroyed the filtering system at the smelter at Bunker Hill, Idaho, octupling its emissions. An executive weighed the costs of temporary closure against the maximum likely settlement to affected families and kept it going.“They’re doing the devil’s business, which is no different from what Ted does,” Fraser writes, hot with indignation. “Like Ted, Bunker Hill has been killing people for years. It’s second nature.” In Murderland, some killers get caught, tried and punished. Others just get rich. For both, it’s a numbers game.Murderland: Crime and Bloodlust in the Time of Serial Killers by Caroline Fraser is published by Fleet (£25).

It was a glib, ahistorical comment, and was widely ridiculed. Shattered Lands, Sam Dalrymple’s urgent and ambitious debut, offers a more comprehensive rebuttal. Far from being a region riven by ancient hatreds, the lands that comprise modern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar – as well as parts of the Gulf – were divided up within living memory from an empire in retreat.“You can’t actually see the Great Wall of China from space,” Dalrymple begins, “but the border wall dividingIndiafrom Pakistan is unmistakable.” Stretching more than 3,000km and flanked by floodlights, thermal vision sensors and landmines, this is more a physical scar left by the hurried dismantling of British India than a traditional geopolitical divide. What might now seem like natural frontiers were shaped by five key events: Burma’s exit from the empire in 1937; the separation of Aden that same year, and of the Gulf protectorates in 1947; the division of India and Pakistan, also in 1947; the absorption of more than 550 princely states; and, in 1971, the secession of East Pakistan. Neither ancient nor inevitable, these lines were hastily drawn in committee rooms, colonial offices and war cabinets.What makes Shattered Lands remarkable is not just the breadth of its archival reach or the linguistic range of its interviews (from Bengali to Burmese, Urdu to Konyak), but the way it reframes south Asia’s history through the lens of disintegration.The son of acclaimed historian William Dalrymple, Sam nevertheless writes with a distinct sensibility. His work is shaped by a generational awareness of fractured identities, contested borders and the violence of nation-making. Where the elder Dalrymple has often chronicled the grandeur and decline of empires, the younger is more interested in how they splinter.And so, rather than treat the 1947 Partition as the singular rupture, Shattered Lands shows it to be one of many. The imperial map frayed gradually, and each unravelling left its own legacy of dispossession, nationalism and insurgency.Take Burma (now Mynamar), whose reconstitution as a crown colony in 1937 represented the first major partition of the Raj. Dismissed by many Indian elites as peripheral, Burma’s separation was both strategic and symbolic. Gandhi, often invoked as a unifier, was among its supporters. “I have no doubt in my mind that Burma cannot form part of India underswaraj[self rule],” he once wrote, aligning with the view of many Indian leaders who viewed India asBharat, the sacred geography referred to in the epicMahabharata, which excluded Burma and Arabia. Speaking to Rangoon’s Gujarati community, Gandhi told them they were “guests in a foreign country” despite many Burmese seeing themselves as Indian.That same year, as Burma and Aden were severed from the Indian Empire, the Congress party adoptedVande Mataramas India’s national song. In equating the nation with the Hindu goddess Durga, it alienated Muslims such as Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who increasingly saw Congress as a vehicle for Hindu majoritarianism. The ideological groundwork for the creation of Pakistan was already being laid.Among the most poignant moments in the book is a brief account of a Bible salesman from the Naga hills who volunteers to fight in the second world war. The Nagas are ethnically Tibeto-Burman peoples native to the borderlands of north-east India and north-west Myanmar, with distinct cultural traditions and a strong sense of nationhood that long predates these modern states. When asked if he is Indian or Burmese, the man replies, “I am a Naga first, a Naga second, and a Naga last.” The British system, designed to sort subjects into clear administrative categories, had no space for an affiliation that transcended colonial borders, and he was turned away.If there’s a critique to be made, it’s that Dalrymple’s account remains largely anchored to the great men of history: viceroys, premiers, politicians, princely elites. While there are flickers of grassroots perspective – such as the Naga would-be soldier and Rohingya families from the borderlands – they often play a supporting role in a narrative shaped by those drawing the maps. Yet perhaps that is the point: these were top-down decisions, made in grand offices, whose human cost has still not fully been reckoned with.More significantly, Shattered Lands speaks powerfully to our present moment. At a time of widespread historical amnesia – when revisionist governments across south Asia are remaking textbooks and erasing inconvenient truths – this book reminds us how recent, contested and fragile these dividing lines are.The prose is vivid, the storytelling cinematic, and Dalrymple draws together forgotten archives from Aden to Assam. Above all, there is a refusal to mythologise, and instead a clear-eyed history that lays bare the possibilities foreclosed by the region’s fragmentation.Shattered Lands: Five Partitions and the Making of Modern Asia by Sam Dalrymple is published by William Collins (£25).

Almost 10 years ago, young Palestinian film-maker Mohamed Jabaly came from Gaza City to the Tromsø film festival in northern Norway with hismuch admired documentary Ambulance,about his time volunteering with an ambulance crew in Gaza in 2014. But the Rafah crossing with Egypt, Gaza’s only entry and exit point, was closed by Israel while Jabaly was away and he found himself stranded in the city. He used the time to shoot this documentary about his exile and about the Norwegian lens through which he poignantly views his beloved homeland.Jabaly’s friends and admirers in Tromsø rallied round and became his surrogate family, chiefly the heroically good-natured festival directors Hermann Greuel and Martha Otte. But when Jabaly applies for new visa to extend his stay, the online entry form refuses to accept “Palestinian” as his nationality and recognises him merely as “stateless”, which may well be a factor in causing his application to be refused. He can’t go … he can’t stay … time is running out … but Jabaly’s boyish, innocent enthusiasm seems inexhaustible (though there are moments when the same can’t exactly be said for Greuel, who sometimes comes across as Jabaly’s grumpy dad.)It’s an eye-opening and very approachable cine-essay about the real experience of exile. But a word about the title: the original Arabic is “al haya helwa”, which is what one of Jabaly’s friends cheerfully says to him on the phone. The echo of Roberto Benigni’s famous second world war Nazi death camp tragicomedy of the same title is, I think, accidental, though it brings us inadvertently and indirectly close to the worrying and problematic Israel-equals-Nazis jibe. But the film itself is too ingenuous and open for that.Life Is Beautiful is on True Story from 4 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGazaNorwayEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Would bands still dream as big? As Oasis prepare for their return gig on Friday, it’s worth asking what their cultural impact has beenTue 1 Jul 2025 06.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Jul 2025 06.38 EDTShareIn the peculiar counterfactual 2019 romcom Yesterday, the Beatles suddenly and mysteriously vanish from history, remembered by just one man. In the interests of a cheap joke, writer Richard Curtis improbably suggests that every band in the world would still exist in the Beatles’ absence, bar one:Oasis.But what about a world without Oasis? As the Gallaghers themselves would admit, they weren’t innovators like the Beatles, whose every move changed the course of popular music. If Noel had never joined Liam’s band at the end of 1991, Creation Records might well have gone bust, Manchester City would have had less pop cachet, and The Royle Family would have needed a different theme tune, but music wouldn’t have sounded significantly different. Today, new bands are more likely to cite the spiky intelligence of Radiohead or the Smiths than Oasis’s broad strokes, and very few younger than Arctic Monkeys expects to fill stadiums.What Tracey Emin beautifully described as the “brightness of things happening” did not depend on Oasis – from club culture to the Young British Artists, Trainspotting to Kate Moss, New Labour to Euro 96, the era’s colour was turned up with or without them. Nor didBritpopflow from Oasis. By the time Definitely Maybe came out in August 1994, Suede and Pulp were crashing the charts and Blur’s Parklife was on its way to going four times platinum, their paths smoothed by Matthew Bannister’s rejuvenation of Radio 1. The commercial bar for indie rock had already been raised, up to a point.Instead, as the mania around their reunion demonstrates, the Gallaghers’ unique achievement was unprecedented scale. They made alternative culture mainstream, because nobody else craved success so unapologetically: daytime airplay, No 1s, stadiums, the whole shebang. For some of their peers, this breakneck acceleration and magnification produced new opportunities. Oasis’s example made possible the second acts of Manic Street Preachers, the Verve and Robbie Williams, before inspiring the formation of younger bands such as Coldplay, the Killers, Arctic Monkeys and Kasabian. It wasn’t the sound so much as the possibility: music for the masses.View image in fullscreenMusic for the masses … The crowd at Knebworth, 1996.Photograph: Hayley Madden/ShutterstockOasis made dreaming big not just an option but a necessity. “It wasn’t: ‘Who’s good?’” the Boo Radleys’ Martin Carr complained of the cash-burning A&R hunt for the next Oasis. “It was: ‘Who’s going to be famous?’” Bands like his, accustomed to modest commercial goals, were suddenly deemed failures if their latest single missed the Top 20, and derailed by these impossible expectations. Even Damon Albarn and Jarvis Cocker soon overdosed on pop celebrity and sought stranger escape routes.Oasis alone sought and achieved true mass appeal by tapping into a communal, aspirational hedonism that suited the times. But in shrugging off indie’s underdog mentality, they also devalued its eccentric outsider’s point of view. The Britpop boom scrambled the music papers’ bearings, turning them into cheerleaders for what was popular rather than champions of what was interesting. “[Oasis] shut down the argument, shut down experimentation,” the artist Jeremy Deller once complained. “They took all the oxygen out of the scene and became the only band.”Nothing summed up the new sports-like obsession with victory more than Blur and Oasis’s news-making battle for No 1 in August 1995, which also established a crude and artificial class dynamic. Contrary to the rich and varied history of British popular music, the discourse around Oasis defined the only “authentic” working-class music as simple, direct, white, laddishly male and aggressively anti-intellectual. Noel insisted (sometimes disingenuously) that his songs meant next to nothing – they were “just about a feeling”. Oasis were a vibe, an energy, and one that lent itself to gung-ho patriotism. Contrast Albarn’s sharp ambivalence about British identity with the blunt hurrah of Noel’s union jack guitar. Oasis can’t be blamed for all these unintended consequences but they were the giant catalyst.‘Liam had been drinking all night. Noel was not in a great mood’: photographers pick their best Oasis shotRead moreToday, the Gallaghers are in every 90s nostalgia montage – Liam in bed on the cover of Vanity Fair’s Cool Britannia issue and Noel shaking hands with Tony Blair at Number 10. They remain a magnetic force, bending our collective memory towards them.So let’s again imagine that Oasis never came to pass. What’s different? Most of 90s culture proceeds anyway, only its busy diversity is more apparent. Britpop remains, but in a less anthemically populist form, closer to journalist Stuart Maconie’s original 1993 manifesto of “glamour, wit and irony”. Alternative music still crosses over but its growth is more sustainable and commercial success does not become a do-or-die metric. Tabloid gossip columns rarely overlap with the NME. Flags and politicians are still regarded with suspicion. The lows aren’t as low – but maybe the highs aren’t as high.Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockBritpopcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s both an opera masquerading in oratorio’s clothing, and a moralising object lesson in knowing your place. “Nature to each allots its proper sphere,” sings the chorus as the overly ambitious heroine goes up in smoke, charred to a crisp by the divine brilliance of her adulterous lover. It’s a point hammered home in Oliver Mears’ astute new production where the hapless Semele is a go-getting servant trapped in a palace with a slippery cad, his vengeful spouse and their glassy-eyed children.If you take William Congreve’s libretto at face value, Semele – the daughter of King Cadmus of Thebes – is a vain fly-by-night, easy prey for the jealous Juno who eggs her on to insist that her mighty paramour appears in all his flesh-consuming majesty rather than human form. Mears takes a more interesting approach, seeing in Semele a tenacious contender who honestly believes that Jupiter intends to make her his life partner. It’s clear, however, from the bookended byplay in the overture and finale that she is merely the latest in a long line of discarded women to be consumed in the royal incinerator. A cupboardful of urns, labelled Calisto, Io, Leda etc is a suitably chilling touch.Flames are pretty much everywhere in Mears’ occasionally fussy staging, from the post-coital cigarettes to the toasty fire and ominous chimney that dominate Jupiter’s love nest. Annemarie Woods’ chic sets and costumes place us in the here and now – the royal residence might be a luxe Parisian hotel – while Fabiana Piccioli’s lighting turns from playful to horrifying at the flick of a switch. The direction has its inconsistencies, and whether Mears earns the horror of his final 15 minutes given the lighter tone adopted for much of the preceding two hours is questionable, but there’s no denying the effectiveness of the denouement.View image in fullscreenDeliciously spiteful … Alice Coote (Juno) and Brindley Sherratt (Somnus) in Handel’s Semele.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianChristian Curnyn leads a respectable account of the score, though the Orchestra of theRoyal Opera Houseis occasionally too loud for the lighter voices and several singers could benefit from crisper diction. Curiously, the chorus sounds better offstage than on.With her filigree upper register, Pretty Yende is vocally appealing in the title role, making relatively light work of Myself I shall adore. She’s spirited too, though the character is sometimes sketchily defined. Ben Bliss is a smooth, articulate Jupiter, dazzling in coloratura passages and elegant in Where’er you walk. Carlo Vistoli makes for a fruity, frenetic Athamas, with Niamh O’Sullivan an intense, velvet-voiced Ino and Marianna Hovanisyan a sweet-toned Iris. Brindley Sherratt does sterling duty as Semele’s run-ragged father and the shabby God of Sleep, but it’s Alice Coote’s deliciously spiteful, yet ultimately abject Juno that gets to the emotional heart of Mears’ bleak reimagining.AtRoyal Opera House, London, until 18 July.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

From its drunkards and nosey-parkers, to its ghosts and dreamers, Ninfea Crutwell-Reade’s new reimagining connects it back to its originsNinfea Cruttwell-ReadeTue 1 Jul 2025 02.00 EDTShareIn October 1953, Dylan Thomas took part in a symposium on poetry and film in New York. Arecording of the eventcaptures the Welsh writer’s speaking voice in what would be one of his last public appearances before his death 12 days later at the age of 39. Amid the pops, ticks and crackles of the tape, we hear Thomas on sparkling form, telling the audience about an experimental play he had been to see “in a cellar or a sewer or somewhere”, accompanied by the US playwright Arthur Miller. In the middle of the performance, he recounts, Miller turned to him and remarked, “Good god, this is avant garde. In a moment the hero’s going to take his clothes off.” Roars of laughter follow this anecdote, before questions turn to Thomas’s radio play Under Milk Wood, which had enjoyed a number of public readings in New York City that year, billed as a “new comedy”.Under Milk Wood is quite a different sort of play to the avant garde production Miller and Thomas had attended. Set in the fictional Welsh town of Llareggub (“Bugger all” backwards), it documents the dreams, digressions and foibles of the town’s inhabitants in a blaze of poetic beauty and vibrant satire. It is a “play for voices”, borne out of the world of the mid-20th-century BBC radio feature – a fluid, experimental genre in which narration, acting, song, verse, music and sound effects were mixed together often without the constraint of a dramatic plot. Thomas himself was a gifted radio actor and had taken part in a number of BBC radio features, includingThe Dark Tower by Louis MacNieceandIn Parenthesisby David Jones. When Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954 on the BBC’s Third Programme, the cast was led by his friend and acting companion, Richard Burton.View image in fullscreenA gifted radio actor … Dylan Thomas at the BBC in 1948.Photograph: Pictures from History/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesI was only dimly aware of Thomas’s radio play when I was first approached about adapting it. I knew that the script contained extensive passages of memorable narration and this, alone, was enough of a draw for me. The proposition – from Nova Music Opera, Presteigne festival and Spitalfields music festival – was to compose a music-theatre adaptation of Thomas’s radio play in an abridged form combining narration, acting and singing, in the vein of Stravinsky’s l’Histoire du Soldat. I was both curious and cautious. Since its first broadcast, Milk Wood has been through all sorts of transformations – from staged theatrical productions to feature films, an animated version, a ballet, a contemporary classical opera and even a jazz suite. The question of what it means to “stage” a radio play has been debated vigorously. Then there is the challenge of setting Thomas’s words to music, given that his language already possesses such a distinctive music, shape and rhythm of its own.Exploring relationships between words and music has marked much of my work to date. I have created musical settings of poetry, fragments of prose and private letters by figures such as Rainer Maria Rilke, Don Paterson, Joseph Roth and Aubrey Beardsley. Setting words to music can be a minefield for composers. As Virginia Woolf remarked in her1937 broadcast On Craftsmanship: “Words, English words, are full of echoes, of memories, of associations – naturally. They have been out and about on people’s lips, in their houses, in the streets, in the fields, for so many centuries.” Words are living entities, but composers attempt to capture them, to fix them in a foreign structure as a jeweller would a precious stone in a metal setting.View image in fullscreenPeter O’Toole, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in a behind-the-scenes moment from the 1971 film of Under Milk Wood, directed by Andrew Sinclair.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesMy first task was to cut 90 minutes of material down to just under an hour. I shrunk it by degrees until I arrived at a shortened version of Milk Wood that preserved Thomas’s temporal arc stretching from dawn to dusk. Many of Llareggub’s most notorious residents remain in my text: Captain Cat with his seafaring memories, Mr Pugh who studies a book titled Lives of the Great Poisoners as he prepares to murder his wife, Willy Nilly the postman who reads other people’s letters, Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard and the ghosts of her two henpecked husbands, Polly Garter pursuing endless liaisons, Mr Waldo singing drunkenly in the pub, and the dead lovers who surface to haunt the living.Scenes from Under Milk Wood is written for a small mixed instrumental ensemble and a cast of one narrator, two singers and two actors who perform multiple roles. Like a fox in a hen house, I’ve enjoyed running riot with the music, devising a score that includes atmospheric underscoring for narration and spoken poetry, lyrical and declamatory operatic singing, and my attempt at a kind of modern folksong. The hybrid form of the piece connects back to the experimental radio feature world that first gave rise to Milk Wood, and the decision by our director Harvey Evans to return the production to a semi-staged radio studio is therefore fitting. Our cast turn up in the mid-1950s for a live recording session and endeavour, with scripts in hand, to bring Thomas’s eccentric characters to life, just as the original broadcasting group did over 70 years ago.View image in fullscreenNinfea Cruttwell-Reade, composerPhotograph: PRFor today’s audiences, the radio studio staging of Scenes from Under Milk Wood also provides an opportunity to be transported, in the same manner as the listeners of the 1954 broadcast, into what Evans describes as the “living mosaic” of Llareggub. The music seeks to celebrate the comedic aspects of Thomas’s loving and humorous portrait of human imperfection, bringing back into focus his subtle invitation to audiences to learn to laugh at themselves. For, as one famous jester in another age memorably put it, “Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun, it shines everywhere”.The world premiere of Scenes from Under Milk Wood is atSpitalfields festival, London, on 2 July.

Crab midweek? Yes, please, and fried rice is my fallback whenever I am in a dinner pickle. That’s not to belittle its deliciousness, complexity or elegance, though, because this spiced crab version can be as fancy as you like. That said, the speed and ease with which I can create a meal that I know everyone will love is the winning factor. Plus, I often have leftover cooked, chilled rice in the fridge, anyway, which is always the clincher (cooked rice has a better texture for frying once chilled).Spiced crab egg fried ricePrep10 minCook25 min, plus coolingServes4Fine sea salt250g jasmine riceVegetable oil4cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped½ tsp ground white pepper2 tbsp fish sauce2 tbsp soy sauce3 large eggs, beaten200g mixed crab meat1 bunch fresh coriander, finely chopped1 green chilli, finely sliced2 limes, halvedBring a large pan of salted water to a boil.
