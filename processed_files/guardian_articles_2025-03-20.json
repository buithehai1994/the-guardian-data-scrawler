But the prime minister did not reiterate his promise to put boots on the ground, instead saying allied forces would be deployed to support Ukrainian troops, including by sea and air, rather than replacing them.“The point of the security arrangements is to make it clear to Russia there will be severe consequences if they are to breach any deal,” he told reporters after the meeting.“This is why it will require a US component; because it needs to be clear to Putin that there will be severe consequences if he breaches the lines. So the purpose of this plan is to ensure that we maintain the peace – as it is in Estonia and all the other countries in which we’re deployed.”Ignored by Trump and menaced by Putin, the UK turns to the EU for defensive tiesRead moreAsked whether British troops were ever likely to serve in Ukraine as he has previously suggested, Starmer said the military planners were discussing offering support by air, sea and land. But he added: “There is a strong sense that, because of what’s happened in the last three years, the Ukrainian forces are amongst the strongest now inEurope. They’ve got the capability, they’ve got the numbers, and they’ve actually got the frontline experience.“We’re not talking about something that replaces the capability, we’re talking about something that reinforces that and then puts around it capabilities in relation to air, water and sea, and land.”A Downing Street source said Starmer’s comments reflected “the nature of moving to the operational phase”.The prime minister was speaking after meeting officers from 31 countries involved in planning how what he has referred to as the “coalition of the willing” might work in practice.Countries represented included France, Poland, the Netherlands, Romania, Canada and Australia.US and Italian officials also attended, even though the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,has describedStarmer’s plans as “risky and ineffective”, while the White House has refused to commit to supporting any western forces in Ukraine.The talks took place against the backdrop of continuing negotiations between the US, Ukraine and Russia, withtalks expected to resume in Saudi Arabia on Sunday. Officials from the three countries will discuss implementing a 30-day pause in targeting each other’s energy infrastructure while they work towards a more comprehensive deal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And therefore [we are planning for] two different scenarios.”The pause in attacks on power plants was agreed after a marathon phone call between Putin and the US president, Donald Trump, earlier this week. A Kremlin account of that call said the Russian president had used it to insist Ukraine should demilitarise and the west should stop providing military aid.Starmer rebuffed those demands on Thursday, saying: “Putin wants a defenceless Ukraine and I think that tells you everything about why we need to do this planning.“What we’re clear about is that Ukraine needs to be secure and needs to be sovereign. And if you’re sovereign, that means that you decide for yourself what defence capability you have.”He added: “You don’t let the person who’s invaded your country tell you what defence capability that you have. So I’m not surprised Putin is saying: ‘I would much rather Ukraine didn’t have any defence,’ because that’s exactly what happened before in Minsk [in 2014], and he breached the line, which I think doubly underlines my argument that we need security arrangements in place.“It does mean that the planning here is on the basis that we continue to build up the Ukrainian forces.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerVladimir PutinForeign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Nevertheless, at the White House, Trump repeated his campaign promise to “send education back to the states”.What is the US Department of Education and what does it do?Read moreThe executive order targeting the education department, which has been expected for weeks, directed McMahon to take all necessary steps to shut down key functionalities. Trump added at the signing ceremony that he hoped McMahon would be the last education secretary.“My administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department. We’re going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. It’s doing us no good,” Trump said.McMahon appeared to smile in acknowledgment as she sat in the front row at the signing event in the East Room. Trump spoke from a stage in front of a row of state flags, and flanked on each side by a group of schoolchildren sitting at small desks.The bulk of the education department’s budget is made up of federal grant and loan programs, including the $18.4bn Title I program that provides funding to high-poverty K-12 schools and the $15.5bn Idea program that helps cover the education costs for students with disabilities.The White House said those programs, as well as the $1.6tn federal student loan program, would not be affected by the order. It was not immediately clear what spending cuts the administration would be able to achieve without cutting those initiatives.The move comes after theadministrationhas already taken steps to undercut the department’s authority by instituting a round of layoffs that hasreduced its workforce by nearly halfand cancelled dozens of grants and contracts.The idea of shutting down the education department dates back to efforts by Republicans in the 1980s. But the push has become increasingly mainstream in recent years as pro-Trump grassroots activists took aim at agendas that promoted education standards and more inclusive policies.Trump’s plans to axe US education department put marginalized students most at risk, experts warnRead moreCongressman Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, separatelyintroduceda one-sentence bill in January that would terminate the education department at the end of 2026. Similar efforts have failed to get enough votes to pass in previous years.The Trump administration’s efforts to shutter the education department havelargely followedthe playbook inProject 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s rightwing manifesto to remake the federal government, which envisions the department as a “statistics-gathering agency that disseminates information to the states”.Democrats on Capitol Hill denounced the executive order and warned it could leave in jeopardy millions of low-income families, who rely on federal funding in schools.“Shutting down the Department of Education will harm millions of children in our nation’s public schools, their families and hardworking teachers. Class sizes will soar, educators will be fired, special education programs will be cut and college will get even more expensive,” Hakeem Jeffries, the US House minority leader, said in a statement.The progressive wing of the House Democratic caucus also denounced Trump’s order as an unconstitutional attempt to evade seeking congressional approval to implement his political agenda.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Programs that don’t affect students directly, such as those that go toward teacher training, could also be on the chopping block. Expanding the use and promotion of school vouchers and installing “parents’ rights” policies are also likely.All the executive orders Trump has signed so farRead moreIn late January, Trump signed executive orders to promote school choice, or the use of public dollars for private education, and to remove funding from schools accused of “radical indoctrination”. Trump also revived a “1776 commission” to “promote patriotic education”.The education departmentboastedthat in the first week of the Trump administration it had “dismantled” diversity, equity and inclusion programs.Soon after Trump took over, the department was loaded with key staffers tied to a rightwing thinktank, the America First Policy Institute, oftenreferredto as a “White House in waiting”. The thinktank has supported driving out diversity programs and banning books, which the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism documented in areporton the institute’s ties to the education department. The policy institute has promotedinstallingChristianity in government, including in schools.The department ended investigations into book banning and got rid of a book-ban coordinator position last month in a moveannouncedby Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, who previously held a role at the thinktank.This article was amended on 20 March 2025. An earlier version incorrectly stated Congressman Massie introduced a separate one-sentence bill on Friday; he introduced it in January.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpUS educationProject 2025SchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

That is likely to worsen, as food production in such regions is dependent on mountain waters, melting snow and glaciers, according to theWorld Water Development Report 2025.‘A dream experiment’: our Australian icebreaker is on a crucial mission to Antarctica | Nathan BindoffRead moreDeveloped countries are also at risk: in the US, for example, theColorado River basin has been in droughtsince 2000, and higher temperatures mean more of the precipitation is falling as rain, which runs off more quickly than mountain snow, exacerbating drought conditions.Audrey Azoulay, the director general ofUnesco, said: “Regardless of where we live, we all depend in some way on mountains and glaciers. But these natural water towers are facing imminent peril. This report demonstrates the urgent need for action.”The rate of change of glaciers is the worst on record, according to separate research from the World Meteorological Organisation, whichpublished its annual State of the Climate report this week. The largest three-year loss of glacier mass on record occurred in the past three years, the study found, with Norway, Sweden, Svalbard and the tropical Andes among the worst-affected areas.Eastern Africa has lost 80% of its glaciers in places and, in the Andes, between a third and a half of glaciers have melted since 1998.Glaciersin the Alps and the Pyrenees, the worst affected in Europe, have shrunk by about 40% over roughly the same period.The decline of glaciers has had a further impact, added Abou Amani, director of water sciences at Unesco, in that the loss of ice replaces a reflective surface with dark soil that absorbs heat. “Glaciers melting have an impact on the reflectivity of [solar] radiation and that will impact the whole climate system,” he warned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Pooling water from melting glaciers can also be released, causingsudden floods in valleys or to people living further down the slopes. Permafrost is also melting, releasingmethane from the mountain soils that melting glaciers are uncovering.A previous study, published last month in the peer-reviewed journal Nature, found thathalf of global glacier mass would be lost by the end of the century, if global heating was not halted. Alex Brisbourne, a glacier geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey, said: “Mountain glaciers contain some of the largest freshwater reservoirs on Earth. Meltwater released in the summer provides the water supply to a billion people and sustains an enormous amount of industry and agriculture. The impact [of such melting] will be felt way beyond those immediately downstream of the glaciers.”These impacts are coming at a time whenmany food sources are already under strain. Alvaro Lario, president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad) and chair of UN-Water, called for more support for people who live in afflicted mountain regions. “Water flows downhill, but food insecurity rises uphill. Mountains provide 60% of our freshwater, but the communities that safeguard these vital resources are among the most food insecure,” he said.“We must invest in their resilience to protect glaciers, rivers, and a shared future for all of us.”Explore more on these topicsGlaciersClimate crisisPolar regionsUnescoUnited NationsFarmingWaternewsShareReuse this content"

Honey, we’re going to call a fig a fig, and we’re going to call a Nazi salute what it was,” Wilson said. “That shit was definitely a Nazi salute.”Wilson entered the public eye last year after Musk spoke about her in a podcast, saying that he had been “tricked” into signing documents so that Wilson, who was 16 at the time, could receive gender-affirming medical treatment.“I lost my son, essentially. They call it ‘deadnaming’ for a reason. The reason they call it ‘deadnaming’ is because your son is dead.” he said. Musk added that the experience made him vow “to destroy the woke mind virus after that, and we’re making some progress”.In aninterviewwith NBC News last year, Wilson said that Musk had been largely absent in her life and that he was often cruel to her for showing feminine traits when she was growing up. She went to California court in 2022 to officially remove “Musk” from her name, saying in court filings she “no longer live[s] with or wish[es] to be related to my biological father in any way shape or form”.“He was cold,” she told NBC News. “He’s very quick to anger. He is uncaring and narcissistic.”By law, Wilson had to get her father, whom she had not spoken to for months at that point, to sign off on her receiving gender-affirming medical treatment, since she was a minor at the time.“I was constantly having mental breakdowns in the middle of class. I could not get through days. I didn’t want to wake up, I didn’t want to do anything. I just wanted to rot, pretty much. It was like, I cannot do this,” she said. “If I stay in the closet anymore, this is going to take me down a very destructive path.”Wilson, who is currently a student in Tokyo, said that she felt obligated to talk about trans issues as someone who transitioned as a minor.“There’s so much villainization of that, and I would really like to raise awareness of the fact that trans care for minors, especially puberty blockers, is really important,” she said. “Maybe stop demonizing these literal children or the people around these children who are just trying to help them feel comfortable in their own skin.”Over the last several years, conservatives have targeted the transgender community through legislation. Since coming into office, Trump has signed executive orders banning transgender people from the military and fromparticipatingin women’s sports. On Wednesday, a federal judgeblockedTrump’s ban on trans people serving in the military.“As a trans woman, I am terrified of losing access to guaranteed medical care. If I didn’t medically transition at the age I did, I don’t know what would’ve happened,” Wilson said.Wilson said that her mother, Justine Musk, Musk’s first wife, had been supportive of her and that she “doesn’t keep up with [Musk’s] side of the family”. Musk, an outspoken pronatalist, has 14 children with four different women.When asked whether she is on good terms with her siblings, Wilson responded: “I will say I do not actually know how many siblings I have, if you include half-siblings.”Though her father is a billionaire who is playing a major role in theTrump administration, Wilson said Musk doesn’t loom large in her life.“People thrive off of fear. I’m not giving anyone that space in my mind,” she said. “The only thing that gets to live free in my mind are drag queens.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Gary Dobson and David Norris were jailed for life in 2012.The original police investigation into the teenager’s death was marred by institutional racism in theMetropolitan police, incompetence and alleged corruption.Norris, 48, was jailed for a minimum of 14 years and three months for murder in January 2012 at the end of an Old Bailey trial.He is set to face his first parole hearing on a date yet to be fixed, and on Thursday the Parole Boardgranted an application for the hearing to be held in public.In the ruling, the vice-chair of the board, Peter Rook KC, said: “After the trial, Mr Norris continued to deny the offence.“Recent reports now suggest he has accepted he was present at the scene and punched the victim but claims that he did not wield the knife.“He does not accept he holds racist views.”The report also detailed “continuing significant risks” to Norris’s safety in prison.“He has been the victim of at least three assaults whilst in prison,” Rook said. “On two occasions he received serious injuries. The latest was in November 2022.”View image in fullscreenStephen LawrenceHe was diagnosed with PTSD in November 2023, according to the report.Norris’s lawyers argued against the parole hearing being held in public, saying it will increase the risk to his safety and that the inmate will not be able to give his “best evidence” given concerns that the media will “sensationalise the proceedings”.Stephen Lawrence’s parents are said to be supportive of the public hearing.His father, Neville Lawrence, has previously said he is not satisfied with Norris getting parole but if he can show remorse he will accept it.Lawrence told the Daily Mail: “He would have to say he was sorry for killing Stephen and that he had changed his ways and apologise to our family [for me to accept his release].“I am not satisfied with him getting parole but what I am saying is if he can show remorse and show he’s changedthen I will accept that.”Explore more on these topicsStephen LawrenceUK criminal justiceMetropolitan policeRaceLondonPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

In 2018-19, the last academic year before the Covid-19 pandemic, 60,247 were classed as severely absent.And the unauthorised absence rate rose from 2.4% in 2022-23 to 2.5% in 2023-24, according to the figures. In 2018-19, the rate was only 1.4%.Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “We need to accept that schools cannot solve this issue on their own and must set out clear expectations and plans for parents, government, schools and other agencies to work together in the best interests of young people.“This must be backed with funding to ensure there is sufficient capacity in the system for all children to get any additional support they require to be able to attend school on a regular basis.“Without investing in a strategic response to this issue, it is difficult to see how attendance rates are going to change at the scale required.”In September, school absence fines in England rose from £60 to £80, and a parent who receives a second fine for the same child within a three-year period will now receive a £160 fine.The latest DfE attendance data covers the last academic year before fines for unauthorised absences were increased.Bridget Phillipson warns parents against ‘casual attitude’ to school attendanceRead moreLast week, the education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, called on school and college leaders to “catch up fast” to improve pupil attendance, and said some schools were “not making enough progress” on absences.Overall, the absence rate decreased from 7.4% in 2022-23 to 7.1% in 2023-24 but it remains higher than pre-pandemic rates of 4.7%, the data suggests.One in five pupils in England, about 1.49 million young people, were “persistently absent” during the 2023-24 school year, which means they missed 10% or more school sessions.This is down on 2022-23 when 21.2% of pupils were persistently absent, but it is still above the rate in 2018-19 of 10.9%.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “These figures make it clear that the current approach to solving absence just isn’t working. Simply increasing the pressure on schools, without providing any additional resource for them to tackle the issue, is fruitless.“The only way to actually make progress is to look at the causes of absence – from parental attitude changes, holiday pricing, and children and young people’s experiences of mental health and poverty.“Unless we begin to improve those things, absence will continue.”Analysis from a thinktank earlier this week found that unauthorised school absence is a leading cause of thewidening performance gapbetween disadvantaged pupils and their peers in England. The research by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) found that all the increase in the “disadvantage gap” among 16-year-olds since 2019 can be explained by students on free school meals (FSM) missing more time at school than other pupils, putting them several months behind in terms of their results.The EPI calculated that if disadvantaged pupils had the same attendance record as other pupils, the attainment gap at age 11 would be almost 10% smaller, and the gap at age 16 would be 20% lower.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The government inherited a broken system, with children and families facing poor outcomes and barriers to opportunity. The case for tackling the epidemic of school absence could not be clearer: improved grades, higher wages, better life chances.“Tackling this issue is everyone’s responsibility – government, schools, parents, and children – and we need a national effort to get our kids back in the classroom. We have made some encouraging progress this academic year, but more must be done and this month we have brought together ministers and over 2,000 school leaders up and down the country to share best practices to drive up attendance.Parents in England: share your experience of your children being absent from schoolRead more“As part of our plan for change, we [are] determined to turn the tide on poor attendance and break down barriers to opportunity – whether it’s through free breakfast clubs, improved mental health support, additional investment in family support, or more focus from Ofsted.”Explore more on these topicsSchool attendance and absenceSchoolsBridget PhillipsonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m looking forward to being back in the Free State of Florida to celebrate with all of you.”Data from the MPs’ register of interests shows that Farage has registered an estimated 800 hours of work since entering parliament, while also carrying out his job as leader of the Reform party.His paid social media work, articles for the Telegraph, job as a brand ambassador for a gold company, speeches and GB News presenting role work out at about 22 hours a week in additional employment since early July.The total shows he rivals Geoffrey Cox, the highly paid barrister and former attorney general, for the most time spent on work outside his job as an MP. Between 2009 and 2021, Cox worked about 600 to 1,600 hours on outside interests every year.Matt Western, the Labour MP for Warwick and Leamington, said: “It’s embarrassing thatNigel Faragespent decades trying to get into parliament, and now he has, he does everything but represent his Clacton constituents.”Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokesperson, added: “Nigel Farage is acting like the MP for Mar-a-Lago, not Clacton-on-Sea. He’s a part-time parliamentarian – working harder for Trump than for the people he represents. His party’s in a shambles and it looks like his priorities are, too.”Farage’s spokesperson was contacted for comment. The Reform UK leader has previously defended his position, saying he is representing Clacton on the world stage and pointing out he is regularly in his constituency, where he has now bought a home.Farage’s outside work and trips to the US do not appear to have dented support for the party, which is challenging Labour and the Tories in a three-way battle to top the opinion polls.On Thursday, Greg Smith, a Conservative shadow minister, hinted at the idea of a pact with Farage’s party, despite the insistence of the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, that this will not happen.“I think if we want to get rid of socialism from this country, there may well be a point where the right-of-centre parties have to play nicely,” he told TalkTV.The Lib Dems said Smith should be sacked for making such a suggestion.Farage is trying to shrug off the dramatic fallout with his now former MP, Rupert Lowe, which has caused unhappiness among grassroots members. Lowe had the whip suspended afteraccusations that he was abusivetowards the Reform chair, Zia Yusuf, which he denies.Lowe also gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which he described Farage as “messianic” and said he should delegate more power if he is serious about winning an election.A number of Reform branch officials have resigned as a result of the row, which has hit the party at a time when it needs maximum manpower fora byelection in Runcorn, elections in several mayoralties from Doncaster to Lincoln, and the local council elections in May.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageEssexDonald TrumpReform UKFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

Their lawyers argued that they were innocent and trial evidence was flawed.Iranian activist Masih Alinejad: ‘It’s the start of the end for the Islamic Republic’Read moreAlinejad, 48, was targeted byIranfor her online campaigns encouraging women there to record videos of themselves exposing their hair in violation of edicts requiring they cover it in public.Iran offered $500,000 for a July 2022 plot to kill Alinejad after efforts to harass, smear and intimidate her failed, prosecutors said.American officials have accused Iran of backing several assassination plots in the United States, including against Donald Trump when he was campaigning last year. Tehran has denied being behind any plots to kill people in the US.Alinejad, who was not in court, told the Associated Press she cried when she learned about the verdict.“I am relieved that after nearly three years, the men who plotted to kill me have been found guilty. But make no mistake, the real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran,” she said.Alinejad testified last week that she came to the United States in 2009 after she was banned from covering Iran’s disputed presidential election and the newspaper where she worked was shut down.Establishing herself in New York City, she built an online audience of millions and launched her “My Stealthy Freedom” campaign, telling Iranian women to send photos and videos of themselves exposing their hair when the “morality police” were not around.Soon, she said, she had inspired women to take to the streets in Iran on Wednesdays to peacefully protest, leading the government to arrest hundreds of them. The crackdown only caused her following to grow, however.At the trial, prosecutors said that by 2022, the Iranian government had enlisted high-level Russian mobsters, including Amirov and Omarov, to kill Alinejad.Khalid Mehdiyev, a former member of the Russian mob who lived in Yonkers and worked at a pizzeria, testified that he was hired as the hitman. Like Amirov and Omarov, he is from Azerbaijan, which shares a border and cultural ties with Iran.Mehdiyev, who cooperated with prosecutors after pleading guilty to multiple crimes, said he bought an AK-47 to kill Alinejadbut the plan was foiledwhen his car was stopped by police and the gun was found in the back seat in July 2022. A doorbell camera at Alinejad’s home recorded Mehdiyev standing on her front porch.Prosecutors have kept the investigation open. In October they announcedcharges against a senior Iranian military officialand three others, none of whom are in custody.Alinejad said she had had to move nearly two dozen times since the assassination plot was discovered, at times feeling guilty that so many of her followers in Iran lack a safety net.That, she said, only “makes me more determined to give voice to voiceless people”.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkIranUS crimeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The American Arbitration Association’s emergency arbitrator, Nicholas Gowen, said that without emergency relief, Meta would suffer “immediate and irreparable loss”. Meta argued that the memoir is prohibited under a non-disparagement agreement signed by Wynn-Williams.The book was announced just one week before publication, meaning there was only a week-long window for pre-orders, which are normally open for months and help boost a book’s chart position.Wynn-Williams’ memoir is her account of seven years she spent at the company. She “had become part of what reads like a diabolical cult run by emotionally stunted men babies, institutionally enabled sexual harassers and hypocritical virtue-signalling narcissists”, writes Stuart Jeffries in anObserver review.The memoir is an “ugly, detailed portrait of one of the most powerful companies in the world”, wrote Jennifer Szalai in the New York Times. Wynn-Williams “had a front-row seat to some of Facebook’s most ignominious episodes”.Meta has described the book as “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about [its] executives”.The emergency ruling dictated that Wynn-Williams must stop promoting the book, refrain from “amplifying any further disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments”, and retract previous disparaging comments “to the extent within her control”.It did not order any action by the publisher. “As publishers, we are committed to upholding freedom of speech and her right to tell her story,” said a spokesperson for Pan Macmillan.Explore more on these topicsBooksMetanewsShareReuse this content"

Composite: SuppliedUS claims tattoos prove membership of Tren de Aragua gang but relatives describe tributes to God, family and Real MadridByTom PhillipsandClavel RangelThu 20 Mar 2025 19.42 EDTFirst published on Thu 20 Mar 2025 18.54 EDTShareLike many Venezuelans of his generation, Franco José Caraballo Tiapa is a man of many tattoos.There is one of a rose, one of a lion, and another – on the left side of the 26-year-old’s neck – of a razor blade that represents his work as a barber.Two other tattoos pay tribute to Caraballo’s eldest daughter, Shalome: a pocket watch featuring the time of her birth and some black lettering on his chest that spells out the four-year-old’s name.“He’s just a normal kid … he likes tattoos – that’s it,” said Martin Rosenow, a Florida-based attorney who represents the Venezuelan asylum seeker – one ofscores shipped to El Salvador by the Trump administration last weekendas part of his hard-line immigration crackdown.View image in fullscreenTattoos on the body of Franco José Caraballo Tiapa.Caraballo’s fondness for body art may have been his undoing. For when the father of two was detained by US immigration officials in Dallas last month, they appear to have taken those tattoos as proof that he was a member ofVenezuela’s most notorious gang, Tren de Aragua.An official Department of Homeland Security document issued in early February and reviewed by the Guardian states: “[The] subject [Caraballo] has been identified as a Member/Active of Tren de Aragua” although it does not explain how agents reached that conclusion. The same document notes that Caraballo – who it calls a “Deportable/Excludable Alien” – has several tattoos and no known criminal history “at this time”.Rosenow rejected the idea that the images inked on to his client’s skin indicated gang membership. “It’s specious – there’s no basis [for this conclusion],” he said. “Experts in Venezuela who study the gang have all stated that there are no tattoos that associate gang members. It’s not like the Central American MS-13 gang where tattoos are relevant in their organization.”“Tren de Agua has no [specific] tattoos,” Rosenow continued. “If you see pictures [of actual Tren de Aragua members arrested in the US], they’re shirtless and many of them don’t even have tattoos.“I’m nauseated by it all. I’m distressed for these individuals. I’m sad for what this means. As an American, for me it’s disgraceful that we would violate human rights so flagrantly on an international level.”Caraballo, who hails from the Venezuelan state of Bolívar and entered the US over its southern border in October 2023, is one of several Venezuelans whom immigration officials appear to have identified as gang members based on little more than their nationality and their tattoos.Daniel Alberto Lozano CamargoDaniel Alberto Lozano Camargo, a 20-year-old asylum seeker from Maracaibo in western Venezuela, lived in Houston, Texas where he washed cars for a living, advertising his services on Facebook.His partner, a US citizen called Leslie Aranda, said he was arrested last November after being contacted by a supposed client. She has not heard from him since last Friday, when Donald Trump invoked sweeping wartime powers called the Alien Enemies Act to deport people considered a threat, such as members of Tren de Aragua, which was last monthdesignated a foreign terrorist organization.Daniel Alberto Lozano CamargoDaniel Alberto Lozano Camargo.Like other Venezuelans now detained and at risk of deportation, Lozano has several tattoos, said Aranda, 25. He has the name of his partner’s daughter, Danessy, on one arm. A rose. The name of his niece, Eurimar, with a crown over the letter E. Praying hands on his neck. His father’s name, Adalberto, and his initials. Lozano also has the date of his anniversary with Aranda: 19 January 2023. Another tattoo reads “King of Myself.”“I know his father’s name is significant to him because he died when Daniel was young. And I also know he didn’t really like the rose tattoo because a friend who was practising did it. Daniel loves art and tattoos – that’s why he has them,” Aranda said.Lozano’s mother, Daniela, who is also in the US, said: “They violated his human rights – it’s an injustice. He doesn’t belong to any gang.”Neri José Alvarado BorgesThe sister of Neri José Alvarado Borges, another Venezuelan deported toEl Salvador, said the 24-year-old also had tattoos that relatives suspect may have led to him being ​wrongly identified as a criminal.​One says “Family”, another says “Brothers” and a third, on his left thigh, features the name of his younger brother, Neryelson, who is autistic, and the rainbow-colored​ infinity symbol of the autism acceptance movement.Neri José Alvarado BorgesNeri José Alvarado Borges.“None of these tattoos has anything at all to do with the Tren de Aragua,” said his sister, Lisbengerth Montilla, 20. “But for them [immigration authorities] anyone with a tattoo is connected to Tren de Aragua.”Montilla said her brother was no gangster. In fact, he was a psychology​ student who had been forced to abandon his studies and migrate to the US nine months ago because ofVenezuela’s economic collapse.After trekking through the perilous Darién Gap jungle and entering the US, Alvarado, who has no criminal history, built a life in Dallas where he worked in a bakery.“Many of us have come here because of the situation back in our country,” said Montilla, who also lives in the US. “There were times when we didn’t even have food to eat or have the money to buy anything. Many people fled because of the dictatorship in Venezuela, seeking a better future.​“Not all of those people [deported to El Salvador] are criminals – and not all Venezuelans are bad people. We are from a decent, hard-working and upstanding family. We’ve never had problems with anybody.”Luis Carlos José Marcano SilvaView image in fullscreenLuis Carlos José Marcano Silva.Luis Carlos José Marcano Silva, a 26-year-old barber from the Venezuelan island of Margarita, was detained at an immigration hearing in Miami last month. His tattoos also seemingly played a role in his detention and deportation to El Salvador.One, on Marcano’s belly, shows the face of Jesus of Nazareth. Another, on his arm, shows an infinity symbol while a third features the name of his daughter, Adelys. His chest is emblazoned with the image of a crown.“[At the hearing] all they kept telling him was that he belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang. When his wife contacted the lawyer, they said it was probably because of his tattoos,” said Marcano’s mother, Adelys del Valle Silva Ortega, denying that her son has any links to the crime group or even a criminal record.“I feel frustrated, desperate. I imagine they are not treating him well. I’ve already seen videos of that prison,” Silva said of the notorious Salvadoran “anti-terrorism” jail where her son is now thought to be incarcerated. “I think of him every moment, praying to the Virgin of the Valley [a Venezuelan patron saint] to protect him.”Jerce Reyes BarriosThe lawyer for a fifth Venezuelan man deported to El Salvador, a former professional footballer called Jerce Reyes Barrios, 36, has also claimed his tattoos played a role in sealing his fate.Reyes’s tattoos include one of a crown sitting atop a soccer ball with a rosary and the word “Dios” (God). In a sworn declaration, his California-based attorney, Linette Tobin, said the Department of Homeland Security had alleged this tattoo was proof of gang membership.“In reality, he chose this tattoo because it is similar to the logo for his favourite soccer team, Real Madrid,” Tobin said in her statement on Wednesday.Tobin rejected the idea that her client was a gang member and said he had fled Venezuela in early 2024 after being detained at an anti-government demonstration by security forces. Reyes was subsequently “taken to a clandestine building where he was tortured” with electric shocks and suffocation.Tobin saidUS immigrationofficials had reviewed her client’s social media posts and found one in which he made “a hand gesture that they allege is proof of gang membership”.“In fact, the gesture is a common one that means I Love You in sign language and is commonly used as a rock’n’roll symbol,” Tobin said.Francisco Javier García CasiqueSebastián García Casique, the brother of a sixth Venezuelan deported to El Salvador, said his sibling, Francisco Javier García Casique, also had tattoos, including of a rose, a compass and a phrase reading: “God chooses his toughest battles for his best warriors.”Francisco Javier García CasiqueFrancisco Javier García Casique.A fourth tattoo says: “Vivir el momento” (Live in the Moment). A fifth says in English: “Family”.In September 2021 García posted an Instagram video of a tattoo of a timepiece being inked on to his right arm by an artist in Peru, where he then lived. “My tattoo in tribute to my two grandmas who I love and miss a lot,” García wrote.Anyelo Sarabia GonzálezIn a sworn declaration, the sister of Anyelo Sarabia González, Solanyer Michell Sarabia González, said her 19-year-old brother had been detained by immigration agents at the start of this year in Dallas and that those agents had asked “about a tattoo that is visible on his hand” showing a rose with money as its petals.“He had that tattoo done … because he thought it looked cool,” González’s sister said, adding that she believed her brother had been sent to El Salvador “under the false pretence that he was a member of Tren de Aragua”.“The tattoo has no meaning or connection to any gang,” said González, 25. Two other tattoos on her brother’s body – of the phrases “strength and courage” and “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” – were also not gang-related, she said.Franco José Caraballo TiapaRosenow also saw no indication that his client – who he said had sought asylum on the basis of political persecution after taking part in opposition protests – was involved in the Venezuelan gang. He said Caraballo’s “cheesy” and romantic Instagram posts indicated he was not “a vicious gang member”.Franco José Caraballo TiapaFranco José Caraballo TiapaA Venezuelan criminal background check issued earlier this month indicates Caraballo has no criminal record there. Francisco Javier García Casique’s family has also published evidence that he had no criminal record back home.The White House has described the Venezuelans deported to El Salvador as “heinous monsters” and terrorists but has yet to release detailed information about their identities, let alone their alleged crimes.On Thursday afternoon CBS News published an internal governmentlistof the 238 Venezuelan deportees, which included the names of all of the men in this story.On Monday, a senior official from immigration and customs enforcement, Robert Serna, admitted that “many” of those removed from the US under the Alien Enemy Act did not have criminal records in the US, but he nevertheless said they were Tren de Aragua members.The fact that those people did not have a criminal record “is because they have only been in the country for a short period of time”, Serna said.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpVenezuelaEl SalvadornewsShareReuse this content"

While the combination of US disengagement from Europe and the reality of Russian aggression has forced a reappraisal of security across the continent, Britain’s half-in, half-out status makes for complications.The prime minister,Keir Starmer, wanted to showcase Britain’s credentials as a European military leader on Thursday, first with a visit to the Barrow shipyard where nuclear submarines are built and then to look into a meeting of 30-plus military heads, mostly from Europe, as they discuss how to create a post-war stabilisation force for Ukraine.Yet the message was somewhat undermined by the EU’s announcement a day earlier thatit would set up a €150bn defence investment lending scheme, from which the UK (and the US) would simply be excluded, because it is not a member and does not have an associate or special status like Norway or Ukraine.In reality, the apparent bar is not quite so serious, as long as the two sides agree a defence and security pact soon.Labour has been pushing for a defence treatywith the bloc since before the election, and the hope is that negotiations will conclude in time for an EU-UK summit in May, which would give the UK partial access to the scheme.The initial EU proposal – pushed hard by France,despite close Anglo-French working over the Ukraine stabilisation force– is that British manufacturers will then only be able to access 35% of the money available. That proportion is not set, however, and a successful negotiation may see an increase for the UK, or some other exception.It will be a test for Labour, which has brought some sanity to the UK’s relationship with the EU but not otherwise sought to redraw the post-Brexit settlement. Under the Conservatives, the UK military pulled out of missions like the EU’s EUFOR peacekeeping mission in Bosnia amid fears that British soldiers would have to wear an operational badge with an EU flag on.A key element of Labour’s forthcoming defence review was always going to be developing the arms industry to promote economic growth, even before the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, declared last month thatWashington was no longer “primarily focused” on defending EuropeandTrump began his telephone diplomacy with Putin, with the two men discussing the fate of Ukraine.The numbers working in defence are not necessarily large – 147,500, according to the ADS trade body – but 70% of defence jobs are outside London and the south-east. Manufacturing sites also make a critical contribution to local economies, in shipyards like Barrow or Rosyth on the Forth in Scotland, or at airfields such as Warton and Samlesbury in Lancashire, and trade unions heavily invested in their success.But the events of last month have given the European defence effort a far greater urgency. Though Britain has always split its procurement between the UK, US and partners in Europe, the sight ofTrump stopping military aid to Ukraineand halting intelligence sharing with almost no notice has not been attractive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the alarm that followed, the makers of the US F-35 jet were even forced to put out a statement saying “there is no kill switch” that the US could operate remotely at a moment’s notice, though a more realistic concern is that without continuing US logistics and software support, an F-35 would become unusable quickly.The history of Anglo-American military cooperation is so long and deep that it hard to imagine it falling apart in a crisis even with Trump in the White House. But long-term military planning is also about contingency and what Britain needs is to deepen its security and defence industrial relationship withEuropenot as an alternative but in parallel with its relationship with the US.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyEuropean UnionKeir StarmerDonald TrumpVladimir PutinUkraineEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyAhead of her 40th birthday next week, we look back over the 25-year big-screen career of the Oscar-nominated actor, from Atonement to Love Actually, Pride & Prejudice to Star WarsByRebecca NicholsonThu 20 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 14.13 EDTShare20. The Hole (2001)View image in fullscreenKnightley as Frankie with Thora Birch as Liz.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyKnightley’s first big role was in this teen thriller, about four private school kids partying in a bomb shelter, where it all goes predictably haywire. It’s a horror, and not just for the sheer dominance of low-rise bootcut jeans. Even in its more hysterical moments, Knightley brings nuance to the posh-girl stereotype.19. The Edge of Love (2008)Ostensibly about the poet Dylan Thomas, this ended up being more about the complicated relationship between his wife, Caitlin (Sienna Miller), and his ex-girlfriend, Vera. As a film, it is a bit of a mess and struggles to soar, but the performances, and particularly Knightley’s turn as the glamorous Vera, help to lift it.18. Silent Night (2021)The first of two films in which Knightley has to navigate the end of the world, and one of the bleakest conceits for a Christmas comedy ever thought up. While Knightley is perfectly at ease with a thriller or a period drama, this gruesome dinner-party piece shows she can do uptight country house black comedy, too.17. Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace (1999)As the decoy and “loyal bodyguard” to Natalie Portman’s Queen Amidala, Knightley gets to act the part of an actor, of sorts. She spends most of the film cloaked in black, in heavy makeup, delivering lines with a regal monotony, but it was a splashy start to her big Hollywood career.16. Seeking a Friend For the End of the World (2012)View image in fullscreenAs the ditzy Penny in the romantic comedy Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyConceptually ahead of its time and with a cast far better than you might expect, Lorene Scafaria’s film sees Knightley again hanging out at the apocalypse, this time accompanying Steve Carell. Watching his dopey misanthropic energy collide with Knightley doing her best manic Brits-y dream girl is quite the ride.15. Boston Strangler (2023)This noir-ish take on the infamous serial killer and the journalist who gave him his moniker sees Knightley playing a hard-boiled, tenacious reporter. Ultimately, the film is less about the killer/s than it is about the victims, and about journalist Loretta McLaughlin’s uphill battle to have the case, and herself, taken seriously.14. Love Actually (2003)Knightley was 17 when she played Juliet, the subject of Andrew Lincoln’s silent, card-holding declaration of his affections towards his best mate’s wife, which is either disgusting or romantic, depending on how you look at it (Knightley has hedged her bets, calling it “creepy and sweet”). She doesn’t have to do a lot here, but the film, and that scene, have taken on a seemingly endless afterlife of their own.Mark (Andrew Lincoln) shows his cards.Keira Knightley says she was ‘stalked by men’ after Pirates of the Caribbean and told ‘you wanted this’Read more13. Misbehaviour (2020)This likable ensemble saw Knightley playing the real-life historian and activist Sally Alexander. It took the rise of second-wave feminism and the plot to disrupt the 1970 Miss World pageant, and used them as a semi-screwball caper. Knightley was more of a straight woman, but its playful underbelly was a way for it to make some complex points about the protest and who was included, or not, in the uproar.12. Pirates of the Caribbean franchise (2003-20o7)She recently called the films “a very confused place in her head”, but this was the blockbuster franchise that made her a box office star. As Elizabeth Swann, Knightley gamely swashbuckled her way through the high seas in a sort of high-end, big-budget, crowd-pleasing panto.11. Begin Again (2013)On paper, it should have been unbearably twee, but it’s a crowd-pleaser, and then some. Knightley sings her way through this modern-day fairytale about a recently dumped folk singer who crosses paths with Mark Ruffalo’s recently fired A&R man. Is it possible for them to sidestep the corporate machine? She plays a lot of songs in a lot of different places to try to find out.10. A Dangerous Method (2011)David Cronenberg takes Knightley’s long-established proficiency in a corset and, well, Cronenbergs it. As Sabina Spielrein, one of Carl Jung’s psychiatric patients, and later one of the first women to become a psychoanalyst, Knightley does some serious acting. It is a film stuffed with big performances, and she more than holds her own.9. The Duchess (2008)She shines as the titular and put-upon Georgiana, who at 17 is married off to the Duke of Devonshire and set to work to produce an heir. It has all the elements of the key Knightley roles: a country house and a woman who rejects social expectations while strapped into some heavy corsetry and also being somewhat doomed, despite a steady display of defiance.8. Anna Karenina (2012)View image in fullscreenIn the title role of Anna Karenina.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyIt was perhaps inevitable that Knightley would end up taking on Tolstoy’s complex heroine in this faithful period drama, albeit seen through the less conventional lens of director and regular collaborator Joe Wright. It is a formidable task, and she delivers a performance that cuts through some of its more experimental flourishes.7. Never Let Me Go (2010)Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel, about clones created in a lab and raised as organ donors, is now a school curriculum staple. While Carey Mulligan takes the lead as Kathy, Knightley is more spirited as her best friend and occasional foil, Ruth. Despite the heavy subject matter, the film chooses a taciturn, almost workaday approach, but Knightley embodies its quiet, steady sense of tragedy.6. Colette (2018)View image in fullscreenAs the eponymous hero in Colette.Photograph: TCD/Prod DB/AlamyKeira Knightley: 'I can’t act the flirt or mother to get my voice heard. It makes me feel sick'Read moreIf Knightley sometimes errs towards stiff-upper-lip restraint, then she lets loose in this retelling of the French author’s first book, published under her husband’s name, Willy. When the marriage becomes toxic and she rejects his controlling ways and finds her own voice, she starts to explore big and exuberant questions about sex, talent and fame.5. Bend It Like Beckham (2002)This slow-burn fan favourite continues to win new aficionados today, two decades after its low-key release. The film belongs to Parminder Nagra’s Jess, but as sidekick Jules, Knightley gives heart and depth to the footballing tomboy fighting her mother’s expectations of who she should be.4. Pride & Prejudice (2005)View image in fullscreenAs Elizabeth Bennet with Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) in Pride & Prejudice.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyThe first of Knightley’s two Oscar nominations came for her Elizabeth Bennet, in Joe Wright’s starry and elegant Austen adaptation. There are so many versions of the character on screen that it can be difficult to find a new way in, but Knightley employs every one of her skills here, carrying the movie with her abrasive yet impossibly charming Lizzie.3. The Imitation Game (2014)Her second Oscar nomination was for best supporting actress in the accomplished Alan Turing biopic, in which she plays Turing’s friend, colleague in code-breaking and – briefly – fiancee, Joan Clarke. As Turing, Benedict Cumberbatch finds a perfect scene partner in Knightley, who ups the cut-glass vowels and finds a magnetic, brittle veneer of her own.2. Atonement (2007)The vowels are even more clipped and regal in Wright’s period masterpiece, which took Ian McEwan’s novel and transformed it into gorgeous, rich cinema. It may be where Knightley’s key oeuvre – posh, tragic and spirited – flourished first; as the glamorous and doomed Cecilia, it is certainly where it reaches perfection.1. Official Secrets (2019)View image in fullscreenAs GCHQ whistleblower Katharine Gun.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyOut of period costume, Knightley was at her career best in this underrated film about Katharine Gun, the GCHQ translator and whistleblower who felt compelled to leak documents about the US manipulation of evidence for the impending Iraq war. The friction between moral and professional duty is remarkable, and it showed she could offer a totally different interpretation of posh, tragic and spirited.Explore more on these topicsRankedKeira Knightleybest ofShareReuse this content"

Keeping track of all the allegiances can be tricky, thoughGraeme VirtueThu 20 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 18.03 EDTShareMost meetings could just be an email. But in the heightened milieu of Sky’s bloodthirsty hitGangsof London, face-to-face parleys have become as essential as the drama’s signature bouts of brutal hand-to-hand combat. Whenever anything dodgy happens that could jeopardise the capital’s lucrative illegal rackets, some high-level hood growls the magic words into their mobile: “Call a meeting of the gangs. Tonight.”For the various factions, these executive sit-downs are an opportunity to look their shady associates in the eye and intuit who might be making a power grab. For viewers, it’s a useful way to keep tabs on all the larger-than-life stakeholders, from fearsome Irish mob widow Marian Wallace (Michelle Fairley) to snappily dressed fixer Ed Dumani (recent Conclave standout Lucian Msamati) and unblinking Albanian mafioso Luan (Orli Shuka). After two seasons of messy backstabbing – with no shortage of front stabbing, bludgeoning and dismemberment – the only thing you can safely assume about the unsmiling faces at these draughty warehouse meet-ups is that they know how to survive in a dog-eat-dog world.That’s certainly the case with compromised hero Elliot Finch (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù), the undercover detective whose original mission to bring down the gangs became a personal beef with wannabe kingpin Sean Wallace (Joe Cole). Having now fully embraced the mobster lifestyle, Elliot has a place at the top table – possibly just to spite his cherubic enemy, Sean, whose surprise resurrection last time still saw him end up behind bars. But as season three gets under way, Elliot is presented with a huge headache: a substantial shipment of cocaine distributed on his watch has been spiked with fentanyl, killing hundreds across London. It’s bad business, and even worse PR.View image in fullscreenFearsome … Michelle Fairley as Marian Wallace in Gangs of London season three.Photograph: Sky UK/Pulse FilmsPart of Gangs of London’s overheated appeal is that cooler heads never prevail. So this act of sabotage triggers a lot of haphazard accusations and recriminations, exacerbated by a hooded martial arts expert who seems to know exactly how to disrupt Elliot’s business. Is someone on the inside leaking vital intel? Might the current chaos have some connection to a tragedy in Elliot’s past? The former cop embarks on a typically hands-on investigation where his interrogation techniques include the unorthodox use of a defibrillator and some nasty business with a vice.New antagonists include Andrew Koji (returning to the UK after three seasons playing the lead in Bruce Lee-inspired US historical dramaWarrior) and veteran scene-stealer Richard Dormer, who is clearly relishing his role as a malevolent Irish rabble-rouser wielding a wicked-looking shillelagh and a sneering rasp that sounds like a rusted petrol can being ripped in half.Heat is also about to come down from London’s new mayor Simone Thearle (T’Nia Miller), whose anti-drug stance is somewhat undermined when we meet her surreptitiously snorting a line at work. The series of micro-expressions that flicker across Miller’s face when an aide informs her that a recent batch of coke has been lethally poisoned demonstrates that for all its well-earned reputation for gory ultraviolence, Gangs of London can occasionally be subtle.Season three continues the tradition of bruising fistfights and exuberant shootouts, all executed at an impressive technical level and mischievously sprinkled with wince-inducing flourishes. But it also doubles down on the convoluted mythology of blood feuds and favours owed between power players. Between the jolts of carnage it can be hard to keep all the motivations straight across eight episodes, especially if your memories of what everyone was up to in the first season –which debuted in 2020– are hazy.View image in fullscreenUnblinking … Orli Shuka as Luan in Gangs of London season three.Photograph: Sky UK/Pulse FilmsSo it is unlikely to win over anyone who has found its previous glamorisation of theatrical gangsters and extreme violence distasteful. Yet in full flight Gangs of London can still be nerve-shredding TV. Most of episode two is given over to a desperate manhunt across the city that ratchets up the tension to near-unbearable levels, with a brief cameo from Phil Daniels as a mouthy East End retiree who won’t be intimidated by swaggering heavies.But the show’s new high-water mark for jaw-dropping use of improvised weaponry takes place in episode five, a flashback spotlight on Kurdish freedom fighter turned drug smuggler Lale (Narges Rashidi), who has variously been an ally to Sean and Elliot. She finds herself isolated and pursued by heavily armed henchmen in a deserted office block where the only sign of life is a smattering of desktop Christmas decorations.From running jokes inBrooklyn Nine-Nineto a shoutout in recent conspiracy thrillerParadise, plenty of TV shows have doffed their hat toDie Hard, the motherlode of modern action movies. But none of them have done it quite like this. Lale’s desperate fightback is empowering and transgressive (and too good to spoil). No wonder the rest of the season can’t quite measure up.Gangs of London aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionGangsTV crime dramaDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

After all, more than half the population will pay no attention to them on the day itself. If so, then the Tory party will be delighted. Long may it stay that way.TheConservativesfind themselves backed into a corner – desperate for an outbreak of national amnesia about the local elections but aware that they have to do something to mark the beginning of the campaign. Otherwise, it will just look as if they are running scared. Heads in the sand.No one has done more to rehabilitate Rishi Sunak’s reputation than Kemi BadenochWhich, of course they are. The only upside for the Tories is that some of the elections have been postponed due to local government reorganisation. For the rest of the seats, only disaster remains.The last time these seats were contested was at the height of Boris Johnson’s popularity in 2021. That didn’t end so well and the Conservatives are, if anything, more toxic than they were at the general election last year. No one has done more to rehabilitate Rishi Sunak’s reputation thanKemi Badenoch.So, on Wednesday, Conservative campaign headquarters sent out an email to lobby journalists, saying Kemi would be doing a local election campaign launch inBuckinghamshire– worded in a way that they hoped would automatically be forwarded to people’s spam. They were literally begging reporters to stay away. It’s going to be really boring, they said. Just local stuff. Not worth your time. You definitely won’t get a question. And no refreshments. Transport links next to impossible. You get the picture.For those who were not so easily put off, CCHQ had some other suggestions. Perhaps you might like to go to the movies instead. How about we offer you tickets to see Macbeth atthe Bridge? The show has been sold out for months.Or, if that didn’t excite you, then what about a day trip to Nice? All flights paid. Lunch on the beach thrown in. The Med is gorgeous in the spring. Anything. Anything you like. Just please, please don’t show up in Buckinghamshire.Unfortunately, the message didn’t seem to have got through to the broadcasters. There is no political event too meta – one that exists only because someone has decided there ought to be one to mark the occasion as one of no importance – that doesn’t end up on the rolling news channels. Pointlessness is now worn as a badge of honour by all TV stations. If it moves, it’s news. So, much to Kemi’s and CCHQ’s disappointment, the event they wanted to be a non-event became an event after all.After brief introductions from Kevin Hollinrake and Nigel Huddleston – has any party leader had less inspiring warmup acts? – Badenoch took to the makeshift stage in front of a couple of dozen Tory councillors. Most of them shortly to be ex-councillors. Desperation was etched in their eyes alongside the fixed grins.Her key-opening message was that the situation was hopeless. No one liked the Tories.Kemi herself looked as if she was starring in her own hostage video. Everything about her demeanour shouted: “Get me out of here.” Even for a woman who gives the impression of hating her job, this was a new career low.Neither is she very good at disguising her feelings. She knows her stay as Tory leader is almost certainly time limited – most of her MPs and party members are already expressing buyer’s remorse – and she reckons she’s got better things to do than this. It was only one step up from handing out raffle prizes at a Tory fundraiser.Some might call it pragmatism. Realism, even. More likely, with KemiKaze is that she just no longer gives a shit. Most party leaders might have tried to soft-soap their audience. Give the councillors and party activists a reason to hope. A reason to get up in the morning and go out canvassing. Trying to secure a handful more votes.That’s not the Kemi way. She basically just looked everyone in the eye and told them they were dead men – and women – walking. There was no point to anything. We might as well kill ourselves now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No one liked the Tories. The brand was kryptonite. There was no way they weren’t toast. They were on course to lose every council in the country that they had held.Kemi shrugged as some in the audience burst into tears. Others reached into their pockets for the Valium. OK, she conceded, maybe we can hang on to one council. But only if we are very, very lucky. And the voters are more stupid – sorry, forgiving – than the polls suggest.Having lowered everyone’s expectations as far as she dared, Kemi quickly rattled through the rest of her speech. Only the Tories could be trusted to keep council taxes low, she said. Lying through her teeth. On average, Tory-run councils have increased local taxes by 23% over the past five years. But by now Badenoch wasn’t much concerned with telling the truth. Just about getting to the end and getting the hell out of Buckinghamshire as soon as possible.“Labour has no understanding of rural areas,” she went on. Pots and kettles. One of the reasons Kemi has become so unpopular with Tory members is that she is perceived as having no interest in the countryside. She doesn’t feel safe unless she is inside the M25.She ended with a swipe at Reform. All celebrity hot air. No delivery. Hmm. It’s not entirely clear the Tories have delivered that much in the past 10 years. Other than a broken economy and a failing NHS.Reluctantly, Kemi took a few desultory questions from broadcasters who were also going through the motions. More out of politeness than genuine interest. What was the difference between the Tories and Reform? Other than Reform are increasing in popularity and the Tories are declining. Er … “We have a plan,” she said. And what was that plan? The plan was to have no plan until such time as a plan was needed.Would that do? It would have to. Kemi had done her bit. Now she could escape back to London. A member of the audience suggested she take a selfie with them all. She duly obliged. Be nice to have a memento of the last time they were all in a job.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe politics sketchConservativesBuckinghamshirecommentShareReuse this content"

On one hand, it’s simple: all you need to do is throw on some shoes, step outside and run. On the other: you have to run.“People think running is intimidating for a couple of reasons,” says Martinus Evans, founder and CEO of the Slow AF Run Club. First, it often happens outdoors – in full view of others. “A lot of people are self-conscious and nervous about what other people are going to say,” he explains.Second, some people feel they’re not built for running – they worry they’re too big or too slow. But that doesn’t matter, Evans says.“You can be a runner in the body you have,” he says. “It can still be something you own and enjoy.”Lift, rest, recover: how to start weightliftingRead moreWe talked to experts about how to start running.Walk as much as you need to“Start from where you are rather than where you want to be,” says Dr Randy Accetta, director of coaching education at Road Runners Club of America. Some novices are able to start running right away, but others may need to build up their walking strength first.“We recommend that true novices begin by walking and spend a few weeks developing the ability to walk for upwards of an hour,” says Accetta.When theyfirst start running, many people – myself very much included – try to jog for as long as they can. But this can be draining, unpleasant and lead toinjury.Jasmine Adgerson, a community engagement manager for the Austin Runners Club in Austin, Texas, recalls that when she first started running, she had no idea how to pace herself. “I’d take off too fast, only to burn out in a few minutes,” she says. Every run felt exhausting and she couldn’t figure out how other people made it look so effortless.View image in fullscreenWhen they first start running, many people try to jog for as long as they can.Photograph: Patrik Giardino/Getty ImagesThen, she startedalternatingbetween running and walking – running for short periods and then walking to recover. This made workouts feel more manageable, and over time Adgerson found she could run for longer periods of time and take fewer walking breaks.Evans says he advises new runners to practice run-walk intervals, running for as little as 15 seconds and then walking for 90 seconds. If you can do more, bump the running up to 30 seconds. If you catch your breath before the 90 seconds of walking is up, try walking for just 60 seconds.“The most important thing is to listen to your body and progress at a pace that feels sustainable,” says Adgerson.Keep it slowA common mistake new runners make is running too fast.“A lot of people run and they’re hyperventilating,” Evans says. “Then they think, this is not sustainable.”Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Evans suggests runs be at a conversational pace, meaning that while you’re running, you can have a conversation with a friend or “sing your favorite song at the top of your lungs”. This pace is a lot slower than most people expect, Evans says.“The level of perceived effort should always be low,” says Accetta – a five or six out of 10.Don’t run every dayWhen you start running, it will take your body time to adjust, so it’s important to give it time to recover.Being consistent is more important than running a particular number of days, says Tia Accetta, who is a Road Runners Club of America certified coach. (Tia and Randy are married.)“Try to do two runs a week for the first two weeks,” she suggests. If that feels good and you want to do more, try three runs a week for the next three weeks, and if that feels good, try bumping it up to four runs a week for the next three weeks.Pay close attention to how each schedule feels. “If you start to feel overly fatigued and start lacking motivation to run, you are probably on the edge of overtraining,” Tia says. If that happens, cut back to two runs a week until you feel better.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She says this helped her stay strong, make progress and prevent burnout.Get appropriate shoesAll you need to run is a pair of shoes – but they need to be the right pair.“Running shoe technology has exploded,” Tia says. The number of options can feel overwhelming. But there’s no need to get too in the weeds. “For most of your running needs, the less technology the better,” she adds.If possible, ask for help and try shoes on before you buy them. “Buying your first pair of running shoes off the internet is a receipt for injury,” says Randy.Experts recommend visiting a running store where you can get properly fitted and try a wide variety of shoes. Notice which styles and brands feel best on your feet. Friends might swear by a particular shoe, but it might not be right for you.Shoe brands fit differently, says Evans. “Typically, people find their particular brand, and that’s the shoe they stay in.”Running shoes can be expensive – anywhere between $130 and $170 – but there’s no need to buy the priciest pair, Tia says.This is a sizable investment upfront. “But considering how important your feet are, it’s absolutely worth it,” says Adgerson.Treadmills can help you stay consistentSome people love treadmills, others hate them. But they can be useful if you’re traveling or if you live somewhere very hot, cold or wet – not ideal conditions for outdoor running.View image in fullscreenTreadmills can be useful if you’re traveling or live somewhere very hot, cold or wet.Photograph: Boston Globe/Getty ImagesIf you do run on a treadmill, Randy says to avoid running right against the front of the machine. For a better, longer stride, try to give yourself a foot or two of space “so you can swing your arms without hitting the front of the treadmill”.Find a running communityIf you like running, experts say the best and most enjoyable way to build your practice is to find arunning community.“Run groups not only keep you accountable but also make the sport so much more enjoyable,” says Adgerson, who is part of multiple clubs in Austin. “There is a deep sense of support and belonging in these spaces, and it is inspiring to see how running can bring people together.”If you are in the US, the Road Runners Club of America hasa long listof running clubs around the country. In the UK, you can find a running group through sites likeRunTogether.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHow to startRunningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So much so they allowed me to watch it on a school night.

Why, drinking pink champagne, of course! It’s on Netflix again so am enjoying it for the umpteenth time in all its glorious technicolor.Deepavali70Guardian writers on their ultimate feelgood movies: ‘Keeps me optimistic’Read moreField of DreamsA feelgood, weepy, anti-fascist ghost story about baseball and fatherhood from a time when the USA had more goodies than baddies. Feels like a long time ago.SnorkellingZeemWalkDon’t RunVery dated 60s romcom but has a charming swan song performance by Cary Grant as a sweet, meddling matchmaker in his last movie role. Samantha Eggar is lovely.

Innocence, nostalgia with an underlying thread of loss and loneliness, makes this my beautiful, majestic go-to movie when life’s chips are in descent.Aubrey26How to Steal a MillionAudrey Hepburn and Peter O’Toole at their romcom best. Crazy fashions, daft plot, fun lines: “Let’s give Givenchy a night off.” And great supporting cast including Eli Wallach, Hugh Griffith and many more.ThinkingAoudThe Big LebowskiThe soundtrack is brilliant, the dialogue is endlessly quotable, the performances are flawless from everyone. Aside from being deeply funny, it’s full of endearingly odd characters, rich with silly detail and, barring a little violence and sadness towards the end, it’s overall a relaxed and fuzzy tale of nothing in particular. Am I wrong?!thealmightycraigIt has a supremely silly plot but has a pin-sharp script that is marvelously acted. It makes me laugh from start to finish. And having watched it several times, I’m almost word perfect with the script.rewilderMoonstruckI’ve seen it at least 20 times and it never fails to make my day.

It doesn’t really matter that Ed is dreadful at making movies because he just loves what he’s doing. Moreover, it’s a story about compassion, friendship and the value of just opening your heart to the world. Ed’s crew are people who are marginalised or rejected or washed up, but he doesn’t care – he’s just happy to have them around and to work with them. In return he finds someone who will love him without judging him.ThornDavisThisIs Spinal TapI know it’s coming, I’ve seen it a thousand times, but when Stonehenge appears, I’m a giggling wreck.

It’s a wonderful blend of 70s noir pastiche, buddy-cop comedy and detective drama with a hell of a cast, and probably the best comedic performances to date by [Ryan] Gosling and [Ruseell] Crowe (Gosling in particular is effortlessly brilliant). Because it doesn’t take itself or its story too seriously, I don’t have to be switched on totally to watch it, so it works for me regardless of mood or energy level going in.jcs100North by NorthwestPerfect combination of drama, romance, comedy, thriller, looks beautiful, cracking dialogue, fabulous performances, great set-piece sequences … Everything so perfectly judged, no matter how brief or insignificant a moment (see, for example, the brief scene where Thornhill escapes the hospital through a young woman’s room!).

But it’s far from the only televisual masterpiece to deliver a devastating emotional punch …Stuart HeritageThu 20 Mar 2025 07.57 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 11.20 EDTShareAdolescence, as the world seems to agree, is a perfect piece of television. However, even perfection has its problems. Adolescence is the sort of show that needs some breathing space afterwards; it’s so comprehensively shattering, and will leave you in such a state of emotional despondency, that you can’t simply hop straight into the next show. I tried – after episode four, I had to watch a reality show for work – and it was horrible. It was like stumbling from a funeral straight into a circus.Perhaps what we need here is an off-ramp. A bunch of shows that, while they might leave you in pieces, may not pack quite such a devastating punch as Adolescence. Here’s a selection of the most heartbreaking television.The Virtues (Channel 4)View image in fullscreenAlcoholic breakdown … The Virtues.Photograph: Dean Rogers/Channel 4If Adolescence wanted to make me do anything – aside from lock my sons in a sensory deprivation chamber until they reach adulthood – it was to watch2019’s The Virtues. Like Adolescence, it stars Stephen Graham and was co-written byJack Thorne, and like Adolescence it’s so raw that it sometimes feels impolite to even watch it. Directed by Shane Meadows, it’s the story of a father who suffers a comprehensive alcoholic breakdown when his wife and son move to Australia without him. There’s repression. There’s childhood trauma. There is an ending that will leave you numb for weeks. If you’re chasing the hit of Adolescence, this is the place to start.This Is England ’86, ’88 and ’90 (Channel 4)View image in fullscreenGut-wrenching … Chanel Cresswell, Rosamund Hanson and Vicky McClure in This Is England ’86.Photograph: Channel 4Another collaboration between Graham, Thorne and Meadows, these area clutch of miniseries, made between 2010 and 2015, that develop the story from Meadows’s 2006 film This Is England. All three shows deploy a gut-wrenching intensity that can be hard to bear. There’s rape and violence, murder, death and poverty – and some of the narrative is set at Christmas, just to compound the misery. Graham’s arc, as a character who struggles to atone for his part in a violent racist attack years earlier, is particularly harrowing. However, there’s also a sense of hope in the show, however dim it might be at times, that just about manages to lift you out of the dirt.The Leftovers (Now TV)View image in fullscreenBleak … Justin Theroux and Carrie Coon in The Leftovers.Written during a depression after the death of his father, Damon Lindelof’sThe Leftovershas the potential to be one of the bleakest programmes ever. An unexplained event makes 2% of the world’s population vanish, leaving the remaining 98% to battle through their grief while a nihilistic religious cult forces everyone to confront their loss. This might be a good next step from Adolescence, because although it starts dark – the pilot episode contains scenes of dog murder – it soon finds absurdity and hope in its miserable premise.Chernobyl (Now TV)View image in fullscreenInnate sadness … Chernobyl.Photograph: Liam Daniel/Sky UK/HBOThe fear of Adolescence is that what happens to its family could happen to anybody. Meanwhile, the Chornobyl explosion was a thing that did happen to many people, and the truth of the disaster was far worse than was reported for decades. There’s an innate sadness tothe show, of course – how could there not be? – but in its depiction of radiation poisoning and death, it also makes a fitting lurch into horror. Historically accurate bleakness.It’s a Sin (Channel 4)View image in fullscreenDeep humanity in every frame … It’s a Sin.Photograph: Ben Blackall/Channel 4This show deserves to go down as Russell T Davies’s masterpiece. Both the BBC and ITV passed onIt’s a Sinbefore Channel 4 picked it up, perhaps fearing that a show about the Aids epidemic of the 1980s would be too harrowing for mainstream audiences. This isn’t quite the case – there are moments of real joy here – but it’s a hard thing to watch as characters die off, knowing that this all really happened. Like Chernobyl, the show burns with an anger that this was ever allowed to happen. But there’s also a deep sense of humanity in every frame. Davies has never written more from the heart, and it shows.This Is Us (Channel 4)View image in fullscreenCompelling … Milo Ventimiglia, Kaz Womack as Kevin, Isabella Rose Landau, CaRon Jaden Coleman and Mandy Moore in This Is Us.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesThis Is Usis compelling: it feels as if it was precision-designed by a team of expert crafters to make as many people cry as possible. It’s about a family who experience the familiar peaks and troughs of love, birth, death and heartache, but with everything ramped up to an absurd degree. You find yourself sobbing even though you’re being manipulated. It is also aggressively sentimental in a way that Adolescence isn’t, which might be a comfort.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionJack ThorneStephen GrahamShane MeadowsYoung peopleDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it was not unexpected or unheralded. Netanyahu and his newly installed military chiefs have made clear their intentions of resuming the war to “crush Hamas once and for all” and “prevent any future threat from Gaza”. They rejected the January deal, which mandated ending the fight in return for the remaining 59 Israeli and foreign hostages held inGazasince Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.The Trump administration has given Israel a free hand vis-a-vis the Palestinians. Donald Trump even drew the goal: relocating Gaza’s more than 2 million inhabitants and turning the rubble intobeachside resorts. His idea came almost as divine intervention to the Israeli far right, which has advocated for decades the “transfer” of Arabs from the occupied territories. What was traditionally viewed as an extremist, marginalised idea has now become US policy, masked as a “humane solution” rather than what it would be: an outright war crime. Once aired by Trump, the idea has enjoyed wide support among Israel’s Jewish majority as a fitting punishment for the 7 October massacre.So far, the Israel Defense Forces have not given an explicit order to ethnically cleanse Gaza of its Palestinians. Nor did the IDF direct its ground force reserves toward an occupation campaign. Tuesday’s assault was framed as an attack on Hamas’s rearming effort and its governance organs, targeting several of its civilian executives along with their family members.Nevertheless Trump, Netanyahu and senior Israeli officials have threatened Hamas with “hell”. Israel’s ministry of defence has established a new officeto facilitate “voluntary emigration”from Gaza via Israeli air and seaports. The minister of finance, Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right leader, envisions a transfer of10,000 Palestinians a day, depopulating the entire Gaza Strip within several months. The defence minister, Israel Katz, whose office runs the emigration project, indicates that2,500 daily evacueeswill suffice. Israel and the US have already asked Sudan, Somaliland and other governments to take the Palestinians.Most Israelis, however, are still considering the talk of a transfer, or second Nakba – recalling the 1948 “catastrophe”, or exodus of most Arabs from what became Israel – as rightwing political gobbledegook. Israeli public attention is focused on the 59 hostages held in Gaza, between 22 and 24 of them apparently alive. To Netanyahu and his allies, the fate of the tortured, starved hostages is a nuisance, a disturbance on the way to “ultimate victory”. The government’s opponents, centred on the old Israeli mainstream, view the return of the hostages as paramount. They have found an unlikely ally in Trump, who hosted freed hostages in the Oval Office, a gesture that Netanyahu has yet to perform. Having shrugged off responsibility for the 7 October disaster, he escapes looking the victims in the eyes.Tuesday’s bombing decided the debate. Netanyahu ignored the pleas of hostages’ families and survivors of Hamas captivity and sent bombers to the skies of Gaza, knowing that Hamas, with its back to the wall, might kill the remaining captives. The deadly attack paid immediate political dividends in Jerusalem. Israel’sKahanist partyOtzma Yehudit (“Jewish Power”), which left the coalition to protest against the ceasefire, came back on the eve of a crucial budget vote. Passing the budget would buy the government time to win its coveted victory in a second, though by no means secondary, battle at home.Since returning to the helm in late 2022, Netanyahu’s goal has been to turn Israel from a quasi-liberal, however battered, democracy – at least on this side of the green line separating Israel proper from the occupied territories – into a Jewish autocracy. Having already transformed Likud, the ruling party, into his personality cult, and partnering with the once-pariah Kahanists, Netanyahu sought to drive out the old elite from its power bases in the defence-intelligence complex and the judiciary and replace it with his alliance of “Bibist” loyalists, religious nationalists and ultra-Orthodox rabbis’ disciples. The secular, westward-looking former elite fought back with mass protests that slowed down the judicial upheaval. Then came 7 October, and domestic strife was put on hold.But Netanyahu never lost sight of his national overhaul. With the war winding down, and his ideological buddy Trump taking over in the US, the Israeli coalition relaunched its coup. Laws that woulddo away with judicial independencewere rushed in the Knesset. With the police force and prison service already politicised, and the IDF chief of staff replaced, Netanyahu aims at the most sensitive and powerful targets: Shin Bet, Israel’s security service, and the attorney general, who serves as the country’s chief law enforcer.Netanyahu’s motives are personal as much as political. Gali Baharav-Miara, the attorney general, is leading the prosecution in Netanyahu’s corruption trial. Replacing her with a crony might throw the case out of the window. Ronen Bar, the Shin Bet chief that Netanyahu wants to sack, is investigating claims of shadowyfinancial ties between the prime minister’s spin masters and Qatar, the main sponsor of Hamas. Netanyahu, expectedly, argues that “Qatar-gate” is a last-ditch effort by his adversaries, Bar and Baharav-Miara, to avoid being ousted. Both loyal bureaucrats who turned into unlikely dissidents, they would lead a legal battle to keep their jobs and preserve remaining civil service independence and authority.And so the dual battle lines, inside and outside Israel, are drawn for the showdown. Netanyahu wants to fight Hamas all the way to ethnic cleansing and is willing to sacrifice the hostages along the way. And he wants to purge the country’s establishment of his traditional rivals, the members of the military, academic and legal elites, keeping the right wing in power for ever.His opponents, struggling to save the hostages and protect democracy, were weakened by the failure of the IDF and Shin Bet to anticipate the 7 October massacre and protect the border communities. The historic debacle has irreparably shattered the prestige of the military and intelligence community, whose former leaders led the anti-government protest. The political opposition is weak, leaderless and lacking a postwar vision. Nevertheless, despite all these obstacles and facing Netanyahu’s unbelievable stamina, the “anti-Bibists” realise that if they lose now, they may not be able to protest again and be reduced to watching their country descending down the autocratic path already paved in Hungary, India, Turkey and Trumpist America.In the coming weeks, we will see if Israel is edging closer to the abyss of war criminality in depopulated Gaza and de facto dictatorship in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, or whether the Netanyahu stampede can be slowed down. The stakes for Israel’s future have never been as high. And the protesters are trying once again to turn the ever-higher tide.Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of HaaretzDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It sounds like a contradiction in terms – Hamlet without the prince. Yet this is the improbable, disjunctive world we now inhabit. It is the one in which our children and grandchildren will live their lives. Like it or not, the systemic shock launched by Donald Trump is our new reality. Absolutely nothing about Trump’s latestphone call with Vladimir Putinon Tuesday has changed that.Europe’s scramble to respond to Trump’s return to power was driven initially by the urgency ofmaintaining support for Ukraine. Most of the focus was diplomatic: keeping US military aid and intelligence flowing, shoring up damaged channels between Washington and Kyiv, engaging quietly with both Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy to both encourage and deter, while moving very publicly to take up more of the security burden.Aiding and armingUkraineremains far and away the first item on Europe’s agenda as well as its most immediate goal. Hugging the US as close as possible continues to be fundamental, whatever Trump’s more cavalier critics may wish. There is no disputing that Trump caught the Europeans within Nato napping in ways that should never have occurred, and which reflect extremely badly on those responsible. For now, American power remains both indispensable and unreliable.Even so, a more lasting and more Europe-heavy reconfiguration of the western alliance is also beginning to take shape. For now, most of what is being planned is either improvised from existing resources or aspirational. But the outline of a new Atlantic alliance can be discerned amid the diplomatic video conferences and high-minded pledges: a kind of Nato-minus supported by most ofEurope, Britain included, potentially plus Canada, and with the role of the US shrouded in uncertainty.Nato remains the basic framework, even if Trump decides to withdraw. This adaptive effort is being shaped by an improbable trio: aconservative German chancellorwho spurns previous orthodoxy; a centrist French president who has just destroyed his own power base; and a UK prime minister equipped with thesmallest British army since the Napoleonic wars. But Europe is nevertheless in their hands. They are the team we can put on the pitch.The inevitability of change has been decisively reinforced by Trump’s 90-minute phone conversation with Putin on Tuesday. Any thought that Trump would somehow persuade Putin to reverse his policy on Ukraine – or even that Trump wanted to – was always a fantasy. Everything Putin has ever said about Ukraine attests that he regards it as Russian land. The conditions he put to Trump amount to a demand to leave Ukraine defenceless against Russian assault and annexation. That assault has continued unabated once again this week.This puts Trump’s claims as a peacemaker on the spot, but the embarrassment, though useful to those trying to rein him in, is likely to be only temporary. Trump’s strategic wish is to withdraw US military and financial support for Ukraine, preferably amid something he can describe as a peace settlement that only his genius could have engineered. But his longer-term approach to Europe is simply an extension of this impatience towards Ukraine. His aim is to withdraw US support for European defence more generally.1:38US no longer ‘primarily focused’ on Europe’s security, says Pete Hegseth – videoThe most significant thing that has happened in Europe this week, therefore, was not the Trump-Putin phone call. It was the vote by the Bundestag to loosen Germany’s constitutionally protected strict financial borrowing rules and, at the same time, to authorise a€500bn fund to boost economic growth, infrastructure projects and military spending. If Europe wants to carry its own defence burden, as it now claims, it has to fire up its own defence industries to scale. More than anything else, that means firing up the German defence industry. This is not an overnight process, but it can now start.The vote was a triumph for the probable new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who pushed it through the departing Bundestag on its final day. But it was also a genuine turn in the road for postwarGermany. Burdened by its history, Germany has consistently eschewed both large-scale borrowing and militarisation. Those taboos have now been busted, under the pressure of economic stagnation and the threat from Russia alike.The internal consequences for 21st-century Germany will be major, assuming that parliament’s upper house endorses the changes this week. It would be mistaken to think the issue is now settled. Both the far right and far left, significantly boosted in the recent German general election, voted against Merz’s plans. Both will continue to see them as betrayals. If inflation rises, Merz’s grip will face fierce challenges.But the consequences for Europe as a whole are likely to be equally powerful. Since the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, Germany has been the most important western European state where foreign policy looks reflexively towards Russia. Earlier in this century, under Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel, those links were always carefully protected. More recently, Putin has ensured that German policy, first under Olaf Scholz and now under Merz, has become more hostile.As Trump menaces us in Canada, we have a question for Britain: when will you stand up to him? | Jennifer WelshRead moreGermany is still the necessary nation for any Europe-wide new political initiative. But now, almost at a stroke, the Bundestag vote has removed the longstanding excuse behind which some European states have been content to hide over the issue of Europe’s manifestly inadequate defence investment. The era of inward-turned European denial about Russia and about defence spending has ended, and the fresh air of truth is breezing through windows that were once firmly sealed.This is a healthy and overdue moment, not least because the danger is real, but also because it gives this continent a more unifying purpose than it has had since the cold war. But there can be no disputing the risks. European history is full of terrifying examples of international alliances that have not survived contact with a determined enemy. One lesson of the 2020s is that things many people had assumed had been consigned to history – among them epidemics, nationalism, territorial land grabs and charismatic tyrants – have returned in force.Today, confronted with an aggressive tyranny and faced with an isolationist US, the nation states of Europe, withCanada, are attempting to uphold the moral and political recasting of the world that took place after 1945. There are echoes here of the conflicts that began in 1914, and again in 1939. Then, too, Europe found itself in wars (which included major Canadian involvement) from which an isolationist US stood aside. In both cases, the US proved the essential nation to victory and the postwar order. Today, though, the US marches to an altogether more unreliable drum.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNatoOpinionDonald TrumpDefence policyGermanyFranceCanadaUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

Why? What for? If it wasn’t for the waste and environmental impact, I’d make a huge pile and torch them all. You’d see the fire from the moon. Alternatively, pick them apart and make something useful out of them. I’d collect them by means of a national scatter cushion and bedspread amnesty. Post them to a facility and leave the rest to me.Let’s take bedspreads first. Big, heavy, useless. Especially the one on the bed at my mum’s house. I can’t always summon the strength to drag it off the bed and leave it in a heap on the floor. If I do, along with leaving no floor space for anything else, this earns me a fierce bollocking. I am commanded to heave it out of the bedroom and hang it on the bannister, which creaks beneath its formidable weight. Then, when my stay is over, I have to wrangle the bedspread back on to the bed, as it is far too heavy for her to handle. I always ask what purpose it serves. I’ve never had an answer.You’d hope these bastard things were a thing of the past, but no. As the Australian bedlinen companyMy Linenhas it: “Now, you might wonder, are bedspreads still in style? The answer is a resounding yes!” Oh God, surely not. “They are experiencing a resurgence in popularity due to their versatility and ability to transform a bedroom into a cosy retreat.”And then there’s the cushions. Mountains of them. Every night I hurl them off, cursing quietly. Every morning they are replaced. Off, on, off, on, for ever. Serving no purpose whatsoever in between the ons and the offs.I suspect they proliferate because they’re thought to make good gifts. Don’t know what to give? How about a nice cushion? Everyone loves a cushion! And I’m not sure they ever get thrown out or given away. The pile, the problem, the misery just grows, pillow upon pillow.

Last month, he announced himself its new chair, replaced 13 board members, andinserted a new interim president, foreign policy adviser Richard Grenell. On Monday this week, the president’s motorcadedisgorged him at the building– which contains an opera house, theatre, concert hall and a plethora of smaller venues off its towering, chandelier-hung foyers. By this point, his and Melania Trump’s portraits, alongside those of vice-president JD Vance and his wife Usha, had been screwed to the wall beside the concert hall stage door.Trump and his new trustees – who include Usha Vance and Fox presenterLaura Ingraham– then discussed changes to theKennedy Center Honors, founded in the 1970s to recognise the greatest figures in American cultural life. Trump called previous honorees, who have ranged from Fred Astaire to Francis Ford Coppola, “radical left lunatics”. Men such as singer Andrea Bocelli, who hasperformedat Mar-a-Lago, and Sylvester Stallone, whorecently called Trumpa “second George Washington”, were floated for future honours. With the truculence of a slighted schoolboy, Trump opined that he had nevermuch cared for Hamilton– this, after the news thatthe musical has withdrawnfrom a 2026 run at the centre. He also complained about an infestation of mice. All this, the day before he was due to speak to Russian president Vladimir Putin tohaggle overUkraine’s future. It is enough to give you a political-cultural attack of the bends.Those who work there – it is the home of theNational Symphony Orchestraand the Washington National Opera, sustains a large educational programme and hosts touring productions – are faced with a moral dilemma. One senior figure, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that what is keeping them from resigning after the ripping away of the centre’s bipartisan heart is the fact that their own section’s programming has yet to be targeted; a feeling of responsibility towards employees’ livelihoods; and a hope that things will one day “swing back”. Nevertheless, the figure told me: “I’m asking myself every day when I get up, am I being like a French collaborator?”If you imagine that a comparison with Vichy France is a bit much, or all of this is unimportant, you are mistaken. This is of a piece with theintimidation of the pressand the closing, by executive order, of the radio station Voice of America, set up during the second world war to counter nazism, nowconsideredby the White House “radical propaganda”. Think of authoritarianism as a sort of disease: you’ll find “preoccupation with the minutiae of the arts” is on the symptom checker, because authoritarians are prickly and afraid of the potency of the arts, how they affect hearts and minds. Sufferers have gone all the way from the poetry-loving (andpoet-banishing) emperor Augustus, to the opera-going (and artist-murdering) Stalin. In his blunt and brutish way, Trump, who characterised his and Vance’s public bullying of a foreign president as “great television”, understands the power of spectacle, of showbiz, of culture and the arts. Politicians in liberal democracies generally let artists get on with it – without indulging in diatribes against, say,drag shows, something with which Trump is weirdly preoccupied.In Washington, politics and the arts are physically indivisible: grand, pedimented cultural institutions stand shoulder to shoulder with the nation’s imposing government buildings. It is no coincidence that the centre of political power is also the place where Americans, and the world, come to absorb the narratives of US identity, culture and memory that are projected by the Kennedy Center, theNational Gallery of Art, and the mightySmithsonian Institutionmuseums, 17 of which are in DC. But what narratives? On Thursday evening, Vance’s motorcade advanced ahead of me as I walked into the Kennedy Center. When a wall of booing from the concert-hall audience greeted the vice-president as he and his party filed into their seats, he let loose a wave as ironic and unconcerned as a Roman emperor acknowledging the Colosseum crowds. But next day, the video that the Guardian shot and published alongside ournews storywas commented on,on X, by the centre’s new leader, Grenell: “It troubles me to see that so many in the audience appear to be white and intolerant of diverse political views. Diversity is our strength.” He sent a similarly worded all-staff letter. Given that Trump banned federal diversity programmes by executive order in January, it takes an Orwellian chutzpah to use a lack of diversity among Kennedy Center patrons as a weapon.0:42Audience boos JD Vance at Kennedy Center classical music performance – exclusive videoElsewhere among Washington’s cultural institutions, there is a sense that leaders are keeping their heads down in hope of evading the gaze of the destroyers. Vance, by virtue of his office, is one of the trustees of the Smithsonian. In a context in which even a Black war hero can beremovedfrom a Department of Defense website, will the entireNational Museum of African American History and Culturebe regarded as a diversity and inclusion folly? Will exhibitions such as that by the radical Cuban-born Félix González-Torres pass unnoticed, even though thewebsitefor the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery fails to mention, perhaps carefully, that the artist was gay, or that one work relates to his lover’s death from Aids, or that he himself died of an Aids-related illness?The National Gallery of Art (not part of the Smithsonian, but Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, is an ex-officio trustee) has just opened a show devoted toElizabeth Catlett, subtitled “a Black revolutionary artist”. One of her works, made amid the turmoil of the 1968 race riots, is afist carved from cedar, titled Black Unity. Will such boldness continue? As time moves on, self-censorship may become evident, as organisations seek to minimise negative attention. The possibility of a casual swipe at funding made one institutional director feel “like the sword of Damocles is dangling over my head”, they told me. At another famous cultural institution, this time in New York, I asked its leader what would happen if the government came for them. “I don’t know,” he said frankly – while acknowledging that even an institution generously supported by philanthropists, which receives no federal funds, could easily be targeted through changes to donors’ tax benefits. Artists may also vote with their feet. On Wednesday, Hungarian-born British pianist András Schiffcancelled all his US engagementsfor next season, citing “political changes”, insisting that “as artists, we must react to the horrors and injustices of this world”.At the Kennedy Center, artists such as soprano Renée Fleming havecut ties with the centre. There will probably be more cancellations, or refusals of invitations. Apetitioncalls on donors to stop supporting it. Either way – by carrying on under the corrupting shadow of the Trump chairmanship, or through the fleeing of audiences, donors and artists – a great institution is weakened. That, in the end, is probably what he wants. And this is just the beginning.Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But so were the right’s Brexit claims, and look where they left usZoe WilliamsThe run-up to 2016 shows ‘common sense’ isn’t enough. Even ignorant, reactionary arguments must be properly counteredThu 20 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 09.42 EDTShareKemi Badenoch’s speech on climate this week was not interesting of itself: she said net zero couldn’t be achieved by 2050 “without a serious drop in our living standards or by bankrupting us”. She has no expertise in climate science, no background in renewables or apparent familiarity with the advances made in their technology, no qualification in economics – just about the only bit of that sentence she knows anything about is bankrupting us.Yet even if Badenoch can take its particulars and shove them, the fact of its existence is interesting for a number of reasons. First, this attack on net zero has been predicted, not secretly by new-Conservative fellow travellers, though conceivably them too, but by progressives – and for years. Among the first was the Cambridge academic David Runciman, who predicted a backlash against action on the climate crisis as the new galvanising issue on the radical right after it had moved on fromBrexit. On his Talking Politics podcast, he was in conversation with Ed Miliband, who took that point but said he hoped Runciman was wrong. He was not wrong.Ben Stewart, one quarter of the direct action/public art group Led By Donkeys described even more closely what the anti-green arguments would look like and the trajectory they would follow. Before Brexit, he’d been looking at who had links to the leave campaign, and cross referencing their other interests – Matt Ridley, coalmine magnate and climate crisis sceptic, Matthew Elliott, founder of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, opponent of green taxes, stalwart of Tufton Street. “Brexit was always, obviously, a plan to completely gut climate regulation,” Stewart told me last year. “First these people denied the science. Then they abandoned that trench and moved back to, ‘the science is probably real, but the impacts of climate change aren’t going to be too bad.’ Then they went to, ‘the science is real, it could be bad, but we can’t do anything about it because it’s too expensive.’”That’s where we are now, and Badenoch’s may be the most mainstream expression of it so far. Because even while outlets such as GB News have been preachingclimate impossibilismfor some time, it has until now been broadly disallowable in mainstream political discourse. Politicians could undermine climate action tangentially, by fulminating about Extinction Rebellion or by sideswiping at the “green crap”, but would not, if they were ambitious, pursue a despair agenda. Not because it wouldn’t garner them attention, but because it meant resiling from scientific and international consensus.Yet if Badenoch is the first prominent person to break the cross-party consensus on net zero, she’s not without cover. There has been a steady build of grassroots movements with specific, vehement objections to apparently pretty anodyne pro-environmental policies: ultra-low emission zones (Ulez) have attracted the ire of the outer London vandal-warriors; low-traffic neighbourhoods blew up into a culture war between neighbours; the 15-minute city attracted conspiracists with an intensity way beyond anything explicable by the idea.All of this anti-climate activism looks, up close, like amorphous rage attached by an algorithm to an issue that could never express or contain it. Or, to put that more simply, Facebook getting peoples’s knickers in a twist. Yet when it drags on, and percolates the phone-ins, and newsreaders start giving it the merest nod, “some people, of course, are very angry about Ulez”, it takes on the heft of an imagined constituency, people who are fed up with environmentalists. Badenoch is speaking their truth. You may feel passionately that we have one precious planet and should do everything in our power to protect it, but you’re not the only one who’s allowed feelings.And now, as progressives or environmentalists, or whatever word you want to use if you’re too polite to say “sane people”, we’re into discursive territory that’s deeply familiar, though you couldn’t call it our “happy place”. Most of us would acknowledge the increasing radicalism and stridency of the anti-environmental agenda, and we’re self-soothing with the fact thatpublic opinion on net zero is still solidly in favour. Getting into the weeds of Badenoch’s own character, a debate is playing out that is also deeply familiar – is she saying this because she’s enchanted by dark money, or is it because she’s an “irresponsible, ignorant, reactionary fool”, as one journalist put it.This may be a useful point at which to consider not the arguments themselves, but what happened last time: when we last saw irresponsible, ignorant, reactionary arguments, which if followed through would be greatly to the nation’s detriment, whose proponents seemed to be effortlessly attaching themselves to a simmering underlying rage that they had no real answers for, over an issue that public opinion, previously, had seemed quite sensible on. That time when it was never quite clear where the money was coming from, but you could definitely smell it somewhere – did that energy dissipate? Was good sense enough to chase the charlatans out of town? Or did they, in fact, win? I think we all remember.Ben Stewart names not just the trench Badenoch is fighting from now, but “the next trench, the last trench: which is to say, ‘Climate change is real, it’s bad, it’s expensive, but it’s too late.’ By the time they start winning that argument, it will be too late.” We need to do better on rightwing activism this time, rather than just ignoring it and hoping it will go away.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionKemi BadenochFar rightBrexitcommentShareReuse this content"

Its spring economic statement next week is likely to be grim. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have an ambitious new leader and the local elections are only six weeks away. The situation ought to be full of promise for Kemi Badenoch and her party. Instead, she is treating the May elections not as a promise but as a threat.Mrs Badenochlaunchedthe Conservatives’ campaign in warm spring weather on Thursday. From her message, however, it sounded as if she is leading her party into an electoral blizzard. If you apply the 2024 general election result to the councils that are up for election on 1 May, she told supporters: “We lose almost every single one.” The contest, she repeated, would be “very difficult”.The new Tory leader likes to think of herself as a facer of facts from which others flinch. And, presumably, Mrs Badenoch casts herself as a prophet of doom in part because she thinks the results will actually be a bit better than this. Even so, this is a spectacularly downbeat piece of expectation management from an outfit that still thinks of itself as Britain’s natural party of government.It is true that the Tories did very wellin 2021, when Boris Johnson was still popular and the Covid vaccine rollout had cheered the nation, so they are vulnerable this time. It is also true that the Liberal Democrats, buoyed by successes in Tory seats last July, hope torepeatthe trick in counties like Buckinghamshire, Cornwall and Wiltshire in May. And it is especially true thatReform UKis high in the polls and expected to draw votes not just from the Conservatives but also from Labour.Nevertheless, the gloom of the launch spoke volumes about a party that is still, in spite of its catastrophic defeat last year, the principal party of opposition and the most probable alternative government. Ordinarily, these can be important advantages to wield amid the long and often cheerless march of opposition. But the deeper reality is that theConservativesare still flailing over policy and too divided, unable to respond humbly to the defeat of 2024, in much the same manner as when they proved incapable of pre-empting it after Mr Johnson was forced out.Some of this isimpossible to avoid. Even if Mrs Badenoch were a better leader and her party more unified, the Tories would still be profoundly constrained by having had 14 years to sort out problems for which they now try to blame Labour. The approach this week over welfare reform is a perfect example. Recent rows about asylum seekers and grooming gangs illustrate the same point. Next week, it will happen again over the economy.We hold no brief for the Conservatives. But here are some things that might help the party feel a bit more relevant again. It could be more honest about its failings, including over Brexit. It could concentrate on policies to rebuild Tory credibility among young people. It could focus on parts of its record in government where it can claim achievements – on the net zero targets that Mrs Badenochhas just trashed, perhaps, or school standards. And it could learn from the German conservative leader,Friedrich Merz. Being in opposition is not easy, especially after an experience like 2024 and what led up to it. At the moment, though, Mrs Badenoch is making the worst of a bad job.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Already, many young people have good experiences of creative learning. Art and design is a popular GCSE, while class assemblies and concerts are a staple of the primary school calendar – in real life as well as the latestBridget Jones film.But thedisparitybetween the opportunities at state and private schools is enormous. And the interim report of Prof Francis’s panel takes seriouslyconcernsthat the arts have been squeezed out of too many children’s learning. The national curriculum, it points out, is meant to “engender an appreciation of human creativity”. But since 2010, when schools were encouraged by Michael Gove to guide pupils towards a GCSE combination of English, maths, science, a language and history or geography, the arts have been relegated to second fiddle.GCSEs are, of course, not the be-all and end-all. Not everything that happens at school leads to an exam. But the decision by the government to place a higher value on other qualificationshad an effect. There are many reasons to regret this, as this column hasargued before. Our capacity for creative expression and imaginative sympathy is part of what makes us human. In the UK, the creative industries are hugely important economically as well as culturally. Encouraging the development of these capabilities in childhood – alongside literacy, maths and so on – ought to be a core task of educators.Up to a point, it already is. Children generally draw, dance and sing before they write. But efforts to raise standards in primary schools, under both Labour and Conservative governments, saw the emphasis on play and creativity reduced while literacy and maths learning was ramped up. In secondary school, similarly, a strong emphasis on academic attainment combined withcutsmeant that the take up of arts subjects, including drama, fell back.Thereviewalso highlights calls from parents for more applied learning – for example, financial and interview skills. It notes that views on the curriculum are very diverse. But the early, positive signs are that the current emphasis on the English baccalaureate will be reduced in favour of the more flexible Progress 8.The overall picture is complicated. Evidence suggests thatstandards in maths and science have risenin English schools. But the failure of attendance to bounce back since the pandemic is deeply concerning.The latest figuresshow that the absence rate in 2023-24 was 7.1%, compared with 4.7% in 2018-19. Pressure on Send provision (for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities) is intense – with councilsfacing a collective £5bn deficit, and absence rates troublingly high for these pupils. The declining mental and emotional wellbeing of children and young people is among the gravest challenges facing our health service and society.It would be glib to claim that more dancing or painting in classrooms would solve these problems. But, asJohn Harris describedin an article last weekend, for some children creativity is hugely important, while in educational terms it can support inclusion. The concentration of the arts inprivate schools and wealthy areasis unjust – not simply because, along with science and maths, they can be a route to good jobs but because participation in arts and culture is life-enhancing.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

However, it isn’t just children who have been affected by the Covid lockdowns. All age groups have been mentally changed.Our 15-year-old daughter died of leukaemia in September 2020, and we had to cremate her with a select “guest list” due to Covid restrictions – most of her friends were excluded; the strict limit on numbers meant only family members could attend the “event”.A few short days after her funeral, a lockdown was imposed and my wife and I had to sit in our terrace house (no leafy garden and countryside for us to walk in, only an urban desert of brick and asphalt) for nearly five months. We were shorn of the comfort of our family, all of whom lived miles away and were cruelly not allowed to visit. That did us no mental favours at all and has scarred us deeply. Do we trust politicians or senior NHS people? No.Covid and the restrictions that were imposed affected us all, and not for the good. Is it any wonder that our nation is mentally ill?Wayne andHelen OsborneBeeston, NottinghamshireFrances Ryan’s excellent article raises a number of important questions, not least in relation to the ongoing political silence around Covid (Long Covid is the pandemic’s dark shadow. Why does no one in power in Britain want to talk about it?, 17 March). That silence continues around deaths. In England and Wales, the most recentdatafrom the Office for National Statistics shows that between 3 January and 28 February, there were 884 deaths involving Covid and 601 where Covid was the underlying cause of death. The silence around who is responsible for the hundreds of thousands of deaths in the past five years remains deafening.Many of these deaths resulted from cynical political choices and morally indefensible, expedient decision-making by politicians. Their choices resulted in a catastrophic number of preventable deaths, even if they are not definitively quantifiable. Politicians have followed a strategy designed to silence discussion and deflect attention about who was, and is, responsible. Those in government at the time, and their advisers, need to be held to account for what amounts to foreseeable,avoidable, deaths – in other words, social murder on an outrageous scale.Joe SimEmeritus professor, Liverpool John Moores UniversitySteve TombsEmeritus professor, The Open UniversityThank you for remembering the significant numbers still living with long Covid, five years on (Editorial, 14 March). TS Eliot’s words capture their situation so well: “And meanwhile we have gone on living / Living and partly living”.I used to lecture on rehabilitation sciences. Rehabilitation takes skill, time and a deep understanding of the circumstances and hopesof each person. Both the chancellor and prime minister have recently focused on the billfor welfare and the need to reform our “broken” welfare system. The system that was allowed to break was the reablement system. Rehabilitation services such as day hospitals or rehab wards were mortally wounded under the Tory health secretary Virginia Bottomley, and disintegrated under her successor Andrew Lansley. If a new service arises that helps people who feel broken and worthless rebuild their lives, the whole country will be the stronger (and probably less broke).Prof Woody CaanDuxford, CambridgeshireCovid did indeed change TV (‘We warned everyone: do not go near Tom Cruise!’ How Covid sent British TV haywire, five years on, 17 March), particularly in stimulating creative new formats, such asStaged, or adaptations such asTalking Heads. But beyond that, their style and innovation helped and reassured us as we stumbled into a new world of lockdown relationships lived through dodgy Zoom connections and fuzzy old screens.I’d particularly honourGrayson’s Art Cluband Sky’s Portrait Artist of the Week. Those two clever rapid responses to audience isolation became landmarks of warmth, interest and humanity in the weeks of such limited human contact.

And then came a flash of steel. “I have been dealing with let’s say difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old,” replied Coventry. “What I have learned is that communication will be key. That is something that will happen early on.“We will not waver from our values,” she added. “Solidarity and ensuring every athlete that qualifies for theOlympic Gameshas the possibility to attend the Olympic Games and be safe during the Olympic Games.”It was a mightily impressive answer. And it also sent a clear message. Coventry might be inexperienced. But she is ready to deal with whatever her brief involves, whether it is dealing with Presidents Trump, Putin and Xi, the weaponisation of sport, or the challenges of steering the IOC through an uncertain decade.She was equally quick footed when asked about whether more needed to be done to protect women’s sports after theboxing controversy at the Paris Games. “My stance is that we will protect the female category and athletes,” she replied. “I want to work together with the international federations. And we’re going to do that by setting up a task force that will look and analyse everything.”1:25'It is significant': Kirsty Coventry voted first female president of IOC – videoPerhaps we should not have been surprised. In the murky world of Zimbabwean politics, Coventry has proved adept at dodging the pitfalls and rising to the top. That ascent started early at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, where she was hailed as Zimbabwe’s “golden girl” by Robert Mugabe after winning three medals in the swimming pool.The dictator used the same phrase after she won four more medals in Beijing in 2008, but Coventry faced criticism for accepting $100,000 (about £55,000) in prize money on state television at a time when Zimbabweans were suffering hunger as a result of hyperinflation.But she showed she could also use her position to offer a mild rebuke, stating that: “President Mugabe knows something needs to change because so many people are hurting.”There was more controversy in 2018, when she became the sports minister in the cabinet of president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is known as ‘The Crocodile’ for his ruthlessness – and whose democratic credentials are flimsy to say the least.View image in fullscreenCoventry smiles after receiving her gold medal for winning the women’s 200m backstroke at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.Photograph: Mark Baker/APThe British government, for instance, is among those to issue sanctions in a bid to encourage Zimbabwe “to respect democratic principles, refrain from actions, policies or activities which repress civil society in Zimbabwe and to comply with international human rights law and respect for human rights”.However, Coventry has not distanced herself from Mnangagwa. Quite the contrary.

Zimbabwe has been banned from hosting national team games by the Confederation of African Football since 2020 because of unsafe stadiums – something that Coventry has not fixed.Meanwhile at the Paris Olympics, Zimbabwe sent a delegation of 74 people for nine competing athletes, raising questions over whether it was an effective use of taxpayers’ money.View image in fullscreenKirsty Coventry will have to deal with difficult situations including handling the influence of Donald Trump.Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/ReutersCoventry defended her role and actions in government after her victory. “In terms of my country, I chose to try and create change from the inside,” she said. “It gets criticised, and that’s OK, because at the end of the day, I don’t think you can stand on the sidelines and scream for change. I believe you have to be seated at the table.”One thing is clear. The political skills she has acquired in her home country have proved exceptionally useful at the IOC, an organisation she joined in 2013 and rose rapidly to beThomas Bach’s chosen successor.Unlike many of the candidates, she didn’t have an expensive PR team helping her during her campaign. Indeed, her manifesto was written by her and her husband. And the one communications professional who helped her did it for free – and was not even with her in Greece.But, crucially, she had the patronage of Bach, the formidable and powerful IOC president since 2013. Under his watch, over two-thirds of IOC members voting in the election were appointed. And in the final days pressure was applied to deliver the result he wanted.The unanswered question now is what happens next. Will it be ‘continuity Bach’, pursuing a top-down and authoritarian approach that allows members little say? Or will she allow a little light into an organisation that desperately needs it? Whatever happens, the next eight years will be fascinating – and challenging.Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeOlympic GamesSebastian CoeSport politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He approached me and asked if anyone had spoken to me about driving for them the following year. I told him no one had and so on the back of a napkin, before the end of the awards, we agreed to come together for 1987 when we would go on to win the Formula 3 British Championship together.I still believe if he hadn’t given me that chance in Formula 3, I’m not quite sure I’d have had that success or would have got toFormula Onewithout him.‘We’ve lost a true legend’: Eddie Jordan, former F1 team owner, dies aged 76Read moreDuring that year, I got to know the real Eddie Jordan. You can see the Eddie that was on TV and when he was a team owner but when I went down to Sotogrande, to his place in Spain with his family we became close. He was just a brilliant host and he made all his drivers feel very, very comfortable within the walls of Eddie Jordan Racing as it was at the time and of course then later with the F1 team, when he brought in Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill among many others.What was also impossible to ignore was his work ethic; looking back, it’s no surprise thathe achieved what he achieved. His work ethic was continuous, all day and sometimes, literally, all night. There was always a deal to be done and there was always this passion for it.We won together in 1987 and that gave him more drive to get himself through to his ultimate dream, which was Formula One. But he grafted for it, it wasn’t given to him on a plate, he had to go out there and find that sponsorship that he needed to keep racing.When we did Formula 3000 together in 1988, at the first race we had one sponsor on the car and it was plain white, nothing else on it. I got pole position and that evening Eddie phoned up Duncan Lee, who was head of Camel cigarettes at the time. Duncan wasn’t interested in sponsoring us, so Eddie banged on until basically Duncan went: “Okay, you can have a meeting on Tuesday”.Eddie went away to another team, got a Camel sticker, stuck it on the side of the car on the Saturday night and I went out and won, so he had a photo of me winning the race, which he took to the meeting on Tuesday and got the Camel sponsorship for the next two years.So it was the graft and the thought process. Having the meeting is one thing but then to think: ‘Right, I get a sticker, stick it on, if we win the race, Camel’s all over the car’.That was what was so wonderful about the wheeler-dealer side of him. He was always thinking out of the box, always trying to think of new ways with his team to be able to promote himself, the brands that he had on board, his partners and that was very refreshing at that time and a lot of people have taken on board what he did in that early 90s period.View image in fullscreenEddie Jordan grafted to achieve his ultimate dream in motor racing.Photograph: Oliver Dixon/ShutterstockHis strength was also in the team he had chosen. When they were in the factory he made sure that he and they were on the same page and there was a togetherness. Everybody had a free and open situation in their particular jobs and that got the best out of people on that limited budget. He had a lot of trust,Eddie looked after everybodyand that just gave them a really good feel and there was a lot of love, because that was his type of character that he had, he was never, ever shying away from his emotions. He’d be hard when he needed to be but he also knew very well that he needed to keep everybody motivated, happy in the job that they were doing, so there was respect, both ways.Jordan F1 were the underdogs, they were the ones that were there or thereabouts and then got very close to winning the drivers and constructors’ championship with Heinz-Harald Frentzen in 1999. They were the underdogs everybody loved because there was just something about them that drew you in.Look at the pictures of the British Grand Prix in 1995 after I won. Eddie had the truck with his band, Nick Mason was on the drums, Eddie was on the drums, Damon was playing guitar, me doing tambourine as that was the only rhythmic thing I could sort of play. It wasn’t Formula One but the fun and the people that it dragged in after the race was brilliant and he loved it.Eddie Jordan – a life in picturesRead moreHe loved that ability to enjoy what he was doing and the limelight that went with it all. That was why he was so refreshing, so very charismatic and the energy that he brought into the paddock is something that we are still benefiting from today. Eddie was one of the last of those successful characters who came in and he was probably one of the very last team owners who was also running the team, very, very involved with all the decision making that was going on. The way that he did it made it that much more special. He achieved so, so much with not the biggest budget on the grid and that is something that earned respect. There’s a lot of respect for what Eddie achieved on track just as there’s a lot of respect for what Eddie did off track with his TV career.I will miss him massively. I think we will all miss him, to be honest. We all have memories in different ways of what he was like but it was the energy that he gave all of us at the end of the day. He was one of the biggest characters we had in the paddock and his popularity is going to live on for sure.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportcommentShareReuse this content"

The German was forthright on England’s laboured performances during a tournament in which fans and pundits turned on Southgate, saying the side played with fear and showed no excitement beforelosing the final to Spain, and his comments were backed up by Harry Kane’s admission that the squad was “a little bit light on leadership” in Germany.Thomas Tuchel’s first task is to solve England’s main problem: Harry Kane | Barney RonayRead moreSouthgate caused surprise inside the camp by taking a host of inexperienced youngsters to the Euros and leaving out senior figures such as Harry Maguire, Jack Grealish and Jordan Henderson, who washanded a shock recall by Tuchellast week. Henderson’s return was backed by Kane, who praised the midfielder’s ability to lift teammates in difficult moments.There was a stir when Tuchel’s take on England’s efforts last year was publicised. Asked by ITV whether he thought the team had a clear way of playing before his appointment, the head coach said: “Not last summer, no.”Tuchel, who takes charge of his first games when England open their World Cup qualifying campaign by hosting Albania at Wembley on Friday and Latvia on Monday, did not drop the honesty after being pressed on what was missing. “The identity, the clarity, the rhythm, the repetition of patterns, the freedom of player, the expression of player, the hunger,” he said. “They were more afraid to drop out of the tournament in my observation than having the excitement and hunger to win.”The aim is to restore the excitement to England’s play. “That was my feeling watching on TV, long before I knew I would be in charge,” Tuchel said. “I want us to play with a hunger to win and we want to implement the togetherness and joy to win, rather than the fear to lose.”Tuchel considered the notion that the shirt weighs heavily on England’s players. “I know what the players mean,” he said. “It maybe is another way to put what I felt watching the Euros. I felt tension and pressure on the shoulders of the players, and it felt to me that they were more afraid, like they were afraid not to lose and not to have even more pressure added.“We need to turn this around because we have so many experienced players, so many players who won the trophies with their clubs. I think we have every right to be self-confident.”Kane, who knows Tuchel well from their time at Bayern Munich, had a similar view on the Euros. “Maybe we didn’t play as freely as we had done in the past and what we could have done,” England’s captain said. “Thomas definitely wants more high tempo, especially without the ball. When we lose the ball, just energy.“Especially at home at Wembley in these games, almost creating the atmosphere yourselves. That’s what we’ve got to try to do. It’s a new beginning. It was really successful with Gareth and that era of English football. We got to two finals, we got to semi-finals, but it’s about making the next step.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Especially when things are not going so well, or there’s a lot of noise around the camp, that’s when you need players like me and someone like Jordan. It’s great to have him. We complement each other very well in the way we lead.”Tuchel added: “You can be sure that if I say something in a press conference, I have addressed it to the players. There are no messages given through you. We need to implement a communication style that is without fear.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelEuro 2024World Cup 2026 qualifiersHarry KanenewsShareReuse this content"

But the returning goalkeeper, who has not played for Belgium for almost two yearsamid a fallout with their former coach Domenico Tedesco, was barely tested again in the first half and captain Lukaku opened the scoring just before the break with his first Belgium goal since November 2023.In a more lively second half, De Bruyne could have doubled the lead for Belgium through a low attempt from the edge of the area that was brilliantly saved by Ukraine keeper Andriy Lunin.However, Ukraine then grew into the game and hit back through Hutsulyak, who capitalised on a mistake by the Belgium defence to level in the 66th minute, before stretching away with two more goals.Belgium, who earned four points from six games as they finished third in League A Group Two, face their first relegation from the competition’s top tier since its creation in 2018.Explore more on these topicsNations LeagueSpainNetherlandsGermanyItalyRepublic of IrelandCroatianewsShareReuse this content"

Scotland scrapped, scratched and clung on for dear life in the first leg of this clash with Greece. The upshot is a highly favourable position before the teams meet again on Sunday in Glasgow.Netherlands 2-2 Spain, Italy 1-2 Germany, Greece 0-1 Scotland: Nations League – liveRead moreScotland probably did not deserve this victory. Greece fired 24 shots at the Scottish goal. The Tartan Army had to watch the second period through their fingers. Greece will complain vehemently about the circumstances attached to the only goal of the game. Still, Scotland’s attitude alone meant they were deserving of good fortune.They opened 2025 in the same manner as 2024 was closed, against a team who have a formidable home record. Clarke can legitimately point out Craig Gordon, his veteran goalkeeper, had little to do. Hampden Park and the second leg promises to be quite the spectacle. “This game is not dead yet. No way.” Clarke warned. “First half we were really good, we could’ve been two in front. If I’m being greedy I could say three. We knewGreecewould come at us second half. We didn’t quite manage to regain our rhythm so we had to show a different side to our game.”Clarke had resisted temptation to deploy fit-again Kieran Tierney from the start. Scotland’s manager determined recent success with four at the back mattered more than finding a role for the Arsenal player. With Tierney and Andy Robertson both involved, Scotland have typically reverted to a five-man backline. Clarke’s key switch involved the introduction of Lewis Ferguson, outstanding upon return from injury at Bologna, to his midfield.It may be that Greece consider it unfair they find themselves in this scenario at all. They lost one of six matches in Group B2, with England squeezing into the top tier at their expense. Scotland had looked certain for automatic relegation before a stirring finish to their league campaign, epitomised by Robertson’s93rd-minute winner against Polandin November. That Warsaw moment earned potential salvation via this Greece tie. Robertson returned to his international happy place following a domestic spell which has seen Liverpool bundled out of the Champions League and suffer defeat in the League Cup final.The match opened in breathless style before Anthony Ralston produced a terrific header to clear a menacing Georgios Masouras cross. Despite impressive ball retention Scotland offered little by way of attacking response until the 26th minute, when the marauding Ché Adams failed to find Scott McTominay.The key moment of the night involved both McTominay and the whiff of controversy. The Napoli midfielder first appeared to stand on the ball upon entering the Greece penalty area, but Lazaros Rota collided with him thereafter. A spot-kick was awarded, with McTominay dusting himself down to send the goalkeeper the wrong way and notch his 12th Scotland goal. All of them have come in competitive matches. Greece had fiercly contested the decision as, in fairness, would Scotland had the scenario played out in reverse.View image in fullscreenAndy Robertson applauds fans after the match.Photograph: Louiza Vradi/ReutersScotland screamed for another penalty three minutes before the break as Kostas Tsimikas nudged Billy Gimour. In truth, Gilmour should have done better with what was a fine scoring opportunity. So, too, should Adams after Greece botched a goal kick routine. Adams flashed another shot wide in the dying seconds. Scotland reached the dressing room with spring in step.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It had, however, crossed the byline before Christos Tzolis knocked it home. The moment epitomised Greece’s new approach, which saw the Scots forced to defend with increased desperation. Kostas Karetsas, the 17-year-old introduced at half-time, was central to the hosts’ spell of dominance. By the hour, Scotland were weathering a storm. Seven minutes later, a post saved Clarke’s side after a glorious Karetsas cross found Tzolis. By the time John Souttar deflected a Tzolis shot wide – the Scotland defender knew little about this – it felt a matter of time before an equaliser landed.Greece were awarded an 84th minute penalty, Grant Hanley’s lazy leg catching Taxiarchis Fountas. The decision was soon and correctly overturned; the foul took place outside the penalty area. Dimitrios Pelkas whacked the free-kick into the Scottish wall. This summed up Greece’s night. Scotland are 90 minutes from remaining at the top table.Explore more on these topicsNations LeagueScotlandGreecematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Littler sent the Cardiff crowd wild with perfect darts in the fourth leg, and the 18-year-old had to be at his brilliant best to ward off a revitalised Van Gerwen.The world champion hit a remarkable 10 180s and returned a match average of 112.50 to extend his Premier League lead to six points. “I didn’t even realise the double 15 was in until Huw [Ware, the referee] shouted it,” said reigning Premier League champion Littler of his final shot.‘FA Cup of darts’ keeps grassroots flame alive as big-money era shapes to snuff it outRead more“I hit one two weeks ago at the Pro Tour and I went the treble 17, double 15 route after missing double 12 numerous times last year. So I think that’s the new route to go for this year.“You’ve seen players in the world championships hit the nine and go out in that game, so I had to focus after that. Michael won the next two legs but I managed to get back into it.“It’s good to pick up another nightly win, more crucial points, and to have a six-point over Luke [Humphries] is a good boost for myself.”In a match of the highest quality – Van Gerwen also hit four maximums and averaged 101.41 – Littler set the pattern by breaking the first throw of the match in 15 darts. Van Gerwen responded instantly, but Littler broke again in 12 darts before extending a two-leg cushion with his perfect leg.The seesaw nature of the continued as Van Gerwen levelled with the help of a bullseye finish, but Littler replied in kind and moved through the gears after being pulled back at 4-4.Littler had earlier defeated Rob Cross 6-2 at the semi-final stage after eliminating Nathan Aspinall 6-3 in low-key affair in his first game.

World No 1 Humphries took out 121 in the opening leg and led 3-0 and 4-1. But Van Gerwen turned the tide with 10 and 11-dart legs and rattled off five straight legs to win.Gerwyn Price’s homecoming fell flat as Rob Cross silenced the Welsh crowd with a dramatic 6-5 victory. The Iceman fought back to level after trailing 5-2, but Cross took out 170 in the decider with Price waiting on a double.

Thanks to the claustrophobic Pulteney Bridge steps, rival fans are literally rubbing shoulders before they even reach the famously compact ground. Then they get to spend 80 minutes seat-by-jowl with each other, and the “mickey-taking” – Rumble’s words – is intense.“I never learn much about rugby from them,” Rumble jokes. “But I come away knowing an awful lot about Volvo cars and Ikea and PTA meetings.”Women’s Six Nations 2025: team-by-team guide to the tournamentRead moreI thought of Rumble when I read thatPremiership Rugby will be trialling “away ends”for supporters next month. The idea that separating out its fans is what rugby really wants or needs right now baffled me, which is why I called Rumble, who has spent decades in the Shed, Kingsholm’s famously vociferous stand. Rumble turns out to be as sceptical as me. “They’ve missed a trick,” he says when I call him. “They should have waited a couple of weeks and brought this out on April the first.”The convivial atmosphere of a rugby ground – especially compared to the snarling intensity and intimidatory language on football terraces – is a big part of why I care for the game. But there are those who think rugby is too quiet. Take the Harlequins flanker Will Evans, who believes away sections are long overdue and can “grow the game massively”.From his perspective, there is nothing better than a concentrated base of support during an away match, upping the noise levels and provoking the home fans to get louder too. “It’s like you end up playing in a cauldron, and players love that. I think sometimes a game can reflect the lack of atmosphere within a stadium, but where we’ve had big away support, the games have ended up being crazy.”I hear his argument, although if the quality of club rugby is that dependent on crowd noise then no wonder it’s in trouble. But none of this is the real motivation for the trial, which is ultimately in service of the broadcasters: give them more bang, and they’ll give the sport more buck.“The Premier League has a £6.7bn TV rights deal over the next four years,” says Evans. “Companies do not pay those crazy figures for a quiet hum in the crowd. They want noise, they want passion, and at the moment you’re not getting that in rugby.”View image in fullscreenWill Evans thinks specified away sections can ‘grow the game massively’.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAQuins are one of a few teams – including Northampton and Saracens – whose supporters groups already block-book tickets to away games to create an away-fan section in the crowd. “We’ve been doing it for 15 years, so it’s not a new phenomenon,” says Phil Gibson, chair of the Quins Supporters’ Association.He points out that the term “away end” is misleading – there’s no compulsion for away fans to sit in their designated section, and individuals are still free to buy tickets wherever they want. “People start envisaging stewards in hi-vis separating supporters who are abusing each other over a load of covered seats. And that is just never, ever going to happen in rugby.”Brian Moore, a former hooker with an acute legal mind, raised justifiable concerns when this trial was first mooted last October. There are, he pointed out, strong sociological studies on tribal behaviours, and plenty of evidence of what happens when you stoke them in sport. Moore was particularly concerned about the loss of the current, largely accepting response to referee decisions – there are, after all, a lot more of them in rugby than football, and most deeply technical. “Rugby’s officials are under enough pressure, without adding … reflexive booing of every decision that goes against one side.”What about the likelihood of an increase in player abuse? “I think you have to give rugby fans the benefit of the doubt,” says Evans, who believes that the sport is “starting way beyond” many others in terms of respect levels. “They are more than capable of policing themselves.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionPerhaps that’s true, but it’s still curious that a sport that prides itself on being played in a non-hostile environment is actively seeking ways to give itself more edge. English cricket, by contrast, has just spent tens of millions of pounds on a new tournament no one asked for precisely to capture the kind of inclusive, family-centric scene rugby already has.Maybe I’m just sceptical because there seems to be enough manufactured division and pointless yelling in the world right now. It’s why I feel sad at the direction of travel in women’s football. So many of the things we’ve been celebrating it for – sense of social purpose, family-friendly atmospheres – appear increasingly under threat. Abuse at grounds and training are already leading players to retreat from their fanbase. Will their answer, too, be segregated stands?View image in fullscreenVivianne Miedema’s comments on the risks of increased abuse are worth listening to.Photograph: SPP Sport Press Photo./Alamy“We always say and we’re always proud as a women’s game that we’re very inclusive but somehow that is starting to slip away a bit,” Manchester City’s Vivianne Miedemasaid last week. “If we are so proud of the environment we’ve created, we need to be really, really careful in the next steps we’re making.” It sums up how I feel about the slippery slope of championing away sections in rugby. Sport has seen plenty of unintended consequences in its constant demand for growth.For perspective and reassurance, I return to fans themselves. Gibson points out that the numbers are so small that the whole issue has become overblown. “I would guess when we go up to Leicester [for the trial game] we’ll probably have a group of 200 sat together and there’ll be another two or three hundred scattered around the park,” he says. “We’re not talking about segregation, we’re talking about choice.”For Rumble, there will be a chance to join in the experiment at Stone X Stadium when Saracens take on Gloucester. “Let’s be candid, rugby’s been in a parlous state for a while. Is this the panacea? I don’t think so, but I wish them well.” In the meantime, he welcomes any and all away fans to come stand next to him in the Shed, and I think I might just take him up on it.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionSport politicscommentShareReuse this content"

While 20 of the birds lived near roads, 18 nested away from traffic.Within the territory of each male, the team played two recorded soundtracks on different days. One soundtrack only featured the song of another male Galápagos yellow warbler, while the other additionally featured traffic sounds.The team found males that lived near busy roads behaved more aggressively in the latter case, approaching and flying around the speaker in search of the intruder. Akçay said that while one possibility was that they got closer to make themselves heard, not all males sang as they approached – suggesting they were ready for a dust-up.“If there was an actual bird instead of a speaker, that would mean … a challenge, essentially, and that could result in a physical fight,” he said.By contrast, males that lived away from roads showed less aggression when traffic noises were present – possibly, the team suggests, because they were scared by the unfamiliar sound.The scientists said males living on the more densely populated Santa Cruz Island sang for longer when traffic sounds were present, while the reverse was true for those on the more sparsely populated Floreana Island.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

And, while an increase in peak frequency was only seen in males that lived away from traffic, the team suggests that could be because the birds that lived near roads were already singing at the optimum peak frequency.Akçay said it was possible birds that were better able to deal with traffic noise settled near roads but, alternatively, it could be that birds adapt as a result of living near traffic.And, because there are very few people on Floreana, that raises another point.“Even that little experience [of traffic], apparently, has some effect,” he said. “We have to think about noise pollution even in places like Galápagos, I think, and the impact of noise pollution on the unique species there.”Explore more on these topicsZoologyGalápagos IslandsPollutionBiologyEcuadorBirdsAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is rich in natural resources, including the world’s largest gold and copper mine as well as extensive reserves of natural gas, minerals and timber.It was part of the Dutch East Indies for a couple of centuries, but in 1963, in controversial circumstances, the territory was handed over to Indonesian control. As a result, say the campaigners, West Papua’s Indigenous Melanesians have not benefited from this wealth. They have been under occupation by Indonesia since 1963, facing repression the ULMWP describes as a “hidden genocide”.West Papuanssay more than 500,000of their people have been killed by the occupation in the past six decades, while millions of acres of their ancestral lands have been destroyed for corporate profit. Indonesia, already the world’s largest palm oil exporter, is now breaking ground in West Papua on the world’s biggest single palm oil plantation, as well as a sugar cane and biofuel plantation that will be the largest deforestation project ever launched.View image in fullscreenBaliem Valley, West Papua.Photograph: Reinhard Dirscherl/AlamyAccording to reports, companies behind the Tanah Merah project plan toestablish palm oil plantations in the country’s eastacross more than 140,000 hectares (346,000 acres) – an area twice the size of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. At the same time, Indonesian authorities haveplans to turn Merauke, in the south, into a 2m-hectare site for the production of 2.6m tons of sugar and 244m litres of bioethanol each year.“West Papuans’, especially the ULMWP, position is very clear: we are a modern-day colony,” said Ap, speaking from the Netherlands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She says the verdict is “a calculated attack on the sovereign rights of the Standing Rock Sioux and all indigenous peoples defending their land and water.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will not be silenced,” the statement said.Energy Transfer’s counsel during the case, Trey Cox, said that the verdict showed that Greenpeace’s actions had been unlawful. “It is also a day of celebration for the constitution, the state ofNorth Dakotaand Energy Transfer,” he said following the decision.Kevin Cramer, a Republican senator for North Dakota, also celebrated the verdict on social media, writing: “Today, justice has been done with Greenpeace and its radical environmentalist buddies who encouraged this destructive behavior during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests with their defamatory and false claims about the pipeline” in a post on X.This ruling is a blatant attempt to silence dissent and crush the power of grassroots activism350.org, international environmental organizationBut experts and non-profit groups expressed alarm over the verdict and what it means for constitutional rights in the US.EarthRights, another non-governmental, non-profit group, says that theDakota Access pipelineprotests were “overwhelmingly peaceful” and that the organization “proudly joins Greenpeace USA in speaking up against brazen legal attacks and ensuring that the environmental movement only continues to grow stronger, despite the appalling result in North Dakota”.The case is being described by legal experts as a classic example of a Slapp – a form of civil litigation increasingly deployed by corporations, politicians and wealthy individuals to deliberately wear down and silence critics including journalists, activists and watchdog groups. These cases often result in significant legal costs for the defendants, which is viewed as “a win” for the suing entity even if they don’t win the lawsuit.The international environmental organization 350.org called the verdict against Greenpeace a “devastating legal ruling”.“This ruling is a blatant attempt to silence dissent and crush the power of grassroots activism,” the group said in a statement. “It sends a dangerous message: that fossil fuel giants can weaponize the courts to silence those who challenge the destruction of our planet.”They also warn that the fossil fuel industry is increasingly turning to “lawfare” – the use of courts and legal action as weapons of intimidation.Most jurors in US pipeline case against Greenpeace have fossil fuel industry tiesRead moreBrice Böhmer, the climate and environment lead at Transparency International, said: “In the face of a climate emergency, it is unconscionable that organisations committed to protecting our planet from the devastating consequences of fossil fuel extraction should be prosecuted in this manner.“As the world struggles under the weight of an existential climate crisis, it cannot be right that environmental defenders are being silenced by a weaponised legal system.”Greenpeace says it plans to appeal the verdict, and some legal experts say they have a good case to do so. The appeal would go straight to the state supreme court, as North Dakota does not have an appellate level court.Kelcy Warren, Energy Transfer’s billionaire founder, is a major donor toDonald Trump.Explore more on these topicsGreenpeaceDemocracy and justiceLaw (US)North DakotaDakota Access pipelinenewsShareReuse this content"

He said the group should set minimum standards for land management plans, with clear milestones for nature restoration and protections.He said: “Landowners must go further and faster to restore our natural world. The National Estate for Nature, who manage a tenth of the land in this country, have a responsibility to future generations to leave the environment in a better state. We have a unique opportunity to work together on common sense changes that create a win-win for nature, the economy, and make the best use of the land around us.”Just 8% of the land and sea in England is protected for nature. The government has a target to reach 30% by 2030, butwildlife groups saythe proportion of land “effectively protected” for nature is even lower than the official statistic, at 2.93%. Nature across Englandcontinues to be in decline, with wild bird numbers decreasing each year. The 2023state of nature reportdescribed the UK as one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, based on declines since the 1970s.The Labour government hopes to accelerate efforts to meet these targetsand recently legalised thewild release of beaversand announced aland use frameworkthat will provide guidance on how to best use land for food and nature.The environmental campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: “Major landowners in England like the Forestry Commission, crown estate and water companies own millions of acres of land – it’s only right that we expect them to repair the badly damaged habitats that they own.”He argued that large landowners should make their plans to protect nature public so that they can be scrutinised and held to account: “The government must mandate these landowners to publish their plans for nature restoration, so the public can see how the land is being looked after on our behalf – and change the outdated legal duties of public bodies to prioritise restoring ecosystems and fixing the climate crisis.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We still think that interest rates are on a gradually declining path, but we’ve held them at 4.5% today.“We’ll be looking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving at our six-weekly rate-setting meetings. Whatever happens, it’s our job to make sure that inflation stays low and stable.”Financial markets had indicated a 90% probability that Threadneedle Street would not repeat February’s cut, when itlowered its key base rate from 4.75%and halved its UK growth forecast.UK pay growth chartReeves will deliver her statement to the Commons next week against a backdrop of lacklustre domestic growth, stubbornly high inflation and rising global uncertainty as Trump imposes tariffs on the US’s allies and enemies alike.UK GDP unexpectedly fell in January, after having come close stalling in the second half of last year.The Bank upgraded its forecast for growth in the first quarter from 0.1% to about 0.25% after a stronger end to 2024 than feared, but said the outlook remained highly uncertain amid weak consumer and business sentiment.Industry groupshave criticisedthe chancellor’s planned £25bn increase in employers’ national insurance contributions, and a 6.7% rise in the minimum wage from April, arguing that they are likely to stoke inflation.In a blow for the chancellor before the spring statement, the Bank published findings compiled by its network of agents across the country showing that growing numbers of companies were putting their hiring plans on ice.“Employment intentions are now negative, on balance, with more firms reporting hiring pauses or freezes and saying they will review staffing levels through natural attrition or redundancies if the outlook does not improve,” the report said.Highlighting “a material increase in total labour costs owing to the changes in employer NICs” alongside the increase in the “national living wage”, it said the rise in labour costs could be up to 10%.Official figures show the jobs market has proven more resilient than business surveys, withthe latest data on Thursdayshowing unemployment remained the same in January at 4.4% while pay growth stuck at historically high levels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the headline rate remains above the Bank’s 2% target and has increased in recent months, from 2.5% in Decemberto 3% in January. It is expected to climb further in coming months afteran increase in household energy costs.The Bank signalled that it remained open to more “gradual and careful” rate cuts, but City traders bet the next reduction was unlikely to come until August. Financial markets anticipate two more quarter-point cuts this year.“There appears to be diminishing appetite for cutting rates faster and a growing desire to cut at the current pace at best,” said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy CapitalEconomics.“Even so, we still think the weak economy will reduce inflation further ahead and prompt it to resume rate cuts, taking rates below the levels investors expect.”Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesBank of EnglandEconomicsMortgage ratesMortgagesnewsShareReuse this content"

[As] I have said to all of you many times, I have done nothing wrong, so I was confident of reaching this point but obviously it is a relief now to have that confirmed,” she said.“For almost two years I have had this cloud of investigation hanging over me. It won’t surprise anybody to hear me say that’s not been an easy experience, so to reach this point today is obviously something I am relieved about. I’ve been trying to go on with my life and I now intend to do that.”Beattie told reporters at Holyrood on Thursday he was very relieved to have been cleared, and said he intended to stand again for parliament next year.“I knew myself I had done nothing wrong but two years is a long time to wait for a result,” he said. “I’ve had tremendous support from constituents and members. I can at least relax and get back to family life now.”The confirmation came after it emerged that Murrell, who served as the SNP’s chief executive for 22 years, had made no plea during his court appearance, a routine hearing that formally begins the prosecution process.The Crown Office has not yet released the charge against him.Murrell was arrested in April 2023 after police came to the home he then shared with Sturgeon in Uddingston, as police mounted a simultaneous raid on the SNP’s headquarters near the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh.Police erected tents outside their detached home, carrying out extensive searches of the property and its garden and shed, while removing documents and computers from their home and the SNP’s offices.Police later confiscated a luxury motorhome parked outside Murrell’s mother’s home in Fife.After being released pending further investigation, Murrell was rearrested on 18 April 2024 and charged with embezzlement. In late 2024, Police Scotland submitted an extensive report to the Crown Office, setting out the evidence it had gathered.Murrell has made no public comment about his arrest or the investigation, but Sturgeon has repeatedly said she was innocent of any wrongdoing since her arrest in June 2023.Sturgeon, whose memoirs will be published in August, announced in January that she and Murrell were to divorce and indicated they had been living separate lives for some time. Earlier in March, she confirmed she would not be standing for re-election to Holyrood in next year’s Scottish parliament elections.Explore more on these topicsUK newsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

This includes new requirementsunder Awaab’s Law, requiring landlords to address health and safety issues in a specific timeframe.The survey found that council housing rents across the country are to increase, but fewer councils have the funds to invest in new housing developments, which may hamper government plans to build 1.5m homes over the next five years.Grace Williams, leader of Waltham Forest council and executive member for housing and regeneration at London Councils, said local authorities were facing a “black hole in our social housing finances”.“In Waltham Forest, we were the fourth largest council home builder in 2024, but like other local authorities, we’re finding it harder to balance those two responsibilities [of building and maintaining],” she said.“For the next five years, we’re using £165m to invest in our current housing stock for improvements and safety. But we need to build more homes for people who are in housing need.“The numbers are just going up, and it’s difficult, because we need both things.”She said it was “refreshing” to have a government talking about building housing but that councils need more investment if they’re going to help deliver it.The LGA found that of those councils with aHousingRevenue Account (HRA), 72% said they were very or fairly likely to draw on reserves to balance their budget for 2025/26. An HRA is a ringfenced budget funded by council housing rent to be spent on housing maintenance and housebuilding.London Councils forecasted that boroughs will have to cut £264m from their social housing spending over the next four years to avoid their HRAs becoming insolvent.In September, an “unprecedented coalition” of councils in Englandcalled for an emergency injection of £644mfrom the government to stabilise their housing accounts and prevent investment in new homes being delayed or cancelled.The government is consulting on a five-year rent settlement for social housing, but many local authorities said it was not enough – just over half of respondents said they were confident this settlement would allow them to balance their budgets.The LGA called on the government to instead plan a 10-year rent settlement, and use the upcoming spending review to announce extra funding.“While many councils see a proposed five-year settlement as a step in the right direction, there are concerns this is not long enough to give them the certainty they need to ramp up their new-build housing programmes,” said Hug.“The situation is untenable and unsustainable, and without urgent action, councils – and the communities and people they support – will be severely impacted.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government said: “We understand the financial pressures councils are facing and we are determined to fix the foundations of the sector so we can deliver the biggest boost in social and affordable housebuilding in a generation.“That’s why, despite the inheritance we have been left, we’re giving councils £500m to help them deliver homes for families at risk of homelessness, and injecting an additional £800m into the Affordable Homes Programme to deliver thousands of new social and affordable homes.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandHousingLocal governmentCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

I was acutely conscious of this and so tried to take the knickers off without bending over too much. By this point, I was expecting to show my naked body upright – being bent over in such an exposing and vulnerable position had never been discussed. Noel was telling me to bend over, repeating things like “bend over further, come on” and “do it properly”​…​“He repeated these comments until I bent over further and further until I was bent completely over with my bum in the air. From this position, my vulva would have been visible to him personally and I presume at close range on camera. I felt humiliated and totally powerless​.”​Mila said she felt “hugely embarrassed, blindsided and shell​ shocked​” and those feelings were amplified when she became aware that Clarke had been watching rushes of the scene and allowing others to as well.​“One day, I was in the back of a car being driven on to set by a driver/runner who had not been on set for the filming of the stripping scene, and he made a jokey comment to me about the scene, referring to it as something along the lines of ‘saucy’, and it inferred that he had seen it,” she told the court.​“My stomach dropped and I felt incredibly embarrassed, and I was horrified to think that Noel had captured those angles and was allowing other people to watch them without my consent​.”Philip Williams, representing Clarke, who is suing over Guardian publications from 2021-22 alleging sexual misconduct, suggested that Mila was embellishing what had happened.He suggested that if events had happened as she described she would have subsequently “avoided nudity and sex scenes like the plague”.Mila replied: “As an actress, you would be turning down a lot of work if you were not prepared to do any nudity at all.” She added that the other productions had not involved full-frontal nudity.The court also heard from actors Charles Cattrall and Samuel Phillips who said Mila had told them about her negative experiences with Clarke not long after the shoot.Cattrall said in his witness statement that it sounded as if actors were “put in a position where they did not feel they could object” and “she also told me … that she believed Clarke was sharing rushes with various people on set: at least one driver and other male crew.”Phillips said in his witness statement: “She [Mila] told me Clarke required her to get fully naked and he positioned his monitor right behind her where she had to bend down when naked.”The final witness on Thursday, Marc Small, claimed in his witness statement that Davie Fairbanks, with whom he wrote and directed Legacy, told him that Clarke, the film’s producer, had recorded nude auditions without actors’ knowledge.Williams put it to Small that he “had an axe to grind” because he and Fairbanks were involved in a business dispute with Clarke over the origins of the Sky show Bulletproof, which Clarke starred in with Ashley Walters.Small replied: “That is absolutely incorrect. I can’t say I was happy with Mr Clarke if he has adapted some of my work but I don’t relentlessly think about it.”Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

Residents have complained that rats are rummaging through the waste, leading to fears over public health.Last Tuesday, nearly 400 council bin workers in the city began indefinite strike action. United said the Labour-run city council could end the dispute “by agreeing to pay a decent rate of pay”. Union officials met council officers on Thursday, but the strike continues.A Unite spokesperson said: “The talks were inconclusive. There was an exchange of information and Unite asked for clarity on a number of points raised by the council, which are currently being worked on.“It was agreed that there would be further regular negotiations, but dates for further talks have not yet been set.”A Birmingham city council spokesperson said: “Birmingham city council and Unite met this afternoon to discuss the current industrial action. Whilst no resolution was reached today, there are points for discussion, the tone was constructive and we are working on the matters raised.“We have contacted Unite representatives to schedule the series of future meeting dates.”The council had previously said the “escalation” of industrial action would mean greater disruption to residents despite a “fair and reasonable offer” made to Unite members.The Conservative councillor for Edgbaston, Deirdre Alden, said the excess rubbish around the city had caused an “explosion” in the local rat population.“I have heard reports of rats in gardens, in rubbish bins and eating the cables in people’s cars – it’s like something out of the Pied Piper of Hamelin,” she said.The industrial action was referenced in parliament on Thursday, with an MP saying that “rats the size of cats”, which she nicknamed the Squeaky Blinders, were “not welcome” beyond Birmingham’s boundaries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The education department will also, for the first time, do an in-depth analysis of the national behaviour survey in schools to look at the most successful ways of policing the bans, and the challenges schools are facing.The guidancestates that “all schools should prohibit the use of mobile phones throughout the school day – not only during lessons but break and lunchtimes as well”, but does not say how schools should enforce the bans.Phillipson is understood to have become frustrated that there is no monitoring of whether the guidance is being followed or proving useful to schools. There are no plans for the government to legislate to ban phones in schools, which ministers believe is fraught with problems.School phone bans alone do not improve grades or wellbeing, says UK studyRead moreThe monitoring will look at how well schools are following policies, how many schools have bans in place, how schools implement bans, such as keeping phones in lockers or bags, and what impact it is having on behaviour. Specific further questions on smartphones will be added to futurenational behaviour surveysto gain additional insights.A government source said: “It beggars belief that the Tories repeatedly told voters they were banning phones but did nothing to ensure the guidance was being followed.“While the vast majority of schools are complying with the guidance we need to make sure it’s being followed to the letter. Rather than indulge in gimmicks and headline grabbing after years of telling us the guidance was sufficient like the Tories, we’re going to keep schools honest and ensure classrooms and corridors are phone-free.”In the Commons on Wednesday, Keir Starmer said he had been watching the Netflix dramaAdolescencewith his teenage children.The series focuses on a family and their teenage son who is arrested for killing a female classmate, and on the impact of online misogynist influencers. The Labour MP Anneliese Midgley asked the prime minister to do more to tackle online male radicalisation.The series’ writerJack Thornehas called for screenings in parliament and said he believes there should be further social media restrictions for young teenagers.Cabinet ministers are split over whether there is a need to do more on the issue.MPs who backed abill from Labour’s Josh MacAlisterthis year, which would have restricted social media algorithms trained on young teens, said the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, was broadly against any wider changes that would go further than self-policing.Phillipson’s department only has jurisdiction over school use of smartphones. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, is among those open to more robust action because of the mental health effects of social media, which affect his department.Speaking to the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, said ending phone use in schools was a “no-brainer”.Trott admitted the guidance issued by the Conservative government last year “hasn’t worked”, with too many children still using phones in classrooms.The Conservatives put down an amendment to the schools bill earlier this week, asking for a full ban on smartphones in schools, which was voted down by the government. Trott denied the amendment was a “gimmick”, saying “parents, teachers, children are all asking for this”.According to an Ipsos poll in September 2024, almost half the UK public believe there should be a total ban on smartphones in schools. A majority of parents said their child’s school did not currently have a full ban in place.MacAlister’s bill included plans to give headteachers legal backing to make schools phone-free.The bill was watered down to gain government assurances on some of the measures, taking out any requirements on tech companies or schools, and just committing the government to do more research.Kit Malthouse, a Tory former education secretary, told the House of Commons the watering down amounted to the “gutting of what could have been a landmark bill”.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsSmartphonesYoung peopleSocial mediaDigital mediaMobile phonesMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

It said plans were being put in place despite low government confidence that their objectives could be achieved.The watchdog will now look at whether those issues represent failures by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to comply with environmental law.The OEP was set up after Brexit. It holds the government to account under theEnvironment Act 2021, which was passed toreplace EU law as a means of holding ministers to account on environmental standards.The OEP found in its report that water regulations were not being followed, meaning targets to clean up England’s rivers by 2027 were very likely to be missed.While in the EU, England was covered by thewater framework directive(WFD), and a national chemical and ecological survey of rivers was conducted annually. After Brexit, England diverged from EU water monitoring standards and transposed the WFD into English law.Since 2016, the government started testing water quality under WFD every three years rather than annually. In 2019, the last time the full water assessments took place, just 14% of rivers were in good ecological health and none met standards for good chemical health. The next results are due this year.The EU has been strengthening testing under the WFD, adding12 new pollutantsto its watchlist. The Labour government has said its independent water commission, due to report in coming months, will assess theefficiency of the directive, and there is potential that the UK will further diverge from it.A previousGuardian investigationfound that the UK has diverged from multiple EU environmental laws since Brexit, and in most cases the legislation has been weakened, leaving nature less protected.Helen Venn, the OEP’s chief regulatory officer, said they were awaiting the results of the independent water commission.She added: “But we also believe that more urgent actions may be needed. We are concerned that there is an indication of potential failures to comply with environmental laws which are having ongoing negative consequences for water bodies, and this is why the important targets for water quality are highly likely to be missed.“Even with all the other activities taking place, none involve firm commitments to address the issues we have identified, and the timeline and extent of any resulting changes are currently uncertain. Clarifying the requirements under the current regulations can help drive action to ensure those targets for water bodies are met as quickly as possible.”A Defra spokesperson said: “This government is determined to clean up our polluted rivers, lakes and seas as part of our plan for change. We have put water companies under tough special measures with new powers to ban the payment of bonuses to polluting water bosses and bring criminal charges against lawbreakers.“We have also launched an independent water commission, which is looking at widespread water sector reform including the effectiveness of the water framework directive.“We welcome the OEP’s support for the commission and share their commitment to improve water quality. We will work constructively with them on this investigation.”Explore more on these topicsRiversEnglandPollutionEuropean UnionBrexitWaterWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He said he feared being made homeless and deported because he said the Home Office never responded to his repeated requests, dating back to the 1980s, to resolve his immigration status.He decided to have one last try to regularise his status and this week received a letter from the Home Office saying that his right to remain in the UK under the Windrush policy had been confirmed and that he could apply to the Windrush compensation scheme for any losses owing to not having been able to demonstrate his lawful status in the UK.He recently received a warning from the housing association that runs his home in westLondon, saying said his accommodation was at risk because he could not prove his right to rent, owing to his lack of a passport.He shared the property with his British partner and the tenancy was in her name, but she died in 2023 and since then he has not been able to produce documentation proving his right to rent.“Originally, I got a stamp in my Sierra Leone passport, but when I sent the passport to the Home Office to be updated I never got any reply and never got my passport back, even though I wrote several letters about it to the Home Office asking what was happening,” Jarrett-Coker said.Until he received the letter from the Home Office confirming his rights under the Windrush scheme he said he had been overwhelmed with anxiety about his immigration status and had struggled to eat or sleep. “I’ve paid my taxes and national insurance all my life and have been working since the age of 16. I take pride in knowing I have made a contribution to British society. I could not imagine having to leave my children and grandchildren.”“When the Home Office confirmed I can stay here this week I felt elated.

Nonetheless, we are pleased that this matter has now been resolved,” said Herbert Smith, whose work includes advising clients on sanctions compliance.OFSI, a division of the Treasury, said the payments, spread over a period of seven days as the company wound down its Russian offices, were caused by a “pattern of failings”.It blamed inadequate due diligence and sanctions screening, amid the “hasty closure” of HSF Moscow.Some of the payments related to redundancy settlements for staff with Sberbank accounts, while others related to fees for audit services and insurance products.HSF London voluntarily disclosed the breaches to OFSI, resulting in a 50% reduction to the final penalty amount.

The same source says median debt runs between $20,000 and $24,999, with median postgraduate debt about double those figures. Younger graduates, between 25 and 39, are more likely to say they are struggling financially than older graduates, though graduates still report higher income than those who do not complete college.Many observers doubt that whatever remains of the Department of Education will be properly equipped to manage student debt.In a statement to the Guardian on Thursday, Sameer Gadkaree, the CEO of the Institute for College Access and Success, said: “Shuttering the Department of Education would prove disastrous for students, borrowers, and our nation’s future workforce. Without the department, fewer students would be able to go to college, student loan borrowers would default in droves, and fraudulent colleges would prey on students with impunity. Separately, gutting education research would curtail our ability to track progress on national educational goals.”Gadkaree added: “The administration claims that it can avoid these harms by shifting the department’s functions to the states – which, like shuttering the department, would require congressional approval. But states cannot effectively administer federal student loans, send out grant aid to millions of students across thousands of colleges, or compile national data.”Beth Maglione, the interim president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators,said recently: “Claiming that eliminating half the department won’t affect its services – without any clear plan to redistribute the workload – is, at best, naive and, at worst, deliberately misleading.“It also raises serious concerns about how billions of dollars in federal student aid will continue to be disbursed to students without interruption.”Earlier this week, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT)suedthe Trump administration, accusing it of unlawfully shutting down access to income-driven student loan repayment plans – a step taken last month after a courtruled againstSave, a Biden administration initiative to provide more generous terms than previous repayment plans.A department spokesperson said it was working to ensure the programs conform with the court ruling “and anticipates the revised form allowing borrowers to change repayment plans to be available as soon as next week”.What is the US Department of Education and what does it do?Read moreSome observers do not think it is out of the question that student debt will not remain at the Trump Department of Education, but could be transferred to another department as Trump himself has suggested.Mark Kantrowitz, a higher education expert, recently told CNBC that Trump could try to transfer student loans to the treasury or the Department of Commerce, though such moves might be stymied by a lack of expertise at those other bodies.Such a move would in all likelihood lead to a period of bureaucratic disruption. Kantrowitz also warned that if student debt remains under the remit of whatever remains of the education department, borrowers may find existing loan forgiveness programs choked and stalled, with staff no longer able to cope.Trump is also seeking to limit the public service loan forgiveness program, onideological grounds.Amid the chaos, CNBC said it was “important … to keep in mind” that “the terms and conditions of … federal student loans cannot change even if the agency overseeing them does”, because “borrowers’ rights were guaranteed when they signed the master promissory note when their loans were originated.”Last month, theTrump administrationremoved an online application form for multiple popular student debt repayment plans including income-driven repayment plans.The administration alsoremovedan online application for students to consolidate their plans on the Department of Education website.On Tuesday, the AFT – a major teachers union in the US –fileda lawsuit against the Department of Education after the department prevented applications from being processed on affordable repayment plans for student loans.According to the complaint, ATF “brings this lawsuit to compel the department to abide by Congress’s command and provide borrowers with the ability to re-pay their loans through the affordable, income-driven repayment plans to which they are entitled.”In a statement accompanying the lawsuit, Weingarten said: “By effectively freezing the nation’s student loan system, the new administration seems intent on making life harder for working people, including for millions of borrowers who have taken on student debt so they can go to college.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS student debtUS educationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "1:17Thousands of Israelis protest against resumption of Gaza war – videoIsraelThousands protest in Israel over ‘attack on democracy’ by NetanyahuProtesters accuse PM of continuing Gaza war for political reasons and ignoring plight of hostages still held by HamasIsrael–Gaza war – latest updatesJason Burkein JerusalemThu 20 Mar 2025 10.32 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 16.07 EDTShareTens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to call for a new ceasefire inGazaand to protest against what they say is an attack on the country’s democracy by the rightwing governing coalition of Benjamin Netanyahu.Key highways have been blocked and police have made at least 12 arrests amid heated scenes in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. More protests were expected in the coming days as the campaign “gathers momentum and energy”, campaigners said.The immediate trigger for the anger was Netanyahu’s attemptto dismissRonen Bar, the head of the internal security agency, but the prime minister’s decision to shatter a two-month-old truce in Gaza with waves of lethal airstrikes has fuelled the demonstrations.Protesters accuse the government of continuing the war for political reasons and ignoring the plight of the 59 hostages – about 24 of whom are believed to be alive – still held by Hamas in the devastated Palestinian territory.“This government has now also started a war, once again, to protect itself, to divert the discourse from the things that bother the public inIsrael. The government has lost all legitimacy on every possible level … They are failing,” said Eitan Herzel, chief executive of the Brothers in Arms protest movement.On Wednesday thousands packed streets close to Netanyahu’s official residence in central Jerusalem. Many carried Israeli flags and placards with slogans in support of hostages still held in Gaza. Others beat drums and chanted “hostages deal now” as they marched in from other parts of Israel.Ora Nakash Peled, a former senior naval officer and an organiser of the protests, had come from her home on a kibbutz near the northern city of Haifa. She had spent the night with other protesters in a tented camp on the outskirts of Jerusalem before walking into the city along a major highway.View image in fullscreenOra Nakash Peled: ‘We need to be organised, we need to be persistent.’Photograph: Jason Burke/The Guardian“I think we have made our point … We need to be organised, we need to be persistent, we need to be focused. [The protest] cannot be violent [but] it doesn’t have to be polite.”Protesters chanted: “Israel is not Turkey, Israel is not Iran,” and pointed to a series of recent moves by Netanyahu they call “red flags” for Israeli democracy.One is the unprecedented effort to dismiss Bar. Another is a bid by the prime minister and his allies to oust the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, who has argued that removing Bar from his post might be unlawful.“The government has the authority to fire Bar but still has to comply with administrative law,” said Dr Amir Fuchs, a legal expert at theIsrael Democracy Institute. “So, for example, if there is seen to be a conflict of interests, it could be stopped by the supreme court.”Experts point out that Shin Bet, which has wide-ranging powers, is investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media and taking money from Qatar, which is know to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.New suspectsin the “Qatargate” affair were interviewed by Israeli police on Wednesday, local media reported.Netanyahu is also facing a potential jail sentence at the conclusion of an ongoing corruption trial. The 75-year-old politician, who took power in Israel for the first time in 1996 and has served 17 years as prime minister, is giving evidence twice weekly.Other concerns for protesters include reforms that would introduce more political appointees to committees that select judges.A series of high-ranking officials seen as responsible for the mistakes and misjudgements that led to the Hamas attack in October 2023 have resigned. Netanyahu himself has not accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst ever security disaster, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and has resisted calls for a powerful commission of inquiry.Fuchs said: “Netanyahu is doing this because he has a problem he wants to solve by centralising as much power as possible and getting rid of all the gatekeepers and professionals … but this does not align with the interests of the state of Israel, only with those of the prime minister and his government.”View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu.Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/APNetanyahu claimed there was a “leftist deep state” working against him in a social media post on Wednesday.“In America and in Israel, when a strong rightwing leader wins an election, the leftist deep state weaponises the justice system to thwart the people’s will. They won’t win in either place!” the post said.Observers pointed to a strong echo in the current movement of the huge protests that erupted in 2023 when Netanyahu attempted to sack the then defence minister, Yoav Gallant, over his opposition to a planned judicial overhaul.Opinion polls suggest Netanyahu would lose an election if one were held now, but he is likely to defy the protests, which are smaller than those two years ago, and ignore calls for new polls. A crucial budget vote before the end of the month now looks likely to go in the government’s favour.The return of Itamar Ben-Gvir, an extreme rightwing politician, to the government after he walked out over the ceasefire deal signed in January has underlined the continuing and vital support for Netanyahu from the nationalist-religious camp in Israel.Analysts said previously fragmented opposition groups had been brought together in recent days, though there are still no political leaders who look likely to threaten Netanyahu.“It’s a very strong homogeneous [governing] coalition. It has a solid base and it is hard to see it falling apart. There is still no alternative or vision to Netanyahu being put forward,” said Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israeli society and politics at the International Crisis Group.Though protesters say they back a ceasefire now to ensure the return of the hostages, most reflect broader Israeli public opinion and believe the war in Gaza is necessary to eliminate any threat from Hamas.Zonszein said the demonstrations could not be described as “anti-war”.“It is not about what is happening in Gaza at all. It is not about civilian casualties there … It is focused on the hostages and the lack of trust in the government.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuProtestThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

It also comes as Musk is getting closer to launching his other key ventures, Starlink and Tesla, in India.In the new court filing, dated 5 March, X argues that India’s IT ministry is asking other departments to use a government website launched by the home affairs ministry last year to issue content-blocking orders and mandate social media companies to join the website too. This mechanism, X says, does not contain the stringent Indian legal safeguards on content removal that required such orders to be issued in cases such as harm to sovereignty or public order, and came with strict oversight of top officials.Value of Elon Musk’s X ‘rebounds to $44bn purchase price’Read moreIndia’s IT ministry redirected a request for comment to the home affairs ministry, which did not respond.The government website creates “an impermissible parallel mechanism” that causes “unrestrained censorship of information in India“,Xsaid, adding it is seeking to quash the directive.X’s court papers are not public and were reported for the first time by media on Thursday. The case was briefly heard earlier this week by a judge in the high court of southern Karnataka state but no final decision was reached. It will now be heard on 27 March.In 2021, X, formerly called Twitter, was locked in a standoff with the Indian government over noncompliance of legal orders to block certain tweets related to a farmers’ protest against government policies.

They had been in jail and on house arrest for more than two years.Prosecutors in Romania suspended a travel ban, and a court lifted a precautionary seizure on some of their assets, following reports that US special envoy Richard Grenell, aDonald Trumpacolyte, raised their case with Romania’s foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, at the Munich Security Conference earlier in the month.The brothers areunder criminal investigation in Florida, where the state attorney general, James Uthmeier, announced a collaboration “with our law enforcement and partners around the world to fight human trafficking and sexual abuse”.They are also wanted in the UK, where authorities filed an extradition request over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to 2012, but were told that would not happen until the conclusion of the legal case in Romania.Under the terms of their release, Andrew, 38, and Tristan, 36, must return to Bucharest before the end of the month.The White House has denied knowledge of the circumstances of the arrival in the US of the Tates, who are dual American and UK citizens. But Andrew Tate was complimentary when reporters in Florida asked earlier this month if the president was involved.“Trump is such a boss, he is such a gangster,”he said.On Thursday, Valderrama criticized Trump’s presumed hand in proceedings.“The Trump administration wants to portray itself as a protector of women. But their work to bring Andrew Tate back to the streets of the US reveals the administration’s true values and priorities,” she said. “Trump does not care about protecting women.”UltraViolet, which helped expose convicted the sexual predatorsHarvey Weinstein,R KellyandBill O’Reilly, alsolaunched a websitelinking to a petition urging US attorney general Pam Bondi, a close ally of Trump, to extradite the Tates to the UK. The group said the petition, which was launched earlier this month, already had more than 10,000 signatures.The Tate brothers have consistently denied all the charges and allegations against them, and Andrew Tate has made Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who said their brand of toxic masculinity was not welcome in his state, a target of vitriol to his 10.9 million followers on X.Their attorney, Joseph McBride, told the Guardian in a statement this month: “The Florida ‘criminal investigation’ is a weak attempt by a lame-duck governor to hold on to power and an unknown attorney general aiming to build his reputation.“The Tate brothers are law-abiding citizens who will fully comply with the conditions of their release in Romania.The Florida state attorney’s office has not responded to an inquiry about the status of the investigation.A recent episode of Andrew Tate’s internet-based reality series Tate Confidential features the brothers frolicking, posturing and smoking cigars by the pool of a Miami mansion.Last week the streaming service Spotifyremoved an Andrew Tate podcastafter complaints from users, including an online petition signed by more than 92,000 people.The broadcast, titled pimping hoes, and part of Tate’s “degree course” on “how to get girls fast and easy”, was taken down for breaching the company’s policies.In one part of the removed podcast, Tate said the “reason the sexual marketplace is so fucked is because there’s too many women out there who get attention without giving sex”.This story was updated on 20 March 2025 to correct that the women’s justice group is attempting to have Andrew Tate extradited, not deported; Tate is a US citizen and cannot be deported.Explore more on these topicsFloridaAndrew TateDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

If anyone feels offended by things I may have done in my life, let them come and tell me.”She also suggested she may have been the victim of a deliberate smear campaign, adding that it was odd that someone had pored over tweets that went all the way back to 2016.“It’s clear that there was a campaign against me and that they kept going until they got what they were after,” she said.She said she had been the victim of hypocrisy, prejudice and a rush to judgment.“They’ve said that I’m far-right or racist or whatever,” she added, inremarks reported by El Mundo. “But if there’s one thing I’ve done all my life, it’s that I’ve been against all this. When I was young, I used to fight with skinheads … When someone comes up to me and I ask them: ‘But what is it about me that offends you?’, no one can come up with anything or tell me anything.”Gascón told the reporters that she was “less racist than Gandhi” – despite the fact, she said, that people had tried to portray her as deeply prejudiced during what she termed “a social media massacre”.The actor said that while she had “enormous respect for Muslim people”, she had none when it came to “fanaticism, terrorism and all the awful things that are done in the name of God or religion”.She also dismissed suggestions that her old tweets had led to her losing a contract with a Spanish publisher. “To tell the truth, there was no contract between me and that publisher,” she said. “They said what they said, but there was never anything.”Asked whether she regretted anything and whether she would do the same thing again, Gascón said: “Life always puts us into difficult places so that we can learn.

An officer separately told Agence France-Presse its forces were about 20 miles (30km) away in the town of Mubi.Walikale, in North Kivu province, is the farthest west that M23 has reached during itslightning advance that started in January.The town has large deposits of tin and many significant goldmines. Tin is widely used as a protective coating for other metals and in industries including food packaging and electronics.In taking control of Walikale, the rebels also seized a road linking four provinces in the east of the country, cutting off the army’s positions. It also puts them within 250 miles of Kisangani, the country’s fourth-largest city.mapGunfire rang out from near Nyabangi neighbourhood on Wednesday, according to Janvier Kabutwa, who lives in Walikale. An army source said the rebels were battling soldiers and pro-government militias after overrunning an army position outside the town in a surprise attack.“The information is confirmed. The rebels are visible at the monument and at the Bakusu group office,” said Prince Kihangi, a former provincial official for Walikale, referring to locations in the town centre.Heavy artillery fire was heard throughout Wednesday but stopped in the evening, giving way to sporadic gunfire, said Fiston Misona, a civil society activist in Walikale. “Our Congolese army is no longer fighting,” he said. “It’s as if we were being sacrificed.”M23 captured Goma, the largest city in North Kivu, in late January. It then started moving south towards Bukavu, the second-largest city in the region.More than 7,000 peoplehave been killedand hundreds of thousandsuprooted from their homessince January in the latest escalation in the conflict, which has lasted for decades and has its roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It is the worst escalation in more than a decade.M23, which is backed byRwanda, is one of dozens of armed groups fighting Congolese forces to make territorial gains in the DRC’s mineral-rich eastern provinces. It says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them from Hutu rebel groups that escaped to the DRC after taking part in the genocide. The DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the region’s mineral resources.The fall of Walikale came a day after DRC’s president, Félix Tshisekedi, and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, met in Qatar for their first direct talks since January and called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.The DRC and M23 had been expected to have their first direct talks on Tuesday in Angola after Tshisekedi’s government went back on its longstanding refusal to speak to the rebels, but M23 pulled out of the talks on Monday, citing EU sanctions against some of its leaders and Rwandan officials.AFP, Reuters andthe Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The US representatives would then meet the Russian negotiating team, Zelenskyy said on Thursday.The Ukrainian announcement indicates the US could shuttle between the two sides to try to achieve Donald Trump’s goal of a quick ceasefire. But both Russia and Ukraine have already disputed the White House’s accounts of their earlier talks with the US president, indicating Trump may have misrepresented the progress of the talks – and his chances of striking a quick deal to halt the war.Starmer warns Putin of ‘severe consequences’ if he breaches peace dealRead moreOn Thursday, Zelenskyy contradicted Trump by denying he had discussed a US plan to take over Ukrainian power plants as part of a peace deal, saying that they “belong to the people of Ukraine”.Trump had announced on Wednesday thatUS ownership of the plants“would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure”.Zelenskyy denied there had been any discussion with Trump about privatising the plants. “If the Americans want to take the station from the Russians and they want to invest there and modernise it, that is a completely different issue,” he said. “We are open to discuss it, but the issue of property we definitely did not discuss with President Trump.”Moscow announced on Thursday that Sergei Beseda, the former head of the spy agency’s fifth directorate – whooversaw intelligence operations in Ukraineand orchestrated the recruitment of collaborators before the full-scale invasion – would travel to Riyadh for Monday’s talks with the US.Both sides said the talks in Saudi Arabia were aimed at finalising a limited ceasefire deal agreed this week, and initiating negotiations on a maritime ceasefire.BeforeRussia’s early failures in the invasion, reports surfaced that Beseda had briefly fallen out of favour with Putin owing to flawed intelligence in the lead-up to the war. Beseda will be joined by Grigory Karasin, the chair of the Russian senate’s committee on international affairs, for the new round of talks with US officials.Zelenskyy has accused Russia of making “unnecessary demands” that will drag out the war, and said Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure had not stopped despitePutin’s claims about his readiness to halt them.1:24Zelenskyy says Putin's words are 'at odds with reality' after strikes on Ukraine – videoMoscow doubled down on Thursday on its insistence that a requirement for serious peace talks would be the complete cessation of both foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence to Kyiv.Trump, speaking on Fox News earlier, denied that arms supplies were discussed during his call with the Russian president, despite a Kremlin readout explicitly stating Putin had demanded an end to military aid to Ukraine.There is still uncertainty over the timing and terms of a limited US-brokered ceasefire agreed this week, with both countries exchanging aerial assaults overnight. Zelenskyy, who was in Oslo on Thursday, said Russia had launched nearly 200 Iranian Shahed drones overnight, wounding at least 10 people, including four children, and damaging “residential buildings, a church, and infrastructure”.Zelenskyy said in a morning statement on Telegram: “Russia’s strikes on Ukraine continue despite its propagandistic statements … With each launch, the Russians show the world their true attitude toward peace.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The airbase in the Russian city of Engels hosts the Tupolev Tu-160 nuclear-capable heavy strategic bombers that have frequently been involved in strikes against Ukrainian cities.Roman Busargin, the governor of Russia’s Saratov region, wrote on Telegram: “Engels today suffered the most massive UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] attack of all time.”Busargin said the attack had left an airfield on fire and that people living nearby had been evacuated. He did not specifically mention the airbase, but it is the main airfield in the area.Images shared by Russian Telegram channelsshowedthick smoke rising from an area west of the airfield, with reports suggesting an ammunition depot cruise missile exploded. Regional officials said 10 people were injured in the strike.Zelenskyy said on Wednesday he had signed up to a partial ceasefire that Trump had agreed with Putin a day earlier after what the Ukrainian leader had described as a “positive, very substantive and frank”call with the US president.But there was confusion over what exactly Trump and Putin had agreed after Moscow and Washington gave different readouts afterwards. Trump, in an initial post on Truth Social, said the partial ceasefire would apply to “energy and infrastructure”, giving the impression it would extend to all civilian infrastructure. Zelenskyy, after his call with Trump, spoke about “ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure”.However, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday the ceasefire would apply only to the energy sector, and a White House statement on Wednesday also referred only to energy.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUS foreign policyEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is expected to preserve investment spending in her spring statement next week whilecutting back day-to-day budgetsin response to higher debt servicing costs.According to the OECD’sGlobal Debt Report, defence spending of 2.2% among member states fell well below the soaring cost of debt interest, while spending on housing was 0.7% of national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), and 1.7% on the police and public order.OECD governments raised $15.7tn (£12.1tn) in fresh borrowing in 2024, which amounted to $3tn of extra debt once repayments were included. That took the total amount ofOECDgovernment debt to $55tn. The stock of global sovereign debt reached $65.2tn after a small rise in non-OECD government borrowing.Corporate debt rose to $35tn – ratcheting up the level of total global debt to exceed $100tn – with much of the extra borrowing used by companies to fund share buy-backs and dividend payments to shareholders.The top five issuers – the US, Japan, France, Italy and the UK – accounted for more than 85% of gross borrowing in OECD countries in 2024. The US alone represented more than two-thirds of the total.The OECD secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, said a combination of higher costs and higher debt risks was restricting the capacity for future borrowing at a time of significant investment needs, “including to boost growth and productivity, respond to population ageing and address defence needs”.He said the high cost of borrowing was an incentive for governments to target “productivity enhancing public investment that enhances long-term growth”.The Paris-based group said debt levels are expected to rise further in 2025, with the average debt-to-GDP ratio in OECD countries reaching 85%, more than 10 points higher than in 2019 and nearly double the 2007 level.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Numbers have remained stable in the north-west, home to a majority of Spain’s estimated 2,500 wolves, an area where they have enjoyed protection only since 2021.Isidre Gavín i Valls of the Catalan nationalist party Together for Catalonia, which supported the amendment, said the party was opposed to the killing of even one wolf, but said that until now “it’s the shepherds who lack protection”.Last December the EU reduced the protected status of wolves from “strictly protected” to “protected” in a policy championed by the EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, after a wolf killed her family’s pet pony.Explore more on these topicsSpainWildlifeAnimalsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The number of repetitions is the nature of the music. On my early pieces, such as It’s Gonna Rain or Piano Phase, everything moves so slowly. Some people will say: “To hell with it, I’m not listening to that,” but those who do experience a different kind of listening.Not only was David Bowie influenced by your workduring his Berlin era, but also your Clapping Music is sampled onthe hypnotic James Murphy remixof Bowie’s Love Is Lost (Hello Steve Reich Mix). What do you recall of your conversations with Bowie in 1978?McScootikinsWe played Music for 18 Musicians at the Bottom Line in New York, the first time we’d played it in a rock club. Afterwards, David Bowie came up and introduced himself and a photograph was taken, but really it was one of the very short post-concert conversations. It was the exchange of mutual admiration that really mattered. I was so delighted to see him there and he told me he’d heard us play the piece before, in Berlin. It was a nice coming together. The James Murphy remix is an odd combination that seems to work. Sometimes, you hear what people do with your music and think: “What have they done to me?” But that sounded really interesting. I wanted to hear it again.Listen to David Bowie’s Love Is Lost (Hello Steve Reich Mix).What was the last piece of “kit” you bought?LasagneIsCancelled“Kit” in terms of my drum kit would be a 20in Zildjian ride cymbal in 1952 or 1953, which was my pride and joy as a drummer who wanted to sound likeKenny Clarkeand bebop. Much later, when I had musical training at Cornell [University], Juilliard [conservatoire] and Mills College and was totally dedicated to performing whatever I wrote for my own ensemble, I was able to get four pairs of very high-quality bongo drums and then three marimbas, which wiped me out financially. Fortunately, my late artist friend Sol LeWitt bought some of my scores as a collection of art pieces, including the original score of Four Organs, and with that money I bought three glockenspiels, which were the finishing touches on Drumming [1971]. That was the last kit I bought! I’m 88 years old. I use composition software, but don’t keep up with gadgets.I am an art handler at the Royal Academy. I heard a story that, when you started out, you andPhilip Glassmoved art around. Is that true?RobinreadbestYes and no. We moved things around, but it wasn’t art, it was big, smelly mattresses and couches up and down stairs in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. We were both short of money and Phil had a panel truck, so he said: “We’re going to form a moving company.” I think it was called Chelsea Light Moving. For a couple of weeks, we got all these downtown orders from people who had these walk-up apartments with heavy furniture. It was backbreaking, hernia-inducing work. So we looked at each other and said: “Enough is enough.”How did it feel to play withPhilip Glassagain in 2014 after such a very long time?Was it significant that the first work you performed that evening was Four Organs?TrumansdadPhil and I had been at Juilliard together, but much later [in 1967] he came to my concert at the Park Place art gallery in New York and said: “I really like what you’re doing. Would you like to come over and see what I’m doing?” The following year, he wrote Two Pages forSteve Reich, basically taking a set of patterns, repeating them and making them longer, which was the breakthrough for him in the way phasing was for me. After that, we travelled and toured together, shared an ensemble – and then at some point it got a little close for comfort and suddenly my best friend became somebody I didn’t talk to.That persisted from the early 1970s until 2014, when Nonesuch Records’ Bob Hurwitz wanted to do something where we shared the evening. He took us out for dinner and I said [to Glass]: “Hi. How are you?” The deal was I’d play a piece of Phil’s and he’d play one of mine. He played Four Organs, which we’d both played on in 1970, and I played Music in 12 Parts, one of the early pieces I’d played in his ensemble. The whole thing went very well and we … we don’t hang out, but it broke the ice and just made things a lot more humane.View image in fullscreenReich’s Four Organs performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2014 as part of the 50th anniversary of the Nonesuch label (from left: Philip Glass, Nico Muhly, David Cossin, Timo Andres and Reich).Photograph: © Stephanie BergerDo you remember theGrateful Dead’s Phil Lesh?Steady-dietI met him in a class at Mills College with the Italian composerLuciano Berio. We hit it off and started to hang out. At that time, Phil Lesh was writing these orchestral pieces à la Stockhausen or Berio – he didn’t play the bass, but did play trumpet. We did a “happening” in San Francisco sometime around 1962 or 1963 and worked together on the electronics. He was driving a cab and I was working at the post office, so we pooled our incomes to buy a really good tape recorder. We spent a lot of time together, then one day he went to see his old friend Jerry Garcia and, the next thing I knew, he was the bass player with the Grateful Dead. We stayed in touch a little bit. He was a good man, a really great musician and a positive force.Do contemporary classical composers, in particularpioneersminimalism, listen to disco? Or even punk rock?Dmitry_SPhil Lesh and I both listened to the Beatles and over the years I’ve grown to have an enormous admiration for Paul McCartney. Punk and disco didn’t really grab me, but the next thing that really did wasRadiohead, from a whole other generation. I had a concert in Kraków and the other big attraction there at the time was Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, who unbeknownst to me had done his own version of my Electric Counterpoint, which is for electric guitar. I thought his version was great – a rockier counterpart to Pat Metheny’s jazzier version – and we really hit it off. Then, discovering Radiohead’s music impressed me so much. I was inspired to write Radio Rewrite, based on two Radiohead songs, which I’d never have written if I’d not gone through that whole experience with Jonny.My favourite piece of music for the past 30 years has beenMusic for 18 Musicians. Do you feellongformpieces of music like this are disappearing due to the modern way of consuming musicas individual, shorter “tracks”?BogmanfanSome pieces should be short. Clapping Music is four or five minutes – any longer and it’s boring, any shorter and it’s too short! On the other hand, as a composer, the music tells me Music for 18 Musicians should be about 55 minutes. I understand that people don’t necessarily have 55 minutes and that Apple Music and Spotify prefer us to listen to shorter tracks, rather than dice up something larger. I don’t run the world, but if there’s another planet that we should go to, let me know.View image in fullscreenReich in New York City in 2005.Photograph: Jeffrey HermanCan art play any meaningful role in countering the recent direction of US politics?ArmholeWe all wish it could, but it can’t. I have a favourite example. One of Picasso’s greatest works, Guernica, was made shortly after the bombing of the town of Guernica in Spain by Franco, the fascist dictator and friend of Hitler’s. Picasso read about it and created this antiwar masterpiece from the images in his head. Afterwards, we had the bombing of Dresden, Nagasaki, Hiroshima and then 9/11. So if that scale of greatness can have no effect whatsoever, we need to realise the limitations of art and music.Your works, such asTehillim, reflect a deep engagement with your Jewish heritage and history. Do you see your music as a form of spiritual or religious expression?NicolasRosYes, but there’s a long history of music being attached to religious expression. I’d never have written Four Organs if I hadn’t been thinking about the 12th-century Notre Dame cathedral composer Pérotin’s use of decorative melodies around a drone. With Tehillim [Hebrew for “psalms”], I was using my own background and writing within the western tuning system. I started by singing psalms, which got me into extreme, constantly changing meters – undoubtedly influenced by Bartók and Stravinsky – and then out popped a whole different way of rhythmically organising music. It was a pivotal piece for me and I think the hallelujah at the end is one of the best things that I’ve written.Jonny Greenwood: ‘I’m still arsing around on instruments like when I was a kid’Read moreYou’ve incorporated genres fromwestern music towest African drumming,gamelanand jazz. Is there a common aspect that keeps the musical discourse together?makeitadoubleVery simply, in some ways, they all have a harmonic centre. When I was a student in the 1950s, Stockhausen, Boulez and John Cage all had no harmonic centre and no regular beat. I could recognise the excellence, but always felt uncomfortable. Eventually I said: “I can’t do this.” When I studied with Berio and was writing 12-tone music, instead I took the 12 different notes of the piano and grouped them in groups of three, to sort of be in harmony. Being a great guy and very flexible, he said: “If you want to write tonal music, then why don’t you?” He opened the door to what I was intuitively trying to do.Steve Reich’s 27-disc box setCollected Works is out now on NonesuchExplore more on these topicsSteve ReichThe reader interviewClassical musicExperimental musicRadioheadGrateful DeadDavid BowiePhilip GlassfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Vance, whose real name is Adam Stone, accused Carey of exploiting his “popularity” and “style”.On Wednesday, Judge Mónica Ramírez Almadani rejected the allegations, citing evidence from a musicologist that the songs only shared “commonplace Christmas song cliches” that are found in many other jingles. Carey’s attorneys previously argued that the language in Vance’s song had been been used in “legions of Christmas songs”, according to reporting fromBillboard.In one report, a New York University professor, Lawrence Ferrara, testified that he had found “at least 19 songs” that incorporated the same lyrical ideas that had been released before Vance’s track.The judge reported that the plaintiffs “have not met their burden of showing that [the songs of] Carey and Vance are substantially similar under the extrinsic test”. The judge also called Vance and his lawyers’ conduct “egregious” and said they caused “unnecessary delay” and “needlessly” increased the costs of litigation, including through “incomprehensible mixtures of factual assertions and conclusions, subjective opinions, and other irrelevant evidence”.Almadani additionally ordered them to repay Carey’s legal bills incurred while defending the case.Vance first sued Carey in 2022 with allegations of copyright infringement. He claimed that his original track received “extensive airplay” during the 1993 holiday season – a year before Carey released her now huge hit.He claimed that Carey “palmed off these works with her incredulous origin story, as if those works were her own”, in his latest complaint.“Her hubris knowing no bounds, even her co-credited songwriter doesn’t believe the story she has spun,” Vance wrote.Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You is considered a modern Christmas classic, retaking the No 1 spot on the BillboardHot 100music chart for six straight years.

He’s talking about the UK drill scene, a subject he explores in hislatest exhibition. In an image used to publicise the show, we see the faces of 42 rappers, all of them in prison.“In autumn last year, there was literally no one,” he says. “The scene was actually dead, everyone was locked up.”RIP Germain’s brutal, uncomfortable, confrontational installation explores UK drill music’s lyrical violence – and society’s voracious appetite for it. It asks how an entire musical movement could end up being lost to the UK prison system.The first work is a storm drain cut into the gallery floor, its grates the same size as the peepholes in UK prison doors. Peer down into the dark basement and a police van is flashing its lights. Downstairs, the room has been cleaned with forensics-grade bleach, the air cooled to the temperature of a morgue. That police van is actually a coffin for you to climb into to watch 101 hours of UK drill music videos, documentaries and social media posts. It’s suffocatingly claustrophobic and relentless in its glorification of guns and death. But the real shock is in realising how normalised, how mainstream, how celebrated this level of violence is.View image in fullscreenLifting the lid: he police van is actually a coffin.Photograph: Mark Blower/Mark Blower, courtesy RIP Germain and Cabinet.“People nowadays are starved of culture, so anything that seems like the real deal they gravitate towards,” says the artist, who keeps his real name secret. “Any form of subculture that people belong to in a genuine way, people want the keys to access that.” In the case of UK drill, its authenticity is integral to its success, and crime and violence – in the form of murder, assault and drug running – is key to that authenticity. “That’s a quick route to stardom,” RIP Germain says. “Take someone like [Camden rapper] Suspect, the way he blew up is that when he was releasing tracks and getting hundreds of thousands of views he was already on the run for murder and living in Kenya. The reputation is what attracts people to the music, and that’s what determines success.”Fans consume UK drill’s everyday gang violence in the same way that people consume true crime podcasts: they’re paying to satisfy a thirst for real death, as opposed to the fantasy of violence and gore provided by something like the horror genre. But that reality is also its downfall. The police monitor and delete UK drill videos from YouTube and social media, and at the same time the videos and lyrics can be used as evidence against the artists in court, all while the artists are expected to be authentic and to brag about these acts of violence.“It’s a trap,” RIP Germain says. “That’s where the audience comes into play. The vast majority of fans are not like the people making the music, and they are using them as avatars and living vicariously through them. For any medium to thrive, it’s going to be white suburban kids that are the biggest pool of buyers. That’s always the plight of Black entertainers.”Given that these rappers are objectively doing well – making money, signing to major labels – why is the lure of crime still so appealing to them?“If you’ve grown up a certain way it’s very hard to jump out of your own brain and reformat yourself,” says the artist. “Society is placing an outrageous level of expectation on these people, and there has been no space and complexity given to their lifestyles. This is an industry where a lot of people come from group homes, child services, alternative schooling, young offenders. It’s not a scene where the average person comes from a straightforward middle-class background.”Drill isn’t unique in its glorification of violent lifestyles: its antecedents in gangster rap and grime did plenty of that. As RIP Germain says: “There was extreme violence way before drill, and there will be after drill.” What’s notable about drill, however, is the way its commitment to violence has led to its own annihilation.View image in fullscreenVisitors face up to ‘the death that’s being sold and celebrated’Photograph: Mark Blower/Mark Blower, courtesy RIP Germain and Cabinet.The work isn’t an attack on UK drill culture, far from it. RIP Germain is deeply passionate and hugely knowledgable about the scene. Part-historian, part-archivist, he obsessively collects and saves videos that he knows are likely to be deleted by the police.Hip-hop culture has played an important part in much of RIP Germain’s work. The artist’s last major installation,Jesus Died for Us, We Will Die for Dudus!at the ICA in 2023, centred on a genuine, blinged-out, Hatton Garden-made thick gold necklace of a white Tupac wearing a crown of thorns, encrusted with diamonds, rubies and sapphires. Hip-hop, and more specifically gangster rap, functions for him as a way of attacking dominant power structures and questioning the way society consumes Black culture.He says he’s using UK drill to make a wider point: “Western culture is in love with violence. It’s a societal violence, it’s across the board. UK drill is the topic I’m using to explore how society functions, and how some people find that the only avenue they have to make it in life is to sell death, to sell their own imprisonment. That’s the currency exchange: ‘I’m exchanging the culture that you want for monetary gain. There’s consequences, but for now I’m going to look the other way to make it out of this neighbourhood.’ These people become products.”The show acts as a plea for clemency, for nuance, for forgiveness and understanding. “It’s not to absolve anyone of responsibility, it’s to look at the picture and see a group of kids that have been let down, and they’ve let themselves down, in a big way. And the work I’ve done over the past six years is flying a red flag saying we need to get ahead of this.”The brilliance of RIP Germain’s installation is in first making you an outside observer, peering through the prison door peephole from an objective distance, and then forcing you into that coffin, making you get properly face-to-face with the death that’s being sold and celebrated. He’s showing you that this isn’t just entertainment, these are lives being lost. What’s truly horrifying isn’t the violence itself, it’s the pleasure we take from consuming it.RIP Germain: Anti-Blackness Is Bad, Even the Parts That We Like is atCabinet, London, until 10 MayExplore more on these topicsArtInstallationRaceBlack British cultureDrillRapCrimeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

These ideas were expressed through titles and a kind of dramaturgy that she called “instrumental symbolism”. Switching from one instrument to another, or between different parts of the same instrument, she suggested extra-musical and even theological ideas, rather like an acoustic equivalent of the geometrical distortions and symbolism familiar from the icons of the Eastern Orthodox church that she loved so much.With works such asIntroitus(1978) for piano and chamber orchestra andIn Croce(1979) for cello and organ,she acquired a reputation in the world of non-official Soviet culture, inspiring for enthusiasts but irritating to the old guard of the Composers’ Union. She refused to be intimidated.The violinist Gidon Kremer took the concertoOffertorium(1980) to orchestras abroad, and Gubaidulina’s music began to feature in concerts and festivals around the globe. Commissions followed, such asAlleluia(1990), for the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and and vocal forces conducted by Simon Rattle;theViola Concerto(1996), for Yuri Bashmet and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; and the violin concertoIn Tempus Praesens(2007), for Anne-Sophie Mutter.View image in fullscreenIn 1992, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Gubaidulina moved to Appen, a village outside Hamburg, in Germany, seeking the peace and quiet that seemed to have gone from Moscow. There she spent the last three decades of her life, composing in every medium that fascinated her, from vast oratorios to the tiniest pieces for solo double bass or unaccompanied voice. As she grew older, her deep and emotional mysticism, rooted in her passionately held religious convictions, became ever more concentrated and fiercely eschatological – concerned with the end of history and the world – in tone.However, in every piece she always seemed to begin anew. She delighted in treating every new day of her life as an opportunity to search for something fresh and undiscovered and she was never afraid to take artistic risks, as withIn the Shadow of the Tree(1998) for Japanese solo instruments and orchestra, andThe Wrath of God(2019), for orchestra.Gubaidulina’s music reflects and embodies her unquenchable lifelong devotion to artistic freedom: not merely the freedom of composers to write what they write, but the freedom of performers to play what they play (“in joy”, as she used to put it, with a childlike smile), and the freedom of every listener to hear what they hear, and not what someone else has told them to hear.Born in Chistopol in the Tatar Republic of the USSR, midway between Moscow and Kazakhstan, Sofia was the youngest of three sisters. She grew up in the Tatar capital of Kazan, on the river Volga. Her mother, Fedosia (nee Elkhova), was a schoolteacher of mixed Russian-Polish heritage, and her father, Asgad Gubaidulin, a land surveyor, from a Tatar family. Both were strong supporters of the communist order and Soviet values.Sofia was especially devoted to her father, though he could accept neither her choice of career nor her religious beliefs. She recalled him talking quietly in the Tatar language with his friends (she never learned it, as the family spoke Russian), and of accompanying him into the countryside on his work where his long silences, she said, “taught me how to listen”.Gubaidulina’s elder sisters were musical and there was a small grand piano at home. When her own lessons began, she made swift progress. Disliking “the impoverished little pieces” she was given to study, she quickly taught herself to improvise, a skill that remained of lifelong importance; relief came when her teacher introduced her to Bach, Mozart and Beethoven.The household was atheist, but while still small, she saw an icon in someone’s home – “and I recognised God”. She was proud that her paternal grandfather, Masgud Gubaidulin, had been a mullah and she kept on her desk a photograph of him in his turban, though she had no memories of meeting him.I write film music for six months, take a month off to recover my health and then write my own music for the rest of the yearAfter five years of undergraduate study at the Kazan Conservatory, in 1954 she moved to the postgraduate course at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow, where her teachers included Nikolai Peiko and Vissarion Shebalin, both unusual composers.On one occasion, when one of her examiners publicly criticised her “mistaken path”, another,Dmitri Shostakovich, quietly told her to “continue on your mistaken path”. She was admitted to the Union of Soviet Composers in 1961 and finished graduate studies two years later.At the tail end of the Khrushchev thaw, Moscow was a cauldron of new artistic ideas. With her contemporaries, who included the composers Alfred Schnittke, Arvo Pärt, from Estonia, and Valentin Silvestrov, from Ukraine, she was fascinated by everything she could lay her hands on from the musical and intellectual world beyond: “In the west, information and recordings and scores were easy to come by, so you could take it for granted you would always find it later. But for us every scrap of information was precious, so we threw ourselves on it hungrily.”Most inspiring for her were her encounters with European religious music of various kinds, and her first impressions of 20th-century modernism, whether in the form of Webern, Berg and Stravinsky, or the later “avant-garde” generation of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono and Iannis Xenakis. Through a friend she also discovered the instruments and sounds of various indigenous cultures, especially those of the far east of the USSR. Even from early on there were hints of what was to come: a certain purity of sound and a fondness for ecstatic incantation.The Soviet Union supported a huge cinema industry, which provided employment for composers. Gubaidulina’s output of movie music was prolific. She worked at enormous speed, noting: “I write film music for six months, take a month off to recover my health and then write my own music for the rest of the year.” Though she scored many kinds of films, ranging from the teen dramaChuchelo(Scarecrow, 1984) toThe Cat That Walked By Herself(1988), she was especially proud of her music for children’s cartoons.Film music was not subject to the same political controls as concert music and popular music, and proved a good place to experiment and learn discipline.Of her encourager Shostakovich she observed: “He could make the deepest darkness shine with the brightest light!” The same could be said of the music with which she found her distinctive voice. I first met her after arriving as a graduate student in Moscow in 1984, at a concert of electronic music where herVivente – Non Vivente(Alive and Dead, 1970) was played. She was immediately open and warm.In 1956 she married Mark Liando, a geologist and poet, and they had a daughter, Nadezhda. The marriage ended in divorce, as did her second, to the mystic and dissident Nikolai, later Nicolas, Bokov. In the 90s she married the pianist and theorist Pyotr Meshchaninov. He died in 2006; Nadezhda had died two years earlier. Gubaidulina is survived by two grandchildren.Sofia Asgatovna Gubaidulina, composer, born 24 October 1931; died 13 March 2025Explore more on these topicsClassical musicRussiaDmitri ShostakovichobituariesShareReuse this content"

I’m grateful for all theBFIhas done to support UK film-making and this incredible art form we share.”Cruise spends much of his time in England, with considerable portions of many of his projects based here. The Mission: Impossible films were filmed on location in London, Birmingham and Yorkshire; other UK-based credits include Legend, Interview With a Vampire, Edge of Tomorrow and Eyes Wide Shut.The BFI chair, Jay Hunt, said: “Tom has brought so much to the UK as a producer … choosing to make many of his films on our shores, where he is welcomed by our crews who step up to help make his cinematic visions a reality.”She continued: “In doing so, he also supports our studios and puts our locations on a world stage, in the process creating jobs and inspiring the next generation of film talent. He is, of course, also simply one of the world’s great actors and a true movie star, delighting audiences as the action hero and romantic lead and then surprising us with brave, left-field roles where his versatility and talent shine through.”An “in conversation” event with Cruise will take place on 11 May, the day before he receives the fellowship, to kick off a month-long season of his films.Former BFI fellows include David Lean, Bette Davis, Akira Kurosawa, Ousmane Sembène, Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, Orson Welles, Thelma Schoonmaker, Derek Jarman, Martin Scorsese, Satyajit Ray, Yasujirō Ozu and, most recently, Tilda Swinton, Barbara Broccoli, Michael G Wilson, Spike Lee and Christopher Nolan.In 2022, Cruise received an honorary Palme d’Or at the Cannes festival in France; he has also won three Golden Globes and been nominated for four Oscars. In December 2024, he was awarded the US navy’s highest civilian honour, the distinguished public service award, in recognition of his “outstanding contributions” to the military via his film roles – presumably Top Gun and its sequel, rather than, say, Cocktail.One of the highest-grossing film stars of all time and one of the best remunerated, he is also a well-known advocate for the Church of Scientology, and is believed to have a home near its UK headquarters in East Grinstead, West Sussex.Explore more on these topicsTom CruiseBFInewsShareReuse this content"

Here is what it is like to navigate the big opportunities – and impossible demandsInès CélineThu 20 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 06.26 EDTShare‘She was sitting at the kitchen table, eating raw cauliflower. For dinner.” It’s September 2024 in London and my friend is reflecting on her time sharing an apartment with fellow models in Paris the previous year. I am grimly amused, but unsurprised. This is the type of story models are always telling.I would know, because I became a model at 21 – quite late, by industry standards – and have walked in several London shows, as well as fittings, showrooms, campaigns, editorials, lookbooks and e-commerce for brands such as Moncler, Lacoste and Toni & Guy. Since I started, I have tried to build a thick skin to protect myself against rejections from castings and call-backs, as well as the ubiquitous skinny body standard. But when I get selected for a show, there is always the underlying fear that perhaps I took it too far – that I lost too much weight again. Because an overwhelming proportion of models are, as they have always been, very thin.I was scouted on a walk through Covent Garden in 2021, just after I had graduated from the University of Warwick. I made my debut at the subsequent London fashion week, at the Victoria Beckham show.In the fashion industry, the extremely skinny look is still valued – you just can’t make it obviousThe expression “baptism of fire” doesn’t begin to cover it. I had done only a quick walking practice at my agency beforehand, not expecting anything to come from my first casting. Within a couple of hours, I was booked on the spot for three days of fittings in a room packed with stylists, creative directors, sewers and photographers, all running on the frenetic energy of fashion week. In the run-up to the show, I was working 13-hour days.My agency steered me towards a high-fashion market, so I moved to Milan for a month, and then back to my home town of Paris, to pursue my career more seriously.Over the past couple of years in the fashion industry, my weight has fluctuated a lot, but I have always remained, by non-fashion standards, slim. Even at my biggest, I was smaller than a UK size 8. High fashion loved me the most at my skinniest, when I was visibly very bony (it was obvious that I had a problematic BMI). During my debut season, I overheard a famous stylist talking about me (it is normal to be spoken about while you are in the room). “She’s too skinny to be used in the show, but she’s perfect for the fittings,” she said, voicing what I came to understand was the underlying mantra of the industry: the extremely skinny look is still valued – you just can’t make it obvious.View image in fullscreenInès Céline backstage at Edeline Lee, at the Dorchester Hotel, London, February 2025.Photograph: Courtesy of Inès CélineWhen I reached what was deemed a healthy size, it was my hips that became my achilles heel – and I am far from curvy. During a couture week fitting, I wasn’t able to fit the wedding gown – the prestigious highlight of the collection – over my hips. The gown was quickly taken away and handed to a 17-year-old model, whose narrow build didn’t fight the fabric. The irony? Couture is designed – and destined – for women with very big bank balances, not girls.For models, conversation about weight and dieting is common. It’s a nonchalant, casual, day-to-day topic that comes up as easily as the weather. It’s not about sharing dieting tips, but rather anecdotes about a nasty casting, or a comment about skipping dessert because fashion week is not far off. One model recounted that she had cut out all sugar, carbs and junk food and had been intensively exercising for three months leading up to the shows. Other models asked me what my measurements were, followed by an encouraging: “That should be fine, don’t worry.” When I started modelling, I was struck by the candour of it, the shared reality of living with the pressure to be a certain size. I knew I had shared the same thoughts and concerns – and hadn’t missed a day at the gym all week.I think it’s fair to say that models don’t intentionally promote or perpetuate the desire for a certain physique; instead, they comply with the “industry standard”, knowing that it’s a component of success, or at least of securing work. That industry standard varies, but tends to be around 34-24-34in (bust-waist-hips), or equivalent to a dress size 6. The need to be a certain size to book jobs can tip models’ behaviour into the unhealthy.In 2023, I was in Madrid working a job. After lunch – a 4pm matcha – a model friend said she was not hungry for dinner. In any other circumstances, her behaviour would have been cause for concern. But here, there was no sense that she might be judged for skipping a meal, certainly not by me – I too have a complicated relationship with food.Measurements remain a very real component of fashion week; up-to-date bikini pictures are still required by potential clients. It does vary a little by location. London displays more of a variety of models in casting queues – from size 2 to size 18. But the same cannot be said of Paris, and even less so Milan, where I was measured every time I went to my agency. I have spent hours in queues made up exclusively of ultra-thin models, to be measured at the door and asked to put on an unforgiving skintight bodysuit to ensure that nothing is concealed behind fabric. Every curve and dip of your body is exposed for evaluation.There is a new narrative, however, which has its roots in the late 2010s, when Ashley Graham was on the cover of Vogue and catwalks showcased plus-sized bodies for the first time. In 2023, Paloma Elsesser won model of the year, highlighting the apparent acceptance and rise of plus-size models. The new narrative told us that strict ultra-skinny measurements, negative body image discourse and a lack of inclusivity were no longer a problem in fashion. It sounds like progress, but it is simply not true. It says it all that Elsesser, who was the only curvier model in the lineup of nominees, faced an immediate backlash about her weight on social media.View image in fullscreenBacklash … Paloma Elsesser on the runway for Ferragamo in Milan, September 2024.Photograph: Jacopo Raule/Getty ImagesFrom my experience, the public celebration of body inclusivity feels performative. No matter how many shows use plus-size models, or how often magazines use larger models, the skinny body ideal remains ever-present. The wording might be more delicate – it’s no longer about “size 0” – and a few token moments have made it seem like things are shifting, but the skinny orthodoxy is still dominant, perhaps increasingly so.The fashion-industry media observed a tangible decrease in body diversity at recent shows.Vogue Business notedthat plus-size representation made up just 0.3% of the looks in autumn/winter 2025 shows, with 97.7% of the models being “straight-size”, the industry term for the skinny norm – equivalent to a dress size 4 or XS in the UK. This matches what I observed in casting queues last season.The shift towards smaller silhouettes extended beyond catwalk models to the front row, coinciding with the rise of weight-loss drugs and signalling a broader cultural shift to thinness.Comment sections on TikTok videos now border on obsessive when it comes to celebrities’ weight loss; the Wicked press tour was overshadowed by remarks about the cast’s noticeably slim silhouettes. Such widespread outrage at what is clearly a deeply personal subject reveals the hypocrisy surrounding women’s bodies. Which women are required to embody “healthiness” and which are meant to have the high-fashion body that society glamorises? Both of the main stars of Wicked, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, look the same size as many models I have worked with. There is a high-fashion blind spot that allows extreme thinness to go unchallenged, while the rest of society – even within the confines of Hollywood – is held to different standards.View image in fullscreenEmily Ratajkowski, Ariana Grande, Charli xcx and Paloma Elsesser at the WSJ Innovator Awards, New York, October 2024.Photograph: Nina Westervelt/WWD/Getty ImagesA scroll through TikTok reveals an array of negative experiences from models that do conform to this type, with Bentley Mescall, for example,exposing the landscape in New York. Sheposts screenshots of messages from her agent: “Bread has to go, rice has to go, pasta has to go – this has to be a choice that you make.” Her experience is not an exception. It’s still the deeply entrenched reality of the modelling world, whatever the so-called plus-size revolution has told us.On a month-long working trip to Greece last summer, my flatmate and fellow model was told by our agent that she would get more bookings if she lost a couple of centimetres off her hips. In Milan last year, a friend was shamed in a room full of agents for having gained slightly in size over the summer holidays. Another was sent home after a visit to her Milan-based agency during which she had her belly grabbed and shaken. A similar experience occurred in Japan, where the model was booked a ticket home on the spot. Each incident happened within the last two years and, for what it’s worth, all of these women are around a size 6.No matter how many shows use plus-size models, the skinny ideal remains ever-presentTo reiterate, the problem lies with the industry, not the models. Most models are professional, kind and compassionate individuals. Most of us are naturally slim and don’t follow a raw cauliflower diet.“Agencies have a duty of care,” says Tom Quinn, the director of external affairs at the eating disorder charity Beat, who urges them “to stop encouraging models to adopt harmful behaviours and pressuring them to fit a certain body ideal”. A person’s appearance should never be prioritised over their mental and physical wellbeing, he says.Luckily for me, the London-based agency that I have been with since I started out has shown concern for my welfare, even encouraging me to gain weight when I was excessively thin. But they are in a tricky position: they have to ensure models’ health isn’t compromised, but they must also please clients and book their talent. The reality is that fashion brands, particularly high-fashion ones, demand this body type.Fashion experts raise concern about return to ‘extremely thin models’Read moreSomewhere, amid the extreme demands and performative inclinations of the industry, there may be a middle ground where agencies do not have to protect models from toxic requirements, or coerce them into complying. Some brands have shown a genuine desire to hire healthy-looking models. The Vogue Business report pointed to Ester Manas, Rick Owens, Sunnei, Boss and Bach Mai as some of the fashion houses promoting a more comprehensive lineup this past season.I also remember how delighted the editor of a French magazine was when she saw me with a “fuller shape” (size 8) after I had worked with them previously. She told me that she didn’t like working with super-skinny models, that it didn’t feel right. You do meet people within the industry who empathise with the strict requirements we have to adhere to and perpetuate; it’s just a question of normalising this concern at a wider industry level.I look back to the modelling era of the 1990s with envy. Growing up, I remember being captivated by Cindy Crawford, who has saidsize 10 was normalfor models at the time. It would be noteworthy to find a single size 10 model in most casting queues in the past decade.Despite all of this, I do and will continue to work in high fashion. The profession, despite its challenges, has offered me amazing experiences and friendships. My trajectory has fostered connections and cultivated resilience. But the industry has a long way to go. Adding a few curvy models to catwalks isn’t nearly enough. I long for a day when my hips, and those of many different-sized women, fit into couture dresses – for the sake of the models, but also young women everywhere.In the UK,Beatcan be contacted on 0808-801-0677.

He also knows his way around a courtroom – last November, the UFC fighter wasfound liable for rape in a civil casein Ireland. And now he knows his way around the White House too – the US seat of power that is all toowelcoming for sexual predators. Visiting the American capital this week, McGregor met Donald Trump in the White House on Saint Patrick’s Day, wearing an outfit that had the markings of a man after the president’s own heart: a three-piece pinstripe suit.Trump loves a suit, so you can also easily imagine that the New York tycoon in him loves a Gordon Gekko-esque pinstripe. McGregor’s meeting was stronglycondemned by Ireland’s taoiseach, while an Irish rape crisis charitydescribed it as “sinister”. But, with his sartorial choices, McGregor showed himself to be the latest Trump loyalist with a penchant for a strong-lined suit.Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s secretary of health and human services, has worn the delineated style to testify before the Senate, as well as in cabinet meetings. Stephen Miller, the ideological anti-immigration firebrand who is one of the architects of Trump’s callous “zero tolerance” family separation policies, is a fan. On this side of the Atlantic, Nigel Farage is also partial.View image in fullscreenRobert F Kennedy Jr in pinstripes at his Senate confirmation hearing in January.Photograph: Michael Brochstein/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockNot to be glib about the hate-filled politics of the Trumpian right, but, whether consciously or not, these outfit choices trace a through-line between the kind of politics these figures espouse and the kind of message a pinstripe signals – elitism, wealth, power and privilege.But the fact that the manosphere and its adjacents are wearing the look hasn’t stopped the largely progressive fashion world from getting in on the trend of late. At the most recent shows, a subtle line was sketched up and down suits and overcoats at Calvin Klein in an ode to CK 90s chic. At the Coach show, watched over by Kamala Harris’s stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, pinstripe was styled in the kind of high-low petri dish way younger generations tend to throw outfits together –over boxer short-style shorts with T-shirtsgrunged with scribbled messages. It was there at the debut show of Haider Ackermann for Tom Ford, slinking out from underneath belted, croc-collared overcoats. As well as a glut of others: Armani, Khaite, Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, Moschino, Ralph Lauren and Stella McCartney. In Berlin, theinclusive brand Richert Beiloften uses pinstripe in its gender-questioning designs.In the world of pop culture, pinstripe charts its own course.“Hot,” Charli xcx captionedon a picture of herself wearing a pinstripe Vivienne Westwood bustier earlier this year – a homage, surely, toCarrie Bradshawwhen she got drunk at Vogue. A$AP Rocky would have looked like an extra from Bugsy Malone had he not had Rihanna on his arm, as heappeared outside an LA courtafter he was acquitted of two felony counts of assault last month.While Trump’s supporters seem to favour bolder, brasher lines, even the most subtle pinstripe is instantly communicative of entitlement and excess – it feels ramped up in an 80s-coded Wall Street way. Perhaps that is what makes it so tempting to toy with. Worn by Charli xcx, its businesslike attitude makes the boardroom seem brat. It is corpcore rather than corporate, a kind of cosplay of the office rather than anything to do with actual spreadsheets and quarterly reviews.The lines are loaded, and McGregor knows it, having used pinstripe in the past to transmit a very direct message to his opponent Floyd Mayweather Jr:written into the stripes of a suit he wore pre-fightwere the words “Fuck You”. And Jeremy Corbyn also knows a thing or two aboutpacking a punchy message in a pinstripe. On the campaign trail in Whitby in 2019, he touted a bespoke suit with his motto, “For the many, not the few” stitched into the Labour-red pinstripes. Pinstripe is clearly a stripe for all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I moved for better weather, proximity to nature and a calmer, healthier way of living but I’ve really struggled to make any friends. This isn’t the first time I lived abroad. I moved around in my 20s and they were some of the happiest times in my life.Now, at 34, the experience feels different. I’m living alone and working remotely. This is something I wanted to do for a long time but it’s a lot harder than I expected. I miss my family, friends and partner, although we speak all the time and travel back and forth to see each other. I know it takes time to build a new life. I miss the familiarity and my network back home. Was moving the right decision?Eleanor says:It’s so poignant to get what you thought you wanted only to have it sour. It can feel worse than just not getting what you wanted – like getting all dressed up for your own birthday only to sit in silence at the table.Of course you knew this would be a tough transition. But that doesn’t make it any easier. I remember a first morning post-move thinking: “What have I done?”I just turned 40 and my life is not what I hoped for. How can I make it better for myself? | Leading questionsRead moreTry not to compare this moment to your 20s; you’ve changed since then, and so has the social scene you’re trying to connect with. It’s hard enough to keep the friends you’ve got in your 30s – everyone’s getting married or having babies or their careers are taking off. That’s true even for people who never leave their home town. In your case, you’ve got the Gladiators obstacle course of adult loneliness – no existing social network, no in-person office, no partner there with you (which would make befriending couples easier), “Now make friends!”That’s a big task. It’s going to take a while. And it might not ever feel quite like it did back home; for some people, relationships from formative years just feel different, easier. It goes differently for different people. Just as there are city mice and country mice, there are people who are happy bouncing between countries and people who want to be around what they know.I’m curious about the way you put your question: was this the right choice? I never really know what that means. What would it take to be the right choice? That you won’t regret it? That it’ll make you happier than you would have been? We can’t know these things with certainty. I think the only question you could really know the answer to is how it makes you feel – are you glad you made this choice?If you’re not, you’re allowed to undo it.Sometimes it feels as though reversing a big life gamble isn’t an option. We’re culturally well-trained to avoid “giving up”. Or maybe we feel shame about “abandoning” the optimistic vision of how life could be. But don’t get so beholden to the narrative that you can’t see the actuality. If it sucks it sucks. Many people have moved overseas then changed their minds – this is not a failure. You haven’t even failed to gain the big learning experience travel is meant to provide. You have learned about yourself, and about how much you value your existing networks.If you moved partly to have a big adventure that makes you realise your own emotional strength, changing your mind can do that too. Saying “you know what, I thought I’d like this but I don’t” can give exactly that feeling of clarity, autonomy and self-reliance.When I say that, how does it feel – to seriously consider reversing this decision? If articulating this possibility feels like a huge relief, that might be your answer. But if it makes you bristle and think “hang on, I’m not done yet”, that’s your answer instead.There’s a difference between challenging yourself in horizon-expanding ways and just making life more painful. Only stick this out if you think it’ll change – not because you feel you have to.The reader’s letter has been edited for lengthAsk Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsLonelinessLeading questionsFriendshipMigrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The green tidal mudflats are noisy with gulls and lapwings as the ferry sails towards Yarmouth. Far out on sparkling water, a white sail stands out against misty downs. The Victorian poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson regularly tramped over those chalky hills, declaring “the air is worth ‘sixpence a pint’”. There is no need to drive for a holiday on the Isle of Wight. Regular ferries connect with mainland trains and the island has a good network of buses.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I am travelling as a foot passenger on the 40-minute Wightlink ferry from Lymington Pier, where the train arrives along an embankment with yachts, plovers and redshanks outside the window. Once on the island, theSummer Links busservice, running from April to late September, stops at the entrance toTapnell Farm, where I’m staying for a couple of nights in a well-equipped cabin with a hot tub that looks out towards Tennyson Down.IoW mapThe14-mile Tennyson Trailruns along the spine of West Wight. It crosses tumuli-studded Compton Down, where there is a clear sense of being on an island: sea views on three sides, with long tapering white cliffs to the west and the gentler coast winding off to the east. There are blue butterflies and chalkland flowers such as orchids, wild thyme and nodding musk thistles.Freshwater Bay is a couple of miles away, so I head there on my first day for a swim among the chalk stacks. The most direct route from Tapnell skirts the site of the1970 Isle of Wight festival. With an audience of about 600,000, it’s still the biggest concert ever held in the UK. Jimi Hendrix played there on 31 August that year; three weeks later he was dead.Beyond the colourful walled garden of Tennyson’s former home are parkland walks and the ‘careless-ordered’ feel that he describes in a poemA short walk from the beach, a bronze statue of Hendrix, with his feet in Spanish daisies, stands in the garden ofDimbola. Once home to pioneering Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, it is now a gallery displaying pictures by Cameron and other photographers with changing exhibitions and one room dedicated to memorabilia from the annual Isle of Wight festivals (£6.90 for adults, £3 for children).Cameron was the great-aunt of writer Virginia Woolf, and Dimbola is the setting for Woolf’s only play, a 1935 comedy called Freshwater. Tennyson, the Camerons and the actor Ellen Terry are all larger-than-life characters in Woolf’s satirical drama. The real Terry appears pensively in one of many celebrity photos on display at Dimbola. In Woolf’s play, her character complains about having to wear itchy wigs and pose for artists and photographers. She declares: “Nothing ever changes in this house. Somebody’s always asleep. Lord Tennyson is always reading. Maud, the cook, is always being photographed.”View image in fullscreenThe bronze statue of Jimi Hendrix at Dimbola gallery.Photograph: Phoebe TaplinTennyson’s creeper-covered houseFarringfordis just around the corner (gardens £4.50; book ahead for house tours). A wooded footpath, heading left beyond thenearby thatched church, leads to the entrance. It runs under a footbridge that was first built by Tennyson to avoid his many fans. (In Freshwater, his character complains: “Twenty earnest youths from Clerkenwell are in the shrubbery; six American professors are in the summer house; the bathroom is occupied by the Ladies Poetry Circle from Ohio.”) Beyond Farringford’s colourful walled garden are parkland walks and the “careless-ordered” feel that Tennyson describes in a poem. You can see a cedar tree sketched by Edward Lear and the magnolia whose flowers Tennyson laid on his wife’s pillow.View image in fullscreenCarisbrooke Castle – where Charles I was imprisoned under Cromwell.Photograph: Graham Prentice/AlamyBack at the thatched church, I catch the open-topped Needles Breezer for a heart-stopping hairpin ride up to the clifftop Old Battery fort. The viewpoint for seeing the sharp limestone rocks and the red and white lighthouse is close by. Heading down again on the next bus, I can see Alum Bay’s cliffs of multicoloured sand, and Tudor Hurst Castle over the water. The day’s last Summer Links bus back from Yarmouth to Tapnell is also an open-topper and runs along waterside Tennyson Road. A£19 rover ticketgives me 48 hours’ unlimited bus travel around the island and includes the open-toppers.It’s drizzling steadily next morning and my hiking plans look less appealing. I was hoping to walk east along the Tennyson Trail, past prehistoric remains with intriguing names likeFive Barrowsto reach the National TrustMottistone Gardens. Instead, I roll through rosy thatched villages on a surprisingly efficient series of buses, finishing with bus 12, which drops me at Mottistone’s entrance.The misty air at Mottistone makes the flowerbeds seem brighter, and fills the woodland and wildflower avenues with romantic fogThe land around Mottistone’s old stone manor house has become a flowering garden with subtropical plants, scented roses and banks of foxgloves. The rain brings out the strong scent of the magenta beach roses, the subtler pale pink shrub roses and abundant purple catmint. The misty air makes the flowerbeds seem brighter, and fills the woodland and wildflower avenues with romantic fog. Raindrops spangle the orange lilies, red bottlebrush flowers and deep blue delphiniums. “This drop of rain is a blessing,” says head gardener Ed Hinch. He explains that the spiralling flowerbeds of the sandy Lower Garden were inspired by the naturally occurring Fibonacci sequence (£8.50 for adults, £4.25 over-fives, without Gift Aid).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bus stops near medieval St Mary’s church, and I walk to Carisbrooke Castle, where Charles I was imprisoned under Cromwell. A path leads steeply up from pretty Castle Street, through a field of sheep, to emerge near the gatehouse, where jackdaws are squabbling and spiral stairways lead up on to the ancient walls. There’s a heady scent from the wet mock orange flowers in the relatively new formal garden, with its avenue of fig trees, but Carisbrooke’s smell-scape is more varied: there’s a hint of bat in the darkest corners (more species roost here than at any other southern English site) and a lingering whiff of donkey in the old well house, which the animals still patiently trot over to on scheduled days to demonstrate a wheel that raises the deep bucket.View image in fullscreenOne of the cabins at Tapnell Farm, where the author stayed.Photograph: Phoebe TaplinThat evening in Tapnell’s barn-like restaurant, the Cow, I order a portobello mushroom burger. Tapnell Farm opened its first safari tents 13 years ago, later adding camping pods and an aquapark with a natural lake (two nights in an Eco Pod from £336). There are now several different glamping options; beyond fields of rescued wallabies are five new domes in a flowering meadow facing north across the Solent.A car-free trip around Aberdeenshire: I saw natural beauty I thought was out of reachRead moreNewtown, where I’m heading on my last morning, was once a busy medieval borough with saltworks and oyster beds. Now, it’s a tiny village in the marshes, where the old brick town hall is subsiding into carpets of clover. Bus 7 from Yarmouth takes 10 minutes to reach the New Inn in Shalfleet and I follow the island’s coastal path for a mile or so to Newtown estuary. Here paths lead through flowering hay meadows and salty stretches of sea purslane. There’s a waterside causeway, a wooden walkway and a well-equipped bird hide.Back in Yarmouth, there’s time for a final walk near the River Yar, round Henry VIII’s coastal castle, and past Yarmouth church, whose tall tower doubled as a seamark. With an hour until my ferry, I head for the watersideTerrace restaurant, which opened in 2020, to drink fresh lemonade with mint and watch the afternoon sun on the water, feeling as if I’ve had a whole week’s holiday.Combined train and ferry ticketsfor foot passengers start at about £30each way fromLondon Waterloo to Ryde or Yarmouth.This trip was supported byTapnell Farm.

Of note is the way troves of previously publicly available information on government websites such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or National Institutes of Health (NIH) have quietly gone dark.One such page is theNot Invisible Act Commission’sfinal reportfrom November 2023. The Not Invisible Act Commission was mandated by bipartisan legislation and signed into law by Trump himself. The report was a collaboration between the justice department and the interior department to address, document and respond to the missing and murdered Indigenous peoples (MMIP) crisis, in which Indigenous communities experience disproportionate rates of abduction, assault and murder. Accurate statistics about the MMIP and missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) crisescan be limited and dated,but,as of 2019, homicide was the third most common cause of death for Indigenous girls aged 15 to 19 and Indigenous women aged 20 to 24.The Not Invisible Act Commission’s final report was a culmination of seven in-person field hearings held across the country and a one-day virtual national hearing. Nearly 600 people attended the hearings and 260 people, including survivors, victims, family members, advocates and law enforcement gave testimony to the commission. As a result of those hearings, the commission issued its final report of recommendations to address the crisis.Having a resource like the Not Invisible Act Commission’s final report provided Indigenous people and governments, as well as federal, state and local branches of the US government, with data and suggestions on how to reduce the crises. The act itself was historic, not only because it shed light on an issue that Indian Country has faced for decades, but also because it wasthe first bill that was introduced and passedby four Indigenous US congressional members.Despite the report no longer being available online, advocates say the fight to bring light to and end the MMIP and MMIW crises continues.Tracking numbersCharolette Gonzales, the policy and advocacy director of the Coalition to Stop Violence Against NativeWomen(CSVANW) said that she and other staffers were shocked when the Not Invisible Act Commission’s report was removed from the federal website.“They were like, ‘What does this mean for the future of other information that supports our work?’” said Gonzales, who is Diné and San Ildefonso Pueblo. “[We] make sure that our communities are informed. What does that mean for them?”The coalition focuses on preventive work, or trying to stop violence against Indigenous women before it happens.“When doing this education, we are better able to equip them with the ability to advocate for themselves, and that work is really important as we move forward, especially with these unprecedented times of this current presidential administration,” she said.Karrisa Newkirk, of the Oklahoma-based MMIW Chahta, an organization that supports affected families through financial assistance, provides training opportunities for law enforcement agencies, and works with victims to help them heal after experiencing violence, said that the work doesn’t stop just because of a decision made in Washington.“When it comes to our work and what we do, I don’t feel like we’ve missed a step,” she said. “We’re going to continue to serve our families exactly how we should and always have. When it comes to other MMIWs across the United States, I truly feel like it kind of puts us back in time a little bit, where people aren’t going to see what a real crisis it is.”Newkirk said that after the commission collected the data, it should have been used to make tangible changes. Still, having a national database that tracked MMIW cases was vital.“Even though there were great strides in the last couple years, them removing that was like a slap in the face. It was a huge step back.” she said. “It felt like we were being heard and recognized, and then all of a sudden it felt like that was no longer what it was any more … When you think about that as someone that’s in the work and you know how many people already don’t know about it, and then it’s removed from the United States website, it’s definitely disheartening.”The CSVANW has begun discussing creating a database of its own, one built with information that the organization has collected over the years, including documents and reports that the Department of Justice previously issued. This method of ensuring that vital documents and resources are stored somewhere other than on government agencies’ websites is something that some advocates have been pushing forsince the website purges began.The National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center, Inc (NIWRC), a non-profit organization that works to end violence against Native women, children and communities, for example, has a version of the Not Invisible Act Commission’s reportthat is still accessible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We already have limited resources as not only just a Native organization and survivor-led organization, but also as tribal people who live in these pueblos and work with our people.”MMIW Chahta also tracks its own numbers, and is trying to overcome racial misclassification by law enforcement.Tribal communities are also concerned about whether treaties,agreements made between sovereign nations, will be upheld by the US government, Gonzales said. The US has had a long history of violating treaties even before Trump’s election.Since he was sworn in, Trump andElon Muskhave called on the General Services Administration to terminate the leases of roughly 7,500 federal offices, including25 regional offices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. On Friday, Trumprescinded a Biden-era executive order,which aimed to strengthen tribal sovereignty for the 574 federally recognized tribes in the nation.Articles about Native American code talkers removed from military websitesRead moreFollowing the removal of the Not Invisible Act Commission’s final report page, federal agencies have flaggedhundreds of words to limit or avoid, including, “indigenous community”, “tribal”, and “Native American”. Defense department websites removed pages aboutIndigenous code talkers, whose usage of Choctaw and Navajo languages to communicate messages were vital for winning the first and second world wars.Of the extreme changes being made by the administration and their implications for Indigenous people, Gonzales said: “A lot of community members, along with our staff, are emotionally exhausted every day we hear about new executive orders coming out.“Our survivors and our resources truly help decrease the violence that happens in our communities … And so, once we heard this, I think our mind instantly went to the fact that Native women will die if we don’t have federal funding.

The enormous ships are unmoving, raised above the waves by thick pylons. Drop-down bridges connect them to each other, the front one extending down to the sand.The original video reportedly disappeared from WeChat shortly after it was uploaded, but copies circulated widely among watchers of China-Taiwan hostilities. The 19-second clip was their first clear look at what many believe are China’s newest tool for itsTaiwaninvasion plans.The barge-likeShuqiaoships were first seen during the construction phase in January, and reported by Naval News. The Zhanjiang beach test showed how together they can create a loading dock from almost a kilometre out to sea – exactly what China needs to overcome one of the key challenges of any land invasion of Taiwan.View image in fullscreenAnnotated satellite image of the Guandong shipyard in early February 2025Photograph: Planet Labs PBCThey also provide crucial insight into China’s advancing integration of its military, paramilitary and civilian operations.Under the rule of Xi Jinping, China’s military is pursuing the capability toforcibly annex Taiwanif it fails to convince or coerce the island’s government to submit peacefully. Most annexation scenarios involve a full ground invasion of Taiwan’s main island, but there are fewer than 20 beaches on which an amphibious assault could land, and in wartime those can be defended, filled with anti-landing equipment.Analysts say these barges can negate that key defence and, potentially, give the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) direct access to any road within about 150 clear metres of the shore. Taiwan has more than 1,500km (930 miles) of coastline which several major roads and highways closely skirt, including as close as 30km to central Taipei.Taiwan’s president labels China a ‘foreign hostile force’ and ramps up security measures citing ‘infiltration’Read more“These bridge-barges are purpose-built for a Taiwan invasion scenario,” said Andrew Erickson, a professor of strategy at the China Maritime Studies Institute. “They embody the seriousness with which China under Xi is pursuing absorption of Taiwan by any means possible.“The Shuqiao barges are not a panacea that can overcome all difficult landing conditions, but they definitely provide PLA planners with more options along far greater stretches of Taiwan’s coastline.”Many have noted the barges’ vulnerabilities. Yu Pei-chen, a former army major general turned city councillor, told local media that Taiwan’s military could use its newly acquired Himars rocket systems to quite easily take them out.“China should build more barges of the same kind and send them to Taiwan. That would save the ammo for our armed forces,” Yu said.But Lu Li-Shih, a retired navy major and now political commentator, urged careful evaluation, telling a political talkshow he expected the barges wouldn’t be deployed until Taiwan’s armed forces “lose their control of the air and sea”.View image in fullscreenPicture from Chinese state media of tanks being loaded on to a car ferry that has been converted to carry military vehiclesPhotograph: CCTV 7/YouTubeJason Wang, chief executive of Ingenispace, a geospatial analysis company, said the ships were a clear sign of China’s “creativity”.“They can produce the ships really fast – four to six months – and get them into theatre,” Wang said. “They can also iterate improvements faster than everybody else.”Several analysts said it was highly unlikely the barges would be used in a first wave of attack. Instead they’d be part of a follow on landing, servings as a causeway to help deliver large numbers of troops, vehicles and artillery transferred from accompanying vessels. High-resolution satellite imagery seen by the Guardian shows the barges at Zhenjiang were also carrying amphibious vehicles on their decks.The Zhanjiang beach where the vessels were filmed is near a PLA Navy facility, the headquarters for the PLA’s Southern Theatre Command, which runs operations targeting Taiwan.5:03How China uses ‘salami-slicing’ tactics to exert pressure on Taiwan - videoUS intelligence has said Xi has ordered the PLA to be capable of invasion by 2027, although military experts have noted that a number of variables – including ongoing corruption issues in the PLA and theunpredictability of US support for Taiwan under Trump– could push that in either direction.Regardless, the PLA is now undergoing one of the biggest military buildups since the second world war. Xi has overhauled the command structure, boosted missile and nuclear stocks, and strengthened paramilitary arms including the coastguard and the paramilitary fleet of fishing boats known as themaritime militia. The different groups are cooperating more than ever on joint operations.Satellite images show the barges were escorted by at least two civilian ships from a nearby civilian dock, and that several other boats – including some marked as fishing vessels on their tracking ID – were sailing laps behind them, appearing to practise running interference.At least three more barges are under construction or in early testing. The barge design suggests they have been built to work with the roll-on, roll-off ferries that China has been repurposing or building to bring tanks and another heavy armoured vehicles across the Taiwan Strait.Shipbuilding is a key part of the expansion of the PLA, which has the world’s largest navy. In a recentreporton China’s growing “dual use” shipbuilding industry, the Centre For Strategic and International Studies said China’s largest single state-owned shipbuilder had built “more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than the entire US shipbuilding industry has built since the end of world war two”.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsTaiwanAsia PacificChinafeaturesShareReuse this content"

About 85% of Farm School NYC’s funding comes from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).The center was in the process of launching aNew York City-wide pilot initiative focused on food justice, crop management and urban farming advocacy. But National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s (NIFA) $300,000community food projects grantthat would have funded it was terminated, effective immediately. Forced to scramble, FSNYC scaled down the programming and adopted a sliding scale for tuition.Trump administration ‘villainizes’ immigrant families with misleading directive on food aidRead moreThe cuts affected other plans, including public courses on food stewardship. Funding that would have allowed the center to distribute mini grants and grow community capacity has also been paused. FSNYC recently discussed cutting some of its own employee benefits to free up resources for the now affected programming. “Our main goal is to keep Farm School in operation,” Germany said.The impact of USDA cuts has rippled through farming and agriculture communities, which are mobilizing to stanch the damage. Farm School NYC is part of the Black Farmer Fund, a consortium of Bipoc-led/owned farms and entities that work on agricultural policy and strengthening local food systems throughout the north-east. The group was founded to share resources in an already difficult funding environment; rather than compete with each other, they collaborate on joint fundraising and programming.Now, they share an estimated $1.2m gap due to defunding. For Farm School NYC and Black Farmers United – New York State (BFU-NYS), the USDA’s termination or freezing of National Institute of Food and Agriculture grants and Natural Resources Conservation Service contracts put programs and salaries at risk.“We are in survival mode,” Germany said. Over the past year, Farm School NYC began taking baby steps to transition some of its funding away from government dollars, but “the sudden defunding was not the way we wanted to do it”, added Germany.A larger farm in a different place has access to resources that our farmers just don’t have access toChristine Hutchinson, NEFOC founding board memberMade up of growers, advocates and food educators, BFU-NYS just became an independent organization after being a fiscally sponsored project under Farm School NYC. It lost a five-year, $660,000 contract with the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service agency. The contract was to fund three annual statewide “Bridging Land, Agriculture, and Communities” conferences, with the inaugural one planned for April.About a week afterDonald Trump’s inauguration, Black Farmers United got an email explaining that because their work fell under diversity, equity and inclusion programming, the USDA would end their contract. This year’s conference was canceled, but BFU-NYS plans to host one in 2026 with or without government funding. The organization is seeking private donors to make that happen.The abrupt withdrawal of funding has left the organization holding the bag for an event that was just around the corner – and all its costs. “We have done the background work, got participating partners, submitted deposits and signed contracts,” said Dr Kuturie Rouse, BFU-NYS’s executive director of development.The organization is now unable to reimburse full-time staff for extra time spent coordinating the conference or recoup the cost of supplies. On top of that, BFU-NYS must pay vendors and other collaborators despite no longer having the USDA money or this year’s conference itself. “The organization is already at a loss,” Rouse said.USDA cuts more than $1bn in local food purchases for schools, food banksRead moreBFU-NYS also lost its Green Futures program. The program helps young adults battle food insecurity, establish community gardens and pursue agriculture as a career. Last year, it launched a pilot program with a South Bronx middle school where students grew watermelon, callaloo, lettuce and other fruits and vegetables. The students then gave that food to their school cafeteria to feed the student body. BFU-NHYS now hopes to partner with other local schools to continue and grow the initiative.Aside from the loss of money and programming, Rouse said that the mental health of BFU-NYS staff had taken a hit. After the inauguration, staff were bombarded with racist emails and social media comments. “It was hate mail just because of our name and who we support and sponsor.” He clarified that while “Black” is on the organization’s name and it focuses on communities of color, it is a nondiscriminatory organization that “work[s] with any and everyone”.And, at this extremely critical and stressful time, mental health support from another ecosystem partner will not happen. The Northeast Farmers of Color Land Trust (NEFOC) supports climate stewardship and regenerative farming. It also serves as an incubator for several regional land projects. Christine Hutchinson, a founding board member of the land trust, shared that a $200,000 collaborative program focused on farmers’ mental health from Maine to Delaware was now on hold indefinitely. NEFOC is one of several organizations that contributed to it. “People are really rocked,” Hutchinson said.There are so many people who are reaching out, trying to be comforted, trying to be connected to othersMonti Lawson, Catalyst Collaborative Farm founderIt’s been difficult for Monti Lawson, the founder of the Catalyst Collaborative Farm, to see so much funding halted because he encouraged many farmers and other partners to take advantage of these USDA programs. The farm, which invites queer and Bipoc people to the land to farm and organize, offers many free, donation-based or sliding-scale events – all possible due to previous funding. “For government and even philanthropy, QTBipoc was a very sexy word,” Lawson said.Lawson has been connecting with past funders and community members. “In this particular moment, there are so many people who are reaching out, trying to be comforted, trying to be connected to others,” Lawson said.The land trust’s Hutchinson pointed out that the impact of defunding will vary. “A larger farm in a different place has access to resources that our farmers just don’t have access to,” Hutchinson said. Farmers from Northeast Farmers of Color Land Trust are already starting with lower levels of federal support, and their capacity to replace those funds will probably be much lower. Meanwhile, farming organizations are trying to document what is happening as funding evaporates. The Hudson Valley Young Farmers Coalition, of which Lawson is a part, is collectingNew York-based farmer testimonialsto track the impact of cuts. The National Young Farmers Coalition is doing the sameacross the country.On the ground, though, the Black Farming Fund members and other agricultural organizations are trying to secure funding and their futures. In mid-February, Farm School NYC launched anemergency fundraiserto meet its severe funding gap, support its scholarship fund, launch revamped courses and pay farmer facilitators. Thus far, it has raised $750.Local food for schools helps farmers and kids. So why is Trump cutting funding?Read moreThe precarity of federal funding has the consortium’s members looking elsewhere for funding. Farm School NYC has been assembling advocacy toolkits and helping facilitate contact with legislators. BFU-NYS recently launched a mobilization strategy that includes prioritizes funding from state and local government. Rouse noted that one of the non-profit’s biggest supporters is New York State representative Khaleel Anderson, who chairs thestate’s food and farming nutrition policytaskforce. Through Anderson’s support, BFU-NYS has had its own line item in the New York state budget for the past three years. Right now, Anderson is pushing for Black Farmers United to get increased support. BFU also wants to tap into New York City council discretionary dollars to fund local initiatives such as its Green Futures program and social responsibility grants from businesses that remain committed to diversity and inclusion.Some advocates believe that now is the time for those with power and privilege to march on the streets and that QTBipoc, immigrant and food justice communities – often on the frontlines – should take a step back.One of the first things longtime food justice advocate Karen Washington did was put out a call on herLinkedIn, asking her network to donate to cover the funding gap. Washington is co-founder of Rise & Root Farm in Orange county, New York.“There are foundations, hedge funds, venture capital groups, and Wall Street executives who can write a check in an instant without losing a cent.” In an interview, she asked: “Where are the people that voted for this? Where is the outrage?”Explore more on these topicsBlack farmersOur unequal earthTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpUS domestic policyFarmingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, Venezuelan immigrants to the US, many of whom are also suspected of gang affiliation without apparent evidence, have joined Salvadorian prisoners in the Americas’ largest – and one of its cruelest – prison systems.Mneesha Gellman, a political scientist at Emerson College who researches human rights and violence, says the US deportees will face dire conditions and uncertain fates. “We don’t know how any of this will play out, because it’s never exactly happened before,” she said. “Because these are Venezuelans being deported to a country most of them have never been.”White House denies violating judge’s order with Venezuela deportationsRead moreThe Guardian spoke to Gellman, who often testifies as an expert witness in asylum cases for Salvadorians, to better understand the conditions that US deportees will face inEl Salvador. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.You’ve emphasized in yourwritingsthat Bukele hasordereda communication blackout between incarcerated people and people outside the prison. But some scholars and journalists have been able to gain some understanding of what Cecot, and other Salvadorian prisons, are like on the inside. What do we know so far?We know that there is severe overcrowding, that there’s inadequate food, and sanitation is a really big issue. People are locked in their cells a majority of the time.There’s been a few political prisoners who’ve been released and spoken to the media. Some of them have described things like seeing people die in the cells with them, and then the bodies are left there for extended periods of time.But because of this contact blackout – there’s no phone, mail or visits – there’s so many people wondering about their loved ones, who have no way to confirm if they’re living. Our understanding is that there’s almost no medical access, or access to medications in any sort of regular or consistent way. If someone has diabetes, there’s no guarantee that they’re going to get insulin. I assume that those conditions would be similar for the Venezuelans being deported from the US.And reports fromAmnesty InternationalandCristosalfound that in Salvadorian prisons overall, there’s systemic torture – it is a regular, institutionalized practice.Is there any sense that the US deportees will be treated any differently than theSalvadorians who are incarcerated?The US has accused these people of gang membership, so on the one hand, there’s a concern that they could attract the attention of rival gangs or cartels operating in the prison. For someone to come in and be perceived, whether or not it’s true, as being a member of a different gang is a territorial threat – and gangs in prison maintain their territorial control through violence and intimidation.And then there is a chance people who have been deported from the US will also have a higher risk of targeting because of their connections to people in the US, and to the US economy. We know this kind of targeting also happens to Salvadorians who are deported from the US. They could be targeted for physical violence as a threat to make them pay, for example – that’s one of the many concerns I have.As you said – it’s unclear that the men who were deported actually have any affiliation with Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang thatDonald Trumphas designated as a “foreign terrorist organization” and vowed to root out in the US. In many cases, the families of these men believe they were targeted due to innocuous tattoos.So using tattoos as criteria to detain and incarcerate people has become practice under the state of exception in El Salvador, and it’s deeply problematic because officials could point to something like a rose tattoo – which someone might get because they like roses or they want something beautiful on their body.And tattoos became an acceptable criterion to use to incarcerate people because Salvadorian police officers and military personnel were given not just a mandate, but for at least a certain period of time, quotas for the numbers of people they needed to arrest and detain each day.Of course, the US policing system has also long used tattoos erroneously to get people intogang databases. And the criterion to label someone as gang affiliated or gang involved has gotten so vague as to render it pointless. Now it’s a deeply troubling situation where anyone with a tattoo of anything can become vulnerable.Trump waging ‘sickening’ psychological war, deported Venezuelan’s lawyer saysRead moreThey’re at risk for getting flagged by law enforcement. And then I’ve seen cases where people who have gotten non-gang-related tattoos are perceived in prison as being part of a rival gang, so they’re targeted for violence.The Bukele government’s quotas for arrests sound similar to the Trump administration’s issuing quotas to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. As someone who has researched human rights and prisons in both the US and El Salvador, are you seeing parallels between Bukele and Trump?Oh, I am seeing so many parallels – every parallel. I think that Bukele and Trump are arm in arm, populist rightwing authoritarian leaders who are using their executive power beyond the limits that executive power is supposed to be used in democratic regimes. That is worrying for everyone in any country, not just for people in the US and El Salvador, and not just for people being deported from the US to El Salvador.This situation of these mass deportations brings up multiple points. First of all, we need to remember that every person is a human being, and the dehumanization of people who are incarcerated creates a sub-class of humanity that is unacceptable for those of us that want to live in a more equitable world.And second, we have two populist authoritarian leaders in both the US and El Salvador – and those of us that are interested in protecting human rights need to push back and call for accountability.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationVenezuelaUS politicsUS immigrationUS foreign policyEl SalvadorAmericasinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Constantin listed them all.“Iliescu, Constantinescu, Iliescu again,” the retired security guard said, counting on his fingers. “Băsescu, then Iohannis. And for what, exactly? Nothing has changed. Nothing, in 35 years. Pay and pensions are too low. Food and fuel cost too much. Something’s got to give.”Nursing a beer outside a hole-in-the-wall bar in rural Drăgănești, an hour’s drive north of Bucharest, Constantin said one man might have been able to change things. “And now they’ve banned him,” he said. “So they can keep on robbing us.”View image in fullscreenConstantin (right), a retired security guard who lives in Drăgănești, says nothing has changed in Romania since the revolution in 1989.Photograph: Bogdan Dinca/The GuardianConstantin’s view is not unusual in this village. In November’s presidential elections, nearly 600 people here (37.2% of the electorate) voted for Călin Georgescu, an anti-EU, Moscow-friendly, Covid-denyingultranationalist who won the first round.Since then,the election has been annulledover suspected Russian interference, andGeorgescu has been placed under criminal investigation. Last week,Romania’s top court upheld a decisionbarring him from standing in the re-run of the vote in May.Now even those who did not back Georgescu are disgusted.View image in fullscreenElena Preda, on her way home from Drăgănești’s minimarket.Photograph: Bogdan Dinca/The Guardian“Millions voted for him; he should have been allowed to stand,” said Elena Preda, 64, a retired legal officer, outside the minimarket. “Nothing’s proven against him. The injustice makes me weep. Look at me, I’m buying candles. We’re mourning democracy.”Beside his roadside greengrocer’s stand, Ionut, 55, was seething. “This isn’t normal,” he said. “It’s a corrupt, thieving dictatorship. A smart guy looked like winning, so they cancel the vote. Then they cancel him.”Hours after the constitutional court confirmed Georgescu’s disqualification, saying his violation of electoral rules was “conduct contrary to the Romanian constitution”, Romania’s prime minister, the Social Democrat Marcel Ciolacu, posted on his Facebook page.He said that he hoped the ruling would “restore social tranquility in Romania”. He added that the judges’ decision closed “an extremely tense and dangerous episode” in the country, which could now return to “a normal social climate” and “civilised public debate”.View image in fullscreenIonut sells potatoes, onions and brooms by the roadside in Drăgănești.Photograph: Bogdan Dinca/The GuardianListening to the voters of Drăgănești, that seems a tad optimistic. Legally, the decisions to annul the vote and pursue Georgescu may be sound. Politically – in a society feeling as fed up and as let down by its political class as Romania’s – they could be explosive.The first-round ballot was annulled after the far-right candidate surged from less than 5% in the polls days before the vote to a triumphant 23%, and declassified intelligence documents revealed a campaign with the hallmarks of a Russian influence operation.The documents, from Romania’s intelligence service and interior ministry, listed 85,000-odd cyber-attacks on the country’s election computer system and identified 25,000 largely dormant TikTok accounts that had suddenly begun amplifying Georgescu’s messages.What has emerged so far strongly suggests a Russian campaign, but does not prove it. The files suggested social media influencers had been hired by intermediaries and paid to share videos promoting Georgescu’s campaign, and that some of his campaign workers were linked to organised crime gangs and neo-fascist groups.The former soil scientist – who declared zero campaign spending - is now under investigation on six counts, including misreporting campaign finances, illegal use of digital technology and promoting fascist groups. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.Prosecutors are also investigating 21 others linked to Georgescu. They includeHoraţiu Potra, a military contractor, who has called for insurrection “with scythes, pitchforks and axes”. Police raids on their homes have uncovered weapons and millions in cash, according to prosecutors.Adina Marincea is a researcher at the Elie Wiesel Institute for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania. In her office in Bucharest, she said clean-cut 62-year-old Georgescu may have “an aura of legitimacy”, but there was little doubt he was “a very dangerous figure”.Georgescu has hailed Romania’s 1930s fascist leaders as heroes. He recently gave an apparent Nazi-style salute. “We have enough evidence to place him in that tradition,” Marincea said. “Look at the ideology he promotes. The people he surrounds himself with.”She added that Georgescu, who ran as an independent, “plays a game of calculated ambivalence”.

He promised he’d put Romania back on its feet, rebuild what all the others broke, bring home the diaspora. If there’s got to be another revolution, so be it.”Mihaela Măcelaru, 43, said Georgescu had “shown us how to fight for our our country, because we are all one people. He brought us all together. He was a good man for our country, a wise man. I believe he was sent by God.

The median household income is about a third of the EU average. Food is 50% more expensive than five years ago. Almost a third of the country’s 19 million people are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. Over the past 10 or 15 years, nearly 20% of the workforce has sought better opportunities abroad.Public services are poor, and the social safety-net lacking. There is a general perception, in the words of one centre-left politician, that: “The state isn’t there to help. Just to punish people, to create difficulties – while enriching its own.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anda long history of corrupt and incompetent politicians has left public trust in MPs and ministers low.Adding fuel to those flames is what many observers see as a calamitous lack of official or institutional transparency. “It’s simple: if the state leaves a void, people are only too eager to fill it,” said Ana Dragomir, communications director of the Romanian civic engagement NGO Funky Citizens.“Our authorities are famous for not communicating or explaining their decisions,” she said. “That leaves a big hole that instantly gets filled by deep-state conspiracy theories [and] allegations of a coup.”Such claims are not confined to Romania. The Trump administration has presented the whole episode as an attack on free speech. The US vice-president, JD Vance, asked in a recent speechwhether the country “shares America’s values”. Elon Musk wondered how a judge can “end democracy in Romania”.View image in fullscreenAna Dragomir, from the Romanian NGO Funky Citizens, in Bucharest.Photograph: Bogdan Dinca/The GuardianDragomir cites the manner of Georgescu’s detention for questioning by police last month as an example of the authorities needlessly fanning the flames of such discourse.“They didn’t make clear why,” she said. “No specifics, no proper explanation, bad updates. It’s about trust ... If we don’t trust our authorities, it’s because they don’t talk to us.”Likewise, the electoral bureau’s decision to cancel the first round of the presidential ballot. “It was unprecedented – yet still they failed to communicate or explain,” Dragomir said. “It just fuels suspicions.”A similar absence of clear, complete and – most importantly – public evidence surrounds the exclusion from May’s presidential re-run of both Georgescu andanother far-right candidate, Diana Șoșoacă. Șoșoacă, of the ultranationalist SOS Romania party, had already been barred from standing in the first round.The constitutional court pronounced Șoșoacă’s anti-EU, pro-Moscow diatribes “contrary to democratic values”. She would not be able to keep the presidential oath to respect Romania’s constitution and protect democracy if elected, it argued.“Again, there’s just nothing really specific there,” said Dragomir. “No clear criteria, written in law … This may have been the right decision. But in this context, if it’s not completely clear, it just creates more tension and polarisation. That’s dangerous.”The barrings left Romania’s populist far-right parties, which hold more than a third of parliamentary seats and had united behind Georgescu, scrambling to find a replacement candidate.In the end, they fielded two – George Simion of Romania’s second-largest party, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), and Anamaria Gavrilă, founder of the Party of Young People (POT) – before Gavrilă withdrew.View image in fullscreenA defaced poster for the presidential candidate Nicușor Dan in Iasi.Photograph: Bogdan Dinca/The Guardian“We decided to support the one who has the most chance of winning,” she said on Wednesday. “We must go beyond parties and, as Mr Georgescu said, we must support this ultranationalist movement by giving it all the chances.”Polls have suggested Simion would top the first round with about 30% of the national vote, but would likely be defeated in the second round runoff by the centrist mayor of Bucharest, Nicușor Dan, who is running as an independent.Whatever the outcome, Georgescu’s campaign has been “an absolute wake-up call”, said Victoria Stoiciu, a Social Democrat senator and former progressive activist. “No one saw it coming, and he’s clearly a symptom of something deeper.”With inequalities growing, the gap between voters and politicians widening and far-right populists stoking resentment, Stoiciu said, “It does remind me of the interwar rise of fascism. The same perceptions of a corrupt elite, the same disconnects.”View image in fullscreenStefan lives in Drăgănești with his wife, Jenica, and believes Romania ‘desperately needs change’.Photograph: Bogdan Dinca/The GuardianShe added that there were external factors, too, including a “long-term, sustained investment by Russia in undermining trust”. But Romania’s mainstream politicians, she acknowledged, had to “be much more open, listen more, talk more” to voters.Above all, they had to actually make a difference to people’s lives. That was a message that resonated back in Drăgănești. Ștefan, 78, a rare dissenting voice, said Georgescu “should just have been arrested, from the start … He’s clearly a shady character.”But even if Georgescu was not the man to do it, Ștefan said, Romania still “absolutely and desperately needs change”.With this, Ștefan’s wife, Jenica, 69, chipped in. “We just have to hope,” she said. “The only problem is, we don’t know what to hope for.”Explore more on these topicsRomaniaEuropeRussiaThe far rightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unlike the US president’s previous gifts – pre-emptively allowing Russia to keep the territory it has illegally invaded, refusing to give any security guarantees to Ukraine, and strongly hinting US sanctions would soon be lifted – this was soft power, wrapped in a pair of skate laces.Putin loves hockey. He plays it himself. (His clearly terrified opponents let him score at will.) Russia is a global powerhouse of the sport. But the best Russian players eventually leave Russia, to go play in the National Hockey League. The money is better, and the fame greater.1:34Vladimir Putin tops the scoring in ice hockey match ... then falls over – videoSo when Russia was booted from international hockey competition after it invaded Ukraine, that hurt Putin even more: the latest insult from a west that would never truly respect it.Russian hockey has always been geopolitical. The Soviet teams of the 20th century were explicitly military proxies. The players were soldiers in the Red Army. Their coach was a colonel. They bunked in barracks for 11 months of the year. When they began playing – and beating – North American teams for the first time, the matches were clashes of ideology. The communists, raised since kids to play together in a collective system on the ice, versus the individualist American and Canadian professionals trying to score goals on their own (and when that didn’t work, trying to bash the Russians in the head). In the 1960s and 70s, the Soviet Union won five of six Olympic golds.There were two big exceptions, both at the height of the cold war: the 1972 Summit Series, when a team of Canadian bruisers barely squeaked out a victory in eight games against the silky Red Army, and the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics when a plucky American team of minor-leaguers and misfits (of course) defeated the heavily favoured Soviets for gold on home turf in what became known as the “Miracle on Ice”. In case you missed the significance, it inspired a Hollywood film starring Kurt Russell.To fully appreciate the geopolitical significance of these hockey proxies, look no further than the recent Four Nations competition, where Canada and the US worked outtheir animosity over Trump’s threatsto make Canada the 51st state by kicking off their first game with three separate fistfights in nine seconds.Canada won the trophyand the nation practically imploded with emotion. The other two nations? Sweden and Finland. If you think Russia didn’t feel left out, let Putin bringing this up in the context of a summit with the US president about the biggest war in Europe since 1945 be a clue.So bold are Putin’s ceasefire demands, it’s hard to believe he is entirely seriousRead moreJust as Saudi Arabia knows the soft power of sport, getting back on their blades on the global ice rink would be a huge triumph for Putin’s Russia. Even better that it comes just as Alexander Ovechkin, the best Russian player of all time and the literal founder of a Putin fanclub, is about toeclipse Wayne Gretzky’s NHL goal record– and to do so while playing for the Washington Capitals, no less. (Gretzky is Canadian, so it is not an American loss – although he has recently attracted Canadian ire by having dinner at Mar-a-Lago and not wearing enough patriotic red.)As for Trump, who appears to see Putin not as a foe but as an equal – great men leading great powers and carving up the world between them – the idea of a Four Nations competition was silly anyway. For him it has only ever been the Two Nations, and you can imagine he and Putin watching it together from the Kremlin press box at Moscow’s CSKA arena, not discussing Ukraine at all.Explore more on these topicsIce hockeyVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUSA ice hockey teamUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

By noon, they were pitchingthe Coronavirus Job Retention Schemeto the chancellor (Leunig admits he is envious of the name the Australians came up with for their equivalent: Jobkeeper).“That was the most useful two hours, 34 minutes of my life,” he recalls. Furlough, as it became known, was signed off by Sunak within the hour, and announced two days later, after consultation with unions and business groups.The policy marked a radical – if temporary – shift in the role of the state, as the Treasury stepped in to underwrite the salaries of millions of citizens whose jobs could otherwise have disappeared. The scheme went on to cost £70bn.Agreed by a chancellor who would have much preferred to be slashing taxes and shrinking the state, furlough is perhaps the clearest example of the way the rules were ripped up in that period – often necessarily, but with long-lasting consequences.Chart detailing how UK national debt rose to close to 100% of GDP since 2008As one Treasury adviser said later, as ministers tried to wind up various costly support schemes: “Covid broke maths.”And that is the most direct way in which the travails of the pandemic period are still felt today – through their impact on the public finances.Public sector borrowing hit almost 17% of GDP in 2020-21, the highest level since the second world war, as the government scrambled to gear up theNHSto cope, as well as cushioning the blow for struggling firms and households, by increasing universal credit by £20 a week, for example.As in many other economies, the result was that public sector debt soared. In the UK, the cost of the bank bailout and a deep recession in 2008, followed by a decade of sluggish growth, had already causedpublic debt as a share of GDP to climbfrom a low of 27% of GDP in 2000, to 84% on the eve of the pandemic.How Covid changed the way Britain works and playsRead moreAs the costs of fighting Covid hit home, it soared to almost 110% of GDP by 2023 – the highest level since the 1950s, when the UK was still working off the legacy of six years of debilitating conflict in the second world war. It remains close to 100%.Many of the key tax and spending decisions made in the past four years, starting withSunak’s 6p increase in the corporation tax ratein the 2021 budget, have been about trying to put the public finances back on an even keel.“The big point is that the pandemic added £400bn to the debt, possibly more if the economy is still smaller than it otherwise would it have been,” says Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). “That is actually one of the things that’s creating huge problems for the public finances. We’re now spending more than £100bn a year on debt interest, and that’s twice what it was pre-Covid.”chartOne former senior Tory adviser, in government during the pandemic, says it is striking how little Covid now figures in the public debate about tax and spend, however.“It’s crazy: there’s a really powerful and actually true argument which is: we had to do loads of stuff during Covid and now we’re having to pay for it – but it’s like we’ve gone through a trauma that no one really wants to talk about, and if we don’t talk about it we can pretend it didn’t happen.”Separate from the impact on the public finances is the direct, long-term effect of the pandemic on public services, many of which are still working through the practical consequences.For the NHS, that means the well documented struggle to deal with waiting lists, which surged as hospitals reorientated towards treating the virus and the public stayed at home.It also means the challenge of trying to support the many thousands of people still experiencing the symptoms of long Covid – very likely to be one driver behind the surge in people unable to work.And there are myriad more subtle ongoing impacts, too, which are harder to measure – such as the dark shadow cast by the psychological impact of the anxiety and grief that accompanied the deadly outbreak.IFS researchpublished earlier this monthcollated evidence to show that the mental health of the UK population appears to have declined since the pandemic. It included the grim fact that there were 3,700, or 24%, more “deaths of despair” – from suicide, drugs or alcohol – among working age people in 2023, than there were on average in the five years pre-Covid.The prevalence of mental health conditions was already rising before the pandemic, and we may have become better at acknowledging and diagnosing them; but a full 36% more people were in touch with mental health services last year, than five years earlier.Chart showing that the government spend 70 billion pounds on furloughThe economist and former Labour adviser James Meadway argues, “the thing with Covid is that it accelerated us along a demographic curve: the transition to everyone being a bit older and a bit sicker than they were”.For these and other reasons, including the cost of supporting working age adults unable to take up employment, public spending as a share of GDP, a proxy for the size of the state, has not returned to its pre-Covid level.There is potentially a more subtle and diffuse impact on public services, too, which comes through a shift in public expectations about what government can and should do.Leunig argues that the large-scale intervention in the energy market made by Liz Truss’s government, protecting even the wealthiest households from the full force of the price rise that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, at a cost of £23bn, would not have happened without the precedent of Covid.“I think what we’ve done is, we’ve now created an expectation that when something happens to the whole of the nation that is genuinely unexpected, the government will step in,” he says. “The government is, if you like, the insurer of last resort.”Several former government figures also point to the fact the pandemic galvanised rapid change in key policy areas – from rough sleeping, to introducing online GP appointments. Some aspects of this transformative way of working stuck; many didn’t.One thing that did not emerge was a determination to tackle many of the deep-seated challenges exposed by the pandemic.These include the fragmented and overstretched state of social care, for example, which was laid bare by the prevalence of deaths in the sector, despiteMatt Hancock’s claim to have thrown a “protective ring”around care home residents.Boris Johnson had alreadypromised to “fix” social care, and after the spotlight was thrown on it by the pandemic, announced a 2p levy on national insurance in 2021, to pump more funding into the sector (and protect families’ inheritances).But the policy was scrapped by Truss, and the Labour government has opted to commission a review, apparently with hopes of constructing a cross-party consensus on the way forward.Chart showing that 7.4 million NHS cases in England were awaiting treatment in January 2025Similarly, the £20 a week uplift in universal credit introduced during the crisis appeared to be an acknowledgment that the usual rate was too little to live on – but it was scrapped in autumn 2021, as Sunak began the work of patching up the public finances.Survey evidence reported in a recentreport from the thinktank Demos, about “social capital” – the connections between individuals that help make economies work better – suggested levels of trust rose during and after the pandemic, as neighbours helped each other out, and thousands of people clapped for the NHS from the doorsteps.But the idea that a new spirit of collectivism had been kindled, that could lead to a remaking of the social contract, in the spirit of the Beveridge report, published in the depths of war in 1942, did not survive the UK’s emergence from lockdown.“None of that really lasted,” says Meadway. “There was all this talk of, ‘the government can do lots of things, and we can think very differently about the welfare state’. And none of it really happened.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsHow Covid changed usTax and spendingBoris JohnsonMatt HancockRishi SunakNHSHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is no vaccine or treatment.Describedby scientistsas a “slow-motion disaster in the making”, the infection’s presence in the wild began quietly, with a few free-ranging deer in Colorado and Wyoming in 1981. However, it has now reached wild and domestic game animal herds in36 US statesas well as parts of Canada, wild and domestic reindeer in Scandinavia and farmed deer and elk in South Korea.In the media, CWD is often called “zombie deer disease” due to its symptoms, which include drooling, emaciation, disorientation, a vacant “staring” gaze and a lack of fear of people. As concerns about spillover to humans or other species grow, however, the moniker has irritated many scientists.“It trivialises what we’re facing,” says epidemiologist Michael Osterholm. “It leaves readers with the false impression that this is nothing more than some strange fictional menace you’d find in the plot of a sci-fi film.Animalsthat get infected with CWD do not come back from the dead. CWD is a deathly serious public and wildlife health issue.”Five years ago, Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, delivered what he hoped would be a wake-up call before the Minnesota legislature, warning about “spillover” of CWD transmission from infected deer to humans eating game meat. Back then, some portrayed him as a scaremonger.A map of the US showing which counties in each state have been affected by CWDToday, as CWD spreads inexorably to more deer and elk, more people – probably tens of thousands each year – are consuming infected venison, and a growing number of scientists are echoing Osterholm’s concerns.In January 2025, researcherspublished a report, Chronic Wasting Disease Spillover Preparedness and Response: Charting an Uncertain Future. A panel of 67 experts who study zoonotic diseases that can move back and forth between humans and animals concluded that spillover to humans “would trigger a national and global crisis” with “far-reaching effects on the food supply, economy, global trade and agriculture”, as well as potentially devastating effects on human health. The report concludes that the US is utterly unprepared to deal with spillover of CWD to people, and that there is no unifying international strategy to prevent CWD’s spread.Wyoming has wilfully chosen to ignore conservationists, scientists, disease experts and prominent wildlife managers who were all saying the same thing: stop the feedingLloyd Dorsey, conservationistSo far, there has not been a documented case of a human contracting CWD, but as with BSE (or mad cow disease) and its variant strain that killed people, long incubation times can mask the presence of disease. CWD, which is incurable, can be diagnosed only after a victim dies. Better surveillance to identify disease in people and game animals is more urgent than ever, experts say. Osterholm says the Trump administration’s proposed cuts to public health funding and research, and the US’swithdrawalfrom international institutions, such as the World Health Organization, could not be happening at a worse time.The risk of a CWD spillover event is growing, the panel of experts say, and the risk is higher in states where big game hunting for the table remains a tradition. In a survey of US residents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,20% saidthey had hunted deer or elk, and more than 60% said they had eaten venison or elk meat.Tens of thousands of people are probably eating contaminated game meat either because they do not think they are at risk or they are unaware of the threat. “Hunters sharing their venison with other families is a widespread practice,” Osterholm says. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people who suspect they have killed an animal infected with CWD not to eat it, and states advise any hunters taking animals from infected regions to get them tested. Many, however, do not.View image in fullscreenA biologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources removes lymph nodes from deer in a hunter’s truck, to test for CWD.Photograph: Scott Takushi/APThe movement of meat around the country also raises concerns of environmental contamination. CWD is not caused by bacteria or a virus, but by “prions”: abnormal, transmissible pathogenic agents that are difficult to destroy. Prions have demonstrated an ability to remain activated in soils for many years, infecting animals that come in contact with contaminated areas where they have been shed via urination, defecation, saliva and decomposition when an animal dies.Analysisby the US Geological Survey has shown that numerous carcasses of hunted animals, many probably contaminated with CWD, are transported across state lines, accelerating the scope of prion dispersal.In states where many thousands of deer and elk carcasses are disposed of, some in landfill, there is concern among epidemiologists and local public health officials that toxic waste sites for prions could be created.Every autumn, Lloyd Dorsey has hunted elk and deer to put meat on the table, but now he is concerned about its safety. “Since CWD is now in elk and deer throughout Greater Yellowstone, the disease is on everybody’s mind,” he says. Dorsey has spent decades as a professional conservationist for the Sierra Club, based in Jackson Hole in Wyoming, and he has pressed the state and federal governments to shut down feedgrounds for deer – where cervids gather and disease can easily spread.View image in fullscreenA sign in Montana warns of CWD in an attempt to prevent its spread via animal carcasses.Photograph: Courtesy of Montana Wildlife Federation“Wyoming has wilfully chosen to ignore conservationists, scientists, disease experts and prominent wildlife managers who were all saying the same thing: stop the feeding,” he says.What’s happening was predictable and we’re living with the consequences of some decisions that were rooted in denialTom Roffe, former US Fish and Wildlife Service chiefApart from the grave concerns about CWD reaching people, scientists describe it as “an existential threat” to wild cervid populations, which are central to American hunting traditions. Nowhere is there more at stake than in the region surrounding the country’s most famous nature preserve, Yellowstone.A new study thattracked 1,000 adult white-tailed deerand fawns in south-west Wisconsin mirrors what research elsewhere suggests: over time infected animals die at rates that outpace natural reproduction, meaning some populations could disappear. No animals have demonstrated immunity to CWD and there is no vaccine.If depopulating herds becomes necessary to reduce disease presence, it could have devastating consequences for people who rely on those animals and who have a connection to them.Studies showthat having healthy wild carnivores on a landscape can help weed out sick CWD-carrying elk and deer, but states in the northern Rockies have adopted policies aimed at dramatically reducingwolves,bearsandmountain lions.View image in fullscreenCWD has been detected in the National Elk Refuge in Yellowstone national park, where thousands of elk gather.Photograph: USFWSOther policies continue to contradict scientific advice. Wyoming has attracted national criticism for refusing to shutter nearly two dozen feedgrounds where tens of thousands of elk and deer gather in close confines every winter and are fed artificial forage to bolster their numbers.One of the largest feedgrounds is operated by the federal government: theNational Elk Refuge, where more than 8,000 elk cluster, and CWD has already been detected. Tom Roffe, former chief of animal health for the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge, and Bruce Smith, a former refuge senior biologist, have said Wyoming has created ripe conditions for an outbreak of the disease, with consequences that will negatively ripple throughout the region.‘Zombie deer disease’ epidemic spreads in Yellowstone as scientists raise fears it may jump to humansRead more“This has been a slowly expanding epidemic with a growth curve playing out on a decades scale, but now we’re seeing the deepening consequences and they could be severe,” Roffe says. “Unfortunately, what’s happening with this disease was predictable and we’re living with the consequences of some decisions that were rooted in denial.”Roffe and others say the best defence is having healthy landscapes where unnatural feeding of wildlife is unnecessary and where predators are not eliminated but allowed to carry out their role of eliminating sick animals.“As Yellowstone has been for generations, it is the most amazing and best place to get wildlife conservation right,” Dorsey says. “It would be such a shame if we continued doing something as foolish as concentrating thousands of elk and deer, making them more vulnerable to catching and spreading this catastrophic disease, when we didn’t have to.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe age of extinctionWildlifeAnimalsInfectious diseasesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today, his ideas influence the very highest levels of governmentByJoshua LeiferThu 20 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 08.57 EDTShareOn the evening of 5 November 1990, Meir Kahane, the extremist American rabbi turned far-right Israeli politician, had just finished speaking at the midtown Manhattan Marriott East Side hotel when a man named El Sayyid Nosair put a bullet through his neck. Two hours after the shooting, Kahane was pronounced dead. Kahane “believed in the ideology that ‘you shall murder,’” said Avraham Burg, then a Labor member of Knesset, “and died at the hands of someone who also believed in that ideology”.From the moment he arrived in Israel in 1971, Kahane preached a shocking mixture of violent, exterminationist ethnonationalism and apocalyptic religious fundamentalism. He claimed that violence was a Jewish value and revenge a divine commandment. He agitated for the expulsion of Palestinians from all the territories under Israel’s control; the party he founded, Kach, was Israel’s first to make the idea its central policy demand. He envisioned “a state of Jewish totality” in which all matters would be decided according to his idiosyncratic interpretation of Jewish law. During his brief tenure as a legislator, he called for banning marriage between Jews and Arabs and criminalising sex between Jews and gentiles. He proposed that insulting Judaism be made illegal and Sabbath observance be made compulsory. He demanded the ethno-religious segregation of the country’s institutions, even its public beaches.Kahane’s political career was marked by failure. Throughout his life he appeared to most Israelis to be a grotesque US import. His relentless demagogic campaign to expel the Palestinians won him notoriety and a small cadre of fanatical followers. Yet he never enjoyed the mainstream acceptance that he believed he had been promised by providence. Since childhood he had dreamed of becoming Israel’s prime minister. Instead he became the leader of a movement shunned across the political spectrum. In his multiple attempts to enter the Knesset, he succeeded only once, in 1984, before Kach was barred from electoral politics. At the time he was assassinated, his movement was on the verge of collapse, starved for funds, beset by infighting and hounded by authorities in the US. Kahane and Kahanism, the ideology to which he gave his name, seemed destined for historical obscurity.But Kahanism did not die. It survived – not in its fully fledged theocratic form, but as an ultranationalist vision of a land and body politic purged of a non-Jewish presence. The germ of Kahanism persisted because the conditions that produced it did not go away. To the contrary, they grew more dire. Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza became ever more entrenched, its maintenance more brutal and deadly. In the 1970s and 80s, Kahane had drawn much of his support from the disfranchised, predominantly Mizrahi working class and portrayed his movement as a populist revolt against Israel’s secular, progressive Ashkenazi elite. In the 21st century, as the uneven gains of capitalist globalisation and the country’s hi-tech boom deepened inequality, Kahanism reemerged to provide the grammar for a reinvigorated rightwing class war. In the wake of the suicide bombings of the second intifada, Kahanism was also buoyed up by an increasingly widespread radical pessimism: that Israel is doomed to war, that this war is zero sum, and that it can end only through a total, eschatological victory – that ultimately, as Kahane was fond of saying: “It is either they or we.”For more than 30 years, Israel’s political system maintained a cordon sanitaire that largely succeeded in excluding Kahanist parties from mainstream politics and parliament. But in the late 2010s, this cordon sanitaire fell. Against the backdrop of successive wars in Gaza, veteran Kahanist militants with thick criminal rap sheets began to appear on primetime television. Ideas that were once taboo became commonplace. Vulgar anti-Arab racism became an easy way to generate attention on TV and social media. Support for the expulsion of Palestinians ceased to be a fringe proposal and became a routine part of political debate. By 2022, thanks to the intervention of the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, parties that had until recently been deemed too dangerous to participate in elections now formed part of the coalition government. Itamar Ben-Gvir, a lifelong Kahanist agitator and convicted criminal, became national security minister, responsible for overseeing the police.Since 7 October 2023, Kahanism has become mainstream. It is the political style that relishes the dehumanisation of Palestinians. It is the ethos according to which Jewish lives are seen as more valuable than all others. It is the ideology behind the normalisation of population transfer and ethnic cleansing. Netanyahu’s Likud has undergone a process of near total Kahanisation, to say nothing of the settler right.In a January 2025 op-ed for the liberal daily Haaretz,the veteran Israeli journalist Gideon Levy described what had ensued since 7 October as the country’sfirst Kahanist war. “Almost everything about it was meant to appease the fascist, racist, population-transferist far right,” Levy wrote. “The spirit of Kahanism seized control over its goals and content.” Indeed, over the past year and a half it has often seemed as if Kahane’s malignant, vengeful ghost had been suddenly reanimated, manifest in the chorus calling to wipe Gaza off the map; in the images of grinning troops standing over white-hooded detainees, kneeling, hands zip-tied behind their backs; in the videos of uniformed men dancing with flags and Torah scrolls in the cratered landscape of the strip; in the line “Kahane was right” graffitied above scorched doorways.Thirty years ago, Kahane was the name of a man who most thought would be forgotten. Today, Kahanism is the governing coalition’s operational ideology.Without America, there would be no Kahanism. As a young man, Meir Kahane metabolised the contradictory currents, anxieties and obsessions of postwar American Jewish life into a toxic, volatile brew. His father, Charles, was a rabbi from a long line of Hassidic rabbis. He led a modern Orthodox congregation in Brooklyn and translated the Torah into an accessible English prose that he thought his flock, relatively ignorant of the tradition, would be able to read.Charles was also a political man. In the 1930s he became an important fundraiser for the Irgun, the underground Zionist paramilitary organisation, and helped the group acquire weapons for its terrorist activities in British Mandate Palestine. Meir grew up in a house where rightwing Zionist leaders were frequent guests at the Shabbat dinner table. On one occasion, Vladimir Jabotinsky, leader of the Revisionist Zionist movement, visited the Kahane family home in the Brooklyn neighbourhood of Flatbush. Rivals to David Ben-Gurion’s Labor Zionists, Jabotinsky’s Revisionists rejected socialism in favour of a martial nationalism that drew inspiration from Mussolini’s fascists in Italy and Piłsudski’s Sanacja movement in Poland.Meir Kahane spent much of his teenage years in the Revisionist youth movement Betar, and the Jabotinskyite cult of force would remain a core part of his worldview throughout his life. But his megalomania and fanaticism made him, even at a relatively early age, restless. After losing a leadership contest, he left the doctrinally secular Betar for Bnei Akiva, the Orthodox religious Zionist youth movement, and enrolled in the Mir Yeshiva, the flagship institution of “Lithuanian” ultra-Orthodoxy – a stricter environment than the milieu in which he was raised – from which he would receive rabbinic ordination. A peculiar product of the 20th century, Kahane managed to incarnate in his person the major ideological tendencies – Revisionist ultranationalism, religious Zionist messianism and ultra-Orthodox fundamentalism – that would come to dominate Israeli political life in the 21st century.View image in fullscreenKahane in New York in 1970.Photograph: New York Daily News Archive/Getty ImagesThe same amalgam of opportunism and zealotry propelled Kahane through America’s far right and New York City’s underworld. The particulars of his bizarre trajectory nearly outstrip the imagination. In the early 1960s, he infiltrated the conspiratorial anti-communistJohn Birch Societyand informed on the organisation to the FBI. (Kahane disliked the group because of its antisemitic tendencies.) He co-founded the July Fourth Movement to drum up support for the Vietnam war on college campuses and published a book titled The Jewish Stake in Vietnam. During this time Kahane was living a double life, secretly posing as a gentile under the pseudonym Michael King. A fire-and-brimstone Orthodox rabbi in public, Kahane was a swindler and womaniser in private. Estelle Evans, a non-Jewish woman he abandoned two days before they were supposed to get married, took her own life soon after. Kahane could deliver a sermon clutching a Talmud tractate one day and shake the hand of an Italianmafia bossthe next.In 1968, Kahane and a group of likeminded reactionaries founded the Jewish Defense League (JDL) as a vigilante organisation that claimed to combat rising Black antisemitism in New York’s outer boroughs. Kahane asserted that within Black-Jewish tensions there existed a potential for another Shoah, and that only Jewish force of arms could ward it off. The JDL’s twinned slogans were “Never again” and “Every Jew a .22”. Yet more than its anti-Black agitation, it was the JDL’s anti-Arab and, in particular, its anti-Soviet activities that brought Kahane fame. And if there was anything he liked more than violence, it was fame.Kahane was not the leader of the Soviet Jewry movement, which aimed to force the Soviet Union to allow its several million Jews the freedom to emigrate, but JDL members were at the movement’s militant vanguard. Approvingly dubbedchayas, or wild animals, by Kahane, they carried out acts of vandalism, shootings and bombings against Soviet political and cultural institutions in the US. At its height, the JDL’s campaign of terrorism even threatened to derail President Richard Nixon’s efforts at detente with the Soviet Union.In 1972, the JDL bombed the offices of Sol Hurok, a Jewish impresario for many Russian cultural acts, including the Bolshoi ballet. The attack sent Hurok to the hospital and killed Iris Kones, his 27-year-old Jewish secretary. It also put the JDL’s members in the federal authorities’ crosshairs. By then Kahane had departed for Israel, reportedly on the heels of an FBI warning that another felony conviction would land him in prison. As with many of his decisions, his move to Israel was motivated as much by self-interest as ideology.It took Kahane time to adjust to his new home. At first his US preoccupations largely dictated his politics. He initially targeted the small sect of Black Hebrew Israelites and Christian missionaries proselytising to Israeli Jews. Yet he came to realise that in Israel, anti-Arab sentiment could mobilise far greater numbers than any of his other obsessions. From his shoebox office in Jerusalem, which Kahane called the Museum of the Potential Holocaust, he warned that Israel faced an existential threat posed by the Soviet-backed Arab armies, which could amass at any moment on its borders, and by the Palestinians living in the territories under its control. He began to describe Israel’s struggle for survival in the language of race war.Kahane’s transplanting of the US psychopolitics of race on to the conflict with the Palestinians made him something of a pioneer in bigotry and incitement. Israeli society was no stranger to racism, but Kahane made subtext into text, then text into melodrama. “I say what you think,” he relished saying. He led his followers on hate marches through Palestinian-majority cities and towns and East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, where they attacked storefronts and threatened people, brandishing their yellow flags, chanting: “Death to Arabs.” His successors have continued this practice today, only under different coloured banners.As Kahane’s movement crystallised through the 1970s, its central demand became the call for the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians from both Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza. “They must go” became a catchphrase and the title of a book, published in 1980, which Kahane wrote in Israel’s maximum-security Ramle prison for plotting to blow up the Dome of the Rock in the hope of igniting an apocalyptic religious war. (Four years later, in 1984, a group of militant West Bank settlers known as the Jewish Underground were arrested for attempting to do the same.) Kahane made the case for ethnic cleansing as a religious imperative: the presence of non-Jews, he argued, defiled the Holy Land and delayed the redemption. He also framed it as a demographic necessity: without expelling the Palestinians, he insisted, there was no way to guarantee a Jewish majority.The idea of population transfer was not foreign to Zionist thought. Jabotinsky’s Revisionists had at times advocated for it; Ben-Gurion had discussed it with British Mandate authorities. But after Israel’s establishment, which resulted in the expulsion and flight of roughly 700,000 Palestinians – what Palestinians callthe Nakba, or catastrophe – the idea was rarely raised in public. By the 1950s it was no longer considered a viable political position. Kahane shattered this taboo. His view, and particularly the religious language in which he articulated it, was “arguably unprecedented in Zionist history”, writes Shaul Magid, a leading scholar of Judaism, in his recent study of Kahane’s thought, “extending beyond even the most maximalist Revisionists”.Kahane mounted several electoral campaigns in the 1970s, each of which ended without success. Yet that did not prevent him from building support in the streets. He understood the explosive power of transgression and the disruptive, even revolutionary potential of Israel’s internal social divisions. While Kahane was seen by the Israeli establishment as a malign and foreign transplant – with his American-accented Hebrew and barely concealed stutter – he found that being an outsider was a political asset as the leader of what was Israel’s first far-right protest movement. When he travelled to Israel’s poor peripheral towns and cities, he cast himself as the tribune of Israel’s forgotten man: the Mizrahi working-class, the Russian-speaking immigrants, the impoverished ultra-Orthodox. At countless rallies, and with his tireless, demonic charisma, Kahane amplified a narrative – then only in its infancy but now a widely accepted structure of grievance – that Israel’s secular Ashkenazi elite had betrayed not only the country’s authentic Jews to appease the Arabs but, even worse, Judaism itself.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Kach outside the Damascus gate in Jerusalem in 2023.Photograph: Eyal Warshavsky/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesThis internal Jewish stab-in-the-back myth was just one part of what Israeli scholars Adam and Gedaliah Afterman have called Kahane’s “radical theology of revenge”. For Kahane revenge – in Hebrewnekama– was at once a comprehensive worldview, a slogan, a strategy and a religious obligation. “Jewish violence in defence of Jewish interests is never wrong,” he declared. Decades before the radical hilltop youth settlers began putting the idea into practice through their “price tag” attacks on Palestinian farmers and towns, Kahane proclaimed: “There is one solution to Arab terror – Jewish counter-terror.” Over time, “Terrorneged[against] terror” or “TNT” would become another of the movement’s catchphrases.In the 1984 elections, Kahane made his breakthrough. His Kach party won 25,907 votes, or 1.2% of all ballots cast – enough for a single Knesset seat, his own. “It is a disgrace to the Jewish people,” Israel’s then president, Chaim Herzog,said in responseto Kahane’s election, “that a person could rise in the Jewish state and present a programme that is very similar to the Nuremberg laws.” Although it had won far from an overwhelming mandate, Kach’s entrance into parliamentary politics shocked Israeli society because of what it appeared to mean, and what it might foretell.Yet Kahanism had not emerged from out of nowhere but from within the precincts of the Revisionist right. When he was merely a US rabble-rouser and anti-Soviet activist in New York, the then prime minister, Menachem Begin, and Yitzhak Shamir, who succeeded Begin as Likud leader, had encouraged his activities. Begin once asked Kahane to write an introduction to the US edition of his wartime memoir of the Irgun and even offered Kahane a seat on the rightwing Revisionist Herut party’s list. Kahane refused both. In another world, he might have lived out his career as a strident Likud backbencher. But driven by a messiah complex, Kahane was never content to be a supporting act. He wanted to be the main show.In 1985, a group of leading Israeli intellectuals headed by Aviezer Ravitzky, a leftwing religious philosopher, convened a study group under the auspices of Israel’s president to assess the seriousness of the threat Kahane posed and suggest how the state should respond. The group would later publish the record of its meeting in a pamphlet titled The Roots of Kahanism: Consciousness and Political Reality. Today it makes for a sobering and frighteningly prescient read. Giving the session’s prefatory remarks, Yehuda Bauer, the celebrated historian of the Holocaust, expressed the fear that gave the initiative its urgency – “that Kahanism can well, heaven forbid, turn out to be the tip of a very large iceberg threatening our society”.As Ravitzky saw it, Kahanism was unlike any of the other extremist ideologies that had taken root in Israel. It was far more dangerous. The religious Zionist settler movement’s official commitment to Jewish unity had limited the risk of intra-Jewish violence, Ravitzky observed, while the ultra-Orthodox tendency to political quietism meant that its representatives had made no active attempt to transform Israel into a theocracy or bring about its vision for the end of days. By contrast, with Kahanism, Ravitzky warned, “all restraints have been removed.” Here was a charismatic demagogue who openly proposed both a final “redemptive” genocide of the Palestinians and a Jewish civil war – a purgation of heretics, humanists, leftists and Arab sympathisers.In response, Yehoshafat Harkabi, a former IDF intelligence chief, argued that Kahanism was a phenomenon that grew out of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. It could not have gained adherents without it. For, in his own maniacal way, Kahane was saying something that no Israeli leader on either the left or the right was prepared to admit: that Israel could not maintain control over millions of Palestinians in the occupied territories without sacrificing its Jewish demographic majority, to say nothing of its democratic character. Kahane himself liked to say, in a mocking pantomime of humanism, that no self-respecting Arab would ever consent to live under Israeli subjugation indefinitely. For Israeli territorial maximalists, unwilling to accept partition of the land, this left one option: ethnic cleansing. “Hence,” Harkabi said presciently, “the Kahanists say: ‘If we annex, we must expel.’”Another member of the study group was Avraham Burg, at the time a young peace activist who had faced down Kahanist thugs at demonstrations. “Throughout Jewish history there has been a struggle against the zealots,” Burg told me when we spoke last summer. “It is a deep-rooted paradigm that rational Judaism has tried to suppress.” Burg, who went on to become speaker of the Knesset, made a version of the same argument to his colleagues back in 1985. “Rabbi Kahane is part of us,” he told the other members of the study group. “He did not emerge all by himself; he emerged from among us, from all who call themselves Zionists, and so the blame is ours.” But whereas his interlocutors made the case for placing Kahane and his movement outside the law, Burg argued that it was safer to fight the extremists in the court of public opinion. “I prefer to have them,” Burg told me, “where they can be seen.”The Knesset decided otherwise. In 1985, Israel’s parliament passed a bill that amended the country’s basic law to bar any party or politician that supports violent terrorism against the state, incites racism or rejects “the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state”. That same year Kahane told a pair of French journalists: “Democracy and Judaism are two opposite things.”With Kach in the Knesset, the established parties swiftly attempted to build a cordon sanitaire around him. During these years, there was much talk in Israel of the need to insulate the democratic system from forces that would exploit its freedoms to subvert it. Israel’s education ministry launched an initiative to inculcate democratic values in the country’s schoolchildren. The army embarked on an endeavour to combat Kahanist sympathies among the rank and file, rolling out a programme to teach new conscripts courses on “the virtues of democracy”. Parties on the left, right and centre worked together to block discussion of Kahane’s proposals and prevent him from taking the podium. When he did rise to speak, members of Knesset, including the ultra-hawkish Likud leader Shamir exited the chamber. Israeli public radio refused to broadcast Kahane’s speeches. The police routinely blocked him from exploiting his parliamentary immunity to instigate violence against Palestinians, leading him to decry Israel’s courts, police and other gatekeepers of the rule of law as “the real fascists”.View image in fullscreenA supporter of the Kach movement wears a T-shirt that reads: ‘Kahane was right’.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/the ObserverSuch measures reflected the immune response of a comparatively healthier Israeli political system. Of course, this anti-Kahane project would not have been so thoroughgoing had it not also been politically convenient. It was not lost on Shamir that Kahane appealed in both substance and style to much of the Likud base. In anarticleabout the 1984 elections for the New York Review of Books, journalist Bernard Avishai asked whether Kahane was simply “carrying to its logical extreme what had become the conventional wisdom under Begin”. But this also meant that Israeli leaders, even or especially those on the right, feared that Kahanism was a kind of virus that fed on the darkest fears in the Israeli collective consciousness and which, if left unchallenged, would ultimately devour its host.As a functional matter, the amendment to Israel’s basic law worked. Kach was banned from running in the 1988 elections and the supreme court rejected Kahane’s appeal. He never recovered from this setback, growing even more radical in response. In what might be called his mature philosophy, Kahane rejected Israel’s system of rule outright. “Kahane’s Zionism,” Magid wrote, became “a battle against the state”. Not only were secular Jews not really Jews, he argued, but Israel was not a Jewish state at all. “It’s a Hebrew-speaking Portugal that would like to be a Hebrew-speaking Sweden,” Kahane wrote. To make Israel into a true Jewish state, he proposed replacing parliament with a Torah-mandated king and Sanhedrin, or supreme rabbinic court, which would rule the country according to the strict interpretation of Jewish law.Towards the end of his life, Kahane joined a doomed far-right separatist movement to establish an “Independent State of Judea” in the occupied West Bank. He was elected the state’s “honorary president”. The project found little support. At the time of his assassination, Kahane and his movement appeared to be on the inexorable descent into obscurity.In the 1990s, as Israel inched toward territorial compromise with the Palestinians, Kahane’s movement assumed the mantle of violent opposition to a peace deal. In the years after his death, Kahane’s remaining disciples, marginalised and ridiculed by Israel’s mainstream, retreated to the ultra-radical settlement of Kiryat Arba, near the Palestinian city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank, and to Kfar Tapuach, the northern West Bank settlement where a small group of Kach supporters led by Kahane’s son, Binyamin Ze’ev Kahane, briefly made their home. From these strongholds, the Kahanist fringe set out to derail the peace process, and by extension change the course of Israel’s history.As practitioners of political violence, the Kahanists proved devastatingly effective. On 25 February 1994, Baruch Goldstein, a Brooklyn-born doctor and Kach member from Kiryat Arba, entered Hebron’s Ibrahimi mosque and opened fire on Muslim worshippers, killing 29 Palestinians. Two months later, the Palestinian Islamist groupHamas launched its first suicide bombingin the northern Israeli city of Afula as an act of retribution.Goldstein’s massacre prompted Rabin’s government to finally outlaw Kach and the Kahane Chai movement, a splinter outfit led by Binyamin Kahane, designating both “terrorist organisations”. In a speech after Goldstein’s massacre, Rabin described Kahane and his supporters as “an errant weed”. He proved to be tragically wrong.The same morning as Goldstein’s massacre, Yigal Amir, a 25-year-old law student, was learning Talmud in the Bar-Ilan University study hall when he heard the news on the radio. “I was very intrigued by how a man like that could get up and sacrifice his life,” Amirwould later tellIsraeli investigators. “That’s when I had the idea that it’s necessary to take Rabin down.” On 4 November 1995, Amir fired two shots at the prime minister as he left a peace rally in central Tel Aviv. Rabin was pronounced dead later that night.In the following two decades, Kahane’s disciples would carry out other devastating acts of terrorism. Yet as the extreme right blossomed through the early 2000s, fuelled by the shattering violence of the second intifada, they would not act alone. In the aftermath of Israel’s 2005 unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, a new generation of religious Zionist settlers also grew more radical. Whereas their parents’ generation had sought to harness the state to entrench Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, this younger generation turned against the state, viewing the Gaza “disengagement” as an unforgivable betrayal. And while the mainstream religious Zionist movement had traditionally endorsed the use of violence as a means to an end, the newly radicalised settlers embraced terror as a value, much like the Kahanists whom they far outnumbered, and turned their violence not only against Palestinians but also against Jews.View image in fullscreenHebron residents show graffiti reading ‘Death to Arabs’ after their house was attacked by settlersPhotograph: Idealink Photography/AlamyThey became known as thehilltop youth. Identifiable by their long, unkempt sidelocks and fraying, oversized skullcaps, the hilltop youth set out to build outposts – illegal under Israeli as well as international law – in the occupied West Bank. As part of their land grabs, they have terrorised Palestinians in the areas where they invaded, stolen their sheep, vandalised their homes, torched their crops and attacked them physically. (Since 7 October, hilltop youth attacks have become far more brazen and more deadly.) They have little use for doctrine, Kahane’s or others’. The entire ethos of the hilltop youth is a revolt against authority – or rather “they resist all authority that is not Torah,” said Idan Yaron, an Israeli anthropologist who studies the far right. Yaron has likened the hilltop youth to other forms of “leaderless resistance” that operate through networked cells, and to Al-Qaida.To the extent that there is an ideologue articulating a political theology for the hilltop youth, it isMeir Ettinger, a gaunt scraggly-bearded 33-year-old. Since his 20s, Ettinger has been among the Shin Bet’s most wanted Jewish Israeli targets. In the early 2010s, he authored a polemic in which he outlined a programme titled The Revolt. In it, he called for settler militants to ignite an epochal, violent conflagration between Jews and Arabs, with the aim of imploding the Israeli state, replacing it with a halakhic kingdom, building the Third Temple in Jerusalem, and expelling or killing any non-Jew left in the Land of Israel. Although he arrived at these deranged fantasies on his own, he was, in a way, also following family tradition:Ettinger also happens to be one of Meir Kahane’s 37 grandchildren.For a long time, the very extremism that made Kahanism so dangerous also prevented it from regaining a foothold in parliamentary politics. But as the Israeli public lurched rightward and Netanyahu transformed his Likud into a bastion of authoritarian, rightwing populism, Kahanist ideas became increasingly normalised. The cordon sanitaire established in the 1980s started to fail. “One of the most fateful decisions was giving permission to let the Kahanists run in the first place,” Yaron told me. While Israel’s high court barred Benzi Gopstein and Baruch Marzel – a Boston-born Kahanist disciple – from running for the Knesset in 2019, the court gave the green-light to Itamar Ben-Gvir and the rest of the Jewish Power list. “It was a mistake of the highest degree,” Yaron added. “A sin that cannot be atoned for.” That year, to shore up his potential coalition, Netanyahu tore up what remained of the cordon sanitaire by signing a vote-sharing agreement with Jewish Power.In the five national elections between 2019 and 2022, Jewish Power failed to garner enough votes to enter the Knesset, repeatedly denying Netanyahu the seats he needed to form a rightwing majority government. In 2022, to solve this problem, Netanyahu cajoled Ben-Gvir, leader of Jewish Power, and Bezalel Smotrich, leader of the hardline settler Religious Zionism party, into forming a “technical bloc”, which enabled the parties to run jointly in the election before splitting once in the Knesset. The move paid off. In theNovember elections, the joint Jewish Power-Religious Zionism slate won a combined 14 seats, making it the Knesset’s third largest faction.Unlike many of Kahane’s latter-day admirers, Ben-Gvir actually appears to have read part of the rabbi’s voluminous oeuvre. Kahane’s books sit prominently on glass-case bookshelves in the Ben-Gvir home, above volumes of the Talmud and Torah commentaries. A resident of the Kahanist bastion in Kiryat Arba, Ben-Gvir hung a portrait of the mass murderer Baruch Goldstein on the wall of his living room for years. The Yeshiva of the Jewish Idea, the seminary Kahane established on the border of East Jerusalem, counts Ben-Gvir among its most illustrious alumni.While Ben-Gvir has not abandoned Kahane’s anti-Arab vitriol or the motifs of rightwing class war, he has endeavoured to expand Kahanism’s appeal. In contrast to the American Kahane, Ben-Gvir is the native-born son of immigrants from Iraqi Kurdistan and speaks of loving “all the Jewish people”. On social media he presents himself as a dishevelled, avuncular yet principled figure. Once a vociferous homophobe, by the time of the 2015 election campaign he was telling journalists: “LGBT people are my brothers, and if I have a gay son, I’ll hug him and kiss him because he’s my son.” Ahead of the 2020 elections, Ben-Gvir acquiesced to removing the portrait of Goldstein from his home. During the 2022 election campaign, Ben-Gvir diligently chided his supporters when they broke into their favourite “death to Arabs” chant. “It’s death toterrorists,” he’d correct them, smiling.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu and Itamar Ben-Gvir at the Knesset in 2023.Photograph: Ohad Zwigenberg/APBeneath these cosmetic changes, Ben-Gvir has remained faithful to the central plank of the Kahanist political project: the annexation of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, and the expulsion of the Palestinians living there. He has shown less overt enthusiasm for the other parts of the Kahanist tradition, such as overthrowing the secular state and its replacement by a theocratic one. If Kahane believed that the eschatological rupture could be instigated here and now through violence, Ben-Gvir is focused on accruing power and popularity.In the weeks and months that followed 7 October, while much of Israel sat in mourning, the far right – Kahanists and hardline settlers alike – looked out on to the destruction with a sense of eager anticipation. They sensed opportunity. In the Kahanist cosmology, a prerequisite for the dawn of the Messianic age is an apocalyptic war that purifies the Land of Israel from the presence of non-Jews. Orit Strock, a member of Knesset for the Religious Zionism party, remarked in July 2024 that the days of war were like “a period of miracles”. The far right’s hope that this war might lead to the divinely ordained conquest of all Greater Israel – and perhaps to the war to end all wars – is one of the reasons it has continued for so long.With the far right in unprecedented positions of power, the possibility that it might achieve such devastating goals has also loomed since the start of the war. In mid-October 2023, Israel’s intelligence ministryprepared a white paperthat recommended expelling Gaza’s population into the Sinai desert. AfterDonald Trump, in February 2025, announced his own planto displace Gaza’s 2 million residents, Netanyahu’s government transformed the Kahanist obsession of “transfer” into official policy. The defence minister, Israel Katz, ordered the army to prepare for its implementation. CBS News reported that the Trump administration and Israel have approached the governments ofSudan and Somaliaas potential destinations for Palestinians expelled from Gaza. Deep within the ranks of Israel’s right, even more lurid, violent fantasies have begun to bloom. Nissim Vaturi, a Likud member of Knesset, said in arecent radio interviewthat Israeli troops should “separate the women and children and kill the adult men in Gaza”, adding: “We are being too considerate.”What is the real Hamas?Read moreOn a dark Thursday night in late December, I attended an event organised by a group of radical rightwing settlers preparing, as they saw it, to return imminently to resettle Gaza. There, in the car park of the Sderot train station, near the Gaza border, a mob of yeshiva students waved flags that read “Gaza is ours for ever” and paraded across the pavement singing Zochreini Na, a shlock-rock song written by the Kahanist musician Dov Shurin that has become an anthem of Israel’s extreme right. The song’s lyrics come from a verse in the Book of Judges that relates how the biblical hero Samson, before he dies, prays to God: “Remember me. Please strengthen me this time to take revenge on the Philistines.” In the common Kahanist rendition, “Palestinians” replaces “Philistines”.The settler youth belted those words with zeal, yet it seemed that in their fervour they had forgotten, or perhaps suppressed, how the story in Judges ends. Samson, the hero, pulls down the walls of the Temple of Dagon on to the Philistines gathered to offer a sacrifice – and on to himself. Although through his death he kills “more than he slew in his life”, Samson’s act is a suicide.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His wife, who is eight months pregnant, said her husband was not told why he was being detained and that officers assumed he was on a visa – but actually he has a green card, allowing him to stay in the US and protecting his constitutional rights.Khalil says his detention is part of a crackdown on dissent – and to deter others from protesting. During pro-Palestine protests on the Columbia campus last year he acted as a mediator between the university and the demonstrators, and, unlike many students, left his face uncovered. ThenDonald Trumpwas elected US president and promised to clamp down on student protests.Prof Joseph Howley, who knows Khalil, says he is “conspicuously committed to non-violent resolution of conflict, conspicuously committed to an inclusive vision of liberation and peace”. He tellsMichael Safiwhy the implications of the government’s efforts to detain and deport Khalil are “incredibly chilling”.Chris McGreal, who writes for Guardian US, explains the background to the case and whether free speech and the right to protest are safe in Trump’s America.Photograph: Ted Shaffrey/APExplore more on these topicsProtestToday in FocusTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warUS universities"

She is the first African to become IOC president and becomes the most powerful woman in global sport.But it was a crushing day for Coe, who could only secure eight votes, putting him third behind the Spaniard Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr with 28.So who is Kirsty Coventry, who now has global sport’s most powerful job? | Sean IngleRead moreCoventry’s victory came despite a manifesto that was widely seen as bland, and a campaign that started slowly. However, in the final few days before the secret ballot, strong lobbying from outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach and other senior IOC members proved to be crucial in tipping support her way.Suddenly a contest that had been fought over in the shadows for months was all over in just two minutes: the time it took for the IOC’s quixotic membership of royals, former athletes, politicians and billionaires to throw their weight overwhelmingly behind the seven-time Olympic medallist.It took a while for Bach to confirm the result – and the electronic voting machine of Afghanistan IOC member Samira Asghari appeared not to function. But when it was finally announced Coventry, who won seven Olympic medals in swimming including gold in the 200 metre backstroke at the 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing Games, was full of smiles.“The young girl who first started swimming inZimbabweall those years ago could never have dreamt of this moment,” she said. “I am particularly proud to be the first female IOC president, and also the first from Africa. I hope that this vote will be an inspiration to many people.“Glass ceilings have been shattered today, and I am fully aware of my responsibilities as a role model. I will make all of you very, very proud and hopefully extremely confident in the decision you have taken. Now we have got some work together.”Beforehand Coe was widely accepted to have the best CV, having won two Olympic gold medals, run the London 2012 Games and having beenWorld Athleticspresident since 2015.He had hoped to get votes by positioning himself as the change candidate, who would make the IOC more democratic and also protect women’s sport.However, his strategy to get the backing of a majority of former athletes before winning a majority in the later rounds when other candidates dropped out was blown away.“It’s very early to start poring over the numbers, but I think it’s pretty clear that the athletes, and in particular the female members, voted for her in very big numbers in the first round,” Coe admitted. “Clearly it’s a disappointing result, but that’s what happens when you go into an election.”Not all candidates were as downbeat. Japan’s candidate Morinari Watanabe, the president of international gymnastics who came fourth with four votes, summed up his efforts succinctly afterwards. “Eight years gone in two minutes,” he said, smiling as he clapped his hands.Coe’s chances were certainly hindered by becoming an implacable enemy ofBachwhen World Athletics banned all Russian athletes from the Rio 2016 Olympics for state sponsored doping.But the stark reality is that there was probably little any candidate could have done given Bach’s power and influence over the organisation he has run since 2013, during which time he has appointed more than two-thirds of the electorate.The 71-year-old German, who was voted in as honorary president on Wednesday, will continue to wield significant influence even if he denied having a direct involvement in Coventry’s victory afterwards. “There is a good democratic rule, when you don’t win,” he said. “Don’t blame the voters and don’t blame the procedure.”But while many will rejoice at the first woman to lead the IOC, her election victory will be seen as controversial in some quarters.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe addresses the media as he reacts after the results.Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty ImagesPart of that is because Coventry is the sports minister of a Zimbabwean government that is subject to sanctions from Britain, which are “aimed at encouraging the Government of Zimbabwe to respect democratic principles and institutions and the rule of law”.Human Rights Watch’s assessment of Zimbabwe reads: “In August 2023, President Emerson Mnangagwa was reelected in an election characterized by repression of civil and political rights. Southern African Development Community observers and others found that the election failed to meet regional and international standards for free and fair elections.“Following the elections, abductions, arbitrary detention and torture of parliament members, opposition political activists, and human rights defenders escalated. Since then, the government has repeatedly targeted opposition members and activists, holding them in prolonged detention, mistreating them in custody, and weaponizing the judicial system against rights defenders.”Coventry also received US$100,000 (about £55,000 at the time) in cash from Zimbabwe’s former president, Robert Mugabe, upon her return from the Beijing Games in 2008.But for now Coventry, who will take over when Bach formally leaves office on June 23, having reached the maximum 12 years in office, is only looking forward.“Sport has an unmatched power to unite, inspire and create opportunities for all, and I am committed to making sure we harness that power to its fullest,” she said in her victory speech. “The future of the Olympic movement is bright, and I can’t wait to get started.”Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeSport politicsOlympic GamesWinter OlympicsUS sportsAustralia sportZimbabwenewsShareReuse this content"

An officer separately told Agence France-Presse its forces were about 20 miles (30km) away in the town of Mubi.Walikale, in North Kivu province, is the farthest west that M23 has reached during itslightning advance that started in January.The town has large deposits of tin and many significant goldmines. Tin is widely used as a protective coating for other metals and in industries including food packaging and electronics.In taking control of Walikale, the rebels also seized a road linking four provinces in the east of the country, cutting off the army’s positions. It also puts them within 250 miles of Kisangani, the country’s fourth-largest city.mapGunfire rang out from near Nyabangi neighbourhood on Wednesday, according to Janvier Kabutwa, who lives in Walikale. An army source said the rebels were battling soldiers and pro-government militias after overrunning an army position outside the town in a surprise attack.“The information is confirmed. The rebels are visible at the monument and at the Bakusu group office,” said Prince Kihangi, a former provincial official for Walikale, referring to locations in the town centre.Heavy artillery fire was heard throughout Wednesday but stopped in the evening, giving way to sporadic gunfire, said Fiston Misona, a civil society activist in Walikale. “Our Congolese army is no longer fighting,” he said. “It’s as if we were being sacrificed.”M23 captured Goma, the largest city in North Kivu, in late January. It then started moving south towards Bukavu, the second-largest city in the region.More than 7,000 peoplehave been killedand hundreds of thousandsuprooted from their homessince January in the latest escalation in the conflict, which has lasted for decades and has its roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It is the worst escalation in more than a decade.M23, which is backed byRwanda, is one of dozens of armed groups fighting Congolese forces to make territorial gains in the DRC’s mineral-rich eastern provinces. It says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them from Hutu rebel groups that escaped to the DRC after taking part in the genocide. The DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the region’s mineral resources.The fall of Walikale came a day after DRC’s president, Félix Tshisekedi, and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, met in Qatar for their first direct talks since January and called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.The DRC and M23 had been expected to have their first direct talks on Tuesday in Angola after Tshisekedi’s government went back on its longstanding refusal to speak to the rebels, but M23 pulled out of the talks on Monday, citing EU sanctions against some of its leaders and Rwandan officials.AFP, Reuters andthe Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Privacy concerns, security risks and online harassment remain major barriers … as the digital landscape evolves, those who are not supported to adapt risk being left behind.”Digital gender gap: men 50% more likely to be online in some countries – reportRead moreWhile 92% of those surveyed owned a smartphone, access to the internet was often restricted. The vast majority used platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook, applications often included in cheap mobile packages in many developing countries, but wider internet access is generally much more expensive.Only about a quarter of the women used e-commerce platforms such as Amazon or Alibaba.According to research onglobal digital trendsby the marketing agency We Are Social, 11 of the 20 countries where internet is least affordable are in sub-Saharan Africa.Safety was also a concern for women selling online: 57% said they faced harassment while selling online, 36% did not use their names and 41% did not post photos on their business profiles to maintain their privacy.Many said they feared aggressive negotiating by men, potential violence, unwanted advances and being sent unsolicited explicit pictures.“One growing concern is the recent rollback of user protections by major social media platforms, many of which are critical for women-led businesses. As our report highlights, these platforms are already rife with online abuse, and weaker safeguards will only worsen the problem – further undermining women’s ability to operate safely online,” said O’Connor.According to research by GSMA, which works with mobile operators globally, women in low- and middle-income countriesare 15% less likelyto use mobile internet than men – rising to a third in South Asia and Africa. Closing that gap could earn developing countries $1.3tn (£1tn) in GDP by the end of the decade.The report said developing countries should be investing in mobile data networks to improve connectivity and reduce cost, and technology companies should develop robust measures to protect women from harassment.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSocial mediaDigital mediaWomen's rights and gender equalityMobile phonesAfricaInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Composite: SuppliedUS claims tattoos prove membership of Tren de Aragua gang but relatives describe tributes to God, family and Real MadridByTom PhillipsandClavel RangelThu 20 Mar 2025 19.42 EDTFirst published on Thu 20 Mar 2025 18.54 EDTShareLike many Venezuelans of his generation, Franco José Caraballo Tiapa is a man of many tattoos.There is one of a rose, one of a lion, and another – on the left side of the 26-year-old’s neck – of a razor blade that represents his work as a barber.Two other tattoos pay tribute to Caraballo’s eldest daughter, Shalome: a pocket watch featuring the time of her birth and some black lettering on his chest that spells out the four-year-old’s name.“He’s just a normal kid … he likes tattoos – that’s it,” said Martin Rosenow, a Florida-based attorney who represents the Venezuelan asylum seeker – one ofscores shipped to El Salvador by the Trump administration last weekendas part of his hard-line immigration crackdown.View image in fullscreenTattoos on the body of Franco José Caraballo Tiapa.Caraballo’s fondness for body art may have been his undoing. For when the father of two was detained by US immigration officials in Dallas last month, they appear to have taken those tattoos as proof that he was a member ofVenezuela’s most notorious gang, Tren de Aragua.An official Department of Homeland Security document issued in early February and reviewed by the Guardian states: “[The] subject [Caraballo] has been identified as a Member/Active of Tren de Aragua” although it does not explain how agents reached that conclusion. The same document notes that Caraballo – who it calls a “Deportable/Excludable Alien” – has several tattoos and no known criminal history “at this time”.Rosenow rejected the idea that the images inked on to his client’s skin indicated gang membership. “It’s specious – there’s no basis [for this conclusion],” he said. “Experts in Venezuela who study the gang have all stated that there are no tattoos that associate gang members. It’s not like the Central American MS-13 gang where tattoos are relevant in their organization.”“Tren de Agua has no [specific] tattoos,” Rosenow continued. “If you see pictures [of actual Tren de Aragua members arrested in the US], they’re shirtless and many of them don’t even have tattoos.“I’m nauseated by it all. I’m distressed for these individuals. I’m sad for what this means. As an American, for me it’s disgraceful that we would violate human rights so flagrantly on an international level.”Caraballo, who hails from the Venezuelan state of Bolívar and entered the US over its southern border in October 2023, is one of several Venezuelans whom immigration officials appear to have identified as gang members based on little more than their nationality and their tattoos.Daniel Alberto Lozano CamargoDaniel Alberto Lozano Camargo, a 20-year-old asylum seeker from Maracaibo in western Venezuela, lived in Houston, Texas where he washed cars for a living, advertising his services on Facebook.His partner, a US citizen called Leslie Aranda, said he was arrested last November after being contacted by a supposed client. She has not heard from him since last Friday, when Donald Trump invoked sweeping wartime powers called the Alien Enemies Act to deport people considered a threat, such as members of Tren de Aragua, which was last monthdesignated a foreign terrorist organization.Daniel Alberto Lozano CamargoDaniel Alberto Lozano Camargo.Like other Venezuelans now detained and at risk of deportation, Lozano has several tattoos, said Aranda, 25. He has the name of his partner’s daughter, Danessy, on one arm. A rose. The name of his niece, Eurimar, with a crown over the letter E. Praying hands on his neck. His father’s name, Adalberto, and his initials. Lozano also has the date of his anniversary with Aranda: 19 January 2023. Another tattoo reads “King of Myself.”“I know his father’s name is significant to him because he died when Daniel was young. And I also know he didn’t really like the rose tattoo because a friend who was practising did it. Daniel loves art and tattoos – that’s why he has them,” Aranda said.Lozano’s mother, Daniela, who is also in the US, said: “They violated his human rights – it’s an injustice. He doesn’t belong to any gang.”Neri José Alvarado BorgesThe sister of Neri José Alvarado Borges, another Venezuelan deported toEl Salvador, said the 24-year-old also had tattoos that relatives suspect may have led to him being ​wrongly identified as a criminal.​One says “Family”, another says “Brothers” and a third, on his left thigh, features the name of his younger brother, Neryelson, who is autistic, and the rainbow-colored​ infinity symbol of the autism acceptance movement.Neri José Alvarado BorgesNeri José Alvarado Borges.“None of these tattoos has anything at all to do with the Tren de Aragua,” said his sister, Lisbengerth Montilla, 20. “But for them [immigration authorities] anyone with a tattoo is connected to Tren de Aragua.”Montilla said her brother was no gangster. In fact, he was a psychology​ student who had been forced to abandon his studies and migrate to the US nine months ago because ofVenezuela’s economic collapse.After trekking through the perilous Darién Gap jungle and entering the US, Alvarado, who has no criminal history, built a life in Dallas where he worked in a bakery.“Many of us have come here because of the situation back in our country,” said Montilla, who also lives in the US. “There were times when we didn’t even have food to eat or have the money to buy anything. Many people fled because of the dictatorship in Venezuela, seeking a better future.​“Not all of those people [deported to El Salvador] are criminals – and not all Venezuelans are bad people. We are from a decent, hard-working and upstanding family. We’ve never had problems with anybody.”Luis Carlos José Marcano SilvaView image in fullscreenLuis Carlos José Marcano Silva.Luis Carlos José Marcano Silva, a 26-year-old barber from the Venezuelan island of Margarita, was detained at an immigration hearing in Miami last month. His tattoos also seemingly played a role in his detention and deportation to El Salvador.One, on Marcano’s belly, shows the face of Jesus of Nazareth. Another, on his arm, shows an infinity symbol while a third features the name of his daughter, Adelys. His chest is emblazoned with the image of a crown.“[At the hearing] all they kept telling him was that he belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang. When his wife contacted the lawyer, they said it was probably because of his tattoos,” said Marcano’s mother, Adelys del Valle Silva Ortega, denying that her son has any links to the crime group or even a criminal record.“I feel frustrated, desperate. I imagine they are not treating him well. I’ve already seen videos of that prison,” Silva said of the notorious Salvadoran “anti-terrorism” jail where her son is now thought to be incarcerated. “I think of him every moment, praying to the Virgin of the Valley [a Venezuelan patron saint] to protect him.”Jerce Reyes BarriosThe lawyer for a fifth Venezuelan man deported to El Salvador, a former professional footballer called Jerce Reyes Barrios, 36, has also claimed his tattoos played a role in sealing his fate.Reyes’s tattoos include one of a crown sitting atop a soccer ball with a rosary and the word “Dios” (God). In a sworn declaration, his California-based attorney, Linette Tobin, said the Department of Homeland Security had alleged this tattoo was proof of gang membership.“In reality, he chose this tattoo because it is similar to the logo for his favourite soccer team, Real Madrid,” Tobin said in her statement on Wednesday.Tobin rejected the idea that her client was a gang member and said he had fled Venezuela in early 2024 after being detained at an anti-government demonstration by security forces. Reyes was subsequently “taken to a clandestine building where he was tortured” with electric shocks and suffocation.Tobin saidUS immigrationofficials had reviewed her client’s social media posts and found one in which he made “a hand gesture that they allege is proof of gang membership”.“In fact, the gesture is a common one that means I Love You in sign language and is commonly used as a rock’n’roll symbol,” Tobin said.Francisco Javier García CasiqueSebastián García Casique, the brother of a sixth Venezuelan deported to El Salvador, said his sibling, Francisco Javier García Casique, also had tattoos, including of a rose, a compass and a phrase reading: “God chooses his toughest battles for his best warriors.”Francisco Javier García CasiqueFrancisco Javier García Casique.A fourth tattoo says: “Vivir el momento” (Live in the Moment). A fifth says in English: “Family”.In September 2021 García posted an Instagram video of a tattoo of a timepiece being inked on to his right arm by an artist in Peru, where he then lived. “My tattoo in tribute to my two grandmas who I love and miss a lot,” García wrote.Anyelo Sarabia GonzálezIn a sworn declaration, the sister of Anyelo Sarabia González, Solanyer Michell Sarabia González, said her 19-year-old brother had been detained by immigration agents at the start of this year in Dallas and that those agents had asked “about a tattoo that is visible on his hand” showing a rose with money as its petals.“He had that tattoo done … because he thought it looked cool,” González’s sister said, adding that she believed her brother had been sent to El Salvador “under the false pretence that he was a member of Tren de Aragua”.“The tattoo has no meaning or connection to any gang,” said González, 25. Two other tattoos on her brother’s body – of the phrases “strength and courage” and “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” – were also not gang-related, she said.Franco José Caraballo TiapaRosenow also saw no indication that his client – who he said had sought asylum on the basis of political persecution after taking part in opposition protests – was involved in the Venezuelan gang. He said Caraballo’s “cheesy” and romantic Instagram posts indicated he was not “a vicious gang member”.Franco José Caraballo TiapaFranco José Caraballo TiapaA Venezuelan criminal background check issued earlier this month indicates Caraballo has no criminal record there. Francisco Javier García Casique’s family has also published evidence that he had no criminal record back home.The White House has described the Venezuelans deported to El Salvador as “heinous monsters” and terrorists but has yet to release detailed information about their identities, let alone their alleged crimes.On Thursday afternoon CBS News published an internal governmentlistof the 238 Venezuelan deportees, which included the names of all of the men in this story.On Monday, a senior official from immigration and customs enforcement, Robert Serna, admitted that “many” of those removed from the US under the Alien Enemy Act did not have criminal records in the US, but he nevertheless said they were Tren de Aragua members.The fact that those people did not have a criminal record “is because they have only been in the country for a short period of time”, Serna said.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpVenezuelaEl SalvadornewsShareReuse this content"

But Mexico has fallen behind in its water payments due to drought conditions in the arid north of the country.US farmers and lawmakers complain that the neighboring country has waited until the end of each cycle in the past and has come up short in the latest period.The treaty is very contentious south of the border,where Mexican farmers have been struggling with intense drought in recent years.A year ago the last sugar mill in southern Texas shut down, blaming a lack of water deliveries from Mexico.After 18 months of negotiations, the United States and Mexico reached an agreement in November, days after Trump’s election, to improve deliveries.Hailed then by the Biden administration, the understanding calls for Mexico to work with the United States to deliver water in a more timely way, including earlier in each five-year cycle.Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said on Thursday before the state department announcement that the water issue was “being dealt with” through the two countries’ boundary and water commission.“There’s been less water. That’s part of the problem,” she told reporters.Tijuana, a sprawling city on the border with the US state of California that has become a hub for manufacturing, depends on the Colorado River for about 90% of its water and has suffered waste from creaky infrastructure.The Colorado River, also a major water source for Los Angeles and Las Vegas, has seen itswater levels shrinkdue todroughtand heavy agricultural consumption in the south-western United States, with around half of its water going to raise beef and dairy cattle.In southern Texas, farmers have voiced fear for the future of cotton, citrus and other farming products without more regular water deliveries from across the border in Mexico.Brooke Rollins, the US agriculture secretary, on Wednesday announced $280m in relief funds for Rio Grande valley farmers.“Texas farmers are in crisis because of Mexico’s noncompliance,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas wrote on X, praising the state department’s water decision.“I will work with the Trump administration to pressure Mexico into complying and to get water to Texas farmers.”The water dispute comes as Trump takes a tough approach to Latin American countries, especially on migration.Trump on returning to office has vowed to end arrivals of undocumented migrants, who largely come from Central America and Venezuela but transit through Mexico.Trump deployed troops to the border and announced painful tariffs on Mexico, although he has since put them on hold until 2 April.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyMexicoAmericasWaternewsShareReuse this content"

The Covid-19 pandemic made it abundantly clear that many of us need help from our neighbours and friends.“So maybe people felt a greater sense of obligation and lower levels of inhibition knowing their help would be welcomed.”ChartShe said data in the coming years would help reveal whether the benevolence trend was here to stay. “One perhaps really optimistic possibility is that we’ve now opened our eyes to the needs of other people and the emotional rewards we get from helping other people, and that could fuel this positive spiral between helping others and wellbeing,” she said.The report said researchers were “struck by the longevity of the increases [in benevolence] appearing first in 2020”, and the “size and persistence of the post-Covid increases in benevolent acts” meant that even in 2024, four years after the onset of Covid, they were still 10% higher.The World Happiness Report is an annual barometer of wellbeing across more than 140 nations coordinated by the University of Oxford’s Wellbeing Research Centre, the analytics company Gallup and theUN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.This year’s edition emphasised people’s tendency to be too pessimistic about the kindness of others. A study across 40 countries on how often dropped wallets were returned found the rate was twice as high as people expected – and wallets were more likely to be returned if they contained money.View image in fullscreenThe report’s annual happiness rankings was led by Nordic countries, with Finland coming out first out of 147 ranked nations for the eighth year in a row.Photograph: Andrii Shevchuk/AlamyJohn F Helliwell, an economist at the University of British Columbia and a founding editor of the WorldHappinessReport, said the data from the wallet study “confirms that people are much happier living where they think people care about each other”.Go outside, ditch the phone, get humble: my top 10 Scandi life lessons after a decade in DenmarkRead moreThe report also found that sharing meals with others was strongly linked with positive wellbeing across all global regions, and that those who shared more meals with others reported significantly higher levels of life satisfaction and social support.But dining alone is becoming more prevalent, especially among young people, and in the US there has been a 53% increase in people dining alone since 2003 – one reason why the country has fallen in the happiness rankings.The report’s annual happiness rankings was led by Nordic countries, with Finland coming first out of 147 ranked nations for the eighth year in a row, whileCosta Ricaand Mexico, in sixth and 10th places respectively, entered the top 10 for the first time.View image in fullscreenThe report found that those who share more meals with others reported significantly higher levels of life satisfaction and social support.Photograph: Anna Ivanova/AlamyThe US fell to its lowest-ever position in 24th place, closely following the UK in 23rd place – it’s lowest placing since the 2017 report.Switzerland, Canada and Australia were all pushed out of the top 10, and this years’ rankings mark the first time “none of the large industrial powers ranked in the top 20”.The report concludes: “In general, the western industrial countries are now less happy than they were between 2005 and 2010.” It added that a decline in happiness and social trust inEuropeand the US had partly led to a rise in political polarisation and anti-system votes.Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, the director of Oxford’s Wellbeing Research Centre and an editor of the World Happiness Report, said: “This year’s report pushes us to look beyond traditional determinants like health and wealth.“It turns out that sharing meals and trusting others are even stronger predictors of wellbeing than expected. In this era of social isolation and political polarisation we need to find ways to bring people around the table again – doing so is critical for our individual and collective wellbeing.”Explore more on these topicsHappinessCoronavirusVolunteeringFriendshipHealth & wellbeingFinlandCosta RicanewsShareReuse this content"

It is rich in natural resources, including the world’s largest gold and copper mine as well as extensive reserves of natural gas, minerals and timber.It was part of the Dutch East Indies for a couple of centuries, but in 1963, in controversial circumstances, the territory was handed over to Indonesian control. As a result, say the campaigners, West Papua’s Indigenous Melanesians have not benefited from this wealth. They have been under occupation by Indonesia since 1963, facing repression the ULMWP describes as a “hidden genocide”.West Papuanssay more than 500,000of their people have been killed by the occupation in the past six decades, while millions of acres of their ancestral lands have been destroyed for corporate profit. Indonesia, already the world’s largest palm oil exporter, is now breaking ground in West Papua on the world’s biggest single palm oil plantation, as well as a sugar cane and biofuel plantation that will be the largest deforestation project ever launched.View image in fullscreenBaliem Valley, West Papua.Photograph: Reinhard Dirscherl/AlamyAccording to reports, companies behind the Tanah Merah project plan toestablish palm oil plantations in the country’s eastacross more than 140,000 hectares (346,000 acres) – an area twice the size of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. At the same time, Indonesian authorities haveplans to turn Merauke, in the south, into a 2m-hectare site for the production of 2.6m tons of sugar and 244m litres of bioethanol each year.“West Papuans’, especially the ULMWP, position is very clear: we are a modern-day colony,” said Ap, speaking from the Netherlands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Between September, when it first gained popularity, and December the dolls reportedly generated US$1.6m in sales.However a suggestion that a heart-shaped design on one version of the doll looked like the controversial line that China’s government inserts on world maps to make aterritorial claim over most the South China Seasparked online backlash. An international tribunal in The Hague has ruled China’s territorial claim invalid and it is disputed by countries including Vietnam. Beijing hasrejected the rulingby the Permanent Court of Arbitration.View image in fullscreenLi, who declined to give her full name, at her home in Hanoi holding a Baby Three doll with a marking on its cheek that some say resembles China’s unrecognised ‘nine-dash line’ in the South China Sea.Photograph: Nhac Nguyen/AFP/Getty ImagesIn response to online outcry, Vietnam’s industry and trade ministry ordered an inspection of toys supposedly displaying the line, warned they were “affecting national security and territorial sovereignty”.Retailers have slowed or stopped sales. According to data cited by state media from YouNet ECI, an e-commerce data analysis platform, the average price of Baby Three on Shopee and TikTok Shop halved in the first 10 weeks of 2025.“Almost all children started to boycott [the dolls] because they saw it as a nationalistic issue, thinking that buying Baby Three was unpatriotic,” one vendor told AFP.Ngoc Hang, a retailer in Ho Chi Minh City, told VN Express that her revenues had dropped by half after the government announced the inspections and penalties.“Consumers have called for boycotts, and I had to lower prices by 30-50% to liquidate my stocks.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘nine-dash line’, which has no international standing, on a map showing the South China Sea.Photograph: Nhac Nguyen/AFP/Getty ImagesIn early March the eyewear retailer Anna Eyewear announced it was terminating a branding collaboration with Baby Three over “controversial character drawings”. It said that as a Vietnamese company, it wanted to “bring our customers not only quality products but also good cultural and humanitarian values”.At the same time, a popular e-commerce streamer, Đặng Tiến Hoàng, announced he would stop selling the dolls.“Although the income is good for us, the land and country must be the top priority,” he said, sparking a storm of debate in the comments.Vietnamese authorities take a particularly hard line on depictions of the nine-dash line on products or in pop culture. In 2023the Barbie film was banned from cinemasover a scene in which a crudely drawn toy map appeared to include the line. The same year Netflix was ordered to remove a Chinese series that regularly featured the map. In 2022 the film Uncharted, starring Tom Holland, Mark Walhberg and Antonio Banderas, was banned for featuring the map.Explore more on these topicsChinaVietnamAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The changes broaden the scope of civilian posts that officers can hold, including the attorney general’s office, the state secretariat, the counterterrorism agency and the narcotics agency. It also extends sitting officers’ retirement age.The parliament, which is dominated by Prabowo’s ruling coalition, approved the revised changes in a plenary session on Thursday.Speaker Puan Maharani led the unanimous vote and officially passed the law, saying that it was in accordance with the principle of democracy and human rights.“President Prabowo appears intent on restoring the Indonesian military’s role in civilian affairs, which were long characterised by widespread abuses and impunity,” saidAndreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The government’s rush to adopt these amendments undercuts its expressed commitment to human rights and accountability.”Kennedy Muslim, a political analyst from Indonesian pollster Indikator, said: “We’ve seen this creeping militarisation for quite some time, that’s why civil society is right to be alarmed by this trend. But I think the concern that this is back to the New Order is quite overblown at the moment.”Muslim said that polls show the military consistently ranks high in public trust surveys, but the new law had the potential to erode this.The bill was approved less than two months after the president formally requested an amendment to the legislation. Activists have complained about the expedited lawmaking process, and the secretive nature of deliberations over the bill.Students organisations have said they plan to protest outside the parliament in Jakarta on Thursday, with one student group, describing the law as “democracy killing”.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The current interruptions to tuberculosis services therefore not only halt further progress, but actively undermine progress to date.“Some of the damage will be irreversible.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailEntsch, who is the co-chair of the Australian Tuberculosis Caucus, a bipartisan group of politicians who raise awareness of the disease and its impact, urged Australian diplomats to “show the new US administration that investing in health aligns with their goals of enhancing American safety and prosperity”.Wong said Australia was determined to be a “partner of choice for our neighbours” and stressed this was “fundamental to our region’s prosperity, stability and security”.The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, criticised the Trump administration’s decision to pause foreign aid after an address to the Lowy Institute on Thursday.“I think it is detrimental to the collective interests in the region and I hope that there can be a discussion between our governments about a sensible pathway forward in that regard,” Dutton said.Last year, a Lowy Institute report found China had renewed its efforts to curry favour with Pacific island nations after charting a “resurgence” in Beijing-backed aid and infrastructure funding.“Beijing has emerged from a pandemic-induced lull with a more competitive, politically targeted model of aid engagement,” the thinktank said in the November report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is now the Bail Amendment Act.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAllan hadordered a review into the state’s bail lawsin February amid growing community concern over rising crime.The latest crime statistics, released on Thursday, revealed a13.2% increase in the crime rate– the highest it has been since 2016. Offences committed by children aged between 10 and 17 rose to their highest levels since electronic records began in 1993.Vic crime rateAllan said her bail changes targeted the serious, repeat offenders police have identified as responsible for the increase in offending.“I have listened to victims of crime and Victorians, and I have acted. These are the toughest bail laws in the country – putting community safety above all and delivering consequences for those who break the law,” she said on Friday morning.“These laws send the strongest possible message to offenders – clean your act up or face the consequences.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its place, community safety would become the “overarching principle” when deciding bail for children and adults.It also revives two bail offences – “committing an indictable offence while on bail for indictable offence” and “breaching of condition of bail” – each adding an additional three months of imprisonment to any other sentence imposed.The offences werescrapped in 2023, after advocacy by the family of Veronica Nelson andrecommendations from a coronial inquestinto her 2020 death in custody.Tougher bail tests for serious offences including aggravated burglary, home invasions and knife crime were also included in the bill but their introduction could be delayed by up to three months, due to the need for additional resources to manage the anticipated increase in offenders held on remand.The Human Rights Law Centre, the Federation of Community Legal Services Victoria (FCLSV), Flat Out advocacy service and the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service issued a joint statement after the bill passed, warning that it would lead to more vulnerable individuals being “needlessly” locked up.“The Allan government has today rammed through dangerous and discriminatory bail laws which will deeply harm Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and breach human rights,” it said.The First Nations director at the Human Rights Law Centre, Maggie Munn, said it was “deeply shameful” the Allan government had not learnt from “past policy failures”, and instead “capitulated to the tabloid media to entrench dangerous bail laws that undermine people’s right to liberty”.Louisa Gibbs, the chief executive of the FCLSV, said the state’s legal sector was “united in our position that rewinding bail laws is a costly and dangerous mistake that will cause far more harm than good, without addressing community safety”.Explore more on these topicsCrime - AustraliaVictoriaVictorian politicsJacinta AllannewsShareReuse this content"

He utilised manipulative and emotionally abusive tactics to erase her sense of self.

The department did not say how many koalas had been tested.“We responded to this incursion quickly and will continue to improve our understanding of the most effective interventions,” said Alison Schumacher, the department’s director of threatened species and ecosystems.“We are working closely with our partners to manage this disease and protect this much-loved species.”Saul Deane, the urban sustainability campaigner at the Total Environment Centre, said the positive detections of chlamydia were “a really depressing development”.“It would be devastating if it becomes endemic in the local population because it’s one of only a few in the state where chlamydia is not the main cause of mortality,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aldi has a 9% share, followed by Metcash-supplied supermarkets with 7%.The regulator acknowledged that Coles and Woolworths’ dominance would continue given their entrenched position.The regulator assessed three different profit metrics before concluding that Coles, Woolworths and Aldi “appear to be among the most profitable supermarket businesses globally”.Grocery prices were also found to have risen sharply over the past five years, most of which was attributed to increased business costs.“However, Aldi, Coles and Woolworths have increased their product and [profit] margins during this time, meaning that at least some of the grocery price increases have resulted in additional profits for Aldi, Coles and Woolworths,” the ACCC said.Woolworths says it has more than 40 competitors in Australia – we went looking for themRead moreThe ACCC’s findings are in line with research conducted by Guardian Australia that has consistently shown that the major chains areamong the most profitable in the worldand that they used the inflationary period toexpand profit margins.The country’s major grocery retailers have consistently defended their pricing decisions against price-gouging allegations, and say they are committed to helping Australians with cost-of-living pressures. They say that they have healthy, long-term relationships with the agricultural sector.Reform measuresThe ACCC singled out Coles, Woolworths and Aldi, saying they should be required to provide produce suppliers with detailed information about their supply forecasts as well as greater transparency about the tendering processes used to negotiate price and volumes.The inquiryheard from fruit and vegetable supplierswho said they needed firmer commitments on how much produce supermarkets would buy, to avoid losing money and wasting stock.The regulator said it supports the government’s move to improve the unit pricing code, which sets out the rules for which businesses must display unit prices.The government plans to improve readability and visibility of prices in stores and the comparability of prices between stores, as well as address inconsistent unit measurements.The recommendations included requiring all supermarkets – including small rural stores and remote community stores – to display prices next to products to improve transparency, addressing a common complaint among shoppers at those outlets.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)Cost of living crisisSupermarketsWoolworthsColesRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The American president appears, at leastaccording to Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, to have told Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday that “American ownership” of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants would be their best protection in future – although the Ukrainian presidentsaid on Thursday that “the issue of property, we did not discuss”.Of the four, the most significant, and the one that Trump has repeatedly referred to in the past week, is the vast, six-reactor Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. It is Europe’s biggest nuclear generator, located on the southern bank of the Dnipro River. Before the full-scale Russian invasion it produced about 20% of the country’s electricity but it is now on the frontline of Europe’s largest war since 1945.Such is the nuclear power station’s importance that it was seized byRussiawithin the first month of fighting and has remained on the frontline ever since. Electricity generation was halted in September 2022 – it is simply too dangerous and too many prewar employees had fled. All six reactors have been in cold shutdown (running below boiling point) since April last year.Ukraine’s nuclear power stationsBut, though it is dormant, it is not dead – though until Trump showed interest in it, it appeared that the reactor could be a diplomatic sticking point between Russia andUkrainewithout any American involvement. Russia’s goal has been to reconnect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Russian electricity grid, but restarting it is impossible during wartime because of all the work required.The destruction of theNova Kakhova damin June 2023 has gradually led to the loss of available water, necessary if the reactor were to be restarted. “There is not enough water in the cooling pond. The only way it can be refilled is to build a new pumping station,” says Shaun Burnie, a nuclear expert with Greenpeace. “But that is only possible after the end of hostilities.”That may have left the site, towering over the river, visible from the Ukrainian-held Nikopol, unusable for the moment. But if Trump really does want it for the US, he has to contend with the fact that the nuclear plant appears also to be a trophy for the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, never mind its interest to Ukrainians keen to recover it in peacetime and rebuild their economy.In an interview with the New York Times, Rafael Grossi, the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, last May recounted a meeting he had with Putin in autumn 2022 where they discussed the plant. Grossi was impressed by Putin’s knowledge of the site, knowing the number of reactors and where its backup power supplies were situated. “He knew every detail,” Grossi said. “It was sort of remarkable.”Experts in Ukraine speculate that Trump’s interest in Zaporizhzhia is because Kyiv has told the US it would be a source of cheap local energy that could be used to power the mining and processing plants as part of therare earths and minerals extraction dealit hopes to sign with the White House. But it would also boost the position of a Pennsylvania-based company in the country.Both before and during the war Ukraine has been switching its reactor technology and fuel supplier from Russia’s Rosatom to Westinghouse, a US-based supplier controlled by a Canadian private equity company. Zaporizhzhia also used Westinghouse fuel, a key plank in the company’s effort to break into the market for Soviet-designed reactors. But this obvious US interest is unlikely to appeal to Putin.If the frontlines in Ukraine were to be frozen as part of an armistice or peace deal, it would be even more difficult to see how Zaporizhzhia could be effectively operated by the US on one side of the Dnipro while surrounded by Russian occupiers, when Ukraine is not thought willing to renounce its ownership.And while Rubio said American ownership would be the “best protection” for Ukraine’s nuclear and energy infrastructure, the US has so far said it is not willing to provide any post-conflict military or security guarantees for Ukraine either.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaNuclear powerDonald TrumpTrump administrationVladimir PutinEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

The US representatives would then meet the Russian negotiating team, Zelenskyy said on Thursday.The Ukrainian announcement indicates the US could shuttle between the two sides to try to achieve Donald Trump’s goal of a quick ceasefire. But both Russia and Ukraine have already disputed the White House’s accounts of their earlier talks with the US president, indicating Trump may have misrepresented the progress of the talks – and his chances of striking a quick deal to halt the war.Starmer warns Putin of ‘severe consequences’ if he breaches peace dealRead moreOn Thursday, Zelenskyy contradicted Trump by denying he had discussed a US plan to take over Ukrainian power plants as part of a peace deal, saying that they “belong to the people of Ukraine”.Trump had announced on Wednesday thatUS ownership of the plants“would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure”.Zelenskyy denied there had been any discussion with Trump about privatising the plants. “If the Americans want to take the station from the Russians and they want to invest there and modernise it, that is a completely different issue,” he said. “We are open to discuss it, but the issue of property we definitely did not discuss with President Trump.”Moscow announced on Thursday that Sergei Beseda, the former head of the spy agency’s fifth directorate – whooversaw intelligence operations in Ukraineand orchestrated the recruitment of collaborators before the full-scale invasion – would travel to Riyadh for Monday’s talks with the US.Both sides said the talks in Saudi Arabia were aimed at finalising a limited ceasefire deal agreed this week, and initiating negotiations on a maritime ceasefire.BeforeRussia’s early failures in the invasion, reports surfaced that Beseda had briefly fallen out of favour with Putin owing to flawed intelligence in the lead-up to the war. Beseda will be joined by Grigory Karasin, the chair of the Russian senate’s committee on international affairs, for the new round of talks with US officials.Zelenskyy has accused Russia of making “unnecessary demands” that will drag out the war, and said Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure had not stopped despitePutin’s claims about his readiness to halt them.1:24Zelenskyy says Putin's words are 'at odds with reality' after strikes on Ukraine – videoMoscow doubled down on Thursday on its insistence that a requirement for serious peace talks would be the complete cessation of both foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence to Kyiv.Trump, speaking on Fox News earlier, denied that arms supplies were discussed during his call with the Russian president, despite a Kremlin readout explicitly stating Putin had demanded an end to military aid to Ukraine.There is still uncertainty over the timing and terms of a limited US-brokered ceasefire agreed this week, with both countries exchanging aerial assaults overnight. Zelenskyy, who was in Oslo on Thursday, said Russia had launched nearly 200 Iranian Shahed drones overnight, wounding at least 10 people, including four children, and damaging “residential buildings, a church, and infrastructure”.Zelenskyy said in a morning statement on Telegram: “Russia’s strikes on Ukraine continue despite its propagandistic statements … With each launch, the Russians show the world their true attitude toward peace.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The airbase in the Russian city of Engels hosts the Tupolev Tu-160 nuclear-capable heavy strategic bombers that have frequently been involved in strikes against Ukrainian cities.Roman Busargin, the governor of Russia’s Saratov region, wrote on Telegram: “Engels today suffered the most massive UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] attack of all time.”Busargin said the attack had left an airfield on fire and that people living nearby had been evacuated. He did not specifically mention the airbase, but it is the main airfield in the area.Images shared by Russian Telegram channelsshowedthick smoke rising from an area west of the airfield, with reports suggesting an ammunition depot cruise missile exploded. Regional officials said 10 people were injured in the strike.Zelenskyy said on Wednesday he had signed up to a partial ceasefire that Trump had agreed with Putin a day earlier after what the Ukrainian leader had described as a “positive, very substantive and frank”call with the US president.But there was confusion over what exactly Trump and Putin had agreed after Moscow and Washington gave different readouts afterwards. Trump, in an initial post on Truth Social, said the partial ceasefire would apply to “energy and infrastructure”, giving the impression it would extend to all civilian infrastructure. Zelenskyy, after his call with Trump, spoke about “ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure”.However, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday the ceasefire would apply only to the energy sector, and a White House statement on Wednesday also referred only to energy.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUS foreign policyEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

If anyone feels offended by things I may have done in my life, let them come and tell me.”She also suggested she may have been the victim of a deliberate smear campaign, adding that it was odd that someone had pored over tweets that went all the way back to 2016.“It’s clear that there was a campaign against me and that they kept going until they got what they were after,” she said.She said she had been the victim of hypocrisy, prejudice and a rush to judgment.“They’ve said that I’m far-right or racist or whatever,” she added, inremarks reported by El Mundo. “But if there’s one thing I’ve done all my life, it’s that I’ve been against all this. When I was young, I used to fight with skinheads … When someone comes up to me and I ask them: ‘But what is it about me that offends you?’, no one can come up with anything or tell me anything.”Gascón told the reporters that she was “less racist than Gandhi” – despite the fact, she said, that people had tried to portray her as deeply prejudiced during what she termed “a social media massacre”.The actor said that while she had “enormous respect for Muslim people”, she had none when it came to “fanaticism, terrorism and all the awful things that are done in the name of God or religion”.She also dismissed suggestions that her old tweets had led to her losing a contract with a Spanish publisher. “To tell the truth, there was no contract between me and that publisher,” she said. “They said what they said, but there was never anything.”Asked whether she regretted anything and whether she would do the same thing again, Gascón said: “Life always puts us into difficult places so that we can learn.

Numbers have remained stable in the north-west, home to a majority of Spain’s estimated 2,500 wolves, an area where they have enjoyed protection only since 2021.Isidre Gavín i Valls of the Catalan nationalist party Together for Catalonia, which supported the amendment, said the party was opposed to the killing of even one wolf, but said that until now “it’s the shepherds who lack protection”.Last December the EU reduced the protected status of wolves from “strictly protected” to “protected” in a policy championed by the EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, after a wolf killed her family’s pet pony.Explore more on these topicsSpainWildlifeAnimalsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

While the combination of US disengagement from Europe and the reality of Russian aggression has forced a reappraisal of security across the continent, Britain’s half-in, half-out status makes for complications.The prime minister,Keir Starmer, wanted to showcase Britain’s credentials as a European military leader on Thursday, first with a visit to the Barrow shipyard where nuclear submarines are built and then to look into a meeting of 30-plus military heads, mostly from Europe, as they discuss how to create a post-war stabilisation force for Ukraine.Yet the message was somewhat undermined by the EU’s announcement a day earlier thatit would set up a €150bn defence investment lending scheme, from which the UK (and the US) would simply be excluded, because it is not a member and does not have an associate or special status like Norway or Ukraine.In reality, the apparent bar is not quite so serious, as long as the two sides agree a defence and security pact soon.Labour has been pushing for a defence treatywith the bloc since before the election, and the hope is that negotiations will conclude in time for an EU-UK summit in May, which would give the UK partial access to the scheme.The initial EU proposal – pushed hard by France,despite close Anglo-French working over the Ukraine stabilisation force– is that British manufacturers will then only be able to access 35% of the money available. That proportion is not set, however, and a successful negotiation may see an increase for the UK, or some other exception.It will be a test for Labour, which has brought some sanity to the UK’s relationship with the EU but not otherwise sought to redraw the post-Brexit settlement. Under the Conservatives, the UK military pulled out of missions like the EU’s EUFOR peacekeeping mission in Bosnia amid fears that British soldiers would have to wear an operational badge with an EU flag on.A key element of Labour’s forthcoming defence review was always going to be developing the arms industry to promote economic growth, even before the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, declared last month thatWashington was no longer “primarily focused” on defending EuropeandTrump began his telephone diplomacy with Putin, with the two men discussing the fate of Ukraine.The numbers working in defence are not necessarily large – 147,500, according to the ADS trade body – but 70% of defence jobs are outside London and the south-east. Manufacturing sites also make a critical contribution to local economies, in shipyards like Barrow or Rosyth on the Forth in Scotland, or at airfields such as Warton and Samlesbury in Lancashire, and trade unions heavily invested in their success.But the events of last month have given the European defence effort a far greater urgency. Though Britain has always split its procurement between the UK, US and partners in Europe, the sight ofTrump stopping military aid to Ukraineand halting intelligence sharing with almost no notice has not been attractive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the alarm that followed, the makers of the US F-35 jet were even forced to put out a statement saying “there is no kill switch” that the US could operate remotely at a moment’s notice, though a more realistic concern is that without continuing US logistics and software support, an F-35 would become unusable quickly.The history of Anglo-American military cooperation is so long and deep that it hard to imagine it falling apart in a crisis even with Trump in the White House. But long-term military planning is also about contingency and what Britain needs is to deepen its security and defence industrial relationship withEuropenot as an alternative but in parallel with its relationship with the US.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyEuropean UnionKeir StarmerDonald TrumpVladimir PutinUkraineEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

But the prime minister did not reiterate his promise to put boots on the ground, instead saying allied forces would be deployed to support Ukrainian troops, including by sea and air, rather than replacing them.“The point of the security arrangements is to make it clear to Russia there will be severe consequences if they are to breach any deal,” he told reporters after the meeting.“This is why it will require a US component; because it needs to be clear to Putin that there will be severe consequences if he breaches the lines. So the purpose of this plan is to ensure that we maintain the peace – as it is in Estonia and all the other countries in which we’re deployed.”Ignored by Trump and menaced by Putin, the UK turns to the EU for defensive tiesRead moreAsked whether British troops were ever likely to serve in Ukraine as he has previously suggested, Starmer said the military planners were discussing offering support by air, sea and land. But he added: “There is a strong sense that, because of what’s happened in the last three years, the Ukrainian forces are amongst the strongest now inEurope. They’ve got the capability, they’ve got the numbers, and they’ve actually got the frontline experience.“We’re not talking about something that replaces the capability, we’re talking about something that reinforces that and then puts around it capabilities in relation to air, water and sea, and land.”A Downing Street source said Starmer’s comments reflected “the nature of moving to the operational phase”.The prime minister was speaking after meeting officers from 31 countries involved in planning how what he has referred to as the “coalition of the willing” might work in practice.Countries represented included France, Poland, the Netherlands, Romania, Canada and Australia.US and Italian officials also attended, even though the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,has describedStarmer’s plans as “risky and ineffective”, while the White House has refused to commit to supporting any western forces in Ukraine.The talks took place against the backdrop of continuing negotiations between the US, Ukraine and Russia, withtalks expected to resume in Saudi Arabia on Sunday. Officials from the three countries will discuss implementing a 30-day pause in targeting each other’s energy infrastructure while they work towards a more comprehensive deal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And therefore [we are planning for] two different scenarios.”The pause in attacks on power plants was agreed after a marathon phone call between Putin and the US president, Donald Trump, earlier this week. A Kremlin account of that call said the Russian president had used it to insist Ukraine should demilitarise and the west should stop providing military aid.Starmer rebuffed those demands on Thursday, saying: “Putin wants a defenceless Ukraine and I think that tells you everything about why we need to do this planning.“What we’re clear about is that Ukraine needs to be secure and needs to be sovereign. And if you’re sovereign, that means that you decide for yourself what defence capability you have.”He added: “You don’t let the person who’s invaded your country tell you what defence capability that you have. So I’m not surprised Putin is saying: ‘I would much rather Ukraine didn’t have any defence,’ because that’s exactly what happened before in Minsk [in 2014], and he breached the line, which I think doubly underlines my argument that we need security arrangements in place.“It does mean that the planning here is on the basis that we continue to build up the Ukrainian forces.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerVladimir PutinForeign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Their lawyers argued that they were innocent and trial evidence was flawed.Iranian activist Masih Alinejad: ‘It’s the start of the end for the Islamic Republic’Read moreAlinejad, 48, was targeted byIranfor her online campaigns encouraging women there to record videos of themselves exposing their hair in violation of edicts requiring they cover it in public.Iran offered $500,000 for a July 2022 plot to kill Alinejad after efforts to harass, smear and intimidate her failed, prosecutors said.American officials have accused Iran of backing several assassination plots in the United States, including against Donald Trump when he was campaigning last year. Tehran has denied being behind any plots to kill people in the US.Alinejad, who was not in court, told the Associated Press she cried when she learned about the verdict.“I am relieved that after nearly three years, the men who plotted to kill me have been found guilty. But make no mistake, the real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran,” she said.Alinejad testified last week that she came to the United States in 2009 after she was banned from covering Iran’s disputed presidential election and the newspaper where she worked was shut down.Establishing herself in New York City, she built an online audience of millions and launched her “My Stealthy Freedom” campaign, telling Iranian women to send photos and videos of themselves exposing their hair when the “morality police” were not around.Soon, she said, she had inspired women to take to the streets in Iran on Wednesdays to peacefully protest, leading the government to arrest hundreds of them. The crackdown only caused her following to grow, however.At the trial, prosecutors said that by 2022, the Iranian government had enlisted high-level Russian mobsters, including Amirov and Omarov, to kill Alinejad.Khalid Mehdiyev, a former member of the Russian mob who lived in Yonkers and worked at a pizzeria, testified that he was hired as the hitman. Like Amirov and Omarov, he is from Azerbaijan, which shares a border and cultural ties with Iran.Mehdiyev, who cooperated with prosecutors after pleading guilty to multiple crimes, said he bought an AK-47 to kill Alinejadbut the plan was foiledwhen his car was stopped by police and the gun was found in the back seat in July 2022. A doorbell camera at Alinejad’s home recorded Mehdiyev standing on her front porch.Prosecutors have kept the investigation open. In October they announcedcharges against a senior Iranian military officialand three others, none of whom are in custody.Alinejad said she had had to move nearly two dozen times since the assassination plot was discovered, at times feeling guilty that so many of her followers in Iran lack a safety net.That, she said, only “makes me more determined to give voice to voiceless people”.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkIranUS crimeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Among those pulled alive from rubble on Thursday was a month-old baby girl, but her parents and brother were killed.A first wave of airstrikes on Tuesdayshattered a two-month pause in hostilities and killed more than 400, according to the health ministry in Gaza, in what may have been the single bloodiest day of the 18-month conflict. The dead included 183 children and 94 women, Palestinian officials said.Warnings telling Palestinians to evacuate areas in the north and east ofGazato avoid being trapped by fighting have been issued by the Israeli military, suggesting ground assaults could be imminent, although Israel appears to be relying on air power for now.World leaders express outrage at Israel’s renewed bombing of Gaza civiliansRead moreThursday’s strikes appeared concentrated on the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis and the northern town of Beit Lahiya.A strike on a family home in Abasan al-Kabira, a village near Khan Younis, killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European hospital, which received the dead. Those killed included a father and his seven children, as well as the parents and brother of the month-old baby who survived along with her grandparents.1:17Thousands of Israelis protest against resumption of Gaza war – videoThe home was within an area covered by a recent evacuation order.“The house collapsed over the people’s heads,” said Hani Awad, who was helping rescuers search for more survivors.The European hospital in the southern city of Rafah said it had received 26 bodies after the overnight strikes, mostly women and children. The Nasser hospital in Khan Younis received the bodies of seven people killed in an attack on a home. In northern Gaza, the Indonesian hospital said it received the bodies of seven people killed in a strike in Beit Lahiya, a town near the border. A second strike in Beit Lahiya killed many mourners at a funeral, survivors said.A spokesperson for al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said 70% of the injured were women and children, most arriving in critical condition.Zaher al-Wahidi, the director of the health information centre at the health ministry in Gaza, said the situation in all hospitals was catastrophic.“The injured are lying on the ground with blood covering the floors of the hospitals. We are suffering greatly from a shortage of supplies for emergency and intensive care, as well as for surgeries and medical equipment. There is a severe shortage of fuel stations, desalination stations, oxygen, and a critical shortage of fuel in the hospitals,” Wahidi said.In its first military response to the Israeli offensive since the ceasefire was broken, Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv in Israel. No casualties or damage were reported.Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said earlier this week that Israel had attacked “terror targets and terrorists in Gaza … to weaken their military and governmental capabilities and remove threats to Israel”.Israeli media have reported that the new air offensive is aimed at senior political and military Hamas officials, and have identified several killed, including the head of Hamas’s internal security agency.On Wednesdaythe IDF reoccupied the Netzarim corridor, a key strip of land that divides Gaza into northern and southern halves.As part of theceasefire deal signed in January, Israel had withdrawn from the corridor, where it had demolished almost all existing buildings, widened a road and built a series of strongpoints.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than half of the hostages are thought to be dead.The group said on Thursday that talks with mediators to halt the Israeli offensive were continuing, and called again for Israel to abide by the earlier agreement.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and other Israel officials said the decision to renew attacks in Gaza came after Hamas rejected proposals for a 30-to 60-day extension of the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire.Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday that Donald Trump backed Israel’s new offensive and blamed Hamas for the violence.“He fully supports Israel and the IDF and the actions that they’ve taken in recent days,” Leavitt told reporters.“Let’s not forget that this situation is completely the fault of Hamas when they launched that brutal attack on Israel on 7 October, and the president has made it very clear that he wants all of those hostages to come home.”Sirens sounded across much of Israel at 4am on Thursday to warn ofan incoming missilelaunched by the Yemen-based Houthi militia. The missile was intercepted by Israel’s air-defence system.The Hamas surprise attack in 2023 killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, also mostly civilians.Critics in Israel have accused Netanyahu of resuming the offensive to reinforce his coalition government before a crucial budget vote in parliament, to rally support for the war in the face of popular backing for a ceasefire to return the hostages, and to head off widespread public anger over hisattempt to fire the head of the internal security service, Shin Bet.Underlining the deep divisions in Israel,hundreds of Israelis protested outside Netanyahu’s residencein Jerusalem on Thursday. Police used a water cannon after some tried to break through barricades. More demonstrations were planned on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In a statement, it reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire deal and called on mediators to “assume their responsibilities”.A temporary first phase of the ceasefire ended at the start of this month. Hamas wants to move to an agreed second phase, under which Israel would be required to negotiate an end to the war and withdrawal of its troops, and Israeli hostages held in Gaza would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and detainees.Israel has offered only a temporary extension of the truce, cut off all supplies to Gaza and says it is restarting its military campaign to force Hamas to free remaining hostages.ShareUpdated at11.48 EDT"

More protests were expected in the coming days as the campaign “gathers momentum and energy”, campaigners said.The immediate trigger for the anger was Netanyahu’s attemptto dismissRonen Bar, the head of the internal security agency, but the prime minister’s decision to shatter a two-month-old truce in Gaza with waves of lethal airstrikes has fuelled the demonstrations.Protesters accuse the government of continuing the war for political reasons and ignoring the plight of the 59 hostages – about 24 of whom are believed to be alive – still held by Hamas in the devastated Palestinian territory.“This government has now also started a war, once again, to protect itself, to divert the discourse from the things that bother the public inIsrael. The government has lost all legitimacy on every possible level … They are failing,” said Eitan Herzel, chief executive of the Brothers in Arms protest movement.On Wednesday thousands packed streets close to Netanyahu’s official residence in central Jerusalem. Many carried Israeli flags and placards with slogans in support of hostages still held in Gaza. Others beat drums and chanted “hostages deal now” as they marched in from other parts of Israel.Ora Nakash Peled, a former senior naval officer and an organiser of the protests, had come from her home on a kibbutz near the northern city of Haifa. She had spent the night with other protesters in a tented camp on the outskirts of Jerusalem before walking into the city along a major highway.View image in fullscreenOra Nakash Peled: ‘We need to be organised, we need to be persistent.’Photograph: Jason Burke/The Guardian“I think we have made our point … We need to be organised, we need to be persistent, we need to be focused. [The protest] cannot be violent [but] it doesn’t have to be polite.”Protesters chanted: “Israel is not Turkey, Israel is not Iran,” and pointed to a series of recent moves by Netanyahu they call “red flags” for Israeli democracy.One is the unprecedented effort to dismiss Bar. Another is a bid by the prime minister and his allies to oust the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, who has argued that removing Bar from his post might be unlawful.“The government has the authority to fire Bar but still has to comply with administrative law,” said Dr Amir Fuchs, a legal expert at theIsrael Democracy Institute. “So, for example, if there is seen to be a conflict of interests, it could be stopped by the supreme court.”Experts point out that Shin Bet, which has wide-ranging powers, is investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media and taking money from Qatar, which is know to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.New suspectsin the “Qatargate” affair were interviewed by Israeli police on Wednesday, local media reported.Netanyahu is also facing a potential jail sentence at the conclusion of an ongoing corruption trial. The 75-year-old politician, who took power in Israel for the first time in 1996 and has served 17 years as prime minister, is giving evidence twice weekly.Other concerns for protesters include reforms that would introduce more political appointees to committees that select judges.A series of high-ranking officials seen as responsible for the mistakes and misjudgements that led to the Hamas attack in October 2023 have resigned. Netanyahu himself has not accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst ever security disaster, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and has resisted calls for a powerful commission of inquiry.Fuchs said: “Netanyahu is doing this because he has a problem he wants to solve by centralising as much power as possible and getting rid of all the gatekeepers and professionals … but this does not align with the interests of the state of Israel, only with those of the prime minister and his government.”View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu.Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/APNetanyahu claimed there was a “leftist deep state” working against him in a social media post on Wednesday.“In America and in Israel, when a strong rightwing leader wins an election, the leftist deep state weaponises the justice system to thwart the people’s will. They won’t win in either place!” the post said.Observers pointed to a strong echo in the current movement of the huge protests that erupted in 2023 when Netanyahu attempted to sack the then defence minister, Yoav Gallant, over his opposition to a planned judicial overhaul.Opinion polls suggest Netanyahu would lose an election if one were held now, but he is likely to defy the protests, which are smaller than those two years ago, and ignore calls for new polls. A crucial budget vote before the end of the month now looks likely to go in the government’s favour.The return of Itamar Ben-Gvir, an extreme rightwing politician, to the government after he walked out over the ceasefire deal signed in January has underlined the continuing and vital support for Netanyahu from the nationalist-religious camp in Israel.Analysts said previously fragmented opposition groups had been brought together in recent days, though there are still no political leaders who look likely to threaten Netanyahu.“It’s a very strong homogeneous [governing] coalition. It has a solid base and it is hard to see it falling apart. There is still no alternative or vision to Netanyahu being put forward,” said Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israeli society and politics at the International Crisis Group.Though protesters say they back a ceasefire now to ensure the return of the hostages, most reflect broader Israeli public opinion and believe the war in Gaza is necessary to eliminate any threat from Hamas.Zonszein said the demonstrations could not be described as “anti-war”.“It is not about what is happening in Gaza at all. It is not about civilian casualties there … It is focused on the hostages and the lack of trust in the government.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuProtestThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

It also comes as Musk is getting closer to launching his other key ventures, Starlink and Tesla, in India.In the new court filing, dated 5 March, X argues that India’s IT ministry is asking other departments to use a government website launched by the home affairs ministry last year to issue content-blocking orders and mandate social media companies to join the website too.

Gary Dobson and David Norris were jailed for life in 2012.The original police investigation into the teenager’s death was marred by institutional racism in theMetropolitan police, incompetence and alleged corruption.Norris, 48, was jailed for a minimum of 14 years and three months for murder in January 2012 at the end of an Old Bailey trial.He is set to face his first parole hearing on a date yet to be fixed, and on Thursday the Parole Boardgranted an application for the hearing to be held in public.In the ruling, the vice-chair of the board, Peter Rook KC, said: “After the trial, Mr Norris continued to deny the offence.“Recent reports now suggest he has accepted he was present at the scene and punched the victim but claims that he did not wield the knife.“He does not accept he holds racist views.”The report also detailed “continuing significant risks” to Norris’s safety in prison.“He has been the victim of at least three assaults whilst in prison,” Rook said. “On two occasions he received serious injuries. The latest was in November 2022.”View image in fullscreenStephen LawrenceHe was diagnosed with PTSD in November 2023, according to the report.Norris’s lawyers argued against the parole hearing being held in public, saying it will increase the risk to his safety and that the inmate will not be able to give his “best evidence” given concerns that the media will “sensationalise the proceedings”.Stephen Lawrence’s parents are said to be supportive of the public hearing.His father, Neville Lawrence, has previously said he is not satisfied with Norris getting parole but if he can show remorse he will accept it.Lawrence told the Daily Mail: “He would have to say he was sorry for killing Stephen and that he had changed his ways and apologise to our family [for me to accept his release].“I am not satisfied with him getting parole but what I am saying is if he can show remorse and show he’s changedthen I will accept that.”Explore more on these topicsStephen LawrenceUK criminal justiceMetropolitan policeRaceLondonPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

In 2018-19, the last academic year before the Covid-19 pandemic, 60,247 were classed as severely absent.And the unauthorised absence rate rose from 2.4% in 2022-23 to 2.5% in 2023-24, according to the figures. In 2018-19, the rate was only 1.4%.Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “We need to accept that schools cannot solve this issue on their own and must set out clear expectations and plans for parents, government, schools and other agencies to work together in the best interests of young people.“This must be backed with funding to ensure there is sufficient capacity in the system for all children to get any additional support they require to be able to attend school on a regular basis.“Without investing in a strategic response to this issue, it is difficult to see how attendance rates are going to change at the scale required.”In September, school absence fines in England rose from £60 to £80, and a parent who receives a second fine for the same child within a three-year period will now receive a £160 fine.The latest DfE attendance data covers the last academic year before fines for unauthorised absences were increased.Bridget Phillipson warns parents against ‘casual attitude’ to school attendanceRead moreLast week, the education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, called on school and college leaders to “catch up fast” to improve pupil attendance, and said some schools were “not making enough progress” on absences.Overall, the absence rate decreased from 7.4% in 2022-23 to 7.1% in 2023-24 but it remains higher than pre-pandemic rates of 4.7%, the data suggests.One in five pupils in England, about 1.49 million young people, were “persistently absent” during the 2023-24 school year, which means they missed 10% or more school sessions.This is down on 2022-23 when 21.2% of pupils were persistently absent, but it is still above the rate in 2018-19 of 10.9%.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “These figures make it clear that the current approach to solving absence just isn’t working. Simply increasing the pressure on schools, without providing any additional resource for them to tackle the issue, is fruitless.“The only way to actually make progress is to look at the causes of absence – from parental attitude changes, holiday pricing, and children and young people’s experiences of mental health and poverty.“Unless we begin to improve those things, absence will continue.”Analysis from a thinktank earlier this week found that unauthorised school absence is a leading cause of thewidening performance gapbetween disadvantaged pupils and their peers in England. The research by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) found that all the increase in the “disadvantage gap” among 16-year-olds since 2019 can be explained by students on free school meals (FSM) missing more time at school than other pupils, putting them several months behind in terms of their results.The EPI calculated that if disadvantaged pupils had the same attendance record as other pupils, the attainment gap at age 11 would be almost 10% smaller, and the gap at age 16 would be 20% lower.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The government inherited a broken system, with children and families facing poor outcomes and barriers to opportunity. The case for tackling the epidemic of school absence could not be clearer: improved grades, higher wages, better life chances.“Tackling this issue is everyone’s responsibility – government, schools, parents, and children – and we need a national effort to get our kids back in the classroom. We have made some encouraging progress this academic year, but more must be done and this month we have brought together ministers and over 2,000 school leaders up and down the country to share best practices to drive up attendance.Parents in England: share your experience of your children being absent from schoolRead more“As part of our plan for change, we [are] determined to turn the tide on poor attendance and break down barriers to opportunity – whether it’s through free breakfast clubs, improved mental health support, additional investment in family support, or more focus from Ofsted.”Explore more on these topicsSchool attendance and absenceSchoolsBridget PhillipsonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I am being targeted for my activism | Mahmoud KhalilRead moreDepartment of Homeland Security agents on Monday detained Suri, a postdoctoral fellow at the university’s Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, saying that his visa was revoked. Suri’s attorney said that he was arrested on the same spurious legal grounds as Columbia University studentMahmoud Khalil, according toPolitico.Suri was arrested after returning home from a traditional Ramadan meal and detained by masked federal agents, his legal team said. He has since been transported to severalimmigrationdetention facilities and is now at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement “staging center” in Louisiana “potentially awaiting deportation”, the ACLU of Virginia said. His attorneys are requesting his immediate return to Virginia and release while his immigration case is being considered.Detainees may only be held at this particular facility for 72 hours, his lawyers contend. “The facility also does not permit access to visitors or even legal counsel,” court papers in support of the emergency petition say.“Ripping someone from their home and family, stripping them of their immigration status, and detaining them solely based on political viewpoint is a clear attempt by President Trump to silence dissent,” Sophia Gregg, a senior immigrants’ rights attorney at the ACLU of Virginia, said in a statement. “That is patently unconstitutional.”Suri on Tuesday filed alegal petition for release; in court papers first reported by Politico, his attorney said that he did not have a criminal record, nor had he been charged with any crime.The Department of Homeland Security alleged that Suri had ties to the Palestinian militant group Hamas and claimed he shared its propaganda and antisemitic content on social media, officials said in a statement to Fox News. This statement, which did not include any evidence, said that the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, found that his activities “rendered him deportable”.View image in fullscreenBadar Khan Suri.Photograph: Georgetown UniversityOne of Suri’s attorneys, Hassan Ahmad, said he had not been able to reach him since the arrest outside his Arlington, Virginia, home. “We’re trying to speak with him. That hasn’t happened yet,” Ahmad told Politico. “This is just another example of our government abducting people the same way they abducted Khalil.”Suri, who was teaching a course this spring on “majoritarianism and minority rights in south Asia”, holds a doctorate in peace and conflict studies from a university inIndia, according to Reuters. His wife, Mapheze Saleh, a US citizen, is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former political adviser to Hamas.For at least one month before Suri’s arrest, various hardline pro-Israel social media accounts, as well as Israel’s US embassy, highlighted his wife and father-in-law in posts on X. One 13 March missive, which showed a photo purporting to be Saleh and another photo of her and her father, tagged the US attorney general,Pam Bondi. Court papers say that such groups publicized the home address of the couple, who have three children.“Dr Suri’s experience is shocking and disgraceful,” Ahmad said in a a statement. “It should worry everyone that masked government agents can disappear someone from their home and family because the current administration dislikes their opinion.”According to a 2018 article about Suri and Saleh in theHindustan Times, Saleh is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former political adviser to Hamas.Suri’s arrest came amidDonald Trump’s efforts to expel foreign nationals who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations against Israel’s war in Gaza following the October 2023 Hamas attack. Civil liberties groups have decried Trump’s actions as assaults on free speech and illegal targeting of political opponents.Khalil, a Palestinian Columbia graduate and green card holder, faces deportation under a provision of immigration law that permits the US secretary of state to expel non-citizens if their presence in the country is deemed a threat to foreign policy. A Manhattan federal court judge ordered that Khalil remain in the US while his immigration case is pending and has transferred the proceedings to New Jersey.Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, confirmed in a social media post that Rubio deemed Suri’s presence a threat to US foreign policy interests.“Suri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media. Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas,” McLaughlinsaidin a post on X. “The Secretary of State issued a determination on March 15, 2025 that Suri’s activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable under INA section 237(a)(4)(C)(i).”Trump administration plans for militarized border in New Mexico – reportRead moreA spokesperson for Georgetown said the university did not know of any alleged wrongdoing on Suri’s part and that it supported students’ and professors’ right to free expression.“Dr Khan Suri is an Indian national who was duly granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,” the university said. “We support our community members’ rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.”Trump has repeatedly characterized pro-Palestinian protesters as antisemitic. Those advocating for Palestine, among them some Jewish groups, contend that their criticism of Israel’s military efforts in Gaza and support for Palestinian rights has wrongly been cast as antisemitism by critics.Reuters contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationWashington DCUS politicsDonald TrumpPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The same source says median debt runs between $20,000 and $24,999, with median postgraduate debt about double those figures. Younger graduates, between 25 and 39, are more likely to say they are struggling financially than older graduates, though graduates still report higher income than those who do not complete college.Many observers doubt that whatever remains of the Department of Education will be properly equipped to manage student debt.In a statement to the Guardian on Thursday, Sameer Gadkaree, the CEO of the Institute for College Access and Success, said: “Shuttering the Department of Education would prove disastrous for students, borrowers, and our nation’s future workforce. Without the department, fewer students would be able to go to college, student loan borrowers would default in droves, and fraudulent colleges would prey on students with impunity. Separately, gutting education research would curtail our ability to track progress on national educational goals.”Gadkaree added: “The administration claims that it can avoid these harms by shifting the department’s functions to the states – which, like shuttering the department, would require congressional approval. But states cannot effectively administer federal student loans, send out grant aid to millions of students across thousands of colleges, or compile national data.”Beth Maglione, the interim president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators,said recently: “Claiming that eliminating half the department won’t affect its services – without any clear plan to redistribute the workload – is, at best, naive and, at worst, deliberately misleading.“It also raises serious concerns about how billions of dollars in federal student aid will continue to be disbursed to students without interruption.”Earlier this week, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT)suedthe Trump administration, accusing it of unlawfully shutting down access to income-driven student loan repayment plans – a step taken last month after a courtruled againstSave, a Biden administration initiative to provide more generous terms than previous repayment plans.A department spokesperson said it was working to ensure the programs conform with the court ruling “and anticipates the revised form allowing borrowers to change repayment plans to be available as soon as next week”.What is the US Department of Education and what does it do?Read moreSome observers do not think it is out of the question that student debt will not remain at the Trump Department of Education, but could be transferred to another department as Trump himself has suggested.Mark Kantrowitz, a higher education expert, recently told CNBC that Trump could try to transfer student loans to the treasury or the Department of Commerce, though such moves might be stymied by a lack of expertise at those other bodies.Such a move would in all likelihood lead to a period of bureaucratic disruption. Kantrowitz also warned that if student debt remains under the remit of whatever remains of the education department, borrowers may find existing loan forgiveness programs choked and stalled, with staff no longer able to cope.Trump is also seeking to limit the public service loan forgiveness program, onideological grounds.Amid the chaos, CNBC said it was “important … to keep in mind” that “the terms and conditions of … federal student loans cannot change even if the agency overseeing them does”, because “borrowers’ rights were guaranteed when they signed the master promissory note when their loans were originated.”Last month, theTrump administrationremoved an online application form for multiple popular student debt repayment plans including income-driven repayment plans.The administration alsoremovedan online application for students to consolidate their plans on the Department of Education website.On Tuesday, the AFT – a major teachers union in the US –fileda lawsuit against the Department of Education after the department prevented applications from being processed on affordable repayment plans for student loans.According to the complaint, ATF “brings this lawsuit to compel the department to abide by Congress’s command and provide borrowers with the ability to re-pay their loans through the affordable, income-driven repayment plans to which they are entitled.”In a statement accompanying the lawsuit, Weingarten said: “By effectively freezing the nation’s student loan system, the new administration seems intent on making life harder for working people, including for millions of borrowers who have taken on student debt so they can go to college.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS student debtUS educationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

They had been in jail and on house arrest for more than two years.Prosecutors in Romania suspended a travel ban, and a court lifted a precautionary seizure on some of their assets, following reports that US special envoy Richard Grenell, aDonald Trumpacolyte, raised their case with Romania’s foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, at the Munich Security Conference earlier in the month.The brothers areunder criminal investigation in Florida, where the state attorney general, James Uthmeier, announced a collaboration “with our law enforcement and partners around the world to fight human trafficking and sexual abuse”.They are also wanted in the UK, where authorities filed an extradition request over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to 2012, but were told that would not happen until the conclusion of the legal case in Romania.Under the terms of their release, Andrew, 38, and Tristan, 36, must return to Bucharest before the end of the month.The White House has denied knowledge of the circumstances of the arrival in the US of the Tates, who are dual American and UK citizens. But Andrew Tate was complimentary when reporters in Florida asked earlier this month if the president was involved.“Trump is such a boss, he is such a gangster,”he said.On Thursday, Valderrama criticized Trump’s presumed hand in proceedings.“The Trump administration wants to portray itself as a protector of women. But their work to bring Andrew Tate back to the streets of the US reveals the administration’s true values and priorities,” she said. “Trump does not care about protecting women.”UltraViolet, which helped expose convicted the sexual predatorsHarvey Weinstein,R KellyandBill O’Reilly, alsolaunched a websitelinking to a petition urging US attorney general Pam Bondi, a close ally of Trump, to extradite the Tates to the UK. The group said the petition, which was launched earlier this month, already had more than 10,000 signatures.The Tate brothers have consistently denied all the charges and allegations against them, and Andrew Tate has made Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who said their brand of toxic masculinity was not welcome in his state, a target of vitriol to his 10.9 million followers on X.Their attorney, Joseph McBride, told the Guardian in a statement this month: “The Florida ‘criminal investigation’ is a weak attempt by a lame-duck governor to hold on to power and an unknown attorney general aiming to build his reputation.“The Tate brothers are law-abiding citizens who will fully comply with the conditions of their release in Romania.The Florida state attorney’s office has not responded to an inquiry about the status of the investigation.A recent episode of Andrew Tate’s internet-based reality series Tate Confidential features the brothers frolicking, posturing and smoking cigars by the pool of a Miami mansion.Last week the streaming service Spotifyremoved an Andrew Tate podcastafter complaints from users, including an online petition signed by more than 92,000 people.The broadcast, titled pimping hoes, and part of Tate’s “degree course” on “how to get girls fast and easy”, was taken down for breaching the company’s policies.In one part of the removed podcast, Tate said the “reason the sexual marketplace is so fucked is because there’s too many women out there who get attention without giving sex”.This story was updated on 20 March 2025 to correct that the women’s justice group is attempting to have Andrew Tate extradited, not deported; Tate is a US citizen and cannot be deported.Explore more on these topicsFloridaAndrew TateDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

He said Musk faced a “moment of truth” and needed to act.“Tesla and Musk are facing a defining chapter in their future and how Musk handles this next few months will be pivotal to the long-term growth trajectory of Tesla in our view,” he wrote. “Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla … they are synonymous and attached together and cannot be separated.”Ives said Musk had to do two things to stop the crisis snowballing into a “much more black swan event”, a reference to an unforeseen event with wide-ranging consequences.Ives said Musk needed to announce formally that he was going to balance running Doge with being Tesla’s chief executive. Doing so would “dissipate” the heat around Tesla and avoid permanent brand damage, although there would still be a “scar”, he said.“Investors need to see Musk take a step back and balance his Doge and Tesla CEO roles,” Ives said.He also called on Musk to set out plans and timing for the release of new, cheaper vehicles along with the rollout of fully self-driving vehicles in Austin, Texas, in June. “There is one person Tesla investors need to hear from … Musk,” Ives said.The Vancouver Auto Show said it was removing Tesla hours before the show got under way on Wednesday in western Canada, with organisers telling reporters the decision had not been made lightly.“The Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla as a participant in this week’s event, after the automaker was provided multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw,” the show’s executive director, Eric Nicholl, said in a statement.“The Vancouver Auto Show’s primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors and staff. This decision will ensure all attendees can be solely focused on enjoying the many positive elements of the event.”Last year nearly 130,000 people attended the show. Organisers said they were expecting a similar turnout for this year’s lineup of 200 or so vehicles.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a post on social media the group urged protesters to “turn out in numbers to fight Elon Musk’s illegal coup”.In an interview this week, Musk called Tesla protesters “deranged” and blamed the protests on his involvement with Doge. “They basically want to kill me because I’m stopping their fraud, and they want to hurt Tesla because we’re stopping this terrible waste and corruption in the government,” he told Fox News.Trump’s commerce secretary defended the company on Wednesday, urging Americans to buy Tesla stock.“I think, if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,”Howard Lutnick told Fox News. “It’s unbelievable that this guy’s stock is this cheap. It’ll never be this cheap again.”However, Tesla shares were down more than 1% on Thursday afternoon.The Tesla recall issued on Thursday was related to a part called a cant rail – a stainless-steel exterior trim panel – delaminating and detaching from the vehicle, the company said. As a remedy, Tesla will replace the rail assembly free of charge.A detached panel can become a road hazard and increase the risk of a crash, according to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s notice on the recalls.Tesla was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskTechnology sectorDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Offices covering research, data and statistics were decimated.Trump is setting the US on a path to educational authoritarianismRead moreA Department of Education employee who survived the cuts likened the experience to a funeral. “People were crying, breaking down at the human toll,” they told the Guardian. “These people are not bureaucratic bloat: they’re vital to helping improve educational outcomes for our nation’s children,and to ensuring states comply with the law. It’s death by a thousand cuts.”Staff were particularly concerned about the decision to halt research projects, years after they started, that were nearly complete.Nearly all employees at the department’s Institute of Educational Sciences (IES) were fired, andmore than 160 education research funding contracts and grantsworth $900mwere cancelled.Many of the research projects were commissioned to take place over five years.“We were in year four, which means there was a lot of research that was almost done, but is now never going to see the light of day,” one fired IES employee said.They cited one study into the early impact of a literacy program in Michigan.The outcome of the research will now not see the light of day.Most of the money spent on suchresearch will now“yield nothing for the taxpayers, nothing for schools, nothing for students,” the employee said.“You can’t even quantify the loss.”View image in fullscreenLinda McMahon, the US secretary of education, hailed the funding cuts and firings at her department as ‘significant step toward restoring the greatness’.Photograph: Tierney L Cross/ReutersThey questioned McMahon’s claim that the sweeping cuts would restore the“greatness”of theUS educationsystem.“I don’t understand how you can do that when you cut an office where our only job was to figure out what’s working in classrooms, what’s not working, who’s it working for, and who’s it not working for?“We have this roadmap for schools, we have all this information, and now we’re just taking it away and saying, figure it out.”“These cancellations are going to have stopped research that was well on its way to helping us better understand how to improve outcomes for kids,” said Rachel Dinkes, president and CEO of Knowledge Alliance, anon-profitwhose members are educational organizations. “It’s just been halted, stopped, and it doesn’t look like there’s any indication that it will get restarted.”She cited proven success stories that relied on the kind of research being cancelled, includingvast improvements in literacyin Mississippi.“When states use evidence-based practices, student achievements improve,” Dinkes added. “I think we’re unwinding, hampering and putting speed bumps into achieving those goals.”Joshua Stewart, an education researcher for a federal contractor since 2012,was working on research for the education department’s regional educational laboratories. Last week, he said they had to inform school districts and teachers they were working with that – midway through their work –it had been abruptly halted.“We had to send them a series of notes saying we’ve been thankful to be your partners on these projects that are intended to improve outcomes for students and teachers, but we have to stop right away. We can’t even leave you with anything, we just have to stop,” Stewart said. “I have a hard time believing that it’s going to have any positive impact on students, teachers and families.”A federal judge in Maryland has sinceorderedatemporary haltto the reduction in force firings at the Department of Education and other agencies.The Trump administration has appealed.Attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia alsofiled a lawsuitlast week over the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle the agency.Contacted for comment, a spokesperson for the Department of Education referred the Guardian to the press release on the cuts, which claimed that it would continue to deliver “on all statutory programs”under the agency’s purview.Education outcomes in reading and math in the US had beengradually increasingsince the education department’s creation in 1979,up until Covid-19 shutdowns caused significant disruption.

And I think we can easily see ourselves manufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the US.”Bank of England expected to leave interest rates on hold today, as wage growth slows and redundancies rise – business liveRead moreThe remarks are the latest example of how Trump’s “America First” policy is having an impact on business investment, even forcing groups such as Nvidia – which is among the world’s most valuable companies – to rethink their global footprint.The Silicon Valley company, founded in 1993, has been the engine of the AI market boom, with hype around the technology propelling its valuation to a stratospheric $2.9tn (£2.2tn). But in recent years it and other big US tech companies, such as Apple, have become increasing dependent on chipmaking facilities in Taiwan run by TSMC and Foxconn – a supply chain now under threat from trade wars and from China’sterritorial designs on its neighbour.Huang said he was confident that Nvidia was well-positioned to deal with any worsening situation in Taiwan, which is also vulnerable to earthquakes. “At this point, we know that we can manufacture in the US, we have a sufficiently diversified supply chain,” he added.He added that the Trump administration could be in a position to bolster the US AI industry at a time of growing competition from China.Huawei, for example, had become the “single most formidable technology company in China”, having “conquered every market they’ve engaged”. Huang argued US efforts to constrain the Chinese company had been “done poorly”, as evidenced by Huawei’s continued success.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Taiwanese semiconductor firm’s investment means that Nvidia’s Blackwell chips – its top-of-the-line graphics processing unit – are being produced in the US, providing for “a substantial step up in our supply chain resilience”.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

And then came a flash of steel. “I have been dealing with let’s say difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old,” replied Coventry. “What I have learned is that communication will be key. That is something that will happen early on.“We will not waver from our values,” she added. “Solidarity and ensuring every athlete that qualifies for theOlympic Gameshas the possibility to attend the Olympic Games and be safe during the Olympic Games.”It was a mightily impressive answer. And it also sent a clear message. Coventry might be inexperienced. But she is ready to deal with whatever her brief involves, whether it is dealing with Presidents Trump, Putin and Xi, the weaponisation of sport, or the challenges of steering the IOC through an uncertain decade.She was equally quick footed when asked about whether more needed to be done to protect women’s sports after theboxing controversy at the Paris Games. “My stance is that we will protect the female category and athletes,” she replied. “I want to work together with the international federations. And we’re going to do that by setting up a task force that will look and analyse everything.”1:25'It is significant': Kirsty Coventry voted first female president of IOC – videoPerhaps we should not have been surprised. In the murky world of Zimbabwean politics, Coventry has proved adept at dodging the pitfalls and rising to the top. That ascent started early at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, where she was hailed as Zimbabwe’s “golden girl” by Robert Mugabe after winning three medals in the swimming pool.The dictator used the same phrase after she won four more medals in Beijing in 2008, but Coventry faced criticism for accepting $100,000 (about £55,000) in prize money on state television at a time when Zimbabweans were suffering hunger as a result of hyperinflation.But she showed she could also use her position to offer a mild rebuke, stating that: “President Mugabe knows something needs to change because so many people are hurting.”There was more controversy in 2018, when she became the sports minister in the cabinet of president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is known as ‘The Crocodile’ for his ruthlessness – and whose democratic credentials are flimsy to say the least.View image in fullscreenCoventry smiles after receiving her gold medal for winning the women’s 200m backstroke at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.Photograph: Mark Baker/APThe British government, for instance, is among those to issue sanctions in a bid to encourage Zimbabwe “to respect democratic principles, refrain from actions, policies or activities which repress civil society in Zimbabwe and to comply with international human rights law and respect for human rights”.However, Coventry has not distanced herself from Mnangagwa. Quite the contrary. Last year they were even seen dancing alongside each other at a public event in which Zimbabwe said it wanted to bid for the 2027 Cricket World Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zimbabwe has been banned from hosting national team games by the Confederation of African Football since 2020 because of unsafe stadiums – something that Coventry has not fixed.Meanwhile at the Paris Olympics, Zimbabwe sent a delegation of 74 people for nine competing athletes, raising questions over whether it was an effective use of taxpayers’ money.View image in fullscreenKirsty Coventry will have to deal with difficult situations including handling the influence of Donald Trump.Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/ReutersCoventry defended her role and actions in government after her victory. “In terms of my country, I chose to try and create change from the inside,” she said. “It gets criticised, and that’s OK, because at the end of the day, I don’t think you can stand on the sidelines and scream for change. I believe you have to be seated at the table.”One thing is clear. The political skills she has acquired in her home country have proved exceptionally useful at the IOC, an organisation she joined in 2013 and rose rapidly to beThomas Bach’s chosen successor.Unlike many of the candidates, she didn’t have an expensive PR team helping her during her campaign. Indeed, her manifesto was written by her and her husband. And the one communications professional who helped her did it for free – and was not even with her in Greece.But, crucially, she had the patronage of Bach, the formidable and powerful IOC president since 2013. Under his watch, over two-thirds of IOC members voting in the election were appointed. And in the final days pressure was applied to deliver the result he wanted.The unanswered question now is what happens next. Will it be ‘continuity Bach’, pursuing a top-down and authoritarian approach that allows members little say? Or will she allow a little light into an organisation that desperately needs it? Whatever happens, the next eight years will be fascinating – and challenging.Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeOlympic GamesSebastian CoeSport politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He then accessed the social media, email and cloud storage accounts of more than 2,000 athletes, according to the indictment.“Weiss primarily targeted female college athletes,” the indictment said. “He researched and targeted these women based on their school affiliation, athletic history and physical characteristics. His goal was to obtain private photographs and videos never intended to be shared beyond intimate partners.”After more than a decade as an assistant coach with the Ravens, under coach John Harbaugh, Weiss moved to Michigan to work for Harbaugh’s brother, Jim.It has been publicly known for two years that Weiss was under scrutiny. His Ann Arbor home was searched by police in January 2023, shortly before he was fired. He said at the time that he was cooperating and was looking “forward to the matter being resolved”.Weiss’s initial court appearance on the charges was not determined.“Our office will move aggressively to prosecute computer hacking to protect the private accounts of our citizens,” Julie Beck, the acting US attorney in Detroit, said of the indictment.Explore more on these topicsSportCollege footballNFLBaltimore RavensCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

ESPN reports that Wyc Grousbeck will continue as the team’s CEO until the end of the 2027-28 season.The sale would represent a huge return in investment for the Grousbecks and partner Steve Pagliuca: they led a group that bought the team for $360m in 2002. Pagliuca had hoped to take sole ownership of the Celtics but was outbid by Chisholm. On Thursday, he said he was “saddened to find out that we have not been selected in the process.”Boston’s brilliant technocrats micromanaged their way to the NBA titleRead moreThe Celtics are one of the NBA’s blue chip franchises.

He approached me and asked if anyone had spoken to me about driving for them the following year. I told him no one had and so on the back of a napkin, before the end of the awards, we agreed to come together for 1987 when we would go on to win the Formula 3 British Championship together.I still believe if he hadn’t given me that chance in Formula 3, I’m not quite sure I’d have had that success or would have got toFormula Onewithout him.‘We’ve lost a true legend’: Eddie Jordan, former F1 team owner, dies aged 76Read moreDuring that year, I got to know the real Eddie Jordan. You can see the Eddie that was on TV and when he was a team owner but when I went down to Sotogrande, to his place in Spain with his family we became close. He was just a brilliant host and he made all his drivers feel very, very comfortable within the walls of Eddie Jordan Racing as it was at the time and of course then later with the F1 team, when he brought in Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill among many others.What was also impossible to ignore was his work ethic; looking back, it’s no surprise thathe achieved what he achieved. His work ethic was continuous, all day and sometimes, literally, all night. There was always a deal to be done and there was always this passion for it.We won together in 1987 and that gave him more drive to get himself through to his ultimate dream, which was Formula One. But he grafted for it, it wasn’t given to him on a plate, he had to go out there and find that sponsorship that he needed to keep racing.When we did Formula 3000 together in 1988, at the first race we had one sponsor on the car and it was plain white, nothing else on it. I got pole position and that evening Eddie phoned up Duncan Lee, who was head of Camel cigarettes at the time. Duncan wasn’t interested in sponsoring us, so Eddie banged on until basically Duncan went: “Okay, you can have a meeting on Tuesday”.Eddie went away to another team, got a Camel sticker, stuck it on the side of the car on the Saturday night and I went out and won, so he had a photo of me winning the race, which he took to the meeting on Tuesday and got the Camel sponsorship for the next two years.So it was the graft and the thought process. Having the meeting is one thing but then to think: ‘Right, I get a sticker, stick it on, if we win the race, Camel’s all over the car’.That was what was so wonderful about the wheeler-dealer side of him. He was always thinking out of the box, always trying to think of new ways with his team to be able to promote himself, the brands that he had on board, his partners and that was very refreshing at that time and a lot of people have taken on board what he did in that early 90s period.View image in fullscreenEddie Jordan grafted to achieve his ultimate dream in motor racing.Photograph: Oliver Dixon/ShutterstockHis strength was also in the team he had chosen. When they were in the factory he made sure that he and they were on the same page and there was a togetherness. Everybody had a free and open situation in their particular jobs and that got the best out of people on that limited budget. He had a lot of trust,Eddie looked after everybodyand that just gave them a really good feel and there was a lot of love, because that was his type of character that he had, he was never, ever shying away from his emotions. He’d be hard when he needed to be but he also knew very well that he needed to keep everybody motivated, happy in the job that they were doing, so there was respect, both ways.Jordan F1 were the underdogs, they were the ones that were there or thereabouts and then got very close to winning the drivers and constructors’ championship with Heinz-Harald Frentzen in 1999. They were the underdogs everybody loved because there was just something about them that drew you in.Look at the pictures of the British Grand Prix in 1995 after I won. Eddie had the truck with his band, Nick Mason was on the drums, Eddie was on the drums, Damon was playing guitar, me doing tambourine as that was the only rhythmic thing I could sort of play. It wasn’t Formula One but the fun and the people that it dragged in after the race was brilliant and he loved it.Eddie Jordan – a life in picturesRead moreHe loved that ability to enjoy what he was doing and the limelight that went with it all. That was why he was so refreshing, so very charismatic and the energy that he brought into the paddock is something that we are still benefiting from today. Eddie was one of the last of those successful characters who came in and he was probably one of the very last team owners who was also running the team, very, very involved with all the decision making that was going on. The way that he did it made it that much more special. He achieved so, so much with not the biggest budget on the grid and that is something that earned respect. There’s a lot of respect for what Eddie achieved on track just as there’s a lot of respect for what Eddie did off track with his TV career.I will miss him massively. I think we will all miss him, to be honest. We all have memories in different ways of what he was like but it was the energy that he gave all of us at the end of the day. He was one of the biggest characters we had in the paddock and his popularity is going to live on for sure.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Victory over the former Wimbledon champion Rybakina, who during the loss managed a 22-point winning streak on serve, was the first top-10 win of Krueger’s career.In the men’s draw, Jacob Fearnley earned a spot in the second round with victory over Benjamin Bonzi. In a close battle lasting two hours and 19 minutes the Briton claimed a 7-6, 2-6, 6-4 win and he will now meet Alexander Zverev, the world No 2 and top seed, in the second round.Nick Kyrgios storms back at Miami Open for first tour-level win since 2022Read moreLittle separated Fearnley and Bonzi in the first set as both players held their serve to reach a tiebreaker, where qualifier Fearnley edged ahead to take the second set point of the match. Another tight encounter followed at the start of the second, but Bonzi suddenly pulled away after breaking the Briton’s serve twice to win the set.Before the third set Fearnley took a medical timeout and, after another closely contested set, the 23-year-old managed to see the match out to reach the last 64.Speaking to Sky Sports, Fearnley said: “That was extremely difficult, I was feeling my legs, especially my left leg twitching a little bit when I moved to a forehand. Just had to dig deep and luckily I got the break at the start of the third because I think that could have easily got away from me. Super happy to get the win and to move on.”Fearnley’s compatriot Cameron Norrie was handed a straight sets defeat by Bu Yunchaokete in the opening round of the competition, losing 6-4, 6-2. Norrie had his serve broken in the opening game and, despite some determined fightback, trailed for most of the match as the Chinese pulled away to claim the first set.Norrie continued to struggle and had his serve broken twice in the second set by Bu, who put in a dominant display – which included eight aces – to cruise into the second round.The former finalist Kei Nishikori withdrew from his opener, citing the need for more time to recover after reaching the semi-finals of an ATP Challenger Tour event last week.“My body has not recovered enough from the matches last week. I will now go home and get ready for the clay court season,” the 35-year-old Japanese wrote on X.Explore more on these topicsCoco GauffTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The German was forthright on England’s laboured performances during a tournament in which fans and pundits turned on Southgate, saying the side played with fear and showed no excitement beforelosing the final to Spain, and his comments were backed up by Harry Kane’s admission that the squad was “a little bit light on leadership” in Germany.Thomas Tuchel’s first task is to solve England’s main problem: Harry Kane | Barney RonayRead moreSouthgate caused surprise inside the camp by taking a host of inexperienced youngsters to the Euros and leaving out senior figures such as Harry Maguire, Jack Grealish and Jordan Henderson, who washanded a shock recall by Tuchellast week. Henderson’s return was backed by Kane, who praised the midfielder’s ability to lift teammates in difficult moments.There was a stir when Tuchel’s take on England’s efforts last year was publicised. Asked by ITV whether he thought the team had a clear way of playing before his appointment, the head coach said: “Not last summer, no.”Tuchel, who takes charge of his first games when England open their World Cup qualifying campaign by hosting Albania at Wembley on Friday and Latvia on Monday, did not drop the honesty after being pressed on what was missing. “The identity, the clarity, the rhythm, the repetition of patterns, the freedom of player, the expression of player, the hunger,” he said. “They were more afraid to drop out of the tournament in my observation than having the excitement and hunger to win.”The aim is to restore the excitement to England’s play. “That was my feeling watching on TV, long before I knew I would be in charge,” Tuchel said. “I want us to play with a hunger to win and we want to implement the togetherness and joy to win, rather than the fear to lose.”Tuchel considered the notion that the shirt weighs heavily on England’s players. “I know what the players mean,” he said. “It maybe is another way to put what I felt watching the Euros. I felt tension and pressure on the shoulders of the players, and it felt to me that they were more afraid, like they were afraid not to lose and not to have even more pressure added.“We need to turn this around because we have so many experienced players, so many players who won the trophies with their clubs. I think we have every right to be self-confident.”Kane, who knows Tuchel well from their time at Bayern Munich, had a similar view on the Euros. “Maybe we didn’t play as freely as we had done in the past and what we could have done,” England’s captain said. “Thomas definitely wants more high tempo, especially without the ball. When we lose the ball, just energy.“Especially at home at Wembley in these games, almost creating the atmosphere yourselves. That’s what we’ve got to try to do. It’s a new beginning. It was really successful with Gareth and that era of English football. We got to two finals, we got to semi-finals, but it’s about making the next step.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Especially when things are not going so well, or there’s a lot of noise around the camp, that’s when you need players like me and someone like Jordan. It’s great to have him. We complement each other very well in the way we lead.”Tuchel added: “You can be sure that if I say something in a press conference, I have addressed it to the players. There are no messages given through you.

But the returning goalkeeper, who has not played for Belgium for almost two yearsamid a fallout with their former coach Domenico Tedesco, was barely tested again in the first half and captain Lukaku opened the scoring just before the break with his first Belgium goal since November 2023.In a more lively second half, De Bruyne could have doubled the lead for Belgium through a low attempt from the edge of the area that was brilliantly saved by Ukraine keeper Andriy Lunin.However, Ukraine then grew into the game and hit back through Hutsulyak, who capitalised on a mistake by the Belgium defence to level in the 66th minute, before stretching away with two more goals.Belgium, who earned four points from six games as they finished third in League A Group Two, face their first relegation from the competition’s top tier since its creation in 2018.Explore more on these topicsNations LeagueSpainNetherlandsGermanyItalyRepublic of IrelandCroatianewsShareReuse this content"

Scotland scrapped, scratched and clung on for dear life in the first leg of this clash with Greece. The upshot is a highly favourable position before the teams meet again on Sunday in Glasgow.Netherlands 2-2 Spain, Italy 1-2 Germany, Greece 0-1 Scotland: Nations League – liveRead moreScotland probably did not deserve this victory. Greece fired 24 shots at the Scottish goal. The Tartan Army had to watch the second period through their fingers. Greece will complain vehemently about the circumstances attached to the only goal of the game. Still, Scotland’s attitude alone meant they were deserving of good fortune.They opened 2025 in the same manner as 2024 was closed, against a team who have a formidable home record. Clarke can legitimately point out Craig Gordon, his veteran goalkeeper, had little to do. Hampden Park and the second leg promises to be quite the spectacle. “This game is not dead yet. No way.” Clarke warned. “First half we were really good, we could’ve been two in front. If I’m being greedy I could say three. We knewGreecewould come at us second half. We didn’t quite manage to regain our rhythm so we had to show a different side to our game.”Clarke had resisted temptation to deploy fit-again Kieran Tierney from the start. Scotland’s manager determined recent success with four at the back mattered more than finding a role for the Arsenal player. With Tierney and Andy Robertson both involved, Scotland have typically reverted to a five-man backline. Clarke’s key switch involved the introduction of Lewis Ferguson, outstanding upon return from injury at Bologna, to his midfield.It may be that Greece consider it unfair they find themselves in this scenario at all. They lost one of six matches in Group B2, with England squeezing into the top tier at their expense. Scotland had looked certain for automatic relegation before a stirring finish to their league campaign, epitomised by Robertson’s93rd-minute winner against Polandin November. That Warsaw moment earned potential salvation via this Greece tie. Robertson returned to his international happy place following a domestic spell which has seen Liverpool bundled out of the Champions League and suffer defeat in the League Cup final.The match opened in breathless style before Anthony Ralston produced a terrific header to clear a menacing Georgios Masouras cross. Despite impressive ball retention Scotland offered little by way of attacking response until the 26th minute, when the marauding Ché Adams failed to find Scott McTominay.The key moment of the night involved both McTominay and the whiff of controversy. The Napoli midfielder first appeared to stand on the ball upon entering the Greece penalty area, but Lazaros Rota collided with him thereafter. A spot-kick was awarded, with McTominay dusting himself down to send the goalkeeper the wrong way and notch his 12th Scotland goal. All of them have come in competitive matches. Greece had fiercly contested the decision as, in fairness, would Scotland had the scenario played out in reverse.View image in fullscreenAndy Robertson applauds fans after the match.Photograph: Louiza Vradi/ReutersScotland screamed for another penalty three minutes before the break as Kostas Tsimikas nudged Billy Gimour. In truth, Gilmour should have done better with what was a fine scoring opportunity. So, too, should Adams after Greece botched a goal kick routine. Adams flashed another shot wide in the dying seconds. Scotland reached the dressing room with spring in step.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It had, however, crossed the byline before Christos Tzolis knocked it home. The moment epitomised Greece’s new approach, which saw the Scots forced to defend with increased desperation. Kostas Karetsas, the 17-year-old introduced at half-time, was central to the hosts’ spell of dominance. By the hour, Scotland were weathering a storm. Seven minutes later, a post saved Clarke’s side after a glorious Karetsas cross found Tzolis. By the time John Souttar deflected a Tzolis shot wide – the Scotland defender knew little about this – it felt a matter of time before an equaliser landed.Greece were awarded an 84th minute penalty, Grant Hanley’s lazy leg catching Taxiarchis Fountas. The decision was soon and correctly overturned; the foul took place outside the penalty area. Dimitrios Pelkas whacked the free-kick into the Scottish wall. This summed up Greece’s night. Scotland are 90 minutes from remaining at the top table.Explore more on these topicsNations LeagueScotlandGreecematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Many of the country’s early player imports hailed from Brazil, home to Japan’s largest diaspora as a result of steady migration in the early 20th century. Nelson Yoshimura, a second-generation Japanese-Brazilian, joined the Japan Soccer League’s Yanmar Diesel (now Cerezo Osaka) in 1967, earning 46 senior caps for Japan after naturalizing in 1970.Other Brazilian players, including those without Japanese heritage, followed Yoshimura’s path. In addition to a trophy-laden career with the JSL’s Yomiuri SC and its J.League successor Verdy Kawasaki, midfielder Rui Ramos contributed to Japan’s landmark 1992 Asian Cup triumph and nearly led the country to its first World Cup berth a year later.Wagner Lopes became Japan’s first naturalized World Cup player at France 1998, while Alessandro Santos, scouted as a 16-year-old by Kochi Prefecture’s Meitoku Gijuku High School, wore Japan’s trademark blue shirt for the 2002 and 2006 editions. Four years later, defender Marcus Tulio Tanaka, a third-generation Japanese-Brazilian, helped guide Japan to the last 16 in South Africa.“The Japanese fans supported the naturalized players exactly like the Japanese-born players as far as I could see,” says veteran soccer writer Michael Plastow. “If there was something special, perhaps it was a sense of gratitude.”Meanwhile, Japan’s demographics gradually changed. A sustained wave of Brazilian and Peruvian workers in the 1980s and 90s gave way to more immigration from southeast Asia and Africa. Though the country’s birth rate declined by nearly 42% between 1987 and 2022, births to at least one non-Japanese parent rose from 1.3% to 4.1% in that same period.That figure is reflected by an increase inhaafucall-ups over the last decade, with four such players in Japan’s 2024 Olympic squad – three more than at any previous Games – and at least one in each World Cup list since 2014.In particular, the last two World Cup cycles have seenhaafufeature frequently between the goalposts, including Qatar 2022 backup Daniel Schmidt, current Samurai Blue starter Zion Suzuki, and Leo Brian Kokubo, Japan’s keeper at the Paris Games.These players have flourished in a physically demanding position that Japan has often struggled to develop: the 6ft 3in Suzuki, Kokubo or Taishi Brandon Nozawa, who are both 6ft 4in, could all potentially become the country’s tallest-ever World Cup goalkeeper. But they and their outfield colleagues have grown up in a society that has not always accepted them openly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Almost half said they’d suffered from mental health issues, a rate five times the Japanese national average.“I’ve experienced the empty seat next to me on the [crowded] train, and when you’re young you wonder, ‘Why?’ But now I can understand,” Jamaican-Japanese forward and Rio 2016 selection Musashi Suzukitold the Asahi Shimbunnewspaper in 2021. “Japanese just aren’t used to seeing people who don’t look like them. As Japan becomes more global, Japanese will have more opportunities to interact with people of other races. I think society is slowly changing.”Despite those changes, racial abuse aimed athaafuplayers – particularly those with Black heritage – has also increased on social media. Zion Suzuki, whose father is Ghanaian, publicly urged fans to stop writing discriminatory messages and comments during last year’s Asian Cup in Qatar, where he failed to record a clean sheet in five starts as the Samurai Blue exited in the quarterfinals.Gianni Infantino and Donald Trump have taken the 2026 World Cup for themselves | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead more“I’ve received [discriminatory comments] since elementary school, but I won’t give in to them,” Suzukitold Number Webafter the tournament. “I could have pretended to ignore [the messages], but I wanted to share my story in the hope that it could help not only soccer players, but athletes and young children with all kinds of roots.”Though soccer’s status as a global game has increasingly been defined through the lens of immigration – 16.5% of Japanese players in the last World Cup were foreign-born,according to Vox– the increase ofhaafuin Japan’s squad is instead a story of integration.Among mixed-race players born and raised in Japanese-speaking households, there is no question as to who they’re playing for.“It’s not the idea that there are many different kinds of people representing [Japan], but rather that once you’re in the national team, you’re the same as everyone else,” says Colombian-Japanese attacker Kein Sato, an Olympic teammate of Kokubo’s and one of threehaafuat FC Tokyo who have represented Japan in international competition.“I think when you wear theHi no maru[Japanese flag], you’re prepared to fight like hell for Japan whether you’rehaafuor pure Japanese, and I think we all feel the same way.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026JapanWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Of that, it is understood $2.5m will go to the winning club, and what was described as a “hefty” portion of that will go the players and coaching staff.What are the rules?Each game will be 30 minutes long, split into two 15-minute halves, with rolling substitutions. A half-sized pitch will be used, with slightly smaller goals than would normally be seen in 11-a-side-football. The teams are set to be divided into two groups of four, before a semi-final and final, and the organisers are hoping that high-scoring games with frequent one-on-one dribbling and a flurry of goalmouth action will make the format appealing to a new generation of fans. “It’s supposed to be exciting and creative with lots of freedom of expression,” the former England international Anita Asante, who is part of the tournament advisory council, said. “That’s why I was so excited to get on board.”View image in fullscreenAnita Asante is part of the tournament advisory council.Photograph: Bristol City FCWhere is this event being staged?The inaugural tournament will be staged from 21-23 May in Estoril, Portugal, on a grass pitch at Estádio António Coimbra da Mota, where it is understood a “stadium within a stadium” will be built around a half-sized pitch for the seven-a-side games. It is in close proximity to Lisbon, which is hosting the Women’s Champions League final on 24 May. The venues for the series’ future events have not yet been announced but the organisers say they are planning to go to cities “across the United States, Mexico, Asia, Europe and beyond” in the future. One source suggested to the Guardian that the second competition in the series, set to be held in November-December 2025, was likely to be held in the Americas.Who is behind the idea?World Sevens Football, backed by vast financial investment from the US-based philanthropist Jennifer Mackesy, co-owner of the NWSL club Gotham FC, has a senior leadership group made up of experienced women’s football executives, some of whom have not yet been revealed, but on Thursday the group named the former US women’s international and Bay FC co-founder Aly Wagner as its chief of strategy, while its chief executive is the entrepreneur Justin Fishkin. The organisers say players will be “at the heart” of the event and they have been guided by a player advisory council, which is led by respected former internationals in Tobin Heath, Caroline Seger, Asante, Kelley O’Hara and Laura Georges, who previously spent more than seven years as the secretary general of the French Football Federation.View image in fullscreenBayern Munich are said to among a number of clubs interested in taking part in the tournament.Photograph: Sven Beyrich/SPP/ShutterstockWhich teams are taking part?At present, no teams have been confirmed for May’s inaugural event but it is understood that, because the Champions League finalists will be the only teams that are not eligible to be involved, most of the participating clubs may not be announced until after the latter stages of that competition. Nonetheless, the sevens event is understood to have been heavily oversubscribed. At least two Women’s Super League teams are likely to take part in May, with Angel City and Bayern Munich also among a long list of clubs said to be interested.How will it be decided which clubs are involved?At present, that remains somewhat unclear, except that it is an invitational event and it appears to be at the full discretion of the organisers. However, a different set of eight teams are expected to be involved in the second staging of the event later in 2025, and different teams again in 2026, as the organisers work to avoid any clashes with domestic schedules, rather than the same clubs taking part every time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAren’t players’ schedules already congested?Yes, which will make this new event controversial, in some people’s eyes. When asked about this specific issue, the organisers said their short-match format has been deliberately designed to minimise the load on players. Teams can bring a full-sized squad and then will select a 14-player squad for each 30-minute match, and then are allowed to use rolling subs, so it’s expected that a typical player might play fewer than 90 minutes of football in total across the entire event. Asante said: “The competition rules are designed with the players in mind, to cope with load.”Will players heading to Euro 2025 be allowed to take part?Technically, as this event is being staged outside a Fifa international window, the players’ availability will lie in the hands of their clubs and not their national teams. That said, it remains to be seen whether any national team coaches will seek to restrict the involvement of any of their players or perhaps request that their minutes be managed across the three-day event. But Georges hinted the tournament is aimed at unearthing some of the next generation, not just adding to first-choice international starting established players’ schedules.View image in fullscreenEngland players such as Lauren James may be able to participate before heading to Euro 2025.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Apl/SportsphotoDoes this event need Uefa or Fifa approval to go ahead?Technically, no, with those organisations overseeing traditional 11-a-side football and not seven-a-side, and while World Sevens Football has been in regular dialogue with Fifa and Uefa, it says it does not want to pitch itself as a “competitor” to the 11-a-side tournaments but rather to provide a new way of injecting investment into the women’s game.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballexplainersShareReuse this content"

It doesn’t sound like much, does it? But Thomas Tuchel has informed his England players that’show much time they have to work togetherbefore next year’s World Cup. Hence, for readers of a certain vintage and fittingly for a tournament across the pond, there will be a strong A-Team vibe to the next 16 months, beginning with Friday’s qualifier against Albania at Wembley. Can Tuchel and his coaching team lock themselves away in a barn and weld togetheran improvised assault vehiclecapable of winning the final, on 19 July 2026, in the space of 24 days? Instead of Templeton Peck and BA Baracus, Tuchel will work alongside Anthony Barry, Nicolas Mayer and Henrique Hilário.We don’t know how much experience they have of randomly bolting machine guns on to cars, but it has been established that Barry, Tuchel’s No 2, oncesifted through footage of 16,154 throw-insin his hunger to find a tactical edge. Tuchel himself boasts the gravitas and charisma of Hannibal, combined with a relentless tactical obsession, laser-like attention to detail and asuitably-accomplished coaching CV. While the German credits Pep Guardiola as a major influence, Barry is said to be an authority on second balls and knockdowns, music to the ears of any England fan who believesSam Allardycewas the greatest manager the country (almost) never had. How many recoveries in the final third will be feasible in the searing heat of a North American summer? Let’s “cross that bridge when we are at the river,” Tuchel tooted.Of course, working on the assumption that England will qualify demonstrates quintessential English arrogance. But taken together Serbia, Albania, Latvia and Andorra don’t constitute the most intimidating adversaries in Group K. The Three Lions are unlikely to need a crunch game against the Netherlands, as they did in failing to qualify for USA 94, just as Tuchel is unlikely to watch a tape of that encounter for tactical inspiration. Graham Taylor’s cry of “That’s good enough!” after Tony Dorigo hacked the ball in the general direction of the Dutch goal exemplifies the level of tactical expertise he brought, and how much things have changed. Compare and contrast with Tuchel, who requires that every pass should be played to a teammate’s preferred foot.Anyway, there is a growing sense that he is the right man at the right time, after last week’s first squad selection, combined with the new-term enthusiasm of his players. But no plan survives first contact with the enemy so we will know a little more after 90 minutes against Albania. And always lurking somewhere beneath the surface is the fear – or the hope, for all the haterz – that the temperamental Tuchel will spontaneously combust at some point, pushed beyond boiling point by an intrusive hack or one too many passes to the incorrect foot. Gareth Southgate said this week that trophies arenot the only marker of success, an idea emphatically proved by the manner in which Tuchel’s predecessor transformed the culture in the squad, revolutionised external perceptions and generally brought the good times back to England. Time is short but thanks to Southgate, there are no fires to put out, and the objective is clear. Perhaps 24 days will be just enough for a plan to come together.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT for hot Nations League clockwatch updates, including the quarter-finals, plus Greece v Scotland.QUOTE OF THE DAY“I’m getting used to being a centre-forward, fighting with the centre-backs, them hitting you from behind.

Any suggestions of the eventual 5-1 scoreline would have been laughable as travelling supporters and the local Indonesian diaspora made a mockery of any home advantage with a sea of red surrounding the Sydney Football Stadium pitch before kick-off, auguring a tide of furious pressure and intent upon the opening whistle.In just the fifth minute, a free-kick swung in from the right by Calvin Verdonk beat the outstretched head of Cameron Burgess and found Jay Idzes, whose resulting header forced Mat Ryan into a diving save. The roar from the stands felt like it shook the foundations. Two minutes later, a ball lofted over the top of the defensive line fell for Rafael Struick, who Kye Rowles clipped for a penalty.Australia 5-1 Indonesia: World Cup 2026 qualifier – as it happenedRead moreAustralia looked like they didn’t know what was happening. This wasn’t the same Indonesiathey faced in Jakarta last September, a team who had largely been content to sit back and absorb pressure. In his first game in charge, Patrick Kluivert instructed his side not to take a backward step, to harry and press with a high line and deny their hosts a moment’s peace. The result was an almost frantic panic from the Socceroos in possession, as if Indonesia’s decision to try to win the game, as opposed to not lose it, had caught them unawares.“It was arguably the hardest I’ve been pressed in a home game in a long time,” Jackson Irvine said. “They were absolutely flying through. There was absolutely no time on the ball in the middle of the park.”But rather than give his nation a deserved lead, Kevin Diks’ attempt from 12 yards smashed off the post and back into play. It was hit with such power that the frame of goal continued to rattle well after the Socceroos had desperately scrambled the ball away. And the reverberations continue to be felt longer.View image in fullscreenKevin Diks misses from the penalty spot.Photograph: Mark Baker/APA shade under 10 minutes later,Australiahad a corner. And while the Indonesians did enough to initially see off the danger, a subsequent VAR found that Nathan Tjoe-A-On had wrapped Lewis Miller in an embrace as the ball was swung in. The Socceroos had a penalty. And unlike Diks, Martin Boyle struck true, sending Maarten Paes the wrong way.Just three minutes later, Jason Geria turned inside Marselino Ferdinan and played a pass to Boyle, who knocked a first-time effort to Adam Taggart. A surprise selection up top, the Perth Glory frontman, who came off at halftime with a groin complaint, turned Idzes and clashed with Thom Haye. Regardless of who got the telling touch from that collision, it saw the ball loop out in front of a galloping Nishan Velupilay to advance on goal and fire beyond the advancing Paes.In three defining moments, the game was irrevocably altered. The air had been taken out of the Indonesian players on the field and the fans in the stands. All of a sudden, the malevolence that came with their pressure had lessened. The confidence and comfort of Australia, in contrast, was growing, and combinations and patterns began to become noticeable in their attacking play. It is remarkable what a two-goal buffer will do for the nerves.“If you score the penalty, it will be a totally different match,” said Kluivert.“But unfortunately, Kevin hit the post and from that moment, we changed something in our minds or something. We didn’t play our game anymore.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was 4-0 in the 61st when Craig Goodwin, inserted as a half-time substitute for Boyle, swung a corner onto the head of a diving Miller. Ole Romeny’s 78th-minute consolation meant the Socceroos are still seeking a first clean sheet of the Tony Popovic era but it was answered by Irvine’s second in the 90th.Ultimately, this was a game of Popaball that did what it said on the tin and, after being given a second wind through an early reprieve, did it well. Grabbing an early two-goal cushion, Australia had 40% possession and were outshot 10 to nine. They had 11 touches in Indonesia’s penalty area to 18. But they gotsettled. They found their shape. They were clinical. And they won comfortably, taking a major step towards the tournament in 2026.“It’s a step in the right direction,” said Irvine. “Of course, there’s a lot to improve on.“But overall, in a big game at home, five goals and the reaction after a poor start to the game, really pleased. We showed a lot of different elements to our game.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersAustraliaAustralia sportmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Littler sent the Cardiff crowd wild with perfect darts in the fourth leg, and the 18-year-old had to be at his brilliant best to ward off a revitalised Van Gerwen.The world champion hit a remarkable 10 180s and returned a match average of 112.50 to extend his Premier League lead to six points. “I didn’t even realise the double 15 was in until Huw [Ware, the referee] shouted it,” said reigning Premier League champion Littler of his final shot.‘FA Cup of darts’ keeps grassroots flame alive as big-money era shapes to snuff it outRead more“I hit one two weeks ago at the Pro Tour and I went the treble 17, double 15 route after missing double 12 numerous times last year. So I think that’s the new route to go for this year.“You’ve seen players in the world championships hit the nine and go out in that game, so I had to focus after that. Michael won the next two legs but I managed to get back into it.“It’s good to pick up another nightly win, more crucial points, and to have a six-point over Luke [Humphries] is a good boost for myself.”In a match of the highest quality – Van Gerwen also hit four maximums and averaged 101.41 – Littler set the pattern by breaking the first throw of the match in 15 darts. Van Gerwen responded instantly, but Littler broke again in 12 darts before extending a two-leg cushion with his perfect leg.The seesaw nature of the continued as Van Gerwen levelled with the help of a bullseye finish, but Littler replied in kind and moved through the gears after being pulled back at 4-4.Littler had earlier defeated Rob Cross 6-2 at the semi-final stage after eliminating Nathan Aspinall 6-3 in low-key affair in his first game.

The first outlined that he asked players of Asian backgrounds what their “Cricinfo” age was, thus “implying that Asian players do not tell the truth about their age”.Mark Wood expected to miss England’s Tests against India after knee surgeryRead moreThe second said Bradburn “made comments that, in cricket selection decisions in Pakistan, they would pick their friends and cousins or pick their names out of a hat”. The ­former New Zealand international was ­Pakistan’s head coach in 2023 before joining Glamorgan in ­January 2024.The third said that during fielding ­sessions Bradburn used the phrase “‘this isn’t Western Storm’ [the ­women’s cricket team] or ­similar when he considered that male players were demonstrating a lack of ­intensity in their fielding or not throwing hard enough”.Regarding the Western Storm ­comment Tim O’Gorman, the CDC’s adjudicator, added: “The Cricket ­Regulator submitted that Mr ­Bradburn’s position as a head coach increased the seriousness of the offending in determining sanction because their view is that culture in any organisation starts from the top down and Mr Bradburn’s actions undermined the ECB’s and the game of cricket’s objective in being the most inclusive sport.“The CR argued that this is ­illustrated by the fact that players picked up on Mr Bradburn’s words regarding Western Storm and started using those words themselves.”O’Gorman found that ­Bradburn’s conduct “perpetuated ­stereotypes” and had racist and sexist ­“connotations”, but “there was no racist or discriminatory intent in the comments made”. He added that Bradburn “meant no offence, never denied making these statements, cooperated fully with the investigation, and unreservedly apologised if any offence was taken”.In addition to his fine – which is suspended for a year – caution and reprimand, Bradburn is required to attend an educational course.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Red Bull went on to win all but one of the races that season with Verstappen cruising to the title in the most dominant yearFormula Onehas seen.And speaking about McLaren before this weekend’s Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, the Mercedes driver Russell said: “Their car is definitely capable of winning every race. Their car should win every race.“I don’t think they will, let’s see, but the gap they have on everybody this year was bigger than Red Bull has ever had. Red Bull’s advantage was maybe three or four tenths, but the advantage we are seeing from McLaren right now is definitely bigger than that.“But you know, when Max was in that car he was pretty reliable every single lap and he did every single run in Q3 or throughout qualifying, and it was never really in question. Hopefully we can be there to capitalise like we did last weekend because it should have been a one-two finish for them [McLaren].”View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell took an impressive third place in Melbourne.Photograph: Michael Potts/ShutterstockBy the time the second safety car was introduced on lap 34 in Melbourne, after Fernando Alonso crashed out, Norris was 18 seconds clear of the third-placed Verstappen and more than half-a-minute in front of Russell, who was running in fourth.He arrives in Shanghai leading the drivers’ standings for the first time – ending Verstappen’s 63-race streak at the summit – and the 25-year-old conceded in the aftermath of the opening round that he now has to be considered the title favourite given the early advantage his McLaren team holds.But asked whether his mindset has changed, Norris said: “It makes no difference for me at the minute. I’m not thinking about it. I don’t really care about it.It shouldn’t change anything I do, it shouldn’t change what the team do. I had one good weekend. People need to calm down a little bit.“I know I stay focused and I try and do the same here this weekend, but I probably won’t even think of the championship until at least halfway through the year.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneLando NorrisGeorge RussellMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s not the most important thing,” Wasserman said. “What’s important is helping people get back into their homes, get back settled, get back with their lives.”Another expected challenge for LA organizers is ensuring athletes, officials and fans from every Olympic team feel welcome and safe going to the United States during a time of unstable geopolitics.“Irrespective of politics today, America will be open and accepting to all 209 countries for the Olympics,” Wasserman said. “LA is the most diverse city in the history of humanity and we will welcome the people from around the world and give them all a great time.”Updating IOC and sports leaders on Thursday, Wasserman said his team made “significant strides” with Donald Trump’s administration, which has security obligations for the Olympics and subsequent Paralympics.“I have met with President Trump and his team both prior to his inauguration and again last month,” Wasserman said. “We have a regular cadence across all federal agencies with leadership from the president to make sure that these Games deliver for all our constituents.”The US visa program – and current restrictions for more than 40 countries who will compete in LA – was the subject of a sharp question from IOC member Ingmar de Vos, the equestrian official who leads the collective group of Summer Games sports bodies. De Vos cited a “red list” ban on travel to the US from 11 countries.“I don’t anticipate any, any problems from any countries to come and participate,” Wasserman replied, noting the US State Department has a “fully staffed desk” to help prepare.“In my many conversations with President Trump and [Secretary of State Marco Rubio] they understand the scale and complexity required to deliver these Games, the access required for not just athletes but for delegations, and the incredibly short time frame on which to do those.”Wasserman insisted “with all due respect to Fifa,” visa issues for the Olympics are more complicatedthan for the men’s World Cup, which the US is co-hosting next year with Canada and Mexico. His audience included IOC member Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president who hasclosely aligned himself with Trump.IOC member Gene Sykes, who is also president of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, promised his city and nation will “extend warmth and respect” to all visitors. “The recent tragic wildfires tested our community,” Sykes said, “yet they illuminated our resilience and determination.”Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesLos AngelesCaliforniaCalifornia wildfiresWest CoastKendrick LamarnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "1:25'It is significant': Kirsty Coventry voted first female president of IOC – videoInternational Olympic CommitteeKirsty Coventry elected first female president of IOC as Coe routed in voteZimbabwean former swimmer won majority in first roundSebastian Coe is third; Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr secondSean Inglein Costa NavarinoThu 20 Mar 2025 12.09 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 17.35 EDTShareThe Zimbabwean swimmer Kirsty Coventry has become the first woman to lead theInternational Olympic Committeein its 131-year history after a stunning first-round knockout over a seven-strong field that included Britain’s Sebastian Coe.In a contest that had been expected to go through multiple rounds of voting, the 41-year-old won 49 of the 97 votes in the first round, giving her an immediate majority. She is the first African to become IOC president and becomes the most powerful woman in global sport.But it was a crushing day for Coe, who could only secure eight votes, putting him third behind the Spaniard Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr with 28.So who is Kirsty Coventry, who now has global sport’s most powerful job? | Sean IngleRead moreCoventry’s victory came despite a manifesto that was widely seen as bland, and a campaign that started slowly. However, in the final few days before the secret ballot, strong lobbying from outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach and other senior IOC members proved to be crucial in tipping support her way.Suddenly a contest that had been fought over in the shadows for months was all over in just two minutes: the time it took for the IOC’s quixotic membership of royals, former athletes, politicians and billionaires to throw their weight overwhelmingly behind the seven-time Olympic medallist.It took a while for Bach to confirm the result – and the electronic voting machine of Afghanistan IOC member Samira Asghari appeared not to function. But when it was finally announced Coventry, who won seven Olympic medals in swimming including gold in the 200 metre backstroke at the 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing Games, was full of smiles.“The young girl who first started swimming inZimbabweall those years ago could never have dreamt of this moment,” she said. “I am particularly proud to be the first female IOC president, and also the first from Africa. I hope that this vote will be an inspiration to many people.“Glass ceilings have been shattered today, and I am fully aware of my responsibilities as a role model. I will make all of you very, very proud and hopefully extremely confident in the decision you have taken. Now we have got some work together.”Beforehand Coe was widely accepted to have the best CV, having won two Olympic gold medals, run the London 2012 Games and having beenWorld Athleticspresident since 2015.He had hoped to get votes by positioning himself as the change candidate, who would make the IOC more democratic and also protect women’s sport.However, his strategy to get the backing of a majority of former athletes before winning a majority in the later rounds when other candidates dropped out was blown away.“It’s very early to start poring over the numbers, but I think it’s pretty clear that the athletes, and in particular the female members, voted for her in very big numbers in the first round,” Coe admitted. “Clearly it’s a disappointing result, but that’s what happens when you go into an election.”Not all candidates were as downbeat. Japan’s candidate Morinari Watanabe, the president of international gymnastics who came fourth with four votes, summed up his efforts succinctly afterwards. “Eight years gone in two minutes,” he said, smiling as he clapped his hands.Coe’s chances were certainly hindered by becoming an implacable enemy ofBachwhen World Athletics banned all Russian athletes from the Rio 2016 Olympics for state sponsored doping.But the stark reality is that there was probably little any candidate could have done given Bach’s power and influence over the organisation he has run since 2013, during which time he has appointed more than two-thirds of the electorate.The 71-year-old German, who was voted in as honorary president on Wednesday, will continue to wield significant influence even if he denied having a direct involvement in Coventry’s victory afterwards. “There is a good democratic rule, when you don’t win,” he said. “Don’t blame the voters and don’t blame the procedure.”But while many will rejoice at the first woman to lead the IOC, her election victory will be seen as controversial in some quarters.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe addresses the media as he reacts after the results.Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty ImagesPart of that is because Coventry is the sports minister of a Zimbabwean government that is subject to sanctions from Britain, which are “aimed at encouraging the Government of Zimbabwe to respect democratic principles and institutions and the rule of law”.Human Rights Watch’s assessment of Zimbabwe reads: “In August 2023, President Emerson Mnangagwa was reelected in an election characterized by repression of civil and political rights. Southern African Development Community observers and others found that the election failed to meet regional and international standards for free and fair elections.“Following the elections, abductions, arbitrary detention and torture of parliament members, opposition political activists, and human rights defenders escalated. Since then, the government has repeatedly targeted opposition members and activists, holding them in prolonged detention, mistreating them in custody, and weaponizing the judicial system against rights defenders.”Coventry also received US$100,000 (about £55,000 at the time) in cash from Zimbabwe’s former president, Robert Mugabe, upon her return from the Beijing Games in 2008.But for now Coventry, who will take over when Bach formally leaves office on June 23, having reached the maximum 12 years in office, is only looking forward.“Sport has an unmatched power to unite, inspire and create opportunities for all, and I am committed to making sure we harness that power to its fullest,” she said in her victory speech. “The future of the Olympic movement is bright, and I can’t wait to get started.”Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeSport politicsOlympic GamesWinter OlympicsUS sportsAustralia sportZimbabwenewsShareReuse this content"

Haggerty was third in Division I in scoring this year, averaging 21.8 points per game, and he scored 83 points in three games to boost the No 5-seeded Tigers to the American Athletic Conference title.DCThis is like asking me to pick my favorite child, which is easy because I only have one. After having seen her play in person a few times, I have to go with Notre Dame’sHannah Hidalgo. Her game is magnetic. She’s quick on her feet, aggressive and has no problem getting in anyone’s face – it’s fun, exciting, and the kind of basketball I love to see.SKWe’ve already dicussed Cooper Flagg in detail elsewhere, so I’ll go withJase Richardsonfrom Michigan State. The 6ft 3in freshman point guard has an elite shooting touch and is incredibly efficient, with a 59% effective field goal percentage. Richardson embodies the toughness and grit that Tom Izzo values, and he has the potential to lead the Spartans on a deep run.NLMarch Madness 2025 predictions: which of the No 1 seeds are in for a shock?Read morePaige Bueckers is excellent but she and her UConn teammates are complemented by the addition ofAzzi Fudd. After missing pivotal moments through injury – like last year’s Final Four matchup, where her ample shooting range was needed most – Fudd has been one of the comeback players of the year. She was the key factor in UConn’s upset of South Carolina, breaking the Gamecocks’ 71-game home win streak. I’m excited to see how her confidence, quick release, and three-pointers will impact the Huskies.TRWhat are you most looking forward to, on or off the court?The finaltelevision ratings. Fueled by that phenomenon named Caitlin Elizabeth Clark, the women’s finaloutdrew the men’s final on TVfor the first time last year – and by more than 4m viewers. Can the women make it two in a row? Three of the last four men’s finals have been blowouts, decided by 15 points or more.DCOn the court: assuming they can take out South Florida and Ohio State (they can!),Tennessee v Texaswill be one of the banner games to watch in the women’s tournament. When they last met in January, Texas eked out a win by only four points, and Tennessee will be hungry to make a major March impact this year.SKThe potential Rick Pitino v John Calipari matchup. There is a lot of history here. They started as good friends, with Pitino helping Calipari land his first head coaching job at UMass in the early 90s. However, as their programs grew and they became competitors, their relationship soured. A second-round matchup of St John’s and Arkansas could bring plenty of drama.NLI’m curious tosee how LSU adjustafter multiple late-season losses, with or without Flau’jae Johnson. She recently admitted that she’s been playing “the worst basketball” of her career, and it’s clearly hurt the team. Now, with news that she’s out indefinitely, the question is whether Kim Mulkey’s group has the IQ and chemistry to make a Final Four run.TRDark horse team to watch …Three teams have won back-to-back NCAA men’s titles in the last 50 years: Duke (1991-92), Florida (2006-07) andConnecticut(2023-24). The 1993 Duke team were dumped by California in the second round, and the 2008 Gators did not even make theNCAA Tournament. UConn (23-10) are a mere No 8 seed this year, but watch Dan Hurley drag the Huskies farther than either of the previous two-time champs. UCLA, by the way, were the last team to win at least three titles in a row, rolling to seven straight from 1967 to 1973.DCOn the women’s side,Ole Miss. They were already so much fun to watchin their season opener in Parislast year, but the team have grown steadily since then and it wouldn’t be a total surprise if they make a deep run. Assuming they beat No 4 Baylor in the first round, the Landsharks will likely face top overall seed UCLA … who they couldprobablybeat. Maybe.SKYou know your program is elite when a 25-8 season feels like a down year. That’s whereGonzaga’smen’s team are but Mark Few still has a group who rank ninth in the country in adjusted offense. There aren’t many coaches who know how to win in the tournament like Few and his team is coming off a WCC championship run where they avenged their two regular-season losses to Saint Mary’s.NLTheTennessee Lady Volsweren’t on my radar as serious contenders until recently. Their wins over UConn and Iowa proved they’re a team to watch. Before those upsets, they weren’t part of the big-team conversation, and those victories felt more like surprising wins than expected outcomes. The No 5 seed in the Texas Longhorns’ quarter of the bracket, they’re easy to overlook, especially without a clear star player.TRThe most vulnerable top seed is …The women’s four top seeds appear to be stronger than the men’s four top seeds. Of the four men’s top seeds,Auburn(28-5), the No 1 seed overall, lost three of their last four games after winning 27 of their first 29 – although the Southeastern Conference, with an astonishing 14 tournament teams, is quite easily the best league in the nation.DCIn the women’s tournament it’sSouthern California, but that’s just because head coach Lindsay Gottlieb seems pretty concerned about playing in the same regional as UConn (which is fair). If she’s scared, I’m scared, too! Among the men’s teams, it’sFloridabecause Duke have something special going, Houston’s size and ball pressure are insurmountable and Auburn are the top overall seed on merit.SKDukehave an embarrassment of riches on their roster, but even so, having the best men’s player in the country dealing with injury is a tough blow. Will thelikely No 1 overall pickin this year’s NBA draft risk playing through injury? Time will tell.NLSouthern California women. They rely too heavily onJuJu Watkinsand struggle with team basketball – it’s as simple as getting the ball to Watkins, even her teammate Kiki Iriafen has said as much. And it reminds me a lot of last year’s Iowa where their strategy was simply getting Caitlin Clark the ball.TROne bold prediction …The energetic and entertainingBill Raftery will once again stand aloneamong television commentators of either tournament, especially if he is egged on by play-by-play man Ian Eagle. Raftery, 81, is the enthusiastic ex-coach from New Jersey known for hollering “Onions!” when a player coolly hits a crucial big shot. Onions, in this case, represent testicles.DCNC State win the entire women’s tournament. There is something so special about the combination of Saniya Rivers, Aziaha James and Zamareya Jones and the way they absolutely hammer their opponents when the team is synchronized. I’d also love to see someone new in the championship game.SKThe University of California San Diego menare in their first season of postseason eligibility. If you appreciate ball movement and connected defense, you’ll enjoy watching this Triton team. They lead the country in turnover margin, and their first-round opponent, Michigan, are prone to turnovers. The size difference is concerning but the Tritons have been elite at doubling the post all year. Let’s see if this is the upset we are all looking for.NLLast year, $2.7bn was legally wagered on the tournament, and I believe this year will surpass that significantly. With the unpredictability of the season – including major losses from even some of the best teams – more people may be inclined to place bets.With gambling culture gripping the US,total wagers could soar to as much as $7bn.TRMen’s final fourMichigan State, St John’s, Duke, Houston.DCMichigan State, Tennessee, Duke, Houston.SKAuburn, Texas Tech, Alabama, Houston.NLAuburn, Florida, Duke, Alabama.TRWomen’s final fourUCLA, Southern California, South Carolina, Texas.DCNC State, UConn, South Carolina, Notre Dame.SKUCLA, Southern California, South Carolina, TCU.NLUCLA, UConn, South Carolina, Notre Dame.TRThe men’s champion will be ...Seven of the last nine NCAA champions have as the top seeds in their regions, which does not appear to be good news for non-No 1 seeds. ButSt John’s, a No 2 seed, have so much going for them – the crafty and rejuvenated Rick Pitino, 19 victories in 20 games, the adoration of a city that loves basketball – that it seems silly to pick against the Red Storm.DCDuke. There’s a lot of chatter about the difficulty of building a championship team with freshmen, but one needs to look only at the not-so-distant past to see that it can be done. Carmelo Anthony, Gerry McNamara and Billy Edelin powered Syracuse to a natty in 2003, a feat replicated by Kentucky’s 2012 squad featuring Anthony Davis. And Duke’s own history backs up the possibility: in 2015 the men’s program pulled off the same feat. That’s as long as Flagg is playing. If not, then it’s anyone’s game.SKAlabamaare battled-tested playing in the rugged SEC. The Crimson Tide play at an uncomfortable pace for their opponents and they have veteran guard play. Mark Sears can be streaky but the kid has proven to be a gamer. Bama rank fourth in adjusted offense and 32nd in adjusted defense in the country. If they can tighten up on the defensive end I like them to cut down the nets in San Antonio.NLDukehave the star power of Flagg – if he’s healthy – but more importantly, they have a strong system and the depth to back it up. Meanwhile, I question the strength of their competition: No 1 overall seed Auburn have a lack of experience in winning a national championship and may struggle to perform under the tournament’s intense pressure, and Houston are missing key quality wins and depth due to injuries to some of their crucial players.TRThe women’s champion will be ...South Carolinawill win their third national title in four years – and fourth in eight – because coach Dawn Staley still patrols the sidelines. Although they are a No 1 seed, the Gamecocks have lost three games this year, or three more than in each of the last two years entering the tournament. But the Gamecocks are deep, tough and experienced, and Staley is the best, not to mention the most intense and audacious, coach in the women’s game.DCUConn. Despite other teams trying to paint themselves as the underdog, Connecticut truly fit the bill in a few key ways. Though the Huskies have reached at least the Final Four every year since, their last championship win came in the 2015-16 season. This year, however, everything seems to be aligning in their favor. Bueckers is headed to the WNBA, Fudd may join her, whil Aubrey Griffin could hear her name called in the second round. The team is healthier than they’ve been in years and has fought its way out of a midseason slump that once seemed endless.SKSouthern California. Rarely does a freshman carry their team to a national championship (Carmelo Anthony being one notable exception). JuJu Watkins was close last year, and that experience seems to have fueled her, as she’s taken her game to another level. The Trojans enter the tournament with a 28-3 record, still feeling like they have something to prove. Watkins makes her case for the best player in the country as she leads USC to the school’s first national title since 1984.NLUConn. The storyline of Bueckers returning for her fifth year with a national championship in mind has been drilled into her teammates, coaches and the press for a while now – it would be foolish for them not to take it seriously. The Huskies’ three in-season losses were either close or were due to issues that have been addressed and ironed out. They play true team basketball, and while most teams are tightening their rotations at this stage, UConn are actually adding depth with previously injured players like Griffin, Fudd, Ice Brady and Caroline Ducharme now healthy and ready to contribute. If they can remain healthy and mentally strong, UConn should regain their status as the strongest women’s college program in the land.TRExplore more on these topicsNCAA Tournament 2025NCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said Musk faced a “moment of truth” and needed to act.“Tesla and Musk are facing a defining chapter in their future and how Musk handles this next few months will be pivotal to the long-term growth trajectory of Tesla in our view,” he wrote. “Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla … they are synonymous and attached together and cannot be separated.”Ives said Musk had to do two things to stop the crisis snowballing into a “much more black swan event”, a reference to an unforeseen event with wide-ranging consequences.Ives said Musk needed to announce formally that he was going to balance running Doge with being Tesla’s chief executive. Doing so would “dissipate” the heat around Tesla and avoid permanent brand damage, although there would still be a “scar”, he said.“Investors need to see Musk take a step back and balance his Doge and Tesla CEO roles,” Ives said.He also called on Musk to set out plans and timing for the release of new, cheaper vehicles along with the rollout of fully self-driving vehicles in Austin, Texas, in June. “There is one person Tesla investors need to hear from … Musk,” Ives said.The Vancouver Auto Show said it was removing Tesla hours before the show got under way on Wednesday in western Canada, with organisers telling reporters the decision had not been made lightly.“The Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla as a participant in this week’s event, after the automaker was provided multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw,” the show’s executive director, Eric Nicholl, said in a statement.“The Vancouver Auto Show’s primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors and staff. This decision will ensure all attendees can be solely focused on enjoying the many positive elements of the event.”Last year nearly 130,000 people attended the show. Organisers said they were expecting a similar turnout for this year’s lineup of 200 or so vehicles.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a post on social media the group urged protesters to “turn out in numbers to fight Elon Musk’s illegal coup”.In an interview this week, Musk called Tesla protesters “deranged” and blamed the protests on his involvement with Doge. “They basically want to kill me because I’m stopping their fraud, and they want to hurt Tesla because we’re stopping this terrible waste and corruption in the government,” he told Fox News.Trump’s commerce secretary defended the company on Wednesday, urging Americans to buy Tesla stock.“I think, if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,”Howard Lutnick told Fox News. “It’s unbelievable that this guy’s stock is this cheap. It’ll never be this cheap again.”However, Tesla shares were down more than 1% on Thursday afternoon.The Tesla recall issued on Thursday was related to a part called a cant rail – a stainless-steel exterior trim panel – delaminating and detaching from the vehicle, the company said. As a remedy, Tesla will replace the rail assembly free of charge.A detached panel can become a road hazard and increase the risk of a crash, according to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s notice on the recalls.Tesla was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskTechnology sectorDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The writing’s on the wall that this is going to transform things, it’s going to be the new way of doing forecasting,” Turner said. He said the model would eventually be able to produce accurate eight-day forecasts, compared with five-day forecast at present, as well as hyper-localised predictions.Dr Scott Hosking, the director of science and innovation for environment and sustainability at the Alan Turing Institute, said the breakthrough could “democratise forecasting” by making powerful technologies available to developing nations around the world, as well as assisting policymakers, emergency planners and industries that rely on accurate weather forecasts.Dr Anna Allen, the lead author of the paper, from the University of Cambridge, noted that the findings paved the way for better forecasts of natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires and tornadoes, as well as other climatic issues such as air quality, ocean dynamics and sea ice predictions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Quantum computing’s ability to crunch numbers at incredible speed makes it a serious threat to encryption, said the NCSC.EU accuses Google and Apple of breaking its rules, risking Trump clashRead more“While today’s encryption methods – used to protect everything from banking to secure communications – rely on mathematical problems that current-generation computers struggle to solve, quantum computers have the potential to solve them much faster, making current encryption methods insecure,” said the agency.The NSCS is recommending that large organisations, operators of critical national infrastructure such as energy and transport and companies with bespoke IT systems introduce post-quantum cryptography to counter the threat.Under the guidance, organisations should identify services that need an upgrade by a deadline of 2028, then carry out the most important overhauls by 2031 and complete the migration to a new encryption system by 2035.“Our new guidance on post-quantum cryptography provides a clear roadmap for organisations to safeguard their data against these future threats, helping to ensure that today’s confidential information remains secure in years to come,” said the NCSC chief technical officer, Ollie Whitehouse.Traditional computers encode their information in bits – represented as a 0 or a 1 – but their quantum counterparts use qubits, which can encode various combinations of 1s and 0s at the same time. As a result, quantum computers can in theory compute their way through vast numbers of different outcomes and carry out far bigger calculations than previously thought possible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The NCSC is hoping its new advice will give organisations plenty of time to be ready for when quantum computers come onstream.“Now that there are new methods for public key encryption, it makes sense to migrate now rather than wait for the threat to becoming real,” said Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeCrimeTechnology sectorHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

And I think we can easily see ourselves manufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the US.”Bank of England expected to leave interest rates on hold today, as wage growth slows and redundancies rise – business liveRead moreThe remarks are the latest example of how Trump’s “America First” policy is having an impact on business investment, even forcing groups such as Nvidia – which is among the world’s most valuable companies – to rethink their global footprint.The Silicon Valley company, founded in 1993, has been the engine of the AI market boom, with hype around the technology propelling its valuation to a stratospheric $2.9tn (£2.2tn). But in recent years it and other big US tech companies, such as Apple, have become increasing dependent on chipmaking facilities in Taiwan run by TSMC and Foxconn – a supply chain now under threat from trade wars and from China’sterritorial designs on its neighbour.Huang said he was confident that Nvidia was well-positioned to deal with any worsening situation in Taiwan, which is also vulnerable to earthquakes. “At this point, we know that we can manufacture in the US, we have a sufficiently diversified supply chain,” he added.He added that the Trump administration could be in a position to bolster the US AI industry at a time of growing competition from China.Huawei, for example, had become the “single most formidable technology company in China”, having “conquered every market they’ve engaged”. Huang argued US efforts to constrain the Chinese company had been “done poorly”, as evidenced by Huawei’s continued success.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Taiwanese semiconductor firm’s investment means that Nvidia’s Blackwell chips – its top-of-the-line graphics processing unit – are being produced in the US, providing for “a substantial step up in our supply chain resilience”.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

It also comes as Musk is getting closer to launching his other key ventures, Starlink and Tesla, in India.In the new court filing, dated 5 March, X argues that India’s IT ministry is asking other departments to use a government website launched by the home affairs ministry last year to issue content-blocking orders and mandate social media companies to join the website too. This mechanism, X says, does not contain the stringent Indian legal safeguards on content removal that required such orders to be issued in cases such as harm to sovereignty or public order, and came with strict oversight of top officials.Value of Elon Musk’s X ‘rebounds to $44bn purchase price’Read moreIndia’s IT ministry redirected a request for comment to the home affairs ministry, which did not respond.The government website creates “an impermissible parallel mechanism” that causes “unrestrained censorship of information in India“,Xsaid, adding it is seeking to quash the directive.X’s court papers are not public and were reported for the first time by media on Thursday. The case was briefly heard earlier this week by a judge in the high court of southern Karnataka state but no final decision was reached. It will now be heard on 27 March.In 2021, X, formerly called Twitter, was locked in a standoff with the Indian government over noncompliance of legal orders to block certain tweets related to a farmers’ protest against government policies.

But attorneys for the plaintiffs called the access unprecedented.In her ruling Hollander also instructed Doge to “disgorge and delete” any non-anonymized data it has obtained from the SSA since Trump took office, and said the agency cannot install or access any software in social security systems.Social security payments are a lifeline for millions of elderly Americans across the country and any effort to cut back the system is widely seen as a political minefield.

They were variously described as “obsessively possessive”, “aggressively jealous”, “a kidnapper and a killer”. Further text described yanking the woman “into the car, swiftly knocking her out”, with the woman asking: “What if I enjoy this?”The ASA said the ad was “suggestive and implied scenarios involving violent and coercive control and a lack of consent”.An ad for an interactive romance story game called My Fantasy featured an animation of a woman being approached by another woman and being pushed on to a desk. Options appeared asking what she should do – “enjoy it”, “push her away”, “please continue” and “stop it”.The ASA said the animations were “strongly suggestive and implied the sexual encounters were not consensual”.The ASA also identified three ads for Love Sparks: Dating Sim, which were shown to its female child and adult male avatars. One ad showed an animated woman lying on her back with her legs spread, with the options “kiss her” and “take it slow”.The second ad featured sexually suggestive depictions of “Kate your naughty step sister” wearing a bra, and an animated image of “Lally, 18”.The third ad featured an animated clothed woman with her bottom pulsating with the options “next girl” and “slap”, as well as text reading “punish me … please”.The ASA said that in the ads the women were shown as “stereotypical sexual objects using tropes from pornography”.The watchdog banned the eight ads and issued a warning to those behind them. It said that although they were rare examples out of the 5,923 adverts served to its digital avatars, the “harmful or degrading portrayals of women in ads are completely unacceptable and we take a zero-tolerance approach to this kind of content”.The ASA also published findings of a study that found that almost half of UK consumers were concerned about the depiction and objectification of women and girls in ads.The survey of 6,500 people, conducted by YouGov, found that 45% of people were concerned about ads that include idealised body images of women. It found 44% were concerned about the objectification of women and girls.Last month, the ASA banned an advert from the high street retailerNextforfeaturing an “unhealthily thin” modelin digitally altered clothing.The survey marks the latest initiative in this area by the ASA since it introduced tougher rules regarding the depiction of men and women in ads in 2019.The new rules were developed after a consultation process partly prompted by theoutcry over adverts in 2015for the slimming product Protein World, which promised to make women “beach body ready”.Explore more on these topicsAdvertising Standards AuthorityAdvertisingAppsGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

The education department will also, for the first time, do an in-depth analysis of the national behaviour survey in schools to look at the most successful ways of policing the bans, and the challenges schools are facing.The guidancestates that “all schools should prohibit the use of mobile phones throughout the school day – not only during lessons but break and lunchtimes as well”, but does not say how schools should enforce the bans.Phillipson is understood to have become frustrated that there is no monitoring of whether the guidance is being followed or proving useful to schools. There are no plans for the government to legislate to ban phones in schools, which ministers believe is fraught with problems.School phone bans alone do not improve grades or wellbeing, says UK studyRead moreThe monitoring will look at how well schools are following policies, how many schools have bans in place, how schools implement bans, such as keeping phones in lockers or bags, and what impact it is having on behaviour. Specific further questions on smartphones will be added to futurenational behaviour surveysto gain additional insights.A government source said: “It beggars belief that the Tories repeatedly told voters they were banning phones but did nothing to ensure the guidance was being followed.“While the vast majority of schools are complying with the guidance we need to make sure it’s being followed to the letter. Rather than indulge in gimmicks and headline grabbing after years of telling us the guidance was sufficient like the Tories, we’re going to keep schools honest and ensure classrooms and corridors are phone-free.”In the Commons on Wednesday, Keir Starmer said he had been watching the Netflix dramaAdolescencewith his teenage children.The series focuses on a family and their teenage son who is arrested for killing a female classmate, and on the impact of online misogynist influencers. The Labour MP Anneliese Midgley asked the prime minister to do more to tackle online male radicalisation.The series’ writerJack Thornehas called for screenings in parliament and said he believes there should be further social media restrictions for young teenagers.Cabinet ministers are split over whether there is a need to do more on the issue.MPs who backed abill from Labour’s Josh MacAlisterthis year, which would have restricted social media algorithms trained on young teens, said the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, was broadly against any wider changes that would go further than self-policing.Phillipson’s department only has jurisdiction over school use of smartphones. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, is among those open to more robust action because of the mental health effects of social media, which affect his department.Speaking to the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, said ending phone use in schools was a “no-brainer”.Trott admitted the guidance issued by the Conservative government last year “hasn’t worked”, with too many children still using phones in classrooms.The Conservatives put down an amendment to the schools bill earlier this week, asking for a full ban on smartphones in schools, which was voted down by the government. Trott denied the amendment was a “gimmick”, saying “parents, teachers, children are all asking for this”.According to an Ipsos poll in September 2024, almost half the UK public believe there should be a total ban on smartphones in schools. A majority of parents said their child’s school did not currently have a full ban in place.MacAlister’s bill included plans to give headteachers legal backing to make schools phone-free.The bill was watered down to gain government assurances on some of the measures, taking out any requirements on tech companies or schools, and just committing the government to do more research.Kit Malthouse, a Tory former education secretary, told the House of Commons the watering down amounted to the “gutting of what could have been a landmark bill”.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsSmartphonesYoung peopleSocial mediaDigital mediaMobile phonesMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

But as shocking as his arrest may have seemed to the world, it was sadly unsurprising to those of us on the frontlines of the war at home over Gaza. Here in the US, a building fury of anti-Palestinian hatred, especially since the October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, is giving Donald Trump cover to cleanse the country of “undesirables” and undermine free speech and academic freedom.“If you love Hamas so much why not pack up and move to south Gaza,” an infuriated reader wrote to me last spring, after the LA Times publishedmy opinion articlecriticising my own university, the University of Southern California (USC), for calling in riot police to arrest peaceful protesters. “Then, there’d be hope that in a future bombing raid your name will be on one of the projectiles.” A few months later came the blast of robo-emails, an estimated 4,000 of them, which all began “Deeply hateful Sandy Tolan,” after mysatirical piecelampooning the lockdown of our campus. And who can forget (I can’t) the angry, shouting Texans who objected tomy speechoutlining evidence for Israel’s genocide in Gaza, just last week?All of this comes with the territory. My experience has been minuscule compared with many of my colleagues, who’ve put their bodies on the line to protect our students, then facedarrestandsanctions. Or the students themselves, who’ve beenblacklisted, fired, suspended, doxed and had job offers rescinded.Even this shrinks immeasurably when compared with what’s happened to the people of Gaza over the past 17 months: more than 47,000 killed, many by US munitions fired by Israeli forces. Countless more maimed and missing limbs. All ofGaza’s universities destroyed. More than100 university deans, professorsand other university staff killed, along with hundreds more students;170 journalists killed, nearly all Palestinian, some deliberately “murdered”, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Desperation. Surgery without anesthesia. Bread made from animal feed. Anestimated 62,000dead from starvation. Last week I met a doctor who has lost 200 members of her family in Gaza.The enraged response to those of us who insist on bearing witness to this reality is a byproduct of the near-complete erasure of the Palestinian narrative. In the US media framing, with few exceptions, Palestinians are terrorists or victims, never fully human.This dehumanisation helps explain the deeply alarming arrest of Khalil. President Trumpmade it clearthat frightening higher education is precisely his intent: “We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country,” he posted on Truth Social. “We expect every one of America’s Colleges and Universities to comply.”Universities must resist our authoritarian leader’s dictates while there is still time. But the long erasure and dehumanisation of Palestinians is working against our urgent task. And robotic acceptance of bogus charges of antisemitism has only made the job of resistance that much more difficult.The charges of antisemitism are rooted in last year’s overwhelmingly peaceful Gaza encampments, which included charges of genocide and slogans such as “from the river to the sea” – a concept found in the original platform ofIsrael’s ruling Likud party. And given that South Africa,supported by other nations, brought genocide charges against Israel in the international court of justice, and that growing numbers ofgenocideand evenHolocaust scholarshave come to the same conclusion, it is hardly antisemitic to express that opinion. Of course, genuine cases of antisemitism should be taken seriously. But some powerful people are making these charges not because they’re worried about antisemitism, but as a broader attack on free speech and universities themselves.This month, 77 Jewish and Jewish Studies faculty, staff and allies at USCwrote a letterto the university’s president, Carol Folt, denouncing the Trump administration’s new executive order on “additional measures to combat anti-semitism”. The letter refuted “in the strongest terms the weaponization of Jewish identity for this Administration’s goals of repression and deportation,” and demanded that our university “not sacrifice our free speech principles”, even when threatened by cuts in federal funding.Now the Justice Department is sending investigators to 10 universities, including USC, to “monitor for and report activities by alien students”.The arrest of Khalil at Columbia,Trump promised, is “the first of many to come”.Billions of dollars in cuts are precisely what may compel universities, even private ones such as USC and Columbia, to comply with Trump dictates on student protesters and universitydiversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) programmes. This is how last year’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian protesters was a kind of test case. This is why acquiescence to this suppression, lazy acceptance of false charges of antisemitism, and passive erasure of Palestinians, have been so dangerous and consequential. They have led us to the present moment.Already universities are scrubbing references to DEI from their public-facing websites. As the Los Angeles Times reported, one department at USC evendeleted references to a scholarshipfor Black and Indigenous students. This suitsDepartment of Education prioritiesand raises the question: will it next target Black studies, Asian studies, Latino and Native American studies, or declare that simplybeingtransgender is illegal? When do universities draw the line and say,no?This month, Columbia signalled to the administration that it wouldcooperate with the Justice Department investigation. But no matter: the Trump teameliminated $400mof the university’s federal funding.It makes no sense to comply with authoritarian mandates, especially when you lose anyway, and when the broader repressive agenda is no secret. Trump administration officials have made it clear that their aim is to cripple universities. The goal, the senior Trump strategist Christopher Rufo told theNew York Times,is to put “universities into contraction, into a recession … in a way that puts them in an existential terror”.For universities, the response should be obvious: no more buckling under repressive pressures from petty, narrow-minded autocrats. It’s time for us to unabashedly defend our values, to advance courage over compliance, to defend knowledge, to fight for our students.A notefrom the University of California chancellor to the UC Berkeley community, helps point the way: “[W]e are gravely concerned about recent Federal action in regard to higher education … in ways that threaten core values: academic freedom, freedom of inquiry, and freedom of expression … we will be steadfast and unrelenting in our efforts to defend those core values.”Universities must become centres of resistance. Silence is not a solution to the mounting tyranny – not on DEI, not on federal interference, and certainly not on the exercise of free speech on Gaza,Israeland Palestine. Whatever the issue, we are called to continue the fight, along with our students, to show the humanity, the dignity, and the rights of our communities at risk.The forces of darkness have the upper hand. We must counter with facts, context, reason, compassion and, above all, courage, for as long as we possibly can.Sandy Tolan is a professor at the Annenberg school for communication and journalism at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and author of two books on the history of Israel and Palestine, including the international bestseller The Lemon TreeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

From Augustus to Stalin, strongmen have sought cultural control for their own endsThu 20 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 10.13 EDTShareIn Washington, Donald Trump’stakeover of the Kennedy Center– the US’s imposing national centre for the performing arts – presents a bizarre, unnerving and, at times, bleakly comical spectacle. Last month, he announced himself its new chair, replaced 13 board members, andinserted a new interim president, foreign policy adviser Richard Grenell. On Monday this week, the president’s motorcadedisgorged him at the building– which contains an opera house, theatre, concert hall and a plethora of smaller venues off its towering, chandelier-hung foyers. By this point, his and Melania Trump’s portraits, alongside those of vice-president JD Vance and his wife Usha, had been screwed to the wall beside the concert hall stage door.Trump and his new trustees – who include Usha Vance and Fox presenterLaura Ingraham– then discussed changes to theKennedy Center Honors, founded in the 1970s to recognise the greatest figures in American cultural life. Trump called previous honorees, who have ranged from Fred Astaire to Francis Ford Coppola, “radical left lunatics”. Men such as singer Andrea Bocelli, who hasperformedat Mar-a-Lago, and Sylvester Stallone, whorecently called Trumpa “second George Washington”, were floated for future honours. With the truculence of a slighted schoolboy, Trump opined that he had nevermuch cared for Hamilton– this, after the news thatthe musical has withdrawnfrom a 2026 run at the centre. He also complained about an infestation of mice. All this, the day before he was due to speak to Russian president Vladimir Putin tohaggle overUkraine’s future. It is enough to give you a political-cultural attack of the bends.Those who work there – it is the home of theNational Symphony Orchestraand the Washington National Opera, sustains a large educational programme and hosts touring productions – are faced with a moral dilemma. One senior figure, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that what is keeping them from resigning after the ripping away of the centre’s bipartisan heart is the fact that their own section’s programming has yet to be targeted; a feeling of responsibility towards employees’ livelihoods; and a hope that things will one day “swing back”. Nevertheless, the figure told me: “I’m asking myself every day when I get up, am I being like a French collaborator?”If you imagine that a comparison with Vichy France is a bit much, or all of this is unimportant, you are mistaken. This is of a piece with theintimidation of the pressand the closing, by executive order, of the radio station Voice of America, set up during the second world war to counter nazism, nowconsideredby the White House “radical propaganda”. Think of authoritarianism as a sort of disease: you’ll find “preoccupation with the minutiae of the arts” is on the symptom checker, because authoritarians are prickly and afraid of the potency of the arts, how they affect hearts and minds. Sufferers have gone all the way from the poetry-loving (andpoet-banishing) emperor Augustus, to the opera-going (and artist-murdering) Stalin. In his blunt and brutish way, Trump, who characterised his and Vance’s public bullying of a foreign president as “great television”, understands the power of spectacle, of showbiz, of culture and the arts. Politicians in liberal democracies generally let artists get on with it – without indulging in diatribes against, say,drag shows, something with which Trump is weirdly preoccupied.In Washington, politics and the arts are physically indivisible: grand, pedimented cultural institutions stand shoulder to shoulder with the nation’s imposing government buildings. It is no coincidence that the centre of political power is also the place where Americans, and the world, come to absorb the narratives of US identity, culture and memory that are projected by the Kennedy Center, theNational Gallery of Art, and the mightySmithsonian Institutionmuseums, 17 of which are in DC. But what narratives? On Thursday evening, Vance’s motorcade advanced ahead of me as I walked into the Kennedy Center. When a wall of booing from the concert-hall audience greeted the vice-president as he and his party filed into their seats, he let loose a wave as ironic and unconcerned as a Roman emperor acknowledging the Colosseum crowds. But next day, the video that the Guardian shot and published alongside ournews storywas commented on,on X, by the centre’s new leader, Grenell: “It troubles me to see that so many in the audience appear to be white and intolerant of diverse political views. Diversity is our strength.” He sent a similarly worded all-staff letter. Given that Trump banned federal diversity programmes by executive order in January, it takes an Orwellian chutzpah to use a lack of diversity among Kennedy Center patrons as a weapon.0:42Audience boos JD Vance at Kennedy Center classical music performance – exclusive videoElsewhere among Washington’s cultural institutions, there is a sense that leaders are keeping their heads down in hope of evading the gaze of the destroyers. Vance, by virtue of his office, is one of the trustees of the Smithsonian. In a context in which even a Black war hero can beremovedfrom a Department of Defense website, will the entireNational Museum of African American History and Culturebe regarded as a diversity and inclusion folly? Will exhibitions such as that by the radical Cuban-born Félix González-Torres pass unnoticed, even though thewebsitefor the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery fails to mention, perhaps carefully, that the artist was gay, or that one work relates to his lover’s death from Aids, or that he himself died of an Aids-related illness?The National Gallery of Art (not part of the Smithsonian, but Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, is an ex-officio trustee) has just opened a show devoted toElizabeth Catlett, subtitled “a Black revolutionary artist”. One of her works, made amid the turmoil of the 1968 race riots, is afist carved from cedar, titled Black Unity. Will such boldness continue? As time moves on, self-censorship may become evident, as organisations seek to minimise negative attention. The possibility of a casual swipe at funding made one institutional director feel “like the sword of Damocles is dangling over my head”, they told me. At another famous cultural institution, this time in New York, I asked its leader what would happen if the government came for them. “I don’t know,” he said frankly – while acknowledging that even an institution generously supported by philanthropists, which receives no federal funds, could easily be targeted through changes to donors’ tax benefits. Artists may also vote with their feet. On Wednesday, Hungarian-born British pianist András Schiffcancelled all his US engagementsfor next season, citing “political changes”, insisting that “as artists, we must react to the horrors and injustices of this world”.At the Kennedy Center, artists such as soprano Renée Fleming havecut ties with the centre. There will probably be more cancellations, or refusals of invitations. Apetitioncalls on donors to stop supporting it. Either way – by carrying on under the corrupting shadow of the Trump chairmanship, or through the fleeing of audiences, donors and artists – a great institution is weakened. That, in the end, is probably what he wants. And this is just the beginning.Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It sounds like a contradiction in terms – Hamlet without the prince. Yet this is the improbable, disjunctive world we now inhabit. It is the one in which our children and grandchildren will live their lives. Like it or not, the systemic shock launched by Donald Trump is our new reality. Absolutely nothing about Trump’s latestphone call with Vladimir Putinon Tuesday has changed that.Europe’s scramble to respond to Trump’s return to power was driven initially by the urgency ofmaintaining support for Ukraine. Most of the focus was diplomatic: keeping US military aid and intelligence flowing, shoring up damaged channels between Washington and Kyiv, engaging quietly with both Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy to both encourage and deter, while moving very publicly to take up more of the security burden.Aiding and armingUkraineremains far and away the first item on Europe’s agenda as well as its most immediate goal. Hugging the US as close as possible continues to be fundamental, whatever Trump’s more cavalier critics may wish. There is no disputing that Trump caught the Europeans within Nato napping in ways that should never have occurred, and which reflect extremely badly on those responsible. For now, American power remains both indispensable and unreliable.Even so, a more lasting and more Europe-heavy reconfiguration of the western alliance is also beginning to take shape. For now, most of what is being planned is either improvised from existing resources or aspirational. But the outline of a new Atlantic alliance can be discerned amid the diplomatic video conferences and high-minded pledges: a kind of Nato-minus supported by most ofEurope, Britain included, potentially plus Canada, and with the role of the US shrouded in uncertainty.Nato remains the basic framework, even if Trump decides to withdraw. This adaptive effort is being shaped by an improbable trio: aconservative German chancellorwho spurns previous orthodoxy; a centrist French president who has just destroyed his own power base; and a UK prime minister equipped with thesmallest British army since the Napoleonic wars. But Europe is nevertheless in their hands. They are the team we can put on the pitch.The inevitability of change has been decisively reinforced by Trump’s 90-minute phone conversation with Putin on Tuesday. Any thought that Trump would somehow persuade Putin to reverse his policy on Ukraine – or even that Trump wanted to – was always a fantasy. Everything Putin has ever said about Ukraine attests that he regards it as Russian land. The conditions he put to Trump amount to a demand to leave Ukraine defenceless against Russian assault and annexation. That assault has continued unabated once again this week.This puts Trump’s claims as a peacemaker on the spot, but the embarrassment, though useful to those trying to rein him in, is likely to be only temporary. Trump’s strategic wish is to withdraw US military and financial support for Ukraine, preferably amid something he can describe as a peace settlement that only his genius could have engineered. But his longer-term approach to Europe is simply an extension of this impatience towards Ukraine. His aim is to withdraw US support for European defence more generally.1:38US no longer ‘primarily focused’ on Europe’s security, says Pete Hegseth – videoThe most significant thing that has happened in Europe this week, therefore, was not the Trump-Putin phone call. It was the vote by the Bundestag to loosen Germany’s constitutionally protected strict financial borrowing rules and, at the same time, to authorise a€500bn fund to boost economic growth, infrastructure projects and military spending. If Europe wants to carry its own defence burden, as it now claims, it has to fire up its own defence industries to scale. More than anything else, that means firing up the German defence industry. This is not an overnight process, but it can now start.The vote was a triumph for the probable new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who pushed it through the departing Bundestag on its final day. But it was also a genuine turn in the road for postwarGermany. Burdened by its history, Germany has consistently eschewed both large-scale borrowing and militarisation. Those taboos have now been busted, under the pressure of economic stagnation and the threat from Russia alike.The internal consequences for 21st-century Germany will be major, assuming that parliament’s upper house endorses the changes this week. It would be mistaken to think the issue is now settled. Both the far right and far left, significantly boosted in the recent German general election, voted against Merz’s plans. Both will continue to see them as betrayals. If inflation rises, Merz’s grip will face fierce challenges.But the consequences for Europe as a whole are likely to be equally powerful. Since the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, Germany has been the most important western European state where foreign policy looks reflexively towards Russia. Earlier in this century, under Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel, those links were always carefully protected. More recently, Putin has ensured that German policy, first under Olaf Scholz and now under Merz, has become more hostile.As Trump menaces us in Canada, we have a question for Britain: when will you stand up to him? | Jennifer WelshRead moreGermany is still the necessary nation for any Europe-wide new political initiative. But now, almost at a stroke, the Bundestag vote has removed the longstanding excuse behind which some European states have been content to hide over the issue of Europe’s manifestly inadequate defence investment. The era of inward-turned European denial about Russia and about defence spending has ended, and the fresh air of truth is breezing through windows that were once firmly sealed.This is a healthy and overdue moment, not least because the danger is real, but also because it gives this continent a more unifying purpose than it has had since the cold war. But there can be no disputing the risks. European history is full of terrifying examples of international alliances that have not survived contact with a determined enemy. One lesson of the 2020s is that things many people had assumed had been consigned to history – among them epidemics, nationalism, territorial land grabs and charismatic tyrants – have returned in force.Today, confronted with an aggressive tyranny and faced with an isolationist US, the nation states of Europe, withCanada, are attempting to uphold the moral and political recasting of the world that took place after 1945. There are echoes here of the conflicts that began in 1914, and again in 1939. Then, too, Europe found itself in wars (which included major Canadian involvement) from which an isolationist US stood aside. In both cases, the US proved the essential nation to victory and the postwar order. Today, though, the US marches to an altogether more unreliable drum.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNatoOpinionDonald TrumpDefence policyGermanyFranceCanadaUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

Ministers should have the guts to abolish them – and start againSimon JenkinsA report out this week highlights how destructive the cult of the exam is in Britain’s schools. But it doesn’t go far enoughThu 20 Mar 2025 12.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 14.05 EDTShareJust say it. Spit it out. Abolish GCSE. It has nothing to do with young people or their advancement. It has everything to do with quantifying, measuring, controlling and governing their preparation for life.Last year, Prof Becky Francis was asked by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, to draw up proposals for the curriculum in England’s secondary schools. In herinterim reportout this week she recognised the challenge, but then took fright.Francis took up the charge that England’s schools are obsessed with exams. She “feared” that they “overly stress” children and prioritise academic subjects. These are not fears, but facts. Anyone reading post-Covid figures about the mental health of young Britons might wish to emigrate. A soaringone in fiveschoolchildren now report mental illness. A fifth of pupils in England are persistent truants. School suspensions and expulsions last year were a full third up on the previous record year.Overly stressed is an understatement. Pupils in England sit twice the hours of exams as do Irish students – and three times the Canadian figure. The gods of GCSE help schools order their classes and assess their teachers – and give ministers a boost in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’sPisa World Cup in maths. Pisa’s most truly awful league table is for European pupils’ sense of “life satisfaction”. Among 15-year-olds,the UK comes bottom.But GCSE’s biases are gross. It places English and maths above all forms of education, yet 40% of pupils fail those subjects, and most fail their retake. Without a maths GCSE, you supposedly cannot become a nurse, teacher or police officer. This is crazy. There is no prize for guessing which jobs now have gaping vacancies.Just as the chip renders obsolete a need to know how engines work, so computers and soon artificial intelligence have rendered maths obsolete. In both cases, the subject is the pursuit of a tiny minority. It is computers that all pupils should study and learn how to use, rather than be suspended or accused of cheating for doing so. Making them learn maths is like teaching them to swim but banning the use of water. Yet to say this in education circles – I began my career in London’s Institute of Education – is like swearing in church.The most telling chart in the Francis report is of what today’s parents and pupils themselves want from schools. Overwhelmingly, both asked for the opposite of what schools are giving them. Their top subjects were personal finance, digital and computing, creative activities, problem-solving, employment, interviewing and debating skills. All were favoured ahead of academic subjects. GCSE might offer a choice of hobby. Pupils wanted help with life’s challenges. They wanted a vocation.Fewer GCSE exams proposed in Labour’s curriculum review – but Sats to stayRead moreIt is a feature of this list that these subjects are all hard to measure. That is clearly the system’s chief objection to them. As the dissident teacher Sammy Wright writes of the cult of the exam in hisExam Nation, GCSE rules all because it is the basis of a school’s public face and pupils are therefore told, over and again: “You need good grades to get on in life.” Exam performance dominates teenage morale. He points out that GCSE English once had 20% of its marks devoted to the essential skills of speaking and listening. When this proved hard to measure, it was simply dropped, demoting the aspect of English that was “most relevant to the widest range of kids”.Mental illness among young people – however questionable its definition – needs the attention of both parenting and teaching. Francis has drawn attention to exams as a contributory factor, but she is too kind to GCSE. A more radical challenge came from last year’sOracy Commission, and its plea for instruction in articulation, in speaking, debating and team working, as an antidote to pupils’ mobile phone addiction. Francis ignored this convincing call.Of course, assessment is needed to ensure schools are up to the mark. Teachers need training in what pupils – and their parents – most need to prepare them for life. Means must be found to ensure this is supplied. But the cult of the exam is not the answer. The present system patently causes harm.Schoolsshould not do that. In her final report, Francis should have the guts to kill GCSE and start again.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGCSEsOpinionExamsSchoolsBridget PhillipsonYoung peopleMental healthHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

For example, I recently told younger friends that as a teen I had to buy CD-Roms that gave me a certain number of hours of internet access, and then it would stop. I saw in their baffled little eyes that they were now picturing me in black and white, waving goodbye to the CD-Rom-monger as I boarded my horse and buggy.I’ve also lived through big changes in LGBTQ+ rights. I was closeted till age 21, whereas many more young people can now be their true selves from the jump – celebrated instead of tolerated.Then there is the biggest change of all, one that I never thought I would see as long as I lived, and that is … country music is cool now.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningI can’t believe it. As someone who has loved country music since I yeehaw’d out of my mother (sorry), I have been watching this vibe shift with feverish anticipation over recent years. There wasLil Nas X’s breakout moment in 2019, with hiscountry-crossover hit Old Town Road. Years after doing the song Daddy Lessons with the Chicks, Beyoncé releasedher full country album Cowboy Carterin 2024 – putting a huge spotlight on country’s roots in black history, and its future black stars. Post Malone transitioned from rap to country with huge success. Hip-hop country singer Shaboozey also had a massive crossover hit last year with A Bar Song (Tipsy). All of these moments have had ripple effects on popular music. We are now seeing country calling, and even the pop girlies are leaning into it. I’ve finally been vindicated, I’m finally cool.Chappell Roan: The Giver review – saddle up, there’s a new sheriff in townRead moreLast week one of the biggest pop stars on the planet right now, Chappell Roan, released a heavily country-vibed song calledThe Giver, which is about queer sex. It would probably have immediately killed 10-year-old me if she heard it. It’s a big change from the country music of my childhood.My dad influenced my taste in musicians like Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash. At around age 10 I heard Patsy Cline for the first time, her plaintive and stunning voice blowing my mind. I listened to Loretta Lynn, Reba, Charley Pride. I got addicted to Garth Brooks (who wasrecently accused of sexual assault, extreme bummer – he denies the allegations). I found the Chicks when I was a bit older – perfect timing for someone starting to care about politics, and uncomfortable with the old-school conservative country ways behind the music.Even though modern country hasonly recently started to includeopenly queer artists, I actually think it was my hidden queerness that drew me to it. The country music stereotype is often mocked (“I went to wash my truck and my wife left me and I’m gutted and my dog is also gone”), but I think it was that plainness that attracted me. I was closeted from the age of 10 (no, Patsy did not make me gay, but she helped) to about 21. The only way to survive was to completely shove down my feelings, disconnecting the wires that could cause emotions. I lived not being able to express myself, in the fear I wouldn’t be able to stop.Country ballads, country love songs – these were always the ones that to me were full of the most emotion, most clearly expressed. Nobody was hiding anything, they weren’t shoving down their true selves. They were singing full-throated and plainly. They were doing exactly what I couldn’t do. Playing those songs and singing along loudly let me release a little bit of the pressure inside me. It was good for me, but kids at my various schools were not interested in singing Trisha Yearwood with me for some reason. The mainstream around me never really accepted country music.But look at us now. I’m happily and loudly gay, and all the popular kids are coming over to my side. Beyoncé, Chappell. Sabrina Carpenter’s best song is Please Please Please, which has a country bent. Lana Del Rey has an upcoming country album. Orville Peck, a gay country singer who always wears a mask, is on the rise, having recently performeda song called Friends of Dorothy with the Wiggles. One of the most popular drag queens in the world, Trixie Mattel, makes beautiful folk-country music. Queer line dancing istaking over Sydney. Cowboy hats and flannels are no longer just the realm of country, or lesbians.The Wiggles on singing with Dolly Parton in their starry country era: ‘We are friends of Dorothy!’Read moreI’ve long endured terminal uncoolness, people groaning when my songs come on, mocking me for being a country bumpkin. There have been a few allies of course, other fans with whom I could watch Garth Brooks’s 1992 concert (RIP), or scream-sing Not Ready to Make Nice by the Chicks in a car. It’s been a long and winding road (Sheryl Crow), and it’s often been a lonely road, but I am finally getting my reward.Now I can turn on the radio and hear the biggest stars in the world singing over a ukulele. I can blast a countrified song, look around and see people smiling instead of grimacing. I hope this means that many more people will discover other types of country and appreciate the scope of the genre.But I’m greedy. While some country fans wring their hands and whine about the purity of the genre, I want more. I want Taylor Swift to go back to her roots and do a country album. I think Miley Cyrus would make an incredible country album. I want Doechii to collab with Kacey Musgraves. I want everyone I enjoy in every genre to make a countrified album. I deserve it, and every time a new country song is released by someone I love, my inner child yahoos and waves her cowboy hat around – this town ain’t big enough any more for country music haters.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsCountryOpinionBeyoncéLGBTQ+ rightscommentShareReuse this content"

But it was not unexpected or unheralded. Netanyahu and his newly installed military chiefs have made clear their intentions of resuming the war to “crush Hamas once and for all” and “prevent any future threat from Gaza”. They rejected the January deal, which mandated ending the fight in return for the remaining 59 Israeli and foreign hostages held inGazasince Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.The Trump administration has given Israel a free hand vis-a-vis the Palestinians. Donald Trump even drew the goal: relocating Gaza’s more than 2 million inhabitants and turning the rubble intobeachside resorts. His idea came almost as divine intervention to the Israeli far right, which has advocated for decades the “transfer” of Arabs from the occupied territories. What was traditionally viewed as an extremist, marginalised idea has now become US policy, masked as a “humane solution” rather than what it would be: an outright war crime. Once aired by Trump, the idea has enjoyed wide support among Israel’s Jewish majority as a fitting punishment for the 7 October massacre.So far, the Israel Defense Forces have not given an explicit order to ethnically cleanse Gaza of its Palestinians. Nor did the IDF direct its ground force reserves toward an occupation campaign. Tuesday’s assault was framed as an attack on Hamas’s rearming effort and its governance organs, targeting several of its civilian executives along with their family members.Nevertheless Trump, Netanyahu and senior Israeli officials have threatened Hamas with “hell”. Israel’s ministry of defence has established a new officeto facilitate “voluntary emigration”from Gaza via Israeli air and seaports. The minister of finance, Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right leader, envisions a transfer of10,000 Palestinians a day, depopulating the entire Gaza Strip within several months. The defence minister, Israel Katz, whose office runs the emigration project, indicates that2,500 daily evacueeswill suffice. Israel and the US have already asked Sudan, Somaliland and other governments to take the Palestinians.Most Israelis, however, are still considering the talk of a transfer, or second Nakba – recalling the 1948 “catastrophe”, or exodus of most Arabs from what became Israel – as rightwing political gobbledegook. Israeli public attention is focused on the 59 hostages held in Gaza, between 22 and 24 of them apparently alive. To Netanyahu and his allies, the fate of the tortured, starved hostages is a nuisance, a disturbance on the way to “ultimate victory”. The government’s opponents, centred on the old Israeli mainstream, view the return of the hostages as paramount. They have found an unlikely ally in Trump, who hosted freed hostages in the Oval Office, a gesture that Netanyahu has yet to perform. Having shrugged off responsibility for the 7 October disaster, he escapes looking the victims in the eyes.Tuesday’s bombing decided the debate. Netanyahu ignored the pleas of hostages’ families and survivors of Hamas captivity and sent bombers to the skies of Gaza, knowing that Hamas, with its back to the wall, might kill the remaining captives. The deadly attack paid immediate political dividends in Jerusalem. Israel’sKahanist partyOtzma Yehudit (“Jewish Power”), which left the coalition to protest against the ceasefire, came back on the eve of a crucial budget vote. Passing the budget would buy the government time to win its coveted victory in a second, though by no means secondary, battle at home.Since returning to the helm in late 2022, Netanyahu’s goal has been to turn Israel from a quasi-liberal, however battered, democracy – at least on this side of the green line separating Israel proper from the occupied territories – into a Jewish autocracy. Having already transformed Likud, the ruling party, into his personality cult, and partnering with the once-pariah Kahanists, Netanyahu sought to drive out the old elite from its power bases in the defence-intelligence complex and the judiciary and replace it with his alliance of “Bibist” loyalists, religious nationalists and ultra-Orthodox rabbis’ disciples. The secular, westward-looking former elite fought back with mass protests that slowed down the judicial upheaval. Then came 7 October, and domestic strife was put on hold.But Netanyahu never lost sight of his national overhaul. With the war winding down, and his ideological buddy Trump taking over in the US, the Israeli coalition relaunched its coup. Laws that woulddo away with judicial independencewere rushed in the Knesset. With the police force and prison service already politicised, and the IDF chief of staff replaced, Netanyahu aims at the most sensitive and powerful targets: Shin Bet, Israel’s security service, and the attorney general, who serves as the country’s chief law enforcer.Netanyahu’s motives are personal as much as political. Gali Baharav-Miara, the attorney general, is leading the prosecution in Netanyahu’s corruption trial. Replacing her with a crony might throw the case out of the window. Ronen Bar, the Shin Bet chief that Netanyahu wants to sack, is investigating claims of shadowyfinancial ties between the prime minister’s spin masters and Qatar, the main sponsor of Hamas. Netanyahu, expectedly, argues that “Qatar-gate” is a last-ditch effort by his adversaries, Bar and Baharav-Miara, to avoid being ousted. Both loyal bureaucrats who turned into unlikely dissidents, they would lead a legal battle to keep their jobs and preserve remaining civil service independence and authority.And so the dual battle lines, inside and outside Israel, are drawn for the showdown. Netanyahu wants to fight Hamas all the way to ethnic cleansing and is willing to sacrifice the hostages along the way. And he wants to purge the country’s establishment of his traditional rivals, the members of the military, academic and legal elites, keeping the right wing in power for ever.His opponents, struggling to save the hostages and protect democracy, were weakened by the failure of the IDF and Shin Bet to anticipate the 7 October massacre and protect the border communities. The historic debacle has irreparably shattered the prestige of the military and intelligence community, whose former leaders led the anti-government protest. The political opposition is weak, leaderless and lacking a postwar vision. Nevertheless, despite all these obstacles and facing Netanyahu’s unbelievable stamina, the “anti-Bibists” realise that if they lose now, they may not be able to protest again and be reduced to watching their country descending down the autocratic path already paved in Hungary, India, Turkey and Trumpist America.In the coming weeks, we will see if Israel is edging closer to the abyss of war criminality in depopulated Gaza and de facto dictatorship in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, or whether the Netanyahu stampede can be slowed down. The stakes for Israel’s future have never been as high. And the protesters are trying once again to turn the ever-higher tide.Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of HaaretzDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But so were the right’s Brexit claims, and look where they left usZoe WilliamsThe run-up to 2016 shows ‘common sense’ isn’t enough. Even ignorant, reactionary arguments must be properly counteredThu 20 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 09.42 EDTShareKemi Badenoch’s speech on climate this week was not interesting of itself: she said net zero couldn’t be achieved by 2050 “without a serious drop in our living standards or by bankrupting us”. She has no expertise in climate science, no background in renewables or apparent familiarity with the advances made in their technology, no qualification in economics – just about the only bit of that sentence she knows anything about is bankrupting us.Yet even if Badenoch can take its particulars and shove them, the fact of its existence is interesting for a number of reasons. First, this attack on net zero has been predicted, not secretly by new-Conservative fellow travellers, though conceivably them too, but by progressives – and for years. Among the first was the Cambridge academic David Runciman, who predicted a backlash against action on the climate crisis as the new galvanising issue on the radical right after it had moved on fromBrexit. On his Talking Politics podcast, he was in conversation with Ed Miliband, who took that point but said he hoped Runciman was wrong. He was not wrong.Ben Stewart, one quarter of the direct action/public art group Led By Donkeys described even more closely what the anti-green arguments would look like and the trajectory they would follow. Before Brexit, he’d been looking at who had links to the leave campaign, and cross referencing their other interests – Matt Ridley, coalmine magnate and climate crisis sceptic, Matthew Elliott, founder of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, opponent of green taxes, stalwart of Tufton Street. “Brexit was always, obviously, a plan to completely gut climate regulation,” Stewart told me last year. “First these people denied the science. Then they abandoned that trench and moved back to, ‘the science is probably real, but the impacts of climate change aren’t going to be too bad.’ Then they went to, ‘the science is real, it could be bad, but we can’t do anything about it because it’s too expensive.’”That’s where we are now, and Badenoch’s may be the most mainstream expression of it so far. Because even while outlets such as GB News have been preachingclimate impossibilismfor some time, it has until now been broadly disallowable in mainstream political discourse. Politicians could undermine climate action tangentially, by fulminating about Extinction Rebellion or by sideswiping at the “green crap”, but would not, if they were ambitious, pursue a despair agenda. Not because it wouldn’t garner them attention, but because it meant resiling from scientific and international consensus.Yet if Badenoch is the first prominent person to break the cross-party consensus on net zero, she’s not without cover. There has been a steady build of grassroots movements with specific, vehement objections to apparently pretty anodyne pro-environmental policies: ultra-low emission zones (Ulez) have attracted the ire of the outer London vandal-warriors; low-traffic neighbourhoods blew up into a culture war between neighbours; the 15-minute city attracted conspiracists with an intensity way beyond anything explicable by the idea.All of this anti-climate activism looks, up close, like amorphous rage attached by an algorithm to an issue that could never express or contain it. Or, to put that more simply, Facebook getting peoples’s knickers in a twist. Yet when it drags on, and percolates the phone-ins, and newsreaders start giving it the merest nod, “some people, of course, are very angry about Ulez”, it takes on the heft of an imagined constituency, people who are fed up with environmentalists. Badenoch is speaking their truth. You may feel passionately that we have one precious planet and should do everything in our power to protect it, but you’re not the only one who’s allowed feelings.And now, as progressives or environmentalists, or whatever word you want to use if you’re too polite to say “sane people”, we’re into discursive territory that’s deeply familiar, though you couldn’t call it our “happy place”. Most of us would acknowledge the increasing radicalism and stridency of the anti-environmental agenda, and we’re self-soothing with the fact thatpublic opinion on net zero is still solidly in favour. Getting into the weeds of Badenoch’s own character, a debate is playing out that is also deeply familiar – is she saying this because she’s enchanted by dark money, or is it because she’s an “irresponsible, ignorant, reactionary fool”, as one journalist put it.This may be a useful point at which to consider not the arguments themselves, but what happened last time: when we last saw irresponsible, ignorant, reactionary arguments, which if followed through would be greatly to the nation’s detriment, whose proponents seemed to be effortlessly attaching themselves to a simmering underlying rage that they had no real answers for, over an issue that public opinion, previously, had seemed quite sensible on. That time when it was never quite clear where the money was coming from, but you could definitely smell it somewhere – did that energy dissipate? Was good sense enough to chase the charlatans out of town? Or did they, in fact, win? I think we all remember.Ben Stewart names not just the trench Badenoch is fighting from now, but “the next trench, the last trench: which is to say, ‘Climate change is real, it’s bad, it’s expensive, but it’s too late.’ By the time they start winning that argument, it will be too late.” We need to do better on rightwing activism this time, rather than just ignoring it and hoping it will go away.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionKemi BadenochFar rightBrexitcommentShareReuse this content"

The Sofronoff findings have upended thatAnthony WhealyThe consequences of this shameful episode are serious and cast doubt on the choice of former judges to lead important commissions or enquiriesWed 19 Mar 2025 22.46 EDTShareFor many years it has been customary to appoint experienced judges or former judges to head up royal commissions, boards of enquiries and the like. It has been thought that judges were well-equipped to control such hearings, often conducted in full public gaze, with fairness and equanimity.Their training made them alert to possible conflicts of interest, the need for procedural fairness and the obligation to provide natural justice where it was required. One additional characteristic was the ability to deal fairly with the media, ensuring proper public coverage, while keeping parts of the media’s sometime capacity to sensationalise or act outside the boundaries of journalistic ethics under control.These certainties have now been more than somewhat shattered by therecent report of the ACT Integrity Commission. This body investigated whether Walter Sofronoff, a former Queensland judge of great distinction, had engaged in corrupt conduct while acting as a board of inquiry into matters arising out of the Bruce Lehrmann trial. The Integrity Commission’s report concluded that he had indeed engaged in corrupt conduct, in fact serious corrupt conduct. Following the release of the report Sofronoff filed an application in the federal court tochallenge the lawfulness of the report.The background to the Integrity Commission’s investigation is well known. After the abortedLehrmann trial, the prosecutor Shane Drumgold raised concerns about various aspects of the police and political handling of the case. He was plainly a passionate advocate for the complainant in the trial. However, his complaint was turned on its head when Sofronoff was appointed to lead a board of inquiry to consider, among other more general issues, whether Drumgold had himself acted in breach of his duties as a prosecutor.TheSofronoff reportwas officially published by the ACT chief minister on 7 August 2023. It was scathing of Drumgold’s behaviour in a number of respects. Drumgold then initiated proceedings to invalidate the report and overturn the adverse findings. On 4 March 2024 acting Justice Stephen Kaye found that the conduct of Sofronoff – in particular his interactions with an experienced lawyer and journalist from the Australian newspaper, Janet Albrechtsen – amounted to conduct giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. This finding effectively vitiated the legal validity of the adverse findings which had been made by Sofronoff.Lehrmann inquiry head Walter Sofronoff engaged in ‘serious corrupt conduct’ , review findsRead moreKaye’s findingsrevealed some startling assertions. Soffronoff and Albrechtsen had engaged in 51 private telephone conversations – over six hours in all – discussing the case; documents were supplied by Sofronoff to the journalist when requested, and views as to the inquiry and sometimes aspects of the evidence were discussed between them. It was clear that Albrechtsen was by no means an avid advocate for Brittany Higgins. For that matter, she was also shown to be highly critical of Drumgold as a prosecutor in the trial.Against this background, the ACT Integrity Commission began its investigation. It was not directly concerned with the issue as to whether the Sofronoff findings were infected by apprehended bias, although it agreed that they were. Rather its focus was on the sole question as to whether his behaviour constituted corrupt conduct within the definition of that phrase in the ACT integrity legislation.The findings were damning. The commission found that three categories of behaviour amounted to corrupt conduct. First, Sofronoff’s disclosure of confidential material to the journalist, contrary to the obligations of the Inquiries Act, could amount to offences under that legislation.Secondly, his disclosure of the final report to journalists before it had been publicly released by the chief minister contravened provisions in the legislation, those provisions giving to the minister and the general assembly sole power and discretion to determine the extent and timing of publication. Thirdly, the disclosures were dishonestly concealed from both Drumgold and the chief minister, thus preventing them from taking legal action to injunct the flawed process.This impugned conduct constituted of the exercise of Sofronoff’s official functions in a way that was not impartial, significantly compromised the inquiry and constituted a breach of public trust. In these circumstances, the commission concluded that this conduct could have justified Sofronoff’s removal from the inquiry.The commission gave great attention to Sofronoff’s arguments as to why he had been entitled to act as he did towards the media. He argued forcefully that his actions were always in accordance with statute and that he acted in the public interest to ensure the media were adequately informed about the issues being investigated and thereby placed in a position to comment accurately about them.However, the commission disagreed. It found he had not acted in good faith. His behaviour undermined the integrity of the board’s processes and the fairness and propriety of its proceedings. It effectively threatened public confidence in the integrity of this aspect of public administration.Sofronoff’s initial findings had condemned Drumgold’s reputation. If the Integrity Commission’s findings withstand legal challenge they will undoubtably and irreparably damage the standing of a once formidable jurist.The consequences of this shameful episode are serious. They cast doubt on the choice of former judges to lead important commissions or enquiries. They erode public confidence in the important role played by judges in the administration of justice. Although no adverse findings were made against the journalists involved in this matter, there is no doubt that a shadow has been cast over the media’s role in this affair. In addition, we have recently seen the head of the national anti-corruption commission publicly castigated for seriously failing to handle a basic but important conflict of interest in relation to the robodebt affair, manifesting once again a reasonable apprehension of bias.None of this is satisfactory.We need to remind ourselves that there have been many well conducted public enquiries over the years with important and beneficial consequences for the community. In many of those enquiries, fairness and the provision of natural justice have been well on display. These are precious commodities. The Integrity Commission’s findings must remind us – the judiciary, the media and the public – that great care and caution need to be exercised to ensure that justice is done for all.Sofronoff has now stated he will endeavour to challenge the Integrity Commission’s findings. From his perspective, there is much at stake here.The irony is that, once again, contentious litigation may continue to spin out of this notorious affair. Sadly, the game is not yet over.Anthony Whealy KC is the chair of the Centre for Public Integrity and former assistant commissioner to IcacExplore more on these topicsLaw (Australia)OpinionCanberraAustralian mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Every few weeks I say soon, even though I’m yet to enrol her.While I know there is plenty of time for her to learn her alphabet, there’s a part of me that’s worried because, unlike her siblings at her age, she’s just not interested in any method I’ve used to teach it to her. No alphabet books, no flashcards, no ABC-puzzles.I have to get creative about it – and in the world of literacy education, that’s actually a good thing.Dr Jen Scott Curwood, associate Prof of English education and media studies at the University of Sydney, says children have a deep curiosity about the world around them, and developing their print-based literacy means cultivating “their playful engagement with language and with the world around them”.Travelling with children: the blood, sweat and tears – and the determination to keep going | Lucille WongRead more“Most [children] will disengage or outright resist activities that are tedious or exhausting, so it’s important for parents to keep language and literacy as playful and immersive as possible,” she says. “As a literacy researcher and a mum of a three-year-old, I see how he uses language to ask questions, make connections, and develop a growing sense of independence.”Curwood says the learning she does with her son is “impromptu and fun”, with any time they spend together an opportunity for out-of-the-box learning.“I try to build literacy into our routines, including through weekly library visits and daily bedtime reading time, but also through songs, games, and imaginative play,” she says. “If we’re grocery shopping, I might draw attention to the initial sound of the word (like ‘p’ for papayas) and ask him to see if he can find more food that starts with the same sound. He’s a very inquisitive child but I make sure to ask him questions too, which prompts him to think more creatively and more critically about his world.”According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics,44% of Australian adults don’t have the functional literacy skillsthey need to cope with the demands of everyday life and work, while 30% of Australians have literacy skills low enough to make them vulnerable to unemployment and social exclusion. Though these figures around literacy skills are somewhat higher in adulthood (23% of children start school with vulnerabilities in developmental areas of communication), they illustrate theimportance of building on your child’s literacy skillsin a variety of ways, and as early as possible.Sara Leman, a former teacher who now writes learning materials for Mathseeds and ABC Reading Eggs, says that busy parents can boost their child’s literacy with “self-directed” learning apps to improve their reading ability with consistent use of 15 minutes per day.But she also encourages busy parents to get creative and employ literacy-building techniques with their children using the most ordinary experiences, like driving around in the family car.“Every parent has snuck veggies into their kids’ favourite meals,” she says. “Well, the same approach works for education.”Need a little inspiration? Here are Leman’s top games to play with kids.Sign spotters“Turn the car ride into a letter-hunting adventure,” she says. “Create a grid on a piece of paper with focus letters in each section. Stick this to the back of the seat in front of your child and give them colourful sticky notes. As you drive, challenge them to spot road signs or objects outside that match the letters on their grid. For example, when they spot an ‘S’ on a sign, they’ll shout out the letter name and sound, then stick a sticky note on that letter in the grid. The goal is to fill up the grid by matching letters to what they see outside.”Leman says this activity helps build your child’s reading skills by helping connect letters to the sounds they make.Clap and count“Look for objects or landmarks out the window and say them out loud. Have your child repeat the word and clap the syllables. For example, if you see a ‘car’, they clap once. If it’s a ‘bus stop,’ they clap twice,” she says.Leman says that syllable clapping helps kids recognise that words are made up of smaller sounds and supports early reading and spelling.Chop it up“Give your child a simple consonant-vowel-consonant word, like ‘man’ [and] have them break it down by sounding it out and doing a ‘karate chop’ motion with their hands after each sound,” Leman says. For example, man would be “m-chop-a-chop-n-chop”. She says the physical chop action makes it easier for kids to focus on individual sounds, improving their ability to segment and blend sounds, which is crucial for reading and spelling.Sarah Ayoub is a journalist, academic and author of books for young adults and childrenExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingSharing the LoadLiteracyAustralian educationFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

He answers your questions about Bowie, the Grateful Dead, spirituality – and his complicated friendship with Philip GlassThu 20 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 15.45 EDTShareWhy does minimalist music consist of so much repetition?CorrellisfluteThe word “minimalist” was invented byMichael Nymanwhen he was more of a music critic than a composer, but the kind of music that I and people like me deal with has changes on a much smaller scale than people are used to hearing. The number of repetitions is the nature of the music. On my early pieces, such as It’s Gonna Rain or Piano Phase, everything moves so slowly. Some people will say: “To hell with it, I’m not listening to that,” but those who do experience a different kind of listening.Not only was David Bowie influenced by your workduring his Berlin era, but also your Clapping Music is sampled onthe hypnotic James Murphy remixof Bowie’s Love Is Lost (Hello Steve Reich Mix). What do you recall of your conversations with Bowie in 1978?McScootikinsWe played Music for 18 Musicians at the Bottom Line in New York, the first time we’d played it in a rock club. Afterwards, David Bowie came up and introduced himself and a photograph was taken, but really it was one of the very short post-concert conversations. It was the exchange of mutual admiration that really mattered. I was so delighted to see him there and he told me he’d heard us play the piece before, in Berlin. It was a nice coming together. The James Murphy remix is an odd combination that seems to work. Sometimes, you hear what people do with your music and think: “What have they done to me?” But that sounded really interesting. I wanted to hear it again.Listen to David Bowie’s Love Is Lost (Hello Steve Reich Mix).What was the last piece of “kit” you bought?LasagneIsCancelled“Kit” in terms of my drum kit would be a 20in Zildjian ride cymbal in 1952 or 1953, which was my pride and joy as a drummer who wanted to sound likeKenny Clarkeand bebop. Much later, when I had musical training at Cornell [University], Juilliard [conservatoire] and Mills College and was totally dedicated to performing whatever I wrote for my own ensemble, I was able to get four pairs of very high-quality bongo drums and then three marimbas, which wiped me out financially. Fortunately, my late artist friend Sol LeWitt bought some of my scores as a collection of art pieces, including the original score of Four Organs, and with that money I bought three glockenspiels, which were the finishing touches on Drumming [1971]. That was the last kit I bought! I’m 88 years old. I use composition software, but don’t keep up with gadgets.I am an art handler at the Royal Academy. I heard a story that, when you started out, you andPhilip Glassmoved art around. Is that true?RobinreadbestYes and no. We moved things around, but it wasn’t art, it was big, smelly mattresses and couches up and down stairs in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. We were both short of money and Phil had a panel truck, so he said: “We’re going to form a moving company.” I think it was called Chelsea Light Moving. For a couple of weeks, we got all these downtown orders from people who had these walk-up apartments with heavy furniture. It was backbreaking, hernia-inducing work. So we looked at each other and said: “Enough is enough.”How did it feel to play withPhilip Glassagain in 2014 after such a very long time?Was it significant that the first work you performed that evening was Four Organs?TrumansdadPhil and I had been at Juilliard together, but much later [in 1967] he came to my concert at the Park Place art gallery in New York and said: “I really like what you’re doing. Would you like to come over and see what I’m doing?” The following year, he wrote Two Pages forSteve Reich, basically taking a set of patterns, repeating them and making them longer, which was the breakthrough for him in the way phasing was for me. After that, we travelled and toured together, shared an ensemble – and then at some point it got a little close for comfort and suddenly my best friend became somebody I didn’t talk to.That persisted from the early 1970s until 2014, when Nonesuch Records’ Bob Hurwitz wanted to do something where we shared the evening. He took us out for dinner and I said [to Glass]: “Hi. How are you?” The deal was I’d play a piece of Phil’s and he’d play one of mine. He played Four Organs, which we’d both played on in 1970, and I played Music in 12 Parts, one of the early pieces I’d played in his ensemble. The whole thing went very well and we … we don’t hang out, but it broke the ice and just made things a lot more humane.View image in fullscreenReich’s Four Organs performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2014 as part of the 50th anniversary of the Nonesuch label (from left: Philip Glass, Nico Muhly, David Cossin, Timo Andres and Reich).Photograph: © Stephanie BergerDo you remember theGrateful Dead’s Phil Lesh?Steady-dietI met him in a class at Mills College with the Italian composerLuciano Berio. We hit it off and started to hang out. At that time, Phil Lesh was writing these orchestral pieces à la Stockhausen or Berio – he didn’t play the bass, but did play trumpet. We did a “happening” in San Francisco sometime around 1962 or 1963 and worked together on the electronics. He was driving a cab and I was working at the post office, so we pooled our incomes to buy a really good tape recorder. We spent a lot of time together, then one day he went to see his old friend Jerry Garcia and, the next thing I knew, he was the bass player with the Grateful Dead. We stayed in touch a little bit. He was a good man, a really great musician and a positive force.Do contemporary classical composers, in particularpioneersminimalism, listen to disco? Or even punk rock?Dmitry_SPhil Lesh and I both listened to the Beatles and over the years I’ve grown to have an enormous admiration for Paul McCartney. Punk and disco didn’t really grab me, but the next thing that really did wasRadiohead, from a whole other generation. I had a concert in Kraków and the other big attraction there at the time was Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, who unbeknownst to me had done his own version of my Electric Counterpoint, which is for electric guitar. I thought his version was great – a rockier counterpart to Pat Metheny’s jazzier version – and we really hit it off. Then, discovering Radiohead’s music impressed me so much. I was inspired to write Radio Rewrite, based on two Radiohead songs, which I’d never have written if I’d not gone through that whole experience with Jonny.My favourite piece of music for the past 30 years has beenMusic for 18 Musicians. Do you feellongformpieces of music like this are disappearing due to the modern way of consuming musicas individual, shorter “tracks”?BogmanfanSome pieces should be short. Clapping Music is four or five minutes – any longer and it’s boring, any shorter and it’s too short! On the other hand, as a composer, the music tells me Music for 18 Musicians should be about 55 minutes. I understand that people don’t necessarily have 55 minutes and that Apple Music and Spotify prefer us to listen to shorter tracks, rather than dice up something larger. I don’t run the world, but if there’s another planet that we should go to, let me know.View image in fullscreenReich in New York City in 2005.Photograph: Jeffrey HermanCan art play any meaningful role in countering the recent direction of US politics?ArmholeWe all wish it could, but it can’t. I have a favourite example. One of Picasso’s greatest works, Guernica, was made shortly after the bombing of the town of Guernica in Spain by Franco, the fascist dictator and friend of Hitler’s. Picasso read about it and created this antiwar masterpiece from the images in his head. Afterwards, we had the bombing of Dresden, Nagasaki, Hiroshima and then 9/11. So if that scale of greatness can have no effect whatsoever, we need to realise the limitations of art and music.Your works, such asTehillim, reflect a deep engagement with your Jewish heritage and history. Do you see your music as a form of spiritual or religious expression?NicolasRosYes, but there’s a long history of music being attached to religious expression. I’d never have written Four Organs if I hadn’t been thinking about the 12th-century Notre Dame cathedral composer Pérotin’s use of decorative melodies around a drone. With Tehillim [Hebrew for “psalms”], I was using my own background and writing within the western tuning system. I started by singing psalms, which got me into extreme, constantly changing meters – undoubtedly influenced by Bartók and Stravinsky – and then out popped a whole different way of rhythmically organising music. It was a pivotal piece for me and I think the hallelujah at the end is one of the best things that I’ve written.Jonny Greenwood: ‘I’m still arsing around on instruments like when I was a kid’Read moreYou’ve incorporated genres fromwestern music towest African drumming,gamelanand jazz. Is there a common aspect that keeps the musical discourse together?makeitadoubleVery simply, in some ways, they all have a harmonic centre. When I was a student in the 1950s, Stockhausen, Boulez and John Cage all had no harmonic centre and no regular beat. I could recognise the excellence, but always felt uncomfortable. Eventually I said: “I can’t do this.” When I studied with Berio and was writing 12-tone music, instead I took the 12 different notes of the piano and grouped them in groups of three, to sort of be in harmony. Being a great guy and very flexible, he said: “If you want to write tonal music, then why don’t you?” He opened the door to what I was intuitively trying to do.Steve Reich’s 27-disc box setCollected Works is out now on NonesuchExplore more on these topicsSteve ReichThe reader interviewClassical musicExperimental musicRadioheadGrateful DeadDavid BowiePhilip GlassfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Hole (2001)View image in fullscreenKnightley as Frankie with Thora Birch as Liz.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyKnightley’s first big role was in this teen thriller, about four private school kids partying in a bomb shelter, where it all goes predictably haywire. It’s a horror, and not just for the sheer dominance of low-rise bootcut jeans. Even in its more hysterical moments, Knightley brings nuance to the posh-girl stereotype.19. The Edge of Love (2008)Ostensibly about the poet Dylan Thomas, this ended up being more about the complicated relationship between his wife, Caitlin (Sienna Miller), and his ex-girlfriend, Vera. As a film, it is a bit of a mess and struggles to soar, but the performances, and particularly Knightley’s turn as the glamorous Vera, help to lift it.18. Silent Night (2021)The first of two films in which Knightley has to navigate the end of the world, and one of the bleakest conceits for a Christmas comedy ever thought up. While Knightley is perfectly at ease with a thriller or a period drama, this gruesome dinner-party piece shows she can do uptight country house black comedy, too.17. Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace (1999)As the decoy and “loyal bodyguard” to Natalie Portman’s Queen Amidala, Knightley gets to act the part of an actor, of sorts. She spends most of the film cloaked in black, in heavy makeup, delivering lines with a regal monotony, but it was a splashy start to her big Hollywood career.16. Seeking a Friend For the End of the World (2012)View image in fullscreenAs the ditzy Penny in the romantic comedy Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyConceptually ahead of its time and with a cast far better than you might expect, Lorene Scafaria’s film sees Knightley again hanging out at the apocalypse, this time accompanying Steve Carell. Watching his dopey misanthropic energy collide with Knightley doing her best manic Brits-y dream girl is quite the ride.15. Boston Strangler (2023)This noir-ish take on the infamous serial killer and the journalist who gave him his moniker sees Knightley playing a hard-boiled, tenacious reporter. Ultimately, the film is less about the killer/s than it is about the victims, and about journalist Loretta McLaughlin’s uphill battle to have the case, and herself, taken seriously.14. Love Actually (2003)Knightley was 17 when she played Juliet, the subject of Andrew Lincoln’s silent, card-holding declaration of his affections towards his best mate’s wife, which is either disgusting or romantic, depending on how you look at it (Knightley has hedged her bets, calling it “creepy and sweet”). She doesn’t have to do a lot here, but the film, and that scene, have taken on a seemingly endless afterlife of their own.Mark (Andrew Lincoln) shows his cards.Keira Knightley says she was ‘stalked by men’ after Pirates of the Caribbean and told ‘you wanted this’Read more13. Misbehaviour (2020)This likable ensemble saw Knightley playing the real-life historian and activist Sally Alexander. It took the rise of second-wave feminism and the plot to disrupt the 1970 Miss World pageant, and used them as a semi-screwball caper. Knightley was more of a straight woman, but its playful underbelly was a way for it to make some complex points about the protest and who was included, or not, in the uproar.12. Pirates of the Caribbean franchise (2003-20o7)She recently called the films “a very confused place in her head”, but this was the blockbuster franchise that made her a box office star. As Elizabeth Swann, Knightley gamely swashbuckled her way through the high seas in a sort of high-end, big-budget, crowd-pleasing panto.11. Begin Again (2013)On paper, it should have been unbearably twee, but it’s a crowd-pleaser, and then some. Knightley sings her way through this modern-day fairytale about a recently dumped folk singer who crosses paths with Mark Ruffalo’s recently fired A&R man. Is it possible for them to sidestep the corporate machine? She plays a lot of songs in a lot of different places to try to find out.10. A Dangerous Method (2011)David Cronenberg takes Knightley’s long-established proficiency in a corset and, well, Cronenbergs it. As Sabina Spielrein, one of Carl Jung’s psychiatric patients, and later one of the first women to become a psychoanalyst, Knightley does some serious acting. It is a film stuffed with big performances, and she more than holds her own.9. The Duchess (2008)She shines as the titular and put-upon Georgiana, who at 17 is married off to the Duke of Devonshire and set to work to produce an heir. It has all the elements of the key Knightley roles: a country house and a woman who rejects social expectations while strapped into some heavy corsetry and also being somewhat doomed, despite a steady display of defiance.8. Anna Karenina (2012)View image in fullscreenIn the title role of Anna Karenina.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyIt was perhaps inevitable that Knightley would end up taking on Tolstoy’s complex heroine in this faithful period drama, albeit seen through the less conventional lens of director and regular collaborator Joe Wright. It is a formidable task, and she delivers a performance that cuts through some of its more experimental flourishes.7. Never Let Me Go (2010)Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel, about clones created in a lab and raised as organ donors, is now a school curriculum staple. While Carey Mulligan takes the lead as Kathy, Knightley is more spirited as her best friend and occasional foil, Ruth. Despite the heavy subject matter, the film chooses a taciturn, almost workaday approach, but Knightley embodies its quiet, steady sense of tragedy.6. Colette (2018)View image in fullscreenAs the eponymous hero in Colette.Photograph: TCD/Prod DB/AlamyKeira Knightley: 'I can’t act the flirt or mother to get my voice heard. It makes me feel sick'Read moreIf Knightley sometimes errs towards stiff-upper-lip restraint, then she lets loose in this retelling of the French author’s first book, published under her husband’s name, Willy. When the marriage becomes toxic and she rejects his controlling ways and finds her own voice, she starts to explore big and exuberant questions about sex, talent and fame.5. Bend It Like Beckham (2002)This slow-burn fan favourite continues to win new aficionados today, two decades after its low-key release. The film belongs to Parminder Nagra’s Jess, but as sidekick Jules, Knightley gives heart and depth to the footballing tomboy fighting her mother’s expectations of who she should be.4. Pride & Prejudice (2005)View image in fullscreenAs Elizabeth Bennet with Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) in Pride & Prejudice.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyThe first of Knightley’s two Oscar nominations came for her Elizabeth Bennet, in Joe Wright’s starry and elegant Austen adaptation. There are so many versions of the character on screen that it can be difficult to find a new way in, but Knightley employs every one of her skills here, carrying the movie with her abrasive yet impossibly charming Lizzie.3. The Imitation Game (2014)Her second Oscar nomination was for best supporting actress in the accomplished Alan Turing biopic, in which she plays Turing’s friend, colleague in code-breaking and – briefly – fiancee, Joan Clarke. As Turing, Benedict Cumberbatch finds a perfect scene partner in Knightley, who ups the cut-glass vowels and finds a magnetic, brittle veneer of her own.2. Atonement (2007)The vowels are even more clipped and regal in Wright’s period masterpiece, which took Ian McEwan’s novel and transformed it into gorgeous, rich cinema. It may be where Knightley’s key oeuvre – posh, tragic and spirited – flourished first; as the glamorous and doomed Cecilia, it is certainly where it reaches perfection.1. Official Secrets (2019)View image in fullscreenAs GCHQ whistleblower Katharine Gun.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyOut of period costume, Knightley was at her career best in this underrated film about Katharine Gun, the GCHQ translator and whistleblower who felt compelled to leak documents about the US manipulation of evidence for the impending Iraq war. The friction between moral and professional duty is remarkable, and it showed she could offer a totally different interpretation of posh, tragic and spirited.Explore more on these topicsRankedKeira Knightleybest ofShareReuse this content"

He’s talking about the UK drill scene, a subject he explores in hislatest exhibition. In an image used to publicise the show, we see the faces of 42 rappers, all of them in prison.“In autumn last year, there was literally no one,” he says. “The scene was actually dead, everyone was locked up.”RIP Germain’s brutal, uncomfortable, confrontational installation explores UK drill music’s lyrical violence – and society’s voracious appetite for it. It asks how an entire musical movement could end up being lost to the UK prison system.The first work is a storm drain cut into the gallery floor, its grates the same size as the peepholes in UK prison doors. Peer down into the dark basement and a police van is flashing its lights. Downstairs, the room has been cleaned with forensics-grade bleach, the air cooled to the temperature of a morgue. That police van is actually a coffin for you to climb into to watch 101 hours of UK drill music videos, documentaries and social media posts. It’s suffocatingly claustrophobic and relentless in its glorification of guns and death. But the real shock is in realising how normalised, how mainstream, how celebrated this level of violence is.View image in fullscreenLifting the lid: he police van is actually a coffin.Photograph: Mark Blower/Mark Blower, courtesy RIP Germain and Cabinet.“People nowadays are starved of culture, so anything that seems like the real deal they gravitate towards,” says the artist, who keeps his real name secret. “Any form of subculture that people belong to in a genuine way, people want the keys to access that.” In the case of UK drill, its authenticity is integral to its success, and crime and violence – in the form of murder, assault and drug running – is key to that authenticity. “That’s a quick route to stardom,” RIP Germain says. “Take someone like [Camden rapper] Suspect, the way he blew up is that when he was releasing tracks and getting hundreds of thousands of views he was already on the run for murder and living in Kenya. The reputation is what attracts people to the music, and that’s what determines success.”Fans consume UK drill’s everyday gang violence in the same way that people consume true crime podcasts: they’re paying to satisfy a thirst for real death, as opposed to the fantasy of violence and gore provided by something like the horror genre. But that reality is also its downfall. The police monitor and delete UK drill videos from YouTube and social media, and at the same time the videos and lyrics can be used as evidence against the artists in court, all while the artists are expected to be authentic and to brag about these acts of violence.“It’s a trap,” RIP Germain says. “That’s where the audience comes into play. The vast majority of fans are not like the people making the music, and they are using them as avatars and living vicariously through them. For any medium to thrive, it’s going to be white suburban kids that are the biggest pool of buyers. That’s always the plight of Black entertainers.”Given that these rappers are objectively doing well – making money, signing to major labels – why is the lure of crime still so appealing to them?“If you’ve grown up a certain way it’s very hard to jump out of your own brain and reformat yourself,” says the artist. “Society is placing an outrageous level of expectation on these people, and there has been no space and complexity given to their lifestyles. This is an industry where a lot of people come from group homes, child services, alternative schooling, young offenders. It’s not a scene where the average person comes from a straightforward middle-class background.”Drill isn’t unique in its glorification of violent lifestyles: its antecedents in gangster rap and grime did plenty of that. As RIP Germain says: “There was extreme violence way before drill, and there will be after drill.” What’s notable about drill, however, is the way its commitment to violence has led to its own annihilation.View image in fullscreenVisitors face up to ‘the death that’s being sold and celebrated’Photograph: Mark Blower/Mark Blower, courtesy RIP Germain and Cabinet.The work isn’t an attack on UK drill culture, far from it. RIP Germain is deeply passionate and hugely knowledgable about the scene. Part-historian, part-archivist, he obsessively collects and saves videos that he knows are likely to be deleted by the police.Hip-hop culture has played an important part in much of RIP Germain’s work. The artist’s last major installation,Jesus Died for Us, We Will Die for Dudus!at the ICA in 2023, centred on a genuine, blinged-out, Hatton Garden-made thick gold necklace of a white Tupac wearing a crown of thorns, encrusted with diamonds, rubies and sapphires. Hip-hop, and more specifically gangster rap, functions for him as a way of attacking dominant power structures and questioning the way society consumes Black culture.He says he’s using UK drill to make a wider point: “Western culture is in love with violence. It’s a societal violence, it’s across the board. UK drill is the topic I’m using to explore how society functions, and how some people find that the only avenue they have to make it in life is to sell death, to sell their own imprisonment. That’s the currency exchange: ‘I’m exchanging the culture that you want for monetary gain. There’s consequences, but for now I’m going to look the other way to make it out of this neighbourhood.’ These people become products.”The show acts as a plea for clemency, for nuance, for forgiveness and understanding. “It’s not to absolve anyone of responsibility, it’s to look at the picture and see a group of kids that have been let down, and they’ve let themselves down, in a big way. And the work I’ve done over the past six years is flying a red flag saying we need to get ahead of this.”The brilliance of RIP Germain’s installation is in first making you an outside observer, peering through the prison door peephole from an objective distance, and then forcing you into that coffin, making you get properly face-to-face with the death that’s being sold and celebrated. He’s showing you that this isn’t just entertainment, these are lives being lost. What’s truly horrifying isn’t the violence itself, it’s the pleasure we take from consuming it.RIP Germain: Anti-Blackness Is Bad, Even the Parts That We Like is atCabinet, London, until 10 MayExplore more on these topicsArtInstallationRaceBlack British cultureDrillRapCrimeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Some were at least halfway joking; some were engaging in hyperbolic tough talk – jokes soured and bluffs unexpectedly called by Trump’s chilling 2016 victory. But even those with the means to hastily relocate mostly stayed put as the shock gradually wore off and plenty of high-profile celebrities lent their voices to protesting against the administration’s various policies (or, doing the celebrity version: making fun of administration oddballs through shaky impressions on the Saturday Night Live cold open). The message was clear: we aren’t actually going anywhere; we’re staying and fighting (or just trying to get through the day). Maybe some people still thought about leaving the country – I know a few who sincerely looked into Canada and Italy based on those countries’ particular rules. But after a global pandemic hit in 2020, there were other concerns involved with shifting residency anyway. Besides, later that year Trump himself was shown the door.And the loser is … politics: why was this year’s Oscars so reluctant?Read moreBut that door was left cracked open, and with the second coming of Trump, there’s been a change. Courtney Love isseekingUK citizenship. Married couple Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have already moved to the UK and recently put their final remaining US property up for sale, indicating the move’s permanence. Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes and their two children moved to London last summer – the same city where America Ferrera has been seen looking at schools, portending a possible move for the firmly outspoken actor. Rosie O’Donnellexplicitlycited concern for her nonbinary child as her reason for heading to Ireland and seeking citizenship there. (Texas native Eva Longoria now resides in Spain and Mexico, though she insisted last autumn that the relocation was not political.)Nine or 10 celebrities is not exactly a groundswell, but in the context of the relative quiet that has greeted the second Trump administration, it is notable. Plenty of famous folks supported Kamala Harris, and plenty have spoken out about certain causes since Trump’s re-election, tacitly and sometimes directly opposing the US president. The tone and volume, however, have been far more muted this time around, just as it has been with non-celebs. This probably reflects a sense of exhaustion and, if not exactly acceptance, perhaps understanding, even fear, that Trump’s 2016 victory wasn’t as anomalous as many hoped. If an American celebrity’s primary job is some form of visibility, a small but noticeable group of them are quiet-quitting their country. And it’s not just the famous (though presumably it is mostly the relatively rich): there’s been an overall40% uptickin Americans seeking British citizenship.On one hand, it’s hard to blame people who have the resources to put their money where their mouth is. The second Trump administration is far more focused on the business of remaking the government, and the country along with it, and part of that strategy entails telling anyone it can that they aren’t considered real Americans. Women, racial minorities, and basically anyone else who isn’t a white male have been told that they don’t really count the same way – that they’re “DEI” people, and they’re about to get purged if they don’t shut up and go along. Cases like O’Donnell’s are particularly sympathetic: anyone with a child who doesn’t identify as belonging to the most traditional categories possible must be terrified that they could wind up sitting by as their rights are stripped away. Hollywood higher-ups have also signaled that they’re ready to capitulate to Trump Nation, duly trashing their DEI initiatives and, in the case of tech-related companies, cozying up to the administration. So it makes sense that some are opting out of that world.At the same time, no one in these celebrities’ position will ever be as deeply affected as, say, a trans kid whose family can’t afford to uproot them out of a red state, let alone out of the country completely. To some extent, efficiently escaping the Trump administration has become just another luxury item for the 1%, the kind of exemption Trump and his cronies constantly seek for themselves. This isn’t celebrities’ fault; Trump’s wrongdoing is his own, and it is legion. It’s a measure of his corruption, though, that one of the best ways to avoid it without hiding in a cave is apparently to spend a bunch of money moving to one of the most expensive cities on Earth. Where regular Americans might have once peered at a celebrity Instagram and felt a pang (or more) of jealousy over a beautiful house or a particularly cushy vacation, now they have the opportunity to envy some basic rights and freedom from direct persecution. It’s a positively Trumpian development: you don’t have to be oppressed, provided you have the right luck or money.Explore more on these topicsCultureDonald TrumpEllen DeGeneresCourtney LovefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s far from the only televisual masterpiece to deliver a devastating emotional punch …Stuart HeritageThu 20 Mar 2025 07.57 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 11.20 EDTShareAdolescence, as the world seems to agree, is a perfect piece of television. However, even perfection has its problems. Adolescence is the sort of show that needs some breathing space afterwards; it’s so comprehensively shattering, and will leave you in such a state of emotional despondency, that you can’t simply hop straight into the next show. I tried – after episode four, I had to watch a reality show for work – and it was horrible. It was like stumbling from a funeral straight into a circus.Perhaps what we need here is an off-ramp. A bunch of shows that, while they might leave you in pieces, may not pack quite such a devastating punch as Adolescence. Here’s a selection of the most heartbreaking television.The Virtues (Channel 4)View image in fullscreenAlcoholic breakdown … The Virtues.Photograph: Dean Rogers/Channel 4If Adolescence wanted to make me do anything – aside from lock my sons in a sensory deprivation chamber until they reach adulthood – it was to watch2019’s The Virtues. Like Adolescence, it stars Stephen Graham and was co-written byJack Thorne, and like Adolescence it’s so raw that it sometimes feels impolite to even watch it. Directed by Shane Meadows, it’s the story of a father who suffers a comprehensive alcoholic breakdown when his wife and son move to Australia without him. There’s repression. There’s childhood trauma. There is an ending that will leave you numb for weeks. If you’re chasing the hit of Adolescence, this is the place to start.This Is England ’86, ’88 and ’90 (Channel 4)View image in fullscreenGut-wrenching … Chanel Cresswell, Rosamund Hanson and Vicky McClure in This Is England ’86.Photograph: Channel 4Another collaboration between Graham, Thorne and Meadows, these area clutch of miniseries, made between 2010 and 2015, that develop the story from Meadows’s 2006 film This Is England. All three shows deploy a gut-wrenching intensity that can be hard to bear. There’s rape and violence, murder, death and poverty – and some of the narrative is set at Christmas, just to compound the misery. Graham’s arc, as a character who struggles to atone for his part in a violent racist attack years earlier, is particularly harrowing. However, there’s also a sense of hope in the show, however dim it might be at times, that just about manages to lift you out of the dirt.The Leftovers (Now TV)View image in fullscreenBleak … Justin Theroux and Carrie Coon in The Leftovers.Written during a depression after the death of his father, Damon Lindelof’sThe Leftovershas the potential to be one of the bleakest programmes ever. An unexplained event makes 2% of the world’s population vanish, leaving the remaining 98% to battle through their grief while a nihilistic religious cult forces everyone to confront their loss. This might be a good next step from Adolescence, because although it starts dark – the pilot episode contains scenes of dog murder – it soon finds absurdity and hope in its miserable premise.Chernobyl (Now TV)View image in fullscreenInnate sadness … Chernobyl.Photograph: Liam Daniel/Sky UK/HBOThe fear of Adolescence is that what happens to its family could happen to anybody. Meanwhile, the Chornobyl explosion was a thing that did happen to many people, and the truth of the disaster was far worse than was reported for decades. There’s an innate sadness tothe show, of course – how could there not be? – but in its depiction of radiation poisoning and death, it also makes a fitting lurch into horror. Historically accurate bleakness.It’s a Sin (Channel 4)View image in fullscreenDeep humanity in every frame … It’s a Sin.Photograph: Ben Blackall/Channel 4This show deserves to go down as Russell T Davies’s masterpiece. Both the BBC and ITV passed onIt’s a Sinbefore Channel 4 picked it up, perhaps fearing that a show about the Aids epidemic of the 1980s would be too harrowing for mainstream audiences. This isn’t quite the case – there are moments of real joy here – but it’s a hard thing to watch as characters die off, knowing that this all really happened. Like Chernobyl, the show burns with an anger that this was ever allowed to happen. But there’s also a deep sense of humanity in every frame. Davies has never written more from the heart, and it shows.This Is Us (Channel 4)View image in fullscreenCompelling … Milo Ventimiglia, Kaz Womack as Kevin, Isabella Rose Landau, CaRon Jaden Coleman and Mandy Moore in This Is Us.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesThis Is Usis compelling: it feels as if it was precision-designed by a team of expert crafters to make as many people cry as possible. It’s about a family who experience the familiar peaks and troughs of love, birth, death and heartache, but with everything ramped up to an absurd degree. You find yourself sobbing even though you’re being manipulated. It is also aggressively sentimental in a way that Adolescence isn’t, which might be a comfort.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionJack ThorneStephen GrahamShane MeadowsYoung peopleDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In recent years, Bryan Ferry has done just that, tending his legacy via vast box set retrospectives of his solo work; reconvening Roxy Music for a 50th anniversary tour; and releasinga cover of Bob Dylan’s She Belongs to Methat seemed to discreetly reference the subtler moments on Roxy’s eponymous debut or 1973’s For Your Pleasure.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Loose Talk.Photograph: Publicity imageAnniversary tours, deluxe box sets, slyly referential cover versions: these are the things almost all artists of a certain vintage and standing indulge in. But Ferry has also taken a more idiosyncratic parallel approach to his history. On 2012’s The Jazz Age and 2018’s Bitter-Sweet, he reworked his back catalogue in the style of late-20s jazz, replete with knowing references to standards of the era: Love Is the Drug in the style of Duke Ellington’s The Mooche; 1977’s This Is Tomorrow appended with a reveille that nodded in the direction of Louis Armstrong’s West End Blues.Now there’s Loose Talk, ostensibly Ferry’s first album of new music in 11 years, but more an act of exhumation. The instrumental tracks are based on unreleased demo recordings from throughout Ferry’s career, with the earliest examples dating from the early 70s. These demos were then refined and reworked in the studio, with some fresh contributions from musicians including Roxy drummer Paul Thompson. There’s a particular pleasure to be had in trying to work out what era the original recordings hail from. Presumably the recordings of piano and electric piano on Big Things and Landscape, wreathed in tape hiss, are from the 1970s. Was Stand Near Me’s strange blend of funk bass and noodling, occasionally atonal synth once intended to be brushed up for 1979’s Manifesto? Were the eerie ambient electronics on Pictures on a Wall a staging post en route to Avalon’s instrumentals India and Tara?Bryan Ferry and Amelia Barratt: Loose Talk – videoHappily, the music on Loose Talk has value beyond a guessing game for Roxy/Ferry nuts. The album is a collaboration with visual artist and writerAmelia Barrattafter they apparently met at a gallery opening. She provides texts and narration, in a cool, unemotional RP voice. Their first collaboration – a track calledStarthat appeared on the aforementioned career-spanning box set – was based on piece of music by Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor and his regular film score collaborator Atticus Ross, and a certain soundtrack-y quality clings to the music here.Floristdrifts moodily along; the more strident closingtitle trackboasts an appropriately end-credits feel (and it opens with a clatter of drum-machine handclaps, a sound so familiar from 80s pop, and so completely absent from it in more recent years, it has a weirdly Proustian effect).There are certainly points where Ferry’s contributions fade into the realm of the characterless – Demolition or Florist could be the work of anyone – but Loose Talk is liberally studded with genuinely haunting moments, frequently when the old demos yield a snatch of vocal, as on Landscape or Cowboy Hat. Ferry’s melodies are beautiful, the fact that these vocals are either wordless place-filler or rendered incomprehensible by the lo-fi sound gives them a strange quality, like memories you struggle to recall in detail.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

There’s plenty of visual detail in her writing, but what’s actually going on is usually unclear. If the sunny vignette of Holiday or the depiction of a tailor at work in Cowboy Hat seem straightforward enough, more often it feels as though something has happened out of shot, and it sounds like bad news: the narrator of Florist ends up in tears; the relief solitude provides on the title track feels unsettlingly overwhelming. Occasionally, Barratt alights on subjects her collaborator might have written about. There’s something quite Ferry-esque about the vengeful siren of Stand Near Me, applying perfume before exacting some nameless retribution, or the narrator of Big Things, watching a barman flame an orange peel, a distraction from the sight of the bar’s “dreadful carpet”. But more often, the sense of imprecise dread or menace that infects a lot of her writing gives Loose Talk a noticeably different emotional – as well as musical – cast to anything Ferry has attempted before.If the end results aren’t quite as holistic as the “duet” both parties have claimed it as, it still works. Barratt’s texts are striking enough that the listener doesn’t long for an instrumental version; Ferry’s approach is intriguing and impressively original. It’s a diversion, but one that transforms his past into something fresh.Loose Talk is released on 28 MarchThis week Alexis listened toNeal Francis – Broken GlassThe singer-songwriter heads towards the post-punk disco dancefloor in the company of Brooklyn trio Say She She, with entirely fabulous results.Explore more on these topicsBryan FerryAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockSpoken wordalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Aside from being deeply funny, it’s full of endearingly odd characters, rich with silly detail and, barring a little violence and sadness towards the end, it’s overall a relaxed and fuzzy tale of nothing in particular. Am I wrong?!thealmightycraigIt has a supremely silly plot but has a pin-sharp script that is marvelously acted. It makes me laugh from start to finish. And having watched it several times, I’m almost word perfect with the script.rewilderMoonstruckI’ve seen it at least 20 times and it never fails to make my day. Every character, big or small, gets a golden line. No throwaways. The grandfather is worth the price all by himself: “Why do you make me wait! Howl.” Love it.Fintan28View image in fullscreenA still from Pride.Photograph: Nicola Dove/AllstarPrideI went to see it one dull afternoon without knowing anything about it but came out of the cinema filled with joy. The soundtrack is amazing. The story is educational and truly uplifting.CardykidThe DaytrippersA bickering family from Long Island navigating the city to help Hope Davis find the elusive Sandy, someone her husband may be having an affair with. The cast is phenomenal! Anne Meara, Parker Posey, Liev Schreiber and more. Marcia Gay Harden is hilarious.VColarussoMy Man GodfreyWilliam Powell and Carole Lombard are perfect and the supporting cast has no weak player. Jean Dixon and Gail Patrick were never better. It’s witty, charming, and has real heart. As a bonus, the cinematography is stunning.JDAretiredSome Kind of WonderfulAll of the characters feel authentic, no one is a bitter caricature of a human being. As a result, all of the decisions feel real and right. Especially, the end, proof that sometimes if you are prepared to let something go, it might just come back to you.SpluttererSix Degrees of SeparationWhen Stockard Channing declares her independence and strides out on Donald Sutherland at the film’s end, it’s a resolution of every grain of tension in the story and a demonstration of how life’s connected threads can pull us but also show us the way. It’s a brilliant, satisfying ending and I get a thrill each time I’m lucky enough to see it.cbpm72CharadeWonderful chemistry between Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, characterful support from James Coburn and Walter Matthau, glamorous Parisian setting and a witty script. The perfect romantic comedy thriller.FrogCDEThe InbetweenersWhat’s so clever about it, and its equally wonderful sequel, is that beneath the laddish humour, it’s really quite sweet. Four misfits just trying to be “normal”, and kind of achieving what they perceive as normality by sharing life’s experiences with one another.11LFO11View image in fullscreenJohnny Depp in Ed Wood.Photograph: Touchstone/AllstarEd WoodIt has a great script and wonderful performances, but most of all it’s just an amazingly heart-warming film. It doesn’t really matter that Ed is dreadful at making movies because he just loves what he’s doing. Moreover, it’s a story about compassion, friendship and the value of just opening your heart to the world. Ed’s crew are people who are marginalised or rejected or washed up, but he doesn’t care – he’s just happy to have them around and to work with them. In return he finds someone who will love him without judging him.ThornDavisThisIs Spinal TapI know it’s coming, I’ve seen it a thousand times, but when Stonehenge appears, I’m a giggling wreck. Every single time.DarenBThe Nice GuysIs it a masterpiece? No. Is itthefunniest film I’ve seen? No. But I love it. It’s a wonderful blend of 70s noir pastiche, buddy-cop comedy and detective drama with a hell of a cast, and probably the best comedic performances to date by [Ryan] Gosling and [Ruseell] Crowe (Gosling in particular is effortlessly brilliant). Because it doesn’t take itself or its story too seriously, I don’t have to be switched on totally to watch it, so it works for me regardless of mood or energy level going in.jcs100North by NorthwestPerfect combination of drama, romance, comedy, thriller, looks beautiful, cracking dialogue, fabulous performances, great set-piece sequences … Everything so perfectly judged, no matter how brief or insignificant a moment (see, for example, the brief scene where Thornhill escapes the hospital through a young woman’s room!). And Hitchcock’s hilarious, not remotely subtle, dick joke in the final shot of the film will always leave a smile.natjimExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieThe Big LebowskiPrideThis Is Spinal TapThe Nice GuysThe Inbetweeners MoviefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump said ‘no redactions’, so no redactions.”The files support the widely held belief – some would say truth – that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. “There’s no evidence of a second gunman, which means Ted Cruz’s father is off the hook,” Kimmel joked. “All Trump did, really, was make a big mess. These are basically the same files Biden released two years ago, but these were totally disorganized.”Jimmy Kimmel on release of JFK files: ‘Like Christmas morning for conspiracy theorists’Read moreTrump’s move reportedly surprised his own team, forcing his national security officials to stay up all night to get the files together for the promised release. “Great hustle, guys. And hey, now that we know how fast you are, let’s see those Epstein files you promised,” said Kimmel. “I’m not a betting man, but I bet they’ll take time to make redactions from those.”Kimmel also touched on nearly a dozen instances of vandalism against Tesla dealerships in protest of its owner, Elon Musk. Trump’s unelected right-hand man appeared on Fox News on Tuesday to drum up sympathy. “Tesla is a peaceful company. We’ve never done anything awful,” he said. “I’ve never done anything awful. I’ve only done productive things … there’s some kind of mental illness thing going on here, because this doesn’t make any sense.”“Well, let me see if I can explain it for you: when you pull out a chainsaw to celebrate firing thousands of people, they get mad!” Kimmel retorted. “This poor guy – you do one, maybe two Nazi salutes and everybody gets all bent out of shape.”The Daily Show.@JordanKleppershouldn’t have to explain this to Elon, but it’s not about the Teslaspic.twitter.com/yl9Y2krSBW— The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow)March 20, 2025On The Daily Show, Jordan Klepper also looked into the backlash against Musk, including a dozen instances of arson and vandalism targeting Tesla dealerships that Klepper described as “petty acts of domestic terrorism”.“Nobody should be breaking the law and blowing up Teslas. Especially because if you just wait a few minutes, they’ll probably do it by themselves,” he joked.Klepper played the clip of Musk going on Sean Hannity’s show, where he “made the case for his victimhood”.As Musk put it: “It’s really come as quite a shock to me that there’s this level of hatred and violence from the left.”“I shouldn’t have to explain this to Elon, but it’s not about the Teslas,” Klepper responded. “If I had to hazard a guess about why they’d be mad, it might be because in the last several weeks, you fired tens of thousands of federal workers, you made cuts to veterans’ care, life-saving foreign aid and food banks, you cancelled important medical research” so abruptly that medical devices for clinical trials were left in people’s bodies. “People might get a little upset if you stop their medical trial halfway through them!“Or maybe people are mad at you because you don’t seem to know what the fuck you’re doing,” Klepper added. “You fired aviation safety staff, then you had to hire them back. You fired nuclear safety inspectors, then you had to hire them back. You cut funding for Ebola prevention and then said, ‘oopsie!’“I could come up with more reasons, but let’s be honest: Elon knows why people are mad at him,” he concluded. “We know he’s not as smart as he pretends to be. But he’s also not as dumb as he’s pretending to be right now. And when he goes on Sean Hannity to complain about why people hate him, it’s just proving that the troll king of the internet can’t handle the consequences of the real world.”Explore more on these topicsLate-night TV roundupJimmy KimmelTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m grateful for all theBFIhas done to support UK film-making and this incredible art form we share.”Cruise spends much of his time in England, with considerable portions of many of his projects based here. The Mission: Impossible films were filmed on location in London, Birmingham and Yorkshire; other UK-based credits include Legend, Interview With a Vampire, Edge of Tomorrow and Eyes Wide Shut.The BFI chair, Jay Hunt, said: “Tom has brought so much to the UK as a producer … choosing to make many of his films on our shores, where he is welcomed by our crews who step up to help make his cinematic visions a reality.”She continued: “In doing so, he also supports our studios and puts our locations on a world stage, in the process creating jobs and inspiring the next generation of film talent. He is, of course, also simply one of the world’s great actors and a true movie star, delighting audiences as the action hero and romantic lead and then surprising us with brave, left-field roles where his versatility and talent shine through.”An “in conversation” event with Cruise will take place on 11 May, the day before he receives the fellowship, to kick off a month-long season of his films.Former BFI fellows include David Lean, Bette Davis, Akira Kurosawa, Ousmane Sembène, Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, Orson Welles, Thelma Schoonmaker, Derek Jarman, Martin Scorsese, Satyajit Ray, Yasujirō Ozu and, most recently, Tilda Swinton, Barbara Broccoli, Michael G Wilson, Spike Lee and Christopher Nolan.In 2022, Cruise received an honorary Palme d’Or at the Cannes festival in France; he has also won three Golden Globes and been nominated for four Oscars. In December 2024, he was awarded the US navy’s highest civilian honour, the distinguished public service award, in recognition of his “outstanding contributions” to the military via his film roles – presumably Top Gun and its sequel, rather than, say, Cocktail.One of the highest-grossing film stars of all time and one of the best remunerated, he is also a well-known advocate for the Church of Scientology, and is believed to have a home near its UK headquarters in East Grinstead, West Sussex.Explore more on these topicsTom CruiseBFInewsShareReuse this content"

After being arrested during the Brixton uprising of April 1981, Wheatle spent four months in prison, where he read CLR James, Charles Dickens, James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Langston Hughes and John Steinbeck among other authors handed to him by his cellmate.“Whatever I achieve in this old writing game is down to the conversion I experienced under Simeon in Wormwood Scrubs,” he wrote inthe Guardian in 2021.Wheatle was born in Brixton, south London, on 3 January, 1963, to Jamaican parents, and spent much of his childhood in Shirley Oaks children’s home in Croydon. The fourth film of Steve McQueen’s 2020 BBC anthology series Small Axe, titled Alex Wheatle, is based on the author’s childhood and imprisonment.Wheatle’s first novel, Brixton Rock, was published in 1999, and is about a 16-year-old who has lived in a children’s home all his life. He wrote many novels for adults over the ensuing decade, including East of Acre Lane, Island Songs and The Dirty South.His first young adult novel, Liccle Bit, was longlisted for the Carnegie medal in 2016. A follow-up, Crongton Knights, won the 50th Guardian children’s fiction prize the same year. Wheatletold the Guardianthat he turned to writing YA novels because he was disillusioned with adult publishing. “Even though I had a good reputation, I always felt a resistance. I didn’t feel like I was making inroads. I felt like I was this token black writer who writes about ghetto stuff.”Two further Crongton books, Straight Outta Crongton and In the Ends, were published in 2017 and 2023 respectively. A BBC adaptation of the Crongton books is due to land on iPlayer next week.Alex Wheatle: ‘I have nightmarish moments where my past comes back and hits me’Read moreWheatle was awarded an MBE for services to literature in 2008. His recent books include Home Boys, Home Girl, Cane Warriors and Kemosha of the Caribbean. In 2023, he published a memoir,Sufferah: Memoir of a Brixton Reggae Head.Wheatle’s “poignant memoir gives us insights into his own suffering: his early life in care, the bullying and abuse he endured, the brutality of the police,” wrote Lucy Popescu in a Guardian review. “Yet Sufferah also documents his love of reggae, the joy of discovering his paternal family and his journey to become an award-winning writer.”The author “has 26 years of legacy for you all to continue and enjoy by reading his novels, watch again the self-titled episode ‘Alex Wheatle’ from the Small Axe TV series and also watch the new upcoming Crongton TV series as he looks over us in spirit”, said his family.“Alex’s fierce intelligence was leavened by a great sense of humour and warm smile which enveloped all who were lucky enough to find themselves in his orbit,” said Grant.Explore more on these topicsBooksAlex WheatlenewsShareReuse this content"

His pacemaker showed no activity after 18 February; he is also believed to have suffered from advanced Alzheimer’s disease.“She’d called me a couple of weeks before her death to ask about getting an echocardiogram [heart scan] for her husband,” said Dr Child. “She was not a patient of mine, but one of my patients recommended Cloudberry to her. She made an appointment for herself for 12 February. It was for something unrelated to anything respiratory.”Dr Child added that two days before her appointment was due, she cancelled it, saying Hackman was unwell. “She [then] called back on the morning of 12 February and spoke to one of our doctors who told her to come in that afternoon.“We made her an appointment but she never showed up. She did not show any symptoms of respiratory distress. The appointment wasn’t for anything related to hantavirus. We tried calling her a couple of times with no reply.”Dr Child also confirmed to the BBC that Arakawa “described some congestion but didn’t mention any respiratory distress, shortness of breath, or chest pain”.The Santa Fe county sheriff’s office now say they have confirmed that Arakawa made multiple calls to a health clinic on 12 February. It remains unclear why these calls have taken so long to come to light, as her previous date of death was predicated on her apparently having no communication by email after 11 February.That day she was also seen visiting a number of Santa Fe shops, including a chemist, pet food store and supermarket.Arakawa, 65, was found on the bathroom floor of the couple’s home, with a portable heater nearby, and pills scattered on a countertop. Hackman was found, apparently having had a fall and with no food in his stomach, in a porch a short distance away. Both bodies showed signs of mummification and bloating.One of the couple’s three dogs, which was in a crate recovering from surgery, died of starvation and dehydration, while the other two dogs were wandering the property and grounds.Dr Child cast further doubt on the official cause of death of his clinic’s prospective client, saying: “I am not a hantavirus expert but most patients who have that diagnosis die in hospital. It is surprising that Mrs Hackman spoke to my office on the phone on 10 February and again on 12 February and didn’t appear in respiratory distress.A Los Angeles-based doctor told the Mail on Sunday: “Respiratory failure is not sudden – it is something that worsens over several days. Most people get admitted to the ER [emergency room] because they are having trouble breathing. It’s exceedingly rare for a seemingly healthy 65-year-old to drop dead of it. In fact, no one’s heard of such a thing.”Representatives for the Hackman estate were initially successful in their bid to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports, especially photographs and police body-camera video, related to the couple’s deaths.Explore more on these topicsFilmGene HackmannewsShareReuse this content"

Inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland, an experimental postmodern fiction in which characters in 1984 California flashback to the 60s, it is Anderson’s second adaptation of his works, following 2014’s Inherent Vice.One of the stars of that film, Benicio Del Toro, also features in One Battle After Another, alongside Licorice Pizza co-stars Alana Haim and Sean Penn.The film is DiCaprio’s first since Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon in 2023.

It’s about “what that brings out for them and their relationship as they go on this journey to to work out what her death means,”Lintonsaid.Several of the plays in Linton’s final season focus on older characters and those in middle age. As well as Superwoman Schema and Miss Myrtle’s Garden, Sweetmeats looks at forbidden love between two middle-aged South Asian characters.Linton recently directedAlterations at the National Theatre, which was a revival of a play by Michael Abbensetts, the ground-breaking British-Guyanese playwright who became established in the 1970s.She said there wasn’t a conscious effort to include stories about older people in the season, but she did feel more stories that revolve around middle-aged Black and Asian leads need to be created.“What’s so beautiful about Sweetmeats is it’s a love story between these two elders: how often do we see a love story between characters of a certain age?“I think that’s happened because there’s something about us honouring our elders at this point as well. I feel very passionate about that. I’ve always felt passionate about that, but Alterations has really opened that up for me.”Other plays in Linton’s final season including After Sunday, which is set in a cooking class that takes place in a prison psychiatric unit; Heart Wall, Kit Withington’s play about the challenges of returning home as an adult, and House of Jenin, written and performed by Alaa Shehada.Linton is taking a break after she finishes at the Bush in two weeks before returning to direct Superwoman Schema. She has been a vocal advocate for creating a morediverse theatre landscape in the UKand for “disrupting” the established canon with new work and rediscovered pieces that go beyond the likes of Ibsen, Pinter and Miller.She said: “It was about really looking at the canon and making a decision to tell specifically British and Irish stories with a specific focus on Black and Asian voices, so that we could go: ‘Look, we are here, and our stories are deserved to be in the West End.’”Her six-year run as artistic director alongside associate director Daniel Bailey who is also leaving, has seen more than 50 plays performed that were written by British and Irish playwrights, with a particular focus on writers of colour.During the pair’s tenure they won four consecutive Olivier awards for productions and earned West End runs for original work, including Red Pitch and Shifters.They also founded the Bush Young Company during the Covid lockdown, and produced Lenny Henry’s debut play, August in England.Did Linton have any advice for new boss Lawson? “Follow your instincts … and remember the people that are around you are the heartbeat of that building,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTheatreBush theatreDementiaBlack British cultureHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He shunned formal scripts and liked to write dialogue the night before a shoot, to encourage actors to behave naturally. He also had a penchant for destroying written records.Jean-Luc Godard: a genius who tore up rule book without troubling to read it | Peter BradshawRead moreAnne Heilbronn, the head of books and manuscripts at Sotheby’sParis, which is auctioning the manuscript along with photographs and other items from De Beauregard’s estate, admitted she was overcome with emotion when she saw the documents.“I wanted to cry. It was an incredible shock to actually have this manuscript that is a record of the history of French and world cinema in my hands,” she said.“À Bout de Souffle is an iconic film for the whole world and here we see part of the dialogue, the scenes, the trailer, for the first time since 1960. As far as we know, it is the only script of its kind.”The original outline for the story, based on a news event that enthralledFrancein 1952, had been written by Godard’s friend and fellow New Wave director François Truffaut, who allowed him to develop the plot.De Beauregard, another of the movement’s key figures, had met Godard through Truffaut, and made a leap of faith in agreeing to produce Breathless, the then unknown director’s first full-length film.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What to do?’Read moreGodard approached the shoot over the summer of 1959 with a documentarist’s method, filming in the streets with a handheld camera and mostly with natural light. Having started with a precise screenplay for the first 14 minutes of action, he ditched it and decided to write each day’s script the night before. As the dialogue was to be synchronised in post-production, he did not mind if the actors forgot lines they had often been given on the morning of the shoot, as they frequently did.Sotheby’s says it is describing the manuscript as “partial”, not because anything is missing but because Godard did not submit a full synopsis and script to the ministry of culture’s National Centre of Cinematography and Animated Pictures, as would have been normal at the time, and made much of it up as he went along.Godard explained his thinking inCahiers du Cinémain 1968. “I had written the first scene [Jean Seberg on the Champs Elysées] and, for the rest, I had a huge number of notes corresponding to each scene. I said to myself, this is outrageous! I stopped everything. Then I thought about it … instead of finding something a long time before, I’ll find it just before. When you know where you’re going, it should be possible. It’s not improvisation, it’s last-minute fine-tuning.”In 1967, Truffaut wrote: “The passing years confirm our certainty that À Bout de Souffle will have marked a decisive turning point in the history of cinema, as Citizen Kane did in 1940. Godard has shattered the system, he has made a mess of the cinema.”The manuscript, with an estimate of £350,000-£500,000, will be sold as part of Sotheby’s online auction of books and manuscripts, open for bidding on 14-18 June. The single lot will include four original photographs of Godard and Seberg, a vintage contact sheet, and letters from Godard and the actor and director Roger Hanin, who appeared in the film, all from De Beauregard’s archive.“As someone who adores the cinema and is passionate about it, I can say it is one of the best film scripts I have ever held,” Heilbronn said.Explore more on these topicsJean-Luc GodardBreathless (A Bout de Souffle)FranceParisEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a film full of wonders but not a single word of dialogue in the epic tale of one cat’s adventures after a flood of biblical proportions (presumably a catastrophic result of global heating). As visions of apocalypse go, it’s rather lovely: a world lush with nature, animals learning to get by together. (Charmingly, in his Oscar acceptance speech, director Gints Zilbalodis thanked his cats and dogs.)Our hero is a slinky black cat with expressive yellow eyes as big as saucers. You get the sense that this feline is more accustomed to the pampered lap of luxury than slumming it in the wild. Alone in the forest, he saunters into a wooden cabin that seems to be owned by an artist. Is this his old home? Where is his human? Then a huge wave crashes through the forest like a tsunami and the cat takes refuge on a clapped out sailboat. Like an ark without a Noah, the boat accumulates beasts: a friendly golden retriever, a mellow capybara, a petulant lemur and a secretary bird.The animals move like real animals and sound like real animals. But Flow is not a slice of realism. In one scene, a gang of them pull together to save the capybara from peril (typically, the dogs get distracted, darting off after a passing rabbit). The beautiful, painterly computer generated animation looks a little like a Studio Ghibli film. And the strangeness of Flow’s odyssey reminded me of Werner Herzog; though its message about the survival of the kindest is the least Herzogian thing ever.Flow is in UK and Irish cinemas from 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmLatviaScience fiction and fantasy filmsAnimalsEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Most did eventually reach what Boulez regarded as a definitive state, but the ones that remained in compositional limbo the longest was his only string quartet, which he had begun to plan in 1948 (the year of his Second Piano Sonata and the cantata Le Soleil des Eaux). For many years, only five of the projected six movements of what he called Livre pour Quatuor were performed (and recorded); the work only reached its final form after the composer’s death and almost 70 years after it was conceived, when in 2017 the composer Philippe Manoury completed the reconstruction of the fourth and longest of its movements.View image in fullscreenBoulez: Livre pour Quatuor.Photograph: PentatoneWhen planning the quartet, Boulez had taken Beethoven’s late quartets and Berg’s Lyric Suite as his starting points, not so much as models to follow but to react against. The language of Livre generates its energy from the tension between the ghosts of the classical forms and the pointillist total serialism that the postwar generation of composers had fashioned from the music of Webern and Messiaen. From the start, too, Boulez had envisaged it as a modular work, from which performers could select which movements to play, and in what order, with a title echoing the symbolist poet Mallarmé’s Livre, a book whose loose-leaf pages could be read in any order.Quatuor Diotimawere able to work on the score of Livre with Boulez in the last decade of his life, clarifying his intentions and unravelling the technical challenges. They recordedthe five-movement version nine years ago, but this new disc, including the first ever recording of the fourth movement, is now the one to hear; the performance has tremendous confidence and authority and marvellously conveys the work’s vertiginous contrasts, between austere stillness and frantic activity, spare, etiolated textures against dense exuberance. If Livre pour Quatuor remains one of Boulez’s most challenging scores, this disc will gain it many new admirers.Listen on Apple music (below)Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

The spectres of previous tenants lurk in the bedside tables and slogan mugs they left behind; their fag smoke lingers in the carpets; the post they failed to redirect piles up in the hall. Neighbours, too, can feel like phantoms: we might rarely see them, but we hear their footsteps and their music, inhale their cooking smells, or simply somehow sense their recently departed presences on the communal stairs. As for landlords: they’re probably the biggest ghouls of all.In light of all this, it’s perhaps surprising that we haven’t seen more housing crisis ghost stories, or, as Róisín Lanigan’s debut has been billed, a “gothic novel for generation rent”. I Want to Go Home But I’m Already There is the story of Áine and Elliot, who have just moved into a rental together in a gentrified area of London. It’s a flat that, ominously, no one else seemed to want. They are both keen to enter a more adult stage of life, but something about the place unnerves Áine from the very start.It’s a familiar premise, albeit given a fresh spin. Lanigan is a wry and witty observer of how it feels to live now, and some sentences are a delight (“she finished the fizz and put the tinsel in their recycling bin and thought about how long it would take before it disintegrated into the earth. A long time. Maybe never, actually”).Beyond the paranormal mystery, Lanigan is more interested in exploring the psychic toll that renting takesShe also knows her gothic tropes. Here we have a female protagonist whose instincts are telling her that something is off but, as is usual, her male partner dismisses her: “he said the flat was just old, that it gave the flat character, that it was a silly thing to be scared of”. It’s that old conundrum: ghost or mental illness? And so Áine starts to keep things from Elliot, retreating into herself as she becomes more and more afraid (“She knew not to tell him that it wasn’t right, how quickly everything died here”).Lanigan creates a genuinely eerie sense of dread, and while she deploys some cliches, she does it in a tone verging on sarcastic: “Frequently she opened her eyes to see a figure standing at the end of the wrought-iron bed, staring at her in the darkness, and she’d be frozen in fear for a few minutes until she realised it was only Elliot, probably.” There are places where I laughed out loud, such as when she describes her landlord as “him, or her, the anonymous spectral gombeen that sucked up all of their capital”.As her use of “gombeen” indicates, Lanigan is Irish, and her talent for exploring the cultural dislocation Áine feels makes this novel stand out. It manifests in all sorts of ways, from her friends being more frightened of death “than was normal” because they haven’t seen enough corpses, to relatives who put out bowls of salt for spirits. Hailing from a superstitious family myself, I loathed Elliot and how he mocks her parents for their genuinely scary banshee story. His scepticism isn’t the problem, it’s the classist, xenophobic way in which he deploys it that has you believing in our heroine.There is much to love about this book: its humour, its use of mould (there isn’t enough mould in fiction) and its themes of inequality (Áine’s childhood respiratory issues are relevant). It’s a brilliant satire of London’s horrific housing market. It also has flaws. At times, it plodded; and I saw the twist – if you can call it that – a mile off. I sensed that Lanigan was wary of stretching our suspension of disbelief too far, and thus she deprives us of a terrifying climax, or explanation. But I may be simply too addicted to theUncanny podcast, and so crave answers where there are none.Despite these reservations, the book stayed with me: it got under my skin in a way that made me shiver. Beyond the paranormal mystery, Lanigan is more interested in exploring the psychic toll that renting takes, after “years of existing on other people’s furniture, soaking in their histories and anxieties”, and the meaning of home for those who may never own their own – the very real sadness of that fact. Most of all, this novel is about the decline of spirituality, and where this generation of young adults might locate God, or the devil, in its absence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Cunningham died in 2009, aged 90, and one of his dancers, Cédric Andrieux, now leads Lyon Opera Ballet, which pays tribute to Cunningham revisiting two works, Beach Birds (1991) and Biped (1999).Beach Birds is a classic. The dancers wear white unitards with a black stripe extending across the chest to gloved hands, and they do look bird-like, arms curved away from the body like wings or flippers. They jump and hop and tilt in balances, with quirky twists of the head. It is fiendishly difficult work, such careful placing of every limb, the absolute muscle control. The purity of form could seem detached, and yet with the peacefulness of Cage’s sparse score, there’s so much breathing space, a deep plié (bend) in second position can feel somehow emotional. The whole thing engenders intense curiosity, like watching animals in the wild.View image in fullscreenComputer generated … Biped by Merce Cunningham.Photograph: Agathe Poupeney/PhotoSceneThe creation of Biped was aided by the Life Forms computer programme, which allowed Cunningham to play with different permutations of the body on screen – in ways that wouldn’t come naturally to a human dancer – and then transfer them on to his company, making the technical demands on them even more difficult. Although the effect may be dry, the irony is it takes years of sweat and grit and sacrifice, so much human striving to be able to do it. Biped also features an early use of motion capture technology to create outlines of dancing bodies projected on a scrim in front of the stage, and it’s a strangely human addition, these ciphers dancing through the air; the tension between people and tech is a genuinely fascinating one.The movement is continually evolving while never quite arriving anywhere, accompanied by the shifting textures of Gavin Bryars’ score, as the dancers perform what looks like Cunningham’s version of petit allegro, the detailed footwork and small jumps you find in ballet. The work is no less challenging to watch now than when it was made. With Merce, you have to be willing to go there, to get sucked in and let time go. It’s odd dance, really, but essential.AtSadler’s Wells, London, until 20 March.

In the pit, Rafael Payare brings care and lightness to the intricate scoreMartin KettleThu 20 Mar 2025 10.19 EDTLast modified on Thu 20 Mar 2025 11.02 EDTShareAndrei Serban’s 1984 production of Puccini’s final opera was a well-flogged warhorse by the turn of the millennium, hugely assisted by the global 1990s popularity of the ariaNessun Dorma. Revived only two years ago it returns again, part of a Puccini-rich season marking thecentenary of the composer’s death(the event which left Turandot unfinished). But thankfully this staging is still far from showing its age.Instead Jack Furness’s meticulous staging, tightly choreographed by Kate Flatt, feels newly minted. When the blood red drapes at the front of the stage are ripped down in the opening bars, the oppressive ceiling-to-floor set looms over everything, severed head masks looking down. The action takes place amid shadowy watchers, seemingly indifferent to the heartlessness that pervades Turandot almost up to its sudden happily-ever-after end, which used the cut version of Franco Alfano’s 1926 completion.There is a fresh hand in the pit too. Both orchestra and chorus are unusually important inPuccini’s most ritualistic opera, in which massive, carefully structured climaxes alternate with quicksilver orientalist lightness.Rafael Payare, Venezuelan-born, grips the score, bringing high energy but also a lot of intuitive care and delicacy to a soundscape that can otherwise be unrelenting.View image in fullscreenReal tenderness … Sondra Radvanovsky as Princess Turandot and SeokJong Baek as Calaf in Turandot by Giacomo Puccini, at the Royal Opera House, London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianTurandot showcases Puccini’s interest in oriental musical traditions as well as his awareness of what his more modernist contemporaries were writing. But the main draw is still the big numbers – Liù’s tender first-act plea, the epic grandeur of the riddle scene at the work’s centre, plus, of course, Nessun Dorma – and those who come for them will not be disappointed.Sondra Radvanovskyshows why she is the reigning Turandot of the day. She has the steely vocal penetration that the role’s mightiest climaxes demand, but she also finds the latent humanity behind the mask. By bringing real tenderness to her explanation of why Turandot is so haunted by her tragic ancestor Lo-u-Ling, Radvanovsky elevates the evening.SeokJong Baek adds Calaf to his growing list ofCovent Garden successes. He is no great shakes as an actor, but nor is Calaf a role that requires one. Baek looks good and sings with uninhibited generosity. In Nessun Dorma he gave the audience exactly what it wanted, with the climactic phrase prodigiously extended.Anna Princeva delivered finely spun accounts of Liù’s two poignant arias. In a spritely trio of courtiers with Aled Hall’s Pang and Michael Gibson’s Pong, the baritone Hansung Yoo made a special impression in Ping’s song of yearning for the countryside. Adam Palka’s Timur, Paul Hopwood’s Emperor Altoum and Ossian Huskinson’s Mandarin all made the most of their moments. The time will come when Serban’s Turandot production is pensioned off.

Her resulting novel’s release into the landscape of 2025 only makes it more so.This stunning, devastating debut starts slowly, easing us into the future where the novel takes place, a future marked by global heating and mass extinction. Tom, a scientist working to find and preserve the fading vestiges of plant and wildlife, brings home specimens and treasures to share with his daughter, Orla, and his wife, Elena, at their home in the foothills of lutruwita/Tasmania. Feathers, skeletons and fins, “eggshells of the palest blue, a tiger snake’s translucent, papery skin”. But this poetic whimsy belies loss, as Tom is forced to reckon daily with the disappearance of the plants and animals he loves.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThese global losses, as well as closer, more intimate ones revealed as the novel progresses, weigh heavily on Tom and, early on, Elena wakes up to find that he has left. His absence is abrupt and unexplained. So when Kit, an old friend who loved both Elena and Tom deeply, asks Elena and Orla to venture into the forest with him to see if they can find answers on an old yacht in the middle of a nearly-frozen lake, she agrees.By this stage of the story, the effects of global heating have become more palpable – Elena and Orla’s home has been crushed by a falling tree during a storm that has devastated the city and triggered civil unrest. Elena is driven by a desperate need for answers, and the knowledge that the home she is leaving behind has been irrevocably damaged.Signs of Damage by Diana Reid review – gripping thriller of unsolved mysteriesRead moreThe reality that Greenhill describes is painfully close. Those animals that haven’t been wiped out are being pushed further out of their natural environments, with scientists working hard to manufacture something close to a natural balance. Despite glimmers of hope – lilies that bloom at the edges of flood waters, penguins returning to nest in human-made protective huts – they are largely fighting a losing battle. The animals are dying, leaving only the barest traces of themselves behind. Humans, as always, persevere, but they too have been pushed to the edges. Climate refugees flee flood, famine and fire. It’s the end of the line, a devastating global reality powerfully imagined.What does it mean to hope in the face of this crisis? Early on, Elena believes, as so many do, that hope can be found in children and in the creation of life. But after Orla – “hope embodied” – is born, the possibility of a second child makes Tom question the ethics of raising children in a world for which he has no hope. When Carol, a work-mandated psychologist, asks Tom what he sees when he imagines his children’s future, he replies, “With everything I know about the way the Earth is changing, I can’t picture my children’s future at all.”Greenhill writes Tom with immense empathy, presenting a man completely incapable of seeing his way out from beneath his own grief. And yet she doesn’t use it to excuse his actions, allowing Elena to express her fury at his disappearance and the selfishness of leaving her behind to raise and care for a child who is hurt and confused by his absence.Loneliness ebbs through the characters. Despite their love for each other, they are unable to fully reach beyond one another’s grief. And while this is particularly true of Tom, whose grief is all-consuming, it is true too of Elena, in her inability to explain things to Orla; and of Kit, whose feelings for Tom have long been an unspoken truth.In a world where so much has been lost, there is a sense, as Elena intimates when she first encourages Tom to try for a family, that finding ways to connect to each other is the most important thing there is. There’s an uneasy question lying beneath this – is connection enough? Maybe not, but love is a powerful and joy-filled filament that radiates through an otherwise bleak narrative.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These endlings, while somewhat disconnected from the main narrative at first, are a powerful way of bearing witness to great global loss. A way, perhaps, to say goodbye.Greenhill writes: ‘“Endlings’ is a word of haunting, lonely beauty, but perhaps it is impossible for any language, modern or ancient, to convey the solitude, the finality of that singular condition of being. A songbird calls out through the twilight for a mate, when there is no other like him surviving anywhere on Earth. He is alone.” She may well be summarising her own novel, evoking this deep, devastating loneliness.This beautiful novel cuts deep – and leaves an open wound.The Clinking by Susie Greenhillis out through Hachette Australia ($32.99)Explore more on these topicsBooksAustralian book reviewsAustralian booksFictionClimate crisisEndangered speciesEndangered habitatsConservationreviewsShareReuse this content"

Featured on two tracks on Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter (which he only found out on the album’s release), he became the poster boy of a revolution in country music overnight – one disrupting Nashville with Black cowboy aesthetics and trap and hip-hop mashups. The release of A Bar Song (Tipsy) just two weeks later was impeccable timing: it became a viral sensation, eventually tying Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road for the longest-running Billboard Hot 100 No 1.It is curious, then, that Shaboozey finds himself performing at the 1,500-capacity Koko. Though sold out, the venue seems minuscule compared to the scale of his radio and chart domination. But it’s an appropriate choice – unencumbered by the recurrent pressure on early-career artists to pack out oversized venues and maximise returns. The vibe is intimate, focused on the close chemistry with his three-piece band, who blow the roof off with some thunderously loud peaks.The show is a journey through the Old West. He plays the scorned lover when performing Anabelle, and on All Men Die the outlaw who punishes a friend who “wanna be John Wayne” and betrays him. All the while he’s swigging Jack Daniel’s , though admits that he needs to slow down.View image in fullscreenClear and confident … Shaboozey.Photograph: Laura Rose/The GuardianHe’s not wrong there. Whether it’s mild intoxication or vocal limitations, at times the balance between country drawl and indecipherable mumbling is thrown off-kilter. He is admirably vulnerable introducing Steal Her from Me as a song about heartbreak, but without controlled vocals it blurs into mopey warbling. He’s at his best, clear and confident, when rapping over trap drums and 808s on Beverly Hills and hip-hop breakbeats on Sticks and Stones.Still, Shaboozey charms in his more sincere moments. He says that when writing lyrics he visualises friends around campfires counting stars in the sky. On Finally Over, he’s candid about wanting to keep hold of those connections and not lose himself to fame. It is in country music, he says, that he has felt confident voicing such precise emotions and found comfort in life’s small graces. When he closes with Tipsy he runs into the crowd. It’s a little awkward, but the intimacy seems as important to him as the music.Explore more on these topicsMusicCountryRaplive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Far out on sparkling water, a white sail stands out against misty downs. The Victorian poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson regularly tramped over those chalky hills, declaring “the air is worth ‘sixpence a pint’”. There is no need to drive for a holiday on the Isle of Wight. Regular ferries connect with mainland trains and the island has a good network of buses.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I am travelling as a foot passenger on the 40-minute Wightlink ferry from Lymington Pier, where the train arrives along an embankment with yachts, plovers and redshanks outside the window. Once on the island, theSummer Links busservice, running from April to late September, stops at the entrance toTapnell Farm, where I’m staying for a couple of nights in a well-equipped cabin with a hot tub that looks out towards Tennyson Down.IoW mapThe14-mile Tennyson Trailruns along the spine of West Wight. It crosses tumuli-studded Compton Down, where there is a clear sense of being on an island: sea views on three sides, with long tapering white cliffs to the west and the gentler coast winding off to the east. There are blue butterflies and chalkland flowers such as orchids, wild thyme and nodding musk thistles.Freshwater Bay is a couple of miles away, so I head there on my first day for a swim among the chalk stacks. The most direct route from Tapnell skirts the site of the1970 Isle of Wight festival. With an audience of about 600,000, it’s still the biggest concert ever held in the UK. Jimi Hendrix played there on 31 August that year; three weeks later he was dead.Beyond the colourful walled garden of Tennyson’s former home are parkland walks and the ‘careless-ordered’ feel that he describes in a poemA short walk from the beach, a bronze statue of Hendrix, with his feet in Spanish daisies, stands in the garden ofDimbola. Once home to pioneering Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, it is now a gallery displaying pictures by Cameron and other photographers with changing exhibitions and one room dedicated to memorabilia from the annual Isle of Wight festivals (£6.90 for adults, £3 for children).Cameron was the great-aunt of writer Virginia Woolf, and Dimbola is the setting for Woolf’s only play, a 1935 comedy called Freshwater. Tennyson, the Camerons and the actor Ellen Terry are all larger-than-life characters in Woolf’s satirical drama. The real Terry appears pensively in one of many celebrity photos on display at Dimbola. In Woolf’s play, her character complains about having to wear itchy wigs and pose for artists and photographers. She declares: “Nothing ever changes in this house. Somebody’s always asleep. Lord Tennyson is always reading. Maud, the cook, is always being photographed.”View image in fullscreenThe bronze statue of Jimi Hendrix at Dimbola gallery.Photograph: Phoebe TaplinTennyson’s creeper-covered houseFarringfordis just around the corner (gardens £4.50; book ahead for house tours). A wooded footpath, heading left beyond thenearby thatched church, leads to the entrance. It runs under a footbridge that was first built by Tennyson to avoid his many fans. (In Freshwater, his character complains: “Twenty earnest youths from Clerkenwell are in the shrubbery; six American professors are in the summer house; the bathroom is occupied by the Ladies Poetry Circle from Ohio.”) Beyond Farringford’s colourful walled garden are parkland walks and the “careless-ordered” feel that Tennyson describes in a poem. You can see a cedar tree sketched by Edward Lear and the magnolia whose flowers Tennyson laid on his wife’s pillow.View image in fullscreenCarisbrooke Castle – where Charles I was imprisoned under Cromwell.Photograph: Graham Prentice/AlamyBack at the thatched church, I catch the open-topped Needles Breezer for a heart-stopping hairpin ride up to the clifftop Old Battery fort. The viewpoint for seeing the sharp limestone rocks and the red and white lighthouse is close by. Heading down again on the next bus, I can see Alum Bay’s cliffs of multicoloured sand, and Tudor Hurst Castle over the water. The day’s last Summer Links bus back from Yarmouth to Tapnell is also an open-topper and runs along waterside Tennyson Road. A£19 rover ticketgives me 48 hours’ unlimited bus travel around the island and includes the open-toppers.It’s drizzling steadily next morning and my hiking plans look less appealing. I was hoping to walk east along the Tennyson Trail, past prehistoric remains with intriguing names likeFive Barrowsto reach the National TrustMottistone Gardens. Instead, I roll through rosy thatched villages on a surprisingly efficient series of buses, finishing with bus 12, which drops me at Mottistone’s entrance.The misty air at Mottistone makes the flowerbeds seem brighter, and fills the woodland and wildflower avenues with romantic fogThe land around Mottistone’s old stone manor house has become a flowering garden with subtropical plants, scented roses and banks of foxgloves. The rain brings out the strong scent of the magenta beach roses, the subtler pale pink shrub roses and abundant purple catmint. The misty air makes the flowerbeds seem brighter, and fills the woodland and wildflower avenues with romantic fog. Raindrops spangle the orange lilies, red bottlebrush flowers and deep blue delphiniums. “This drop of rain is a blessing,” says head gardener Ed Hinch. He explains that the spiralling flowerbeds of the sandy Lower Garden were inspired by the naturally occurring Fibonacci sequence (£8.50 for adults, £4.25 over-fives, without Gift Aid).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bus stops near medieval St Mary’s church, and I walk to Carisbrooke Castle, where Charles I was imprisoned under Cromwell. A path leads steeply up from pretty Castle Street, through a field of sheep, to emerge near the gatehouse, where jackdaws are squabbling and spiral stairways lead up on to the ancient walls. There’s a heady scent from the wet mock orange flowers in the relatively new formal garden, with its avenue of fig trees, but Carisbrooke’s smell-scape is more varied: there’s a hint of bat in the darkest corners (more species roost here than at any other southern English site) and a lingering whiff of donkey in the old well house, which the animals still patiently trot over to on scheduled days to demonstrate a wheel that raises the deep bucket.View image in fullscreenOne of the cabins at Tapnell Farm, where the author stayed.Photograph: Phoebe TaplinThat evening in Tapnell’s barn-like restaurant, the Cow, I order a portobello mushroom burger. Tapnell Farm opened its first safari tents 13 years ago, later adding camping pods and an aquapark with a natural lake (two nights in an Eco Pod from £336). There are now several different glamping options; beyond fields of rescued wallabies are five new domes in a flowering meadow facing north across the Solent.A car-free trip around Aberdeenshire: I saw natural beauty I thought was out of reachRead moreNewtown, where I’m heading on my last morning, was once a busy medieval borough with saltworks and oyster beds. Now, it’s a tiny village in the marshes, where the old brick town hall is subsiding into carpets of clover. Bus 7 from Yarmouth takes 10 minutes to reach the New Inn in Shalfleet and I follow the island’s coastal path for a mile or so to Newtown estuary. Here paths lead through flowering hay meadows and salty stretches of sea purslane. There’s a waterside causeway, a wooden walkway and a well-equipped bird hide.Back in Yarmouth, there’s time for a final walk near the River Yar, round Henry VIII’s coastal castle, and past Yarmouth church, whose tall tower doubled as a seamark. With an hour until my ferry, I head for the watersideTerrace restaurant, which opened in 2020, to drink fresh lemonade with mint and watch the afternoon sun on the water, feeling as if I’ve had a whole week’s holiday.Combined train and ferry ticketsfor foot passengers start at about £30each way fromLondon Waterloo to Ryde or Yarmouth.This trip was supported byTapnell Farm.
