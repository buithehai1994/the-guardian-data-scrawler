WhenYvette Cooperwas chair of the home affairs select committee between 2016 and 2021, she was a force of nature. Tireless. Persistent. Forensic. A one-woman opposition party that the government took seriously.Yvette pretty much did for Amber Rudd – or rather, helped Rudd to do with herself – as home secretary. Sajid Javid was lucky to escape with a score draw in his appearances before her. Priti Patel merely had confirmed what we all knew: that she was one of the worst home secretaries in living memory.So you would have imagined that the current home affairs select committee would have wanted to live up to the reputation of its predecessor. To put Yvette through the same level of scrutiny. To make an appearance before them something the home secretary would come to fear. Two hours of her life in which her work at the department would be gone through in fine detail. And found wanting. After all, theHome Officeis pretty much guaranteed to break every secretary of state in the end.Only Cooper appears to be having a charmed life. It’s almost as if she had handpicked the committee itself. Mostly Labour MPs from the 2024 intake who appear reluctant to ask the tough questions. As if it might somehow be thought rude to do so. Or it might get back to the party whips that they had been a bit harsh.It’s all a bit of a love-in. New MP Jake Richards’s sister is an adviser to Yvette. He may as well have phoned in his questions over a drink or two. Nor are the two 2024 Lib Dems any different. There again, the current Lib Dems are even more enthusiastically Labour than Labour itself. This was the epitome of politesse. Courtly love. As a committee it was almost entirely pointless. Dumb, dumber, dumbest.The tone was set byKaren Bradley, the committee chair. A kind and gentle woman who appears to have unwittingly made a career as a politician. How this has happened, not even she really knows. She was, briefly, under the previous Tory government, the Northern Ireland secretary. Once in post, she declared that she had had the stunning insight that the Protestants and the Catholics really didn’t get on that well. You can’t buy that level of intelligence.To be fair, it’s possible that Karen is merely biding her time. Trying to sit out life as quietly as possible, not rocking the boat, while her party indulges its current lunacy. Let Honest Bob and Kemi fight it out among themselves. Sooner or later some kind of sanity must return. Or maybe not. Either way, she’s decided she’s taking it easy. Time to make friends, not enemies.We began with something vaguely topical. The arrest of Paul Doyle for allegedly driving into the crowd at the Liverpool parade. But no one had much to say about that. Nigel Farage and Richard Tice might have been bitterly disappointed that he hadn’t turned out to be a Muslim or an illegal immigrant, but everyone in the committee seemed quite relieved he had proved to be white and English.Then we moved on to policing. Which consisted of several MPs trying to name-check their own police forces. You feel that they haven’t quite got the hang of this yet. They aren’t in the committee room to generate a few soundbites for their constituency newsletters. They are there to interrogate the home secretary on the work of her department. But Yvette was more than happy to indulge the committee in its saccharine agenda. Why stop when you’re winning?This was Cooper in her happy place. It was as if she had dosed up on amphetamines especially for the afternoon. The words rattled out of her mouth at a frightening speed. Not necessarily in the right order. The sentences more or less made sense on their own but were completely unintelligible when collected into a paragraph. The overall effect was hypnotic. Words for words’ sake that battered you into morphine dream submission.In many ways, this was a bravura performance from Yvette. One designed to waste as much time as possible while saying little of interest. In among all the white noise she did commit news once, when she let slip that more children had been referred to Prevent, but that was a rare misstep. She wouldn’t let it happen again. This was all about running down the clock.Ten minutes from the end, Bradley finally noticed that no one had got round to talking about the small boats. Had anyone got anything they wanted to ask about this, she inquired. No one had really. It may be a hot topic elsewhere in Westminster but not here.Eventually, someone said something about hotels. We didn’t even get to discuss the warm-weather excuse that Chris Philp had described as nonsense, even though he had used himself. Was that the time? It was. It was over. Permanent Home Office secretary Antonia Romeo punched the air. She had lasted the entire two hours without saying a word. Civil servants dream of that sort of thing.Elsewhere, it was another day of Honest Bob out and about on manoeuvres. He is fighting the longest guerrilla leadership campaign in Tory party history. Another pointless TikTok stunt, then off to justice questions, where he once again defended the right of Tory women to encourage people to burn down hotels with migrants in them. No compassionate conservatism for him.But for outright stupidity, we must ask for the shadow Defra secretary, Victoria Atkins, to take a bow. Vicky had won an urgent question from the Commons speaker to ask Steve Reed about Thames Water. A scenario that even she couldn’t screw up. Except she could. Vicky wondered if the reason KKR had pulled out of the deal was because Reed had said a few mean things about them at the weekend. This is what passes for scrutiny from the opposition these days.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchYvette CooperHome OfficeKaren BradleycommentShareReuse this content"

Might they be better off without Spotify et al?Eamonn FordeTue 3 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 10.02 EDTShareThere is a battle gripping the music business today around the manipulation of streaming services – and innocent indie artists are the collateral damage.Fraudsters are flooding Spotify, Apple Music and the rest with AI-generated tracks, to try and hoover up the royalties generated by people listening to them. These tracks are cheap, quick and easy to make, with Deezer estimating in April that over20,000 fully AI-created tracks– that’s 18% of new tracks – were being ingested into its platform daily, almost double the number in January. The fraudsters often then use bots, AI or humans to endlessly listen to these fake songs and generate revenue, while others are exploiting upload services to get fake songs put on real artists’ pages and siphon off royalties that way.Spotify fines the worst offenders and says it puts “significant engineering resources and research into detecting, mitigating, and removing artificial streaming activity”, whileApple Musicclaims “less than 1% of all streams are manipulated” on its service. That may sound encouraging, but in a streaming business worth$20.4bn globally(according to the IFPI), it’s likely that hundreds of millions of dollars are being skimmed off annually by rogue operators.Part of the problem is that while the barriers of entry for musicians have been dramatically lowered – uploading songs to streaming services is much easier than manufacturing CDs or vinyl – the barriers of entry for fraudsters are lower too. So the industry has declared war, but hair-trigger automated detection systems mean that artists are seeing their music taken offline even when they’ve done nothing wrong.View image in fullscreenSpotify’s New York headquarters.Photograph: John Nacion Imaging/ShutterstockDarren Owen, chief operating officer of music distribution company Fuga, suggests streaming fraud “started to blow up across the industry” around 2021. Grappling with it now makes up 50% of his workload.Using AI and machine learning, Fuga gives streaming patterns a “severity score”, separating out “non-human listening patterns” to spot fraud. “You’re not going to listen to the same song at the same time across multiple devices,” Owen says, noting that countries like India, Vietnam, Thailand and parts of eastern Europe are hotbeds of click-farm activity, using low-paid workers. “It’s become clear that organised criminals are involved in it as well.”It is not just services like pimpyourfollower.de in Germany – which was taken offline after a court injunction – and others in Canada and Brazil who are being targeted by record industry trade bodies for offering artificially inflated streams. Universal Music Group (UMG), the biggest record company in the world, has been accused by Drake of conspiring to increase the play count of Kendrick Lamar’s diss track Not Like Us, an allegation UMG denies.The Guardian has spoken to multiple artists who found themselves at the sharp end of this war on manipulation, where unexpected spikes in streams get taken as proof of guilt.Darren Hemmings is managing director of music marketing company Motive Unknown and a musician himself. His distributor recently informed him that a track on one EP, having jumped from “a few plays a day” to more than 1,000, was guilty of manipulation. “I wouldn’t blame them for drawing that conclusion,” he says, but “it’s very judge, jury, executioner”. He did not manipulate the streams, but could not identify the root cause – other than it simply becoming popular with actual listeners.Northern Irish rock band Final Thirteen had some of their music taken off streaming services due to a spike in the tens of thousands. They suspect this came after a play on Radio 1, but their distributor automatically concluded they were manipulated. “It’s really hard for any artist to prove that they didn’t [manipulate streams], but it’s even harder forSpotifyto prove that they did,” says their drummer, Doobes. “[They] take it down and that’s it.”View image in fullscreenMatthew Whiteside of The Night With …Photograph: Julie HowdenAdam J Morgan, who makes music as indie act Naked & Baked, had a track get over 10,000 streams in a week, possibly from use in a TikTok video, but it was zapped by his distributor RouteNote as suspicious. “I hadn’t done anything wrong and they didn’t provide any evidence,” he says, believing it was down to an overly anxious RouteNote. “I spent that weekend trying to work out what was going on, but Spotify said my music hadn’t been flagged at all.” RouteNote did not respond to a request for an interview.Takedowns can cause musicians inconvenience, derail marketing and cost them money. Matthew Whiteside, artistic director of experimental classical event The Night With… (and head of the TNW Music label) had three different albums taken down amid claims of artificial streaming. He tracked it back: TNW Music tracks were being added to manipulated playlists. “It made no sense [why they were added] based on the genre.” His distributor said he could resubmit the album again, at $40 per album, but with no guarantee it would not be removed again.“Streaming in general is geared against the smaller and the niche,” he says. “If we get 1,000 streams a month on an album, I’d be very happy.” As such, paying to resubmit an album is beyond their release budget.Deezer claims it was the first streaming service to implement fraud detection systems. “We look at a lot of indicators that help our algorithm decide if a user is fraudulent or not,” says Thibault Roucou, the company’s royalties and reporting director. “When we ask for a takedown, we look manually at what’s happening and we’re very confident that it is extreme manipulation.”Unfortunately, systems elsewhere for taking down tracks often presume guilt and the appeals system is so arduous that small acts, already struggling, just give up. Pop singer Levina, who represented Germany at Eurovision in 2017, saw her music taken off streaming services without warning – it was flagged because she unintentionally had the same name as another artist. “With streaming services, it’s almost impossible to [appeal] through them,” she sighs. “You fill out a form but it leaves you quite powerless.”View image in fullscreenLevina, chair of the artist council within the Featured Artists Coalition.Photograph: Sam RockmanShe is also chair of the artist council within trade body Featured Artists Coalition, and they are finalising “minimum standards for what distributors should be doing”. She proposes a traffic light warning system that allows acts time to present their defence or take action to address the problems.Streaming services and distributors now accept this battle is about containment rather than total elimination. Owen, however, says the latest iteration is not fraudsters manipulating the streams of a few tracks by large amounts, but rather boosting multiple tracks a small amount to fly under detection radars.For Hemmings, this could result in a two-tier streaming economy, with smaller acts abandoning the main streaming platforms, where earnings are derisory anyway, to focus on a service such as Bandcamp. “This could provoke a conclusion among large swathes of the independent music community that they’re just better off focusing on other ways to make money.”Explore more on these topicsMusic streamingMusic industrySpotifyApple MusicIndieDigital music and audioArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

But other people’s reactions surprised her.“I thought people were going to laugh at me or be like, that sounds boring, but so many people would lean in and either get this eager look on their face or this sort of dreadful look on their face, and they would say, ‘Oh, I think I should probably do that too,’” she says. “I had no idea how many people had been in relationships for their whole adult life.”Febos, a professor at the University of Iowa and author of books aboutworking as a dominatrix,young womanhoodandwriting, chronicles this celibate era in her new memoir,The Dry Season. “I had scrutinized my experience and self in many different areas, but in this area, I was fairly unexamined,” she says. “I didn’t have as much insight about that part of myself.”Going boysober: the women who turned to celibacy in 2024Read moreThe experience ended up affecting more than her reliance on love and sex. “All the other areas of my life began to flourish and feel really fulfilling and complete,” she says. “I had kind of a honeymoon experience with myself, especially at the beginning, because I realized almost immediately that I enjoyed my own company profoundly, perhaps even more than I enjoyed the company of any other person.”What were those first weeks of celibacy like?What was the hardest part?At first, I wasn’t quite sure what my goal was, or what the conditions of my celibacy would be. I began with sex, because that seemed like the most obvious common denominator in my relationships. So I thought, I’ll take three months off. Within the first few weeks, I had the experience of flirting with someone, and I got a text from someone I’d been on a date with, and I identified very quickly the feeling of excitement and distraction that had been propelling me.I almost immediately began questioning the parameters of my celibacy: I thought, oh, perhaps it’s not sex. Perhaps it’s this feeling of being taken out of myself and chasing a psychological high that I get out of not just sex, but all of the activity around romance, flirtation and seduction.What made sex and relationships so appealing for you?One factor is a collective derangement that we have around love and sex. We idealize this very temporary, superficial definition of love, which has to do mostly with the early stages of infatuation and is predicated upon not yet knowing the lover, and not yet being secure or safe. That’s a traditional sense of eros, of longing and uncertainty; it’s a very immature definition of love, and it’s not sustainable.We have a collectively problematic relationship to love and sex … that it’s going to complete usBut it is the part of love that pop songs and movies and romance novels are obsessed with. I think we have a collectively problematic relationship to love and sex, and also a narrative about it – that it’s going to complete us, and it’s just about finding the right person and then everything’s going to fall into place.In addition, I developed early, physically, and underwent a radical difference in the way I experienced being perceived by other people, particularly by boys or men. And I got this messaging, as lots of young girls do, that my primary power in life was to attract and appear lovable and desirable. That’s a very fraught place to be sourcing one’s self-esteem, and I identified it early, at a time in life when I felt really disempowered.I’ve learned, partly as a result of being celibate and talking about it, that this is really common.In the book, you talk about distilling these internal beliefs to an idea of “if I’m not wanted, I will die”. You describe this concept as dramatic, but women constantly receive messages – from companies trying to sell us stuff, pop culture – that partnership is what women should aspire to the most.Those ideas have roots that go back literal centuries, right? Women’s individual personal safety and survival did depend on our being appealing to potential partners, both physically and financially. And that was true for a lot longer than it hasn’t been literally true. I don’t know how we would eschew that idea within just the last few generations.Why did you include historical examples of women who were also celibate, like theBelgian beguines, the 12th-century abbess Hildegard von Bingen and Shulamith Firestone, who called herself a political celibate?A few weeks into celibacy, I started to realize I had a set of role models for love and romance that were quite outdated, whom I had adopted as a younger person who was interested in semiconsciously justifying my own choices in love. These were primarily women who were artistically prolific and fulfilled, but also very passionate and messy in their love lives, like Edna St Vincent Millay and Colette and Sappho. I realized, I’ve chosen these role models because I’m already like them. And now that I’m trying to change my ideals, I need new role models.Buy an exclusive print from our Well Actually seriesRead moreSo I went about reading about women who were voluntarily celibate across global history, and ended up becoming obsessed with these women who seemed incredibly complete and fulfilled, and lived profoundly creative and spiritually centered lives that were also very political, very community-oriented, that were interested in mutual aid and art making and collectivity.About a month into celibacy, you found you had a lot of time for other things. You included a short list in the book that I thought was really funny: you cut your hair, donated a bunch of clothes and ran 45 miles.All the adults I know are always complaining aboutnot having enough time, and I, too, have been like that for most of my adult life. This amazing space opened up as soon as I stopped engaging in activities related to love and sex. Some were kind of superficial, like, I revamped my whole apartment. But also, I had this luxury of time to bring a new focus to my creative practice, to all of my other relationships, my friendships, my family relationships, my job.I had so vastly underestimated the amount of time and energy that I spent devoted to love and sex and flirting or being on apps or spending time with a partner or thinking about a partner or a potential partner. There’s no way that I could have measured that while I was engaged with those things. I just hadn’t realized that I had been preoccupied by partners and dating and love and sex, almost all of the time.Ultimately you were celibate for a year, but originally had set a goal of three months. Why did you decide to extend that period?I started with three months because that is a familiar unit of measurement. I’m a sober addict, and three months is a typical amount of time to detox, psychologically. I also knew it would be unrealistic for me to try to commit to anything longer. And honestly, even though it might sound ridiculous to other people, three months was kind of a long time for me to abstain.But when I got to the end, there was no question that I had barely begun. I was just starting to get a sense of the deeply entrenched patterns that I had been stuck in for years, and I knew that it would take much longer to undo them. I had gotten a break, but I had not fundamentally or constitutionally changed.In the book, a friend makes fun of you – like, three months is actually not that long.Yeah, there were a number of people who said that. It’s relative, right? To someone who has trouble getting into relationships, it’s absurd, but I had been incapable of doing that.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Penguin RandomhouseThis book – as with you previous books about addiction and sex work – is honest and revealing. What is it like to write vulnerably about your life, and what do you get out of the process?Well, fortunately, I am alone when I write. So I get to write in total privacy.I think when people read a memoir, it feels as though the writer is speaking directly to them in real time. But actually the writer gets to sit alone for years with those words until I find exactly the way I want to communicate them. I also get to sit with those reflections long enough to make friends with them and to become comfortable with them. I would never publish the first words I wrote about those subjects.For me, writing is a sort of integrating experience, of undoing shame, of becoming friends with experiences that at one time made me very uncomfortable or felt incredibly vulnerable. By the time a book is published, it doesn’t feel so vulnerable any more. I actually feel quite comfortable with that material and excited to share it.Writing about it and publishing it also connects me to a vast community of people, both living and dead, who have had similar experiences and have survived them. And being a part of that larger network and lineage is incredibly meaningful to me. It makes me feel strong and connected in experiences that once felt alienating.There’s a great scene where you describe trying to teach a friend to flirt, and you realize you’ve honed that skill in response to various external pressures.Before I was in graduate school, I worked in food service, and I located this as a training camp in seduction, because it is through social skills and a form of magnetism that I earned my living. The better I was at it, the bigger tips I earned. But I had never thought of that as connected to seduction.Curious about sex parties? Here’s what they’re really likeRead moreAlso because I had gotten so much of my self-esteem from feeling lovable or appealing or attractive, it was just something that I was constantly practicing from quite a young age. In my early 20s, I worked as a professional dominatrix, and that was probably the realm in which it was most explicit, where my ability to conform to someone else’s romantic or sexual ideal was the extent that I earned my living. People told me what they wanted and I became it.My current profession, in addition to writing, is teaching creative writing. I use those same skills in the classroom, but it feels much less manipulative or transactional, because what I’m doing is using my ability to hold someone else’s attention so that I can share with them my genuine love for a text or an art form or an artistic practice so that I can imbue them with that same passion for the subject.You mentioned your sobriety earlier. Were there commonalities between sobriety and celibacy for you?When I started the celibacy, one of the questions I brought was whether I could apply the rubric of addiction and recovery to my pattern in love and sex, because there were certainly compulsive elements. I was sort of hoping that I could classify it as a form of addiction, because I had had such success when recovering from other addictions, and I wanted a clear solution.Unfortunately, it wasn’t that clearcut. I don’t identify as a love and sex addict, at least not exclusively. But there was a lot of overlap. I brought a lot of the wisdom and tools I had learned in recovery to this process, from abstinence to the practice of writing an inventory to gain insight into personal behavior, which I learned to do in recovery from drug addiction.My experience of recovery is that it is not passive. My recovery and abstinence from addiction are contingent on my active participation, and it affects everything about the way that I live. And it is also contingent upon my honesty with myself, about my complicity, my past behaviors, and that also became incredibly relevant to my process of celibacy. Accountability cannot be skipped over at any process of personal change, and I learned that in sobriety.Voluntary celibacy isa hot topic now, as withthe 4B movement.What do you think has shifted culturally for that to happen?I think certain groups of people are bringing more scrutiny to conventions that they have taken for granted or passively complied with. And one of the reasons is that the political landscape in the US has taken such a hard shift to the right. We’re living under an incredibly oppressive government. Part of this swing to the right is backlash against feminism and civil rights movements. People are responding to that with an equal force, both individually and collectively, and a part of that is scrutinizing how relationship dynamics are reinforcing institutional oppression.You’re now married to your wife, whom you describe meeting in this book. Have you brought principles from that celibate year to the present era of your life?I have redefined my ideal for romantic love as one that is not based on dependency. I think our fantasy of love has to do with need and dependency. My definition of love is contingent upon a very conscious choice to support the flourishing of another person. It’s based on choosing them, every moment that I maintain that connection. That is the only way I became qualified to have a long-term relationship. I would never have gotten married if I hadn’t redefined love in this way, because I think any other definition is not sustainable.The Dry Seasonis out now through Knopf"

Don’t let my death be in vain.”Soueif told the BBC: “It’s something that I passionately don’t want to happen. Children want a mother, not a notorious mother – whether the notoriety is good or bad – but if that’s what it takes to get Alaa out of jail and to get all my children and grandchildren’s lives back on track, then that’s what I’m going to do.”Fattah was arrested in September 2019, and sentenced in December 2021 to five years in jail for “spreading false news and harming Egypt’s national interest”.A UN panelconcluded Egypt was illegally detaining him.Soueif described her eventful life to the Guardian. Born in Britain in 1956, where she lived until she was two, she comes from an academic family. Her father, Mostafa Soueif, was the founder of Cairo University’s psychology department and founder of Egypt’s Academy of Arts.Her mother, Fatma Moussa, was a professor of English literature at Cairo University, an accomplished translator of Shakespeare and Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian Nobel prize-winning novelist. Her sister Ahdaf is a distinguished novelist and essayist.Her parentage gifted her a love of literature. At the age of 11, bed-ridden from typhoid, she was given a copy of War and Peace to keep her quiet and now even in hospital a novel has always been on her bed.She said she was also raised on Jane Austen, so is “partial to texts in which every word is considered and nothing is superfluous”. She also developed a love of maths, telling her father at the age of eight that she loved “solving maths puzzles, and it did not seem like school work”. She went on to become an assistant professor of maths at Cairo University.She spent her adolescence on Brazil Street in Zamalek, an affluent district in Cairo where like any other neighbourhood there was a band of rebellious teenagers. “I loved riding motorcycles with the boys and had fleeting romances, but I steered clear of drugs. I never hid anything from my parents either. I’d even take my romantic calls on the house phone,” she recalled.View image in fullscreenAlaa Abd el-Fattah was sentenced in December 2021 to five years in jail for ‘spreading false news and harming Egypt’s national interest’.Photograph: Omar Robert Hamilton/ReutersShe said her sister Ahdaf “was always the polished, captivating mademoiselle – five boys would be infatuated with her at the same time. She was the older sister everyone admired. Meanwhile, I was the punk, trying everything out. Our parents never wanted us to be replicas of each other, or of them.”Politics was always part of the household and a pivotal moment came in 1967 when Israel defeated Egypt in the six-day war. It was a political awakening. She said: “People who’d always remained silent spoke out. I remember seeing family friends who had been close to the regime, officers in the army, sitting in our living room, weeping: ‘We betrayed the country! We lost it.’”She recalled her first student protest in high school in the early 1970s, when demonstrations were erupting across campuses calling for an uprising against the Israeli occupation of Sinai. “I remember watching students march from everywhere, even Zamalek, to Tahrir Square. A student friend and I joined, thrilled.”She met her husband, Ahmed Seif el-Islam, and the father of Alaa, at Cairo University. She was doing an MA in algebra and he was a member of a secretive group called Al-Matraqa that had split away from the Egyptian Communist party, disillusioned by the party’s reformism.Laila had inherited from her parents a cynical attitude towards any party organisation, but she loved Seif for his mind and his sincerity.Must Laila Soueif die from her hunger strike in London before her son Alaa Abd el-Fattah is released? | Helena KennedyRead moreAlaa was born in 1981. In 1983, her husband was arrested and tortured. A year later she was given the chance to undertake a PhD at Poitiers University in France, taking her son with her, but returned to Cairo for a year after her husband was arrested in 1983. He was found guilty of illegal weapons possession, and sentenced to five years in jail. On bail, he went into hiding with his wife and young son for three months only to decide that life as a fugitive was impossible and so gave himself up. In jail he was again tortured.While in prison he received a BA in law and within a month of leaving jail was admitted to the bar. He became one of the most effective human rights lawyers in Egypt.It was in France that Laila formed a deep emotional bond with Alaa, but started to learn the sacrifice involved in political activism. She said: “The fact that Seif was in prison when Alaa was very young created a very special relationship between us.“I had to explain things that you should never have to explain to a child – why his father was in prison, that there are bad police and good police – the good ones, who catch thieves and organise traffic, and the bad ones, who arrest people who oppose the government.“You don’t usually need to know these things when you’re four or five.”View image in fullscreenSanaa Seif, sister of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, gives an update on her mother’s health outside St Thomas’ hospital on Tuesday.Photograph: Benjamin Cremel/AFP/Getty ImagesLater her admiration for Alaa’s ability to look after his two younger sisters comforted her in continuing a teaching career.On returning to Cairo full-time, she helped found the March 9 movement in 2004, an organisation dedicated to academic autonomy and removing the state from universities. Her reputation as someone who would confront the police in protests became legendary. She was often the last to leave.Although she participated in the demonstrations in Tahrir Square in 2011, she like many had not anticipated the scale of the popular movement that would bring about thefall of Egypt’s then president, Hosni Mubarak. By then she was the matriarch of three human rights activists. Sanaa, the youngest of the three and then 18, joined their activism during the Mohamed Mahmoud street clashes in 2011 that resulted in more than 40 being killed.A week before Mubarak’s fall in February 2011, Soueif’s husband was arrested in his office and later interrogated in prison byAbdel Fatah al-Sisi, then head of military intelligence, and now president. In an exchange with Sisi, Seif el-Islam unusually answered him back, describing Mubarak as corrupt.Seif el-Islam later told the Guardian that Sisi “became angry, his face became red. He acted as if every citizen would accept his point and no one would reject it in public. When he was rejected in public, he lost it.” The episode is sometimes cited as one reason Sisi seems so determined to keep Alaa in jail.The revolution, in the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood, imploded. Soueif said: “We couldn’t believe that the most prepared organisation for governance wasted itself on eliminating the opposition as its first task, instead of achieving tangible accomplishments on the ground. Even the religious current in Iran, when it took power, implemented some social and economic achievements for the masses before it became a dictatorship. But for the MB to start by fighting the opposition in the streets – how did they think that would work?”With the collapse of the revolution and the capture of power by the military, the family suffered. In June 2014 Alaa was first arrested for violating protest laws and then in October Mona, the middle daughter, then aged 20, was convicted of a similar offence and jailed for three years. She had two spells in jail. At the time Soueif and her other daughter Mona went on a hunger strike lasting 76 days.When her husband died aged 63 in August 2014, two of his children were in jail, and were barred from seeing him in hospital. Alaa spoke movingly at his father’s funeral.Since then Soueif’s life has been one long attempt to secure his release and ensure his life in prison is bearable.She was once asked during the hunger strike whether what she was doing frightened her. “My mind is aware that I am doing something different, but my feeling as a mother is that this is normal and intended.“Any mother in my circumstances with the ability to do so would do this. People don’t easily realise what you can do. I know all the time that there are things that work, I don’t guarantee the results at all, but I tell myself that there’s nothing more to lose.”Explore more on these topicsEgyptMiddle East and north AfricaAbdel Fatah al-SisiActivismHuman rightsFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There isn’t much I miss from my pre-Invisalign “gappy teeth” days, but it was far more difficult for food and plaque to get stuck in the gaps – something I took for granted at the time. Using floss between my pre-braces teeth was easy, but ultimately pointless, like using a pipe cleaner to buff the Dartford Tunnel.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.With all the gaps closed, that’s no longer the case, and my water flosser has become a welcome part of my dental routine. A water flosser fires an intense jet of water between the teeth to dislodge debris and leave your mouth feeling fresher.“Most people know they should be flossing, but in reality, it’s one of the most skipped steps in daily oral care,” says Dr Johannes Jacobs, the founder ofJacobs & Associates Dental Office. “Patients who struggle with traditional flossing routines often do far better with water flossers, and their gum health improves noticeably.”Most of the dentists I spoke to favour floss or interdental brushes (such as TePe) – more on that in the what you need to know section below – but water flossers definitely offer convenience.“The water flosser doesn’t provide the scraping action that traditional string floss does, but what it offers in return is accessibility and comfort,” says Jacobs. “For a lot of patients, that’s the deciding factor. If flossing is painful, frustrating or impossible – due to dexterity issues or appliances such as braces – it usually just doesn’t happen.“A water flosser is easy to use, even for kids and older adults. That’s why I often recommend it – not as a replacement for floss across the board, but as a realistic alternative for those who aren’t flossing at all.”For the past few months, I’ve been putting water flossers through their paces. Here are my findings.At a glanceBest water flosser overall:Waterpik Ultra Professional£84.15 at AmazonBest budget water flosser:Operan Cordless Oral Irrigator£21.99 at AmazonBest cordless water flosser:Philips Sonicare Cordless 3000£69.99 at John LewisWhy you should trust meFirst off, because I have 32 teeth, as most adult humans do. A weird flex, granted, but a useful qualifier for anyone wanting to be taken seriously when it comes to assessing the merits of water flossers. Thanks to the aforementioned course of Invisalign, said teeth are also now close together, making them more of a sporting challenge for the water flossing contenders.Perhaps more importantly, I’ve been professionally testing consumer technology for more than a decade now, and have previously trialled thebest electric toothbrushesfor the Filter. You canread more about the ins and outs of that here.How I testedView image in fullscreenOur writer attempts to test the water flossers’ power by measuring how far a jet can be fired across a room.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianFor the most part, the testing process is what you’d expect: using one water flosser after another, and lavishing the kind of attention on my teeth that they usually get only in the panicked hours before a dental checkup to avoid a tongue-lashing (by which I mean a dressing down, not some kind of novel oral treatment).Each flosser was used multiple times, testing the various heads and settings, while making notes on features such as usability, controls and the slightly grim-sounding “mouth feel”. But there were also more off-the-wall tests to check the manufacturer’s specs – such as emptying a full water tank into a measuring cup to verify capacities, and testing power by measuring how far a jet could be fired across a room on a full battery.I wouldn’t recommend repeating the latter test – it’s not scientific, with each flosser’s different heights and jet angles – but if you do insist on following my bad example, don’t do it in a carpeted area and ensure pets are safely locked away.Samples were requested directly from manufacturers and retailers, with nine being provided from brands including Oral-B, Panasonic, Ordo, Waterpik and Philips.The best water flossers in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianBest water flosser overall:Waterpik Ultra ProfessionalView image in fullscreen£99 at AO£84.15 at AmazonCountertop water flossers seem to be going out of style, and I could get hold of only one for our roundup. The Ultra Professional is a reminder of why this isn’t necessarily a good thing, providing not only the largest tank around but also the kind of flexibility its cordless brethren could only dream of.Why we love itUnlike cordless models, the water reservoir remains on your countertop at all times. That makes it easier to move the nozzle around your mouth and ensures the easy-to-fill tank’s 650ml of water is accessible at all times, no matter the angle from which you’re attacking your teeth. Too often with cordless models, I found a half-full tank turned to a dribble when spraying the backs of my lower teeth – that was never a problem here.On top of that, it has 10 pressure settings increasing from 10PSI to 100PSI (pounds per square inch, a common measure of pressure), so you can choose what works for you. A generous number of heads (seven) are included, with three standard jet tips, one plaque seeker, another for orthodontics, a Pik Pocket and a toothbrush.There are drawbacks to the countertop design. Obviously, it’s not travel-friendly (11.9 x 9.7 x 26.3cm WDH), and giants like me will have to stoop to use it. However, if you have the space, it’s an easy recommendation.It’s a shame that …it’s a permanent resident on your countertop.Tank size: 650mlHeads: seven: jet (x3), plaque seeker, orthodontic, Pik Pocket, toothbrushPressure: 10-100PSIWaterproof: not statedCharging: not applicableBest budget water flosser:Operan Cordless Oral IrrigatorView image in fullscreen£21.99 at AmazonWhile most cordless water flossers sit in the £60 to £120 range, Operan comes in at a fraction of that, while still achieving excellent results.Why we love itFrom the suspiciously low pricing, I was sure there would be something to complain about with the Cordless Oral Irrigator. But mouthful of a name aside, there really isn’t.It’s easy to hold and has four noticeably different power settings, with a pleasant pulsing stream. It’s also quite effective when turned upside down, thanks to the generous 300ml tank and floating ball on the end of the reservoir tube (it’s not perfect, though, so it’s worth tackling the back of your teeth first, while the tank is full).There are four tips in the box, including one for orthodontics and another for tongue scraping. The cherry on the cake? It has a water resistance rating of IPX7, so you can use it in the shower, if you like.It’s a shame that …some customers report reliability problems, although I had no issues.Tank size: 300mlHeads: four: jet, periodontal, orthodontic, tongue scraperPressure: 40-120PSIWaterproof: IPX7Charging: USB-CBest cordless water flosser:Philips Sonicare Cordless 3000View image in fullscreen£69.99 at John Lewis£119.99 at BootsThe best of the cordless bunch is the Philips Sonicare Cordless 3000. It offers a great combination of design, power and capacity, although it’s not ideal for those with orthodontics or periodontal pockets as it comes with just two tips.Why we love itThe main thing that sets the Sonicare Cordless 3000 apart is its special Quad Stream tip, which fires water in four directions at once. While that might be bad news if you accidentally turn it on outside your mouth, it provides good, powerful coverage across multiple teeth and gum areas at the same time as a result.It also comes with a standard jet tip for a more intense stream, and both provide a decent amount of power. While Philips doesn’t list a PSI figure, in my unscientific laminate-soaking distance test, it landed in the top half, and it feels like it provides a good level of pressure in the mouth, too. More importantly, it comes with a “deep clean” setting with a more thorough pulsing jet of water.The water tank holds a decent 250ml, and is transparent so you can easily keep an eye on how much is left. One thing to note, however, is the charging method: my unit came with a bespoke power cable, but other versions pack USB-C. Philips’s PR confirmed that they’re otherwise identical, but USB-C is undoubtedly more handy if you lose the original cable.It’s a shame that …it comes with only two tips.Tank size: 250mlHeads: two: Quad Stream, jetPressure: not statedWaterproof: not statedCharging: USB-C/figure 8The best of the restView image in fullscreen‘The bulbous water tank means you can use it over multiple sessions’: the Spotlight water flosser.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianOral-B Aquacare Pro Expert Series 6View image in fullscreen£45.50 at Pharmacy2U£49.99 at DebenhamsBest for:sensitive gumsThe Aquacare Pro Expert Series 6 is far from perfect. For one thing, if you find it at its RRP of £150, it’s pricey – although you’re unlikely to pay that in practice. Even more importantly, it has the smallest tank of the lot at 150ml. It also feels underpowered, with even the “intense” setting feeling nowhere near as powerful as its rivals.For sensitive gums and teeth, though, that possible weak spot becomes a virtue. It certainly offers a comfortable experience with the Oxyjet heads, which claim to add microbubbles for a deeper clean. These provide two types of stream via a manual switch: the rotational option gently massages the gums, while the more traditional targeted stream fires in one direction. There’s also a standard jet tip for more power – but again, if you’re after power, you’ve come to the wrong place.It didn’t make the final cut because …the tank is the smallest of the lot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The travel lock is also handy to avoid a soggy bag, should you forget to empty the tank.With an RRP of £60, it’s also competitively priced, though it’s undoubtedly a basic solution, with only three power settings, no automatic pulse option, and just two jet tips in the box. The design, while distinctive and available in various cheerful colours, makes it difficult to tell how much water is left in the tank at a glance. It also sometimes struggles when turned upside down to tackle the backs of your teeth.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s somewhat basic in its functionality.Tank size: 260mlHeads: two: jet (x2)Pressure: 80-160PSIWaterproof: IPX7Charging: USB-CSpotlight water flosserView image in fullscreen£84 at SpotlightBest for:capacityIf you want a cordless flosser with a generous water capacity, then the Spotlight is top of the tree, holding a massive 400ml in its bulbous tank. Unlike other cordless models, it means you can use it over multiple sessions – and there’s a built-in UV light setting to sterilise the water, if you don’t like the idea of nasties swimming in it.That’s something of a gimmick, but it’s a nice extra to have in an all-around great water flosser. It is pretty powerful, comes with four different heads, offers three operating modes, and is pretty good at working upside down, thanks to the Hydro Gravity Ball at the end of the reservoir tube.There are two downsides: it charges with a bundled figure-8 charger rather than USB-C, and the water tank has to be unscrewed every time you need to fill it. Given I managed to incorrectly align it a couple of times, that may get messy – but that should at least let you test the IPX7 waterproof rating.It didn’t make the final cut because …the tank is a pain to fill, and it uses a figure-8 charger rather than USB-C.Tank size: 400mlHeads: four: jet, orthodontic, periodontal pocket sprinkler, tongue scraperPressure: 60-120PSIWaterproof: IPX7Charging: figure-8Icy Bear water flosserView image in fullscreen£59.99 at Icy Bear Dental CareBest for:travelPlenty of water flossers include travel cases in the box, but from the selection I tested, only the Icy Bear flosser gets physically smaller when not in use. The body of the flosser slips down into the tank, reducing its size by about a third: clever!This design does come with some drawbacks, however. It’s slower to fill than other models, and it can sometimes leak a little – something countered by its IPX7 waterproof rating. The design also requires a long press to turn on and off, which is great to avoid accidental leaks in your bag, but less good when your mouth is rapidly filling with water and you need to breathe without soaking the mirror.It didn’t make the final cut because …the pull-out design is not without its problems.Tank size: 200mlHeads: four: jet, orthodontic, periodontal, tongue scraperPressure: not statedWaterproof: IPX7Charging: USB-CWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenWater flossers aren’t a replacement for mechanical flossing, but they have their place.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianHow to use a water flosserPart of the appeal of water flossers is how simple they are to use: just fill the tank, and then work the flosser along the gumline, spraying between the teeth. You may find your flosser comes with different attachments that require an adjusted technique, but that’s the basic operation.Dr Flavio Pisani, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Lancashire’s School of Medicine and Dentistry, recommends intermittent spraying, and some flossers have this pulsing action as a built-in setting.“It should be an alternate flowing and oozing that makes the power efficient,” he says. Otherwise, you could “just get your mouth full of water without any effect”.Some people like to add a little mouthwash to the water, but Pisani says the evidence doesn’t support this as being any more effective.“I think it’s really only going to make people feel fresher,” says Dr Sam Jethwa, president of the British Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry. “It’s more just a freshness of the mouth thing rather than any other benefit.”Water flossers vs regular flossingFrom speaking to several dentists, the consensus is that water flossers aren’t a replacement for mechanical flossing, but they have their place. They are, as Caitlin Miller, head of dental hygiene and therapy at Bupa Dental Care UK,told me while I was testing toothbrushes, “better than nothing” for patients who won’t use floss or interdental brushes.Jethwa agrees. “The example I give patients is a boat sitting in a dock for a long time – it’s got algae on the bottom. Get a hose pipe to try to get it off, it’s not going to do anything. You need the water, but you need the mechanical movement there,” he says.“So I wouldn’t say that they’re a replacement for floss. It may be better to use a water flosser if you’re not using anything.”Pisani is open to water flossers’ potential, but says there is “not strong evidence” of their efficacy compared with traditional interdental cleaning.“There’srecent evidence from a studyover four weeks of using water flossers compared to TePe brushes, and the [results] are quite similar,” he says. But there’s a catch: “The problem is that this study was not giving the group using interdental brushes the size that fit their teeth.”Hopefully, further study will reveal more, but don’t expect anything overnight. “We have reached a consensus aboutelectric toothbrushes, but bear in mind they’ve been available since the 1980s,” Pisani continues. “We found the evidence about the better use of electric toothbrushes about 10 years ago.”For now, Pisani doesn’t recommend seeing water flossers as an outright replacement, but insists that interdental cleaning is crucial. “I tell my students and patients that if I were sent to a desert island with only one tool, I would definitely bring myTePe [interdental brushes]with me, rather than a toothbrush, because gum disease starts in between teeth or in between implants.”“If a water flosser encourages people who are doing very little in addition to brushing to do something, then it’s a good thing,” says Jethwa. “But what I wouldn’t encourage is for people who are flossing well, using interdental brushes and achieving good oral hygiene to think that this is an easier way of achieving the same thing.”Key features to look forSince most water flossers do the same thing, it’s worth focusing on the differences.For example, tank size is important. If you’re doing a thorough clean, then some of the smaller capacities won’t be enough. Yet this directly plays off against usability and portability, so it’s a balancing act.Power sometimes turns up in the specifications under PSI – or pounds per square inch. While a higher pressure may be more effective at pushing out debris, it can prove uncomfortable, especially on sensitive mouths, so the flexibility of power is arguably more important than the raw PSI figure.If you’re looking at a cordless model, as most of the ones in this guide are, it’s also worth considering how they’re charged. Some power up using USB-C, which is undoubtedly more convenient than a proprietary lead, as most folk have several cables lying around. Finally, some people like to floss while in the shower. If that’s you, then look for one that has IPX7 protection.Alan Martin is awriter who has been putting products, including phones, gaming devices and wearables, through their paces for more than a decade.

Now history is repeating itselfTue 3 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 07.07 EDTShareSociety is sleepwalking into a nightmare. The rate of global investment in AI is rocketing, as companies and countries invest in what has been described as a new arms race. The Californian company Nvidia, which dominates the market in the chips needed for AI, has become themost valuable in the world. The trend has been dubbed an “AI frenzy”, with the components described by analysts as the “new gold or oil”.Everyone is getting in on the act, and politicians are desperate to stake their countries’ claim as global leaders in AI development. Safeguards, equitable access and sustainability are falling by the wayside: when countries gathered forthe Paris AI summit in February 2025and produced an international agreement pledging an “open”, “inclusive” and “ethical” approach to AI, the US and the UKrefused to sign it.It is worth asking who is benefiting from this headlong rush, and at whose expense. One developer, who only goes by the name Lore in their communications with the media, described the open-source release of the large language model (LLM) Llama as creating a “gold rush-type of scenario”. He used Llama to build Chub AI, a website where users can chat with AI bots and roleplay violent and illegal acts. For as little as $5 a month, users can access a “brothel” staffed by girls below the age of 15, described on the site as a “world without feminism”. Or they can “chat” with a range of characters, including Olivia, a 13-year-old girl with pigtails wearing a hospital gown, or Reiko, “your clumsy older sister” who is described as “constantly having sexual accidents with her younger brother”.This million-dollar money generator is just one of thousands of applications of this new technology that are re-embedding misogyny deep into the foundations of our future. On other sites men can create,share and weaponise fake intimate imagestoterrorise women and girls.Sex robotsare being developed at breakneck speed. Already, you can buy a self-warming, self-lubricating or “sucking” model: some manufacturers have dreamed up a “frigid” setting that would allow their users to simulate rape. Millions of men are already usingAI “companions” – virtual girlfriends, available and subservient 24/7, whose breast size and personality they can customise and manipulate.Meanwhile, generative AI, which hasexploded in popularity, has been proven to regurgitate andamplify misogynyand racism. This becomes significantly more of a concern when you realise just how much online content will soon be created by this new tool.Women are at risk of being dragged back to the dark ages by precisely the same technology that promises to catapult men into a shiny new future. This has all happened before. Very recently, in fact. Cast your mind back to the early days of social media. It started out the same way: a new idea harnessed by privileged white men, its origins in the patriarchal objectification of women. (Mark Zuckerberg started out with a website calledFaceMash, which allowed users to rank the attractiveness of female Harvard students … a concept he now says had nothing to do with the origins of Facebook.)Women, particularly women of colour, raised their voices in concern: some of theearliest objectionsto FaceMash came from Harvard’s Fuerza Latina and Association of Harvard Black Women societies. They were ignored, Facebook was born and the rest is history.Social media was rolled out at great speed. Back then, Zuckerberg’s famous catchphrase was “Move fast and break things”. The things that got broken were societal cohesion,democracyand the mental health, in particular, of girls.By the time people started pointing out that online abuse was endemic to social platforms, those platforms were too well established and profitable for their owners to be prepared to make sweeping changes. Politicians seemed too enamoured with the powerful tech lobby to be prepared to stand up to them.The results have been devastating. Young women have taken their own lives afterexperiencing sexualised cyberbullying. An alarming number of female parliamentarians have stepped down from office after experiencing intolerable levels ofonline abuse. Millions of women have been subject to rape and death threats, doxing, online stalking and racist and misogynistic abuse.We failed to prevent this crisis when we didn’t heed the warning calls in the early days of social media. We now risk squandering a similar opportunity. Without urgent action, we will be doomed to repeat the same mistakes with AI, only this time on a far larger scale. “One of the reasons many of us do have concerns about the rollout of AI is because over the past 40 years as a society we’ve basically given up on actually regulating technology,” Peter Wang, co-founder of data science platform Anaconda, recentlytold the Guardian. “Social media was our first encounter with dumb AI and we utterly failed that encounter.”If women and marginalised communities have already learned from their frequent mistreatment on social media to self-censor, to disguise their real names and to mute their voices, these coping mechanisms and restrictive norms will follow them when they step into new technological environments.Nearly nine in ten womenpolled in a 2020 Economist study said they restricted their online activity in some way as a result of cyber-harassment, hacking, online stalking and doxing. This helps to explain the disparity between men’s and women’s use of AI;71% of men aged 18 to 24say they use AIweekly, while only 59% of women in the same age range do so. So long as men remain the main users of AI, the technology will be designed to cater to their preferences.The answer isn’t to reject new technology, or ignore the enormous potential of AI. Instead, we should ensure regulations and safeguards are implemented when AI is designed, before products are rolled out to the public, in much the same way that they are within other industries.“I thought people should be aware,” said Leyla R Bravo,then president of Fuerza Latina, when she tried to raise the alarm at Harvard over the nascent FaceMash website back in 2003. This time, might someone listen? It isn’t too late for political leaders to stand up to big tech. The harms of this technology aren’t rooted in a future dystopia where robots take over the world. AI is already devastating the lives of women and girls, right now.

Tweaks and tinkering won’t do | Polly ToynbeeRead moreWith ministers looking for ways to combat the electoral threat of Reform UK,Labourofficials are attempting to refocus anxious backbenchers away from expected cuts in day-to-day spending, and on to capital budgets. “We’re investing to rebuild,” one said.The spending review will be a difficult one for the government, however, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies saying the chancellor faces “unavoidably tough decisions” as the demands of funding for the NHS and defence raise the prospect of deep cuts elsewhere.“We have a big battle with how to frame this,” one minister told the Guardian. “The big risk is that people get the [spending] review, turn to the back of the book and see the minus numbers and the story is big cuts.“But the difference is what it would have been without massive extra investment that came from the budget, or the capital spending which is huge. It will be a job to set that out. I think a lot of cabinet ministers – perhaps all apart from Ed and Yvette – do get that.”Reeves’s allies argue that departments will receive £300bn more than the Conservatives had planned as a result of the decisions she took in the autumn budget, such as loosening the fiscal rules on capital spending. This includes £190bn more on day-to-day spending over the parliament.Much of the extra £113bn in capital spending will be inareas outside the south-east of England, and Reeves has confirmed Treasury investment rules will be rewritten to give extra weight to schemes that increase productivity in the Midlands and the north.In a speech in GreaterManchesteron Wednesday morning, she is expected to say this represents a “step change in how government approaches and evaluates the case for investing in our regions … to make sure that this government gives every region a fair hearing when it comes to investments”.She will add: “A Britain that is better off cannot rely on a handful of places forging ahead of the rest of the country. [The] result of such thinking has been growth created in too few places, felt by too few people and wide gaps between regions, and between our cities and towns.”Government sources said that some departments that settled with the Treasury the earliest had some of the harshest settlements and thus faced the biggest cuts, including the Foreign Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.Some departments, including Defra and education, settled early this week. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, is said to have sealed his own settlement with capital cash for flood defences.One cabinet source who had settled in recent days said they felt there was a greater recognition in the Treasury of the pressure departments were under and that most negotiations with Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, had been cordial.The Ministry of Justice, under Shabana Mahmood, one of the first to settle so that Mahmood could announce the prison funding, is being held up to ministers as an example of a department that had a clear realistic ask and got much of the substantial funding it had asked for.However, both Miliband and Cooper are said to have had fiery meetings with Jones, asking to deal with Reeves directly. Of those still to settle, Cooper has been fighting the hardest against what she sees as an impossible settlement particularly on policing – with the pressure to both increase police numbers, halve knife crime and violence against women and girls, and deal with early releases.Six police chiefs publicly warned last week that the funding gap meant that Labour could miss its manifesto promises.On Tuesday night it emerged Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan police, and other senior police officers had written to the prime minister warning him that they would face “stark choices” about which crimes to investigate if the Treasury pushed ahead withcuts.The Times reported that in a letter sent on Friday – and signed by Rowley, Gavin Stephens, the head of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, and Graeme Biggar, the head of the National Crime Agency (NCA) – they wrote: “We are deeply concerned that the settlement for policing and the [NCA], without additional investment, risks a retrenchment to what we saw under austerity. This would have far-reaching consequences.”Miliband has also been locked in a struggle with the Treasury, including over funding for a “warm homes” insulation plan that insiders believe is set to be cut. One cabinet minister pointed to other areas that had received investment including nuclear and carbon capture. “You can’t get everything,” they added.The main fight for Rayner is over the affordable homes budget, given that both she and Reeves had promised a generational shift in social housing when £2bn for the programme was announced before the spring statement – then described as “down payment” on further funding to be announced at the spending review – which now does not look to be forthcoming.Among the regional transport projects set to receive government backing next week are some that were promised by the Conservatives, but for which the money was never allocated, potentially including a new railway between Manchester and Liverpool.The £15.6bn package announced on Wednesday is expected to include £2.4bn for theWest Midlandsto fund an extension of the region’s metro from Birmingham city centre to the new sports quarter, and £2.1bn to start building West Yorkshire Mass Transit by 2028.Greater Manchester will receive £2.5bn for projects including new tram stops in Bury, Manchester and Oldham and an extension of the tram network to Stockport.A £1.5bn investment inSouth Yorkshirewill include £530m to renew the region’s trams, while the East Midlands will receive £2bn to design a new mass transit system between Derby and Nottingham.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesEconomic growth (GDP)Transport policyEconomicsLabourTransportWest MidlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”Musk, who had previously voiced criticism of the proposed legislation, quipping that it could be big or beautiful but not both, added on X: “It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.”Oval and out: Musk and Trump’s farewell marred by disillusionmentRead moreHe continued: “Congress is making America bankrupt.”A top donor to Trump during last year’s election campaign, Muskdeparted the White Houselast week after steering its so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) with the stated mission of slashing fraud and abuse within federal departments. He has argued that the Republican bill will undermine Doge’s work and drive the US further into debt.On Tuesday, Musk drew immediate support from Thomas Massie, one of only two Republicans who last month voted against the bill in the House of Representatives. “He’s right,”Massie responded on X.But there was a rebuke from Mike Johnson, the House speaker, who said he had spoken with Musk by phone on Monday for more than 20 minutes, making the case that the bill achieved campaign promises while making permanent massive tax and spending cuts.Johnsontold reporters: “With all due respect, my friend Elon is terribly wrong about the One Big Beautiful bill. It’s a very important first start. Elon is missing it … I just deeply regret he’s made this mistake.”John Thune, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, was more diplomatic, saying: “So we have a difference of opinion. He’s entitled to that opinion. We’re going to proceed full speed ahead.”Having narrowly passed the House, the bill is now under consideration in the Senate, which is aiming to pass a revised version by 4 July. Some Republican fiscal conservatives, such as senators Ron Johnson and Rand Paul, share Musk’s concerns about the need for significant spending cuts.Johnson told CNN: “We have enough [holdouts] to stop the process until the president gets serious about spending reduction and reducing the deficit.”Trump has previously dismissed Republican dissenters as “grandstanders” and urged them to get onboard. His influence proved decisive in quelling a potential rebellion in the House. On Monday he wrote on his Truth Social platform: “So many false statements are being made about ‘THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’.”The White House acknowledged Musk’s stance but said it has not changed its position on the bill. Press secretary Karoline Leavitttold reporters: “Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn’t change the president’s opinion: this is one big, beautiful bill and he is sticking to it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Republicans aimed to offset these costs with cuts to programmmes such as Medicaid, food stamps and green-energy tax credits.Projections from the Congressional Budget Office and independent analysts indicate that the bill would add between $2.3tn and $5tn to the deficit over the next 10 years. White House officials contend that the economic growth generated by tax cuts will offset the increased spending.Russ Vought, director of the office of management and budget,told CNN: “This bill doesn’t increase the deficit or hurt the debt. In fact, it lowers it by $1.4tn.”But Democrats have warned that the budget would raise the cost of healthcare for millions of people, and cause millions to lose coverage, in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.A new analysisby Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania found that it could lead to more than 51,000 preventable deaths.Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader,said in a floor speechon Tuesday: “Donald Trump and his so-called ‘big, beautiful bill’ is ugly to its very core. Behind the smoke and mirrors lies a cruel and draconian truth: tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy paid for by gutting healthcare for millions of Americans.”Later, responding to Musk’s intervention, Schumercommented on X: “I didn’t think it was imaginable but … I AGREE WITH ELON MUSK.”Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont,added in a post: “Musk is right: this bill IS a ‘disgusting abomination’. We shouldn’t give $664 billion in tax breaks to the 1%. We shouldn’t throw 13.7 million people off of Medicaid. We shouldn’t cut $290 billion from programs to feed the hungry.

Seven people were killed and 113 injured, including children, when two trains crashed as a result of the attacks.A Russian rocket attack on the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Tuesday killed at least four people and wounded 25, officials said. Zelenskyy denounced the assault, saying it underscored the fact that Moscow had no intention of halting the war.The SBU said the operation against the Kerch bridge had been planned for several months and involved the equivalent of more than a metric tonne of TNT, which it said had “severely damaged” the base of the bridge supports.It is the third time Ukraine has targeted the key logistics route since Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022.In October 2022, a truck exploded on the bridge, while in July 2023, the SBU said it had blown up part of the bridge using an experimental naval drone. Both times, Russia repaired the damaged sections.Lt Gen Vasyl Maliuk, of the SBU, who supervised the latest operation, described the bridge as “an absolutely legitimate target, especially considering that the enemy used it as a logistical artery to supply its troops”.He added: “Crimea is Ukraine, and any manifestations of occupation will receive our tough response.”TheSBU published footageshowing a blast coming out of the water and debris flying, along with a photo of some damage to the side of the bridge.Road traffic on the bridge had been temporarily suspended, Russian authorities said on Telegram on Tuesday. Russian state media reported it had been closed to traffic for about four hours.Crimean Bridge mapRussia said on Tuesday said it was wrong to expect a quick breakthrough in Ukraine talks, a day after Moscow rejected Kyiv’s call for an unconditional ceasefire at negotiations in Istanbul. The Russian offensive has been going for more than three years, and has killed tens of thousands on both sides and forced millions from their homes in eastern Ukraine. Russia instead offered a partial truce of two to three days in some areas of the frontline, its top negotiator said after the talks.“The settlement issue is extremely complex and involves a large number of nuances,” the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Tuesday. “It would be wrong to expect immediate solutions and breakthroughs.”The sides insteadagreed on a large-scale swap of captured soldiersand exchanged their roadmaps to peace, or “memorandums”, at the discussions, which lasted for just under two hours on Monday.According to a document handed to the Ukrainians that was published by Russian state media, Moscow is demanding, as a precondition to pausing its offensive, that Ukraine pull its troops out of four eastern and southern regions that Moscow claims to have annexed.Peskov was speaking as Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, arrived in the US along with the deputy prime minister Yulia Svrydenko to press for tougher sanctions on Russia.“We plan to talk about defence support and the situation on the battlefield, strengthening sanctions against Russia,” Yermak said on Telegram.Peskov also dismissed the idea of a summit between the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the US.“In the near future, it is unlikely,” he told reporters, adding that such a summit could happen only after Russian and Ukrainian negotiators reached an agreement.The White House said on Monday that Donald Trump was “open” to the idea of a summit, which is also backed by Zelenskyy and by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Zelenskyy’s attendance at the Nato summit in The Hague from 24 to 26 June was welcomed by the Ukrainian president after reported misgivings over the potential for the renewal of friction between Zelenskyy and Trump administration officials.“We were invited to the Nato summit. I think this is important,” Zelenskyy said on Monday after he held a meeting with Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, in Vilnius.Explore more on these topicsCrimeaUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Given the tens of billions at stake, and the dangers on site to both the environment and human life, this is simply not good enough.”He added: “As with the fight against climate change, the sheer scale of the hundred-year timeframe of the decommissioning project makes it hard to grasp the immediacy of safety hazards and cost overruns that delays can have.“Every day at Sellafield is a race against time to complete works before buildings reach the end of their life. Our report contains too many signs that this is a race that Sellafield risks losing.”MPs noted that one project, a now-paused replacement of an on-site lab, had resulted in “£127m wasted”.The cost of cleaning up Sellafield has causedtensions with the Treasuryas the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, attempts to tighten public spending and spur growth. Sellafield, which is home to the world’s largest store of plutonium, said in February that nearly £3bn in new funding was“not enough”.Last year, Sellafield apologised and wasfined £332,500after it pleaded guilty to criminal charges over years of cybersecurity failings.The PAC noted that the timeline for a government project to create a long-term deep underground store for nuclear waste, including that held at Sellafield, had slipped from 2040 to the late 2050s. The government is considering sites in Cumbria and Lincolnshire, although Lincolnshire county council is expected to withdraw the latter from the process aftervocal local opposition.The MPs said they had found “indications of a suboptimal culture” at Sellafield, and noted that theNDA paid £377,200in 2023-24 to settle employment-related claims. Alison McDermott, a former HR consultant whoraised concerns over bullying and a “toxic culture”at the site, said she felt “vindicated” by the report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said Sellafield should report annually on progress against targets and explain how it is addressing the deteriorating condition of its assets. The NDA should publish data on the prevalence of bullying and harassment at nuclear sites, it said.Clifton-Brown said there were “early indications of some improvements in Sellafield’s delivery” but said the government needed to do “far more” to ensure bosses safeguard the public and taxpayer funds.The NDA’s chief executive, David Peattie, responding on behalf of Sellafield, said: “We welcome the scrutiny of the committee and their report. We will now look in more detail at the recommendations and consider how best to address them.“We take the findings seriously, and the safety of the site and the wellbeing of our people will always be our highest priorities.”A spokesperson for the Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero said: “We expect the highest standards of safety and security as former nuclear sites are dismantled, and the regulator is clear that public safety is not compromised at Sellafield.“We continue to support the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in its oversight of Sellafield, while driving value for money. This is underpinned by monthly performance reviews and increased responsibility for overseeing major project performance, enabling more direct scrutiny and intervention.“We have zero-tolerance of bullying, harassment and offensive behaviour in the workplace – we expect Sellafield and the NDA to operate on this basis, investigate allegations and take robust action when needed.”Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerNuclear LeaksEnergyEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But meanwhile, fare evasion remains a significant problem, and rigorous action should be taken against those who intentionally seek to defraud the railway.”Peter Hendy, the rail minister, said privatisation had “created a mess of deep-rooted issues across our railway”, and the creation of Great British Railways would “establish oversight and … end inconsistent prosecutions and making sure passengers are treated fairly”.He added: “Deliberate fare-dodging costs the taxpayer up to £400m annually and must be dealt with, but ham-fisted prosecutions that punish people who have made an innocent mistake is not the way to do this.”A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, said it welcomed the ORR’s “sensible recommendations”.They said: “We need to strike the right balance addressing genuine, honest mistakes made by customers and taking firm action against those who deliberately and persistently seek to exploit the system.”The watchdog Transport Focuscalled for a “yellow card” systemfor passengers who travel without the correct ticket on a national database.Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail faresRail transportTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

Its predecessor, published in January 2024, found that women working in the sector faced misogyny and discrimination, with rife sexual harassment and abuse, to which the industry’s many self-employed practitioners were more vulnerable.Despite music industry support for the report, the previous Conservative government declined to implement any of its recommendations. In September 2024, the Labour party conference passed a motion calling on the government to implement the committee’s report in full.On publication of the latest report, a government spokesperson told the Guardian: “The music industry must be free of misogyny and discrimination and NDAs should not be misused to silence victims. We are actively looking at all options for further reform of NDAs.”In the year since the previous report, the committee, led by Labour MP Sarah Owen, said that little had changed from its previous characterisation of the culture of the British music industry as a “boys’ club”.Hearing evidence from pop-soul artist Celeste and the classical soprano Lucy Cox, along with representatives from the organisations Black Lives in Music and the Musicians’ Union, it found barriers including unequal pay, ageism and unequal responsibility for childcare duties; harassment, particularly for LGBTQ+ women, women of colour and disabled women.It established that women reported mistreatment at low rates because of fear of retaliation. Musicians’ Union data showed that despite 51% of women in the sector experiencing gender discrimination and 47% of women of colour experiencing racism, only 11% and 8% respectively reported their allegations.Secretary Naomi Pohl told the committeethat even initiatives designed to protect women within the sector “still exist within a system that doesn’t prioritise women’s safety and none of the organisations have the power to change that culture”.“The need for government intervention is clear,” the committee said. “There remains an overwhelming case for the government to implement the measures set out in our predecessors’ report, and the updated recommendations set out in this report.” It stressed that their recommendations would also benefit women working across all sectors.The committee once again backed the proposedCreative Industries Independent Standards Authority (CIISA), a non-statutory standards authority designed “to improve standards of behaviour across the creative industries and to prevent and tackle all forms of bullying and harassment”.CIISA chair Jen Smith said that the authority would benefit victims as well as smaller employers seeking advice on how to deal with issues such as implementing investigations procedures.Additionally it stressed that female and gender non-conforming freelancers within the music industry were additionally vulnerable, and not sufficiently protected by the employment rights bill despite proposing stronger protections from third-party harassment. The committee called on the government to amend the Equality Act and the Employment Rights bill to ensure their safety.The committee stressed that parents and carers also faced unique challenges, especially when those responsibilities intersected with freelance employment and late and unpredictable working hours, and called for the government to align maternity allowance with statutory maternity pay to facilitate greater flexibility during leave.Soprano Lucy Cox told the committee: “In the very first audition I did, I was told that I would need to wait for somebody to become pregnant or die in order to start getting any work as a classical singer.”She described “a feeling that you have ended your job by having a child”: after having a baby, longer tours became unviable owing to the cost of travelling with her husband, yet committing to the tours remained essential to “maintain my foothold because … if you do not do the work then somebody else might well do it, and then you might not get invited back.”Dr Charisse Beaumont, CEO ofBlack Lives in Music,expressed her impatience with a lack of decisive progress on the issues. “We need the government to get involved,” she told the committee. “We do not need any more reports. We need the [previous committee’s] report to be actioned.”After the publication of the report, Deborah Annetts, chief executive of the Independent Society of Musicians who gave evidence in the hearings, also called for action. “It’s to the previous government’s shame that it rejected all the recommendations of the first report,” she said. “This government must not make the same mistake … [and must] make the sector safer.”Explore more on these topicsMusicMusic industryGenderWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Four decades after the blockbuster film debuted, the guitar’s creator has launched a search for the cherry red Gibson ES-345.Gibson, which is based in Nashville, is asking the public for help tracking it down as the movie turns 40 and as the company produces a new documentary about the search and the film, Lost to the Future.In a video by Gibson, with the movie’s theme song playing in the background, Back to the Future stars such as Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Harry Waters Jr make a cinematic plea.There’s also a surprise appearance by Huey Lewis, whose band Huey Lewis and the News performed the soundtrack’s headliner song, The Power of Love.Lloyd, in the cadence of Doc Brown, says in the video that the guitar has been “lost to the future”.“It’s somewhere lost in the space-time continuum,” says Fox, who played McFly. “Or it’s in some Teamster’s garage.”In the film, McFly steps in for an injured band member at the 1955 school dance with the theme Enchantment under the Sea, playing the guitar as students slow dance to Earth Angel. He then leads Marvin Berry and the Starlighters in a rendition of Johnny B Goode, calling it an oldie where he comes from even though the 1958 song doesn’t exist yet for his audience.Fox said he wanted McFly to riff through his favorite guitarists’ signature styles – Jimi Hendrix behind the head, Pete Townshend’s windmill and the Eddie Van Halen hammer.After digging and dancing to Johnny B Goode, the students at the dance fall into an awkward silence as McFly’s riffs turn increasingly wild.“I guess you guys aren’t ready for that yet,” McFly says. “But your kids are gonna love it.”Explore more on these topicsBack To The FuturenewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022 she was elected president of the Royal Society of Literature, becoming the first writer of colour and only the second woman to hold the position.Throughout her career, Evaristo has launched several successful writing schemes designed to support female writers and under-represented writers of colour, most recently launching theRSL Scriptorium awards, which give 10 writers a year the opportunity to use her Kent cottage for a writing retreat.“I am completely overwhelmed and overjoyed to receive this unique award,” Evaristo said. “Over the last three decades, I have witnessed with great admiration and respect how the Women’s prize for fiction has so bravely and brilliantly championed and developed women’s writing, always from an inclusive stance.”She said the prize money was “an unexpected blessing in my life” and “it seems fitting that I spend this substantial sum supporting other women writers”. Details on how she will do that will follow, she said.Funded by Bukhman Philanthropies, the prize is designed to reflect the founding principles of the Women’s prize for fiction, “to celebrate and amplify women’s voices; to open the pathways into writing as a viable career choice for women from all backgrounds; and to shine a spotlight on exceptional, original books for readers to discover and enjoy.”As well as the prize money, Evaristo will receive a sculpture named Thoughtful by the artist Caroline Russell, to be awarded on 12 June when the winners of the Women’s prizes for fiction and nonfiction will also be revealed.The judging panel was chaired by the author and Women’s prize founder Kate Mosse, who was joined by a selection of former Women’s prize for fiction judges: the academic and writer Gillian Beer; the writer and activist Scarlett Curtis; the playwright and author Bonnie Greer; and the broadcaster Vick Hope. To be eligible for the prize, authors had to have published at least five books and been previously longlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Some of the calls have been from distressed students, at other times it is their panicked parents, but all have the same question – is their dream of studying in the US still possible?Devatwal runs an education consultancy in Ahmedabad, the main city in the Indian state of Gujarat. It is one of thousands of such organisations that exist across the country, helping Indian students achieve what many consider to be the ultimate symbol of success: getting into an American university.It has long been a booming business for Devatwal. Families in India will often invest their entire life savings to send their children to study in the US and last year there were more than 330,000 Indians enrolled at American universities, more than any other foreign nationality, overtaking Chinese students in numbers for the first time in years.But this year the situation looks drastically different. As Donald Trump’s administration has taken aim at international students – first implementing draconian screening measures over political views and then last week ordering all US embassies globallyto indefinitely pause all student visa interviews– many Indian students and their families have been left in limbo.Trump’s unilateral decision toblock Harvard University from admitting international students, which was laterblocked by the courts, also caused widespread panic and stoked fears that foreign students at other universities could get caught in the president’s crosshairs.“The students are in shock. Most of them spend several years preparing to study in the US,” said Devatwal. He said many of his clients were now hesitant to pursue a US degree, given the high levels of turmoil and uncertainty following the Trump administration’s new policies. Indian students can expect to pay between $40,000 to $80,000 (£29,500 to £59,000) a year on tuition alone to study in the US.In previous years, Devatwal’s organisation sent more than 100 students to American universities but this year he said the number had dropped to about 10. Instead, families were shifting their focus to the UK and other European countries. Arecent analysisby the Hindu newspaper estimated a 28% drop in Indian students going to the US in 2025.View image in fullscreenA group of students outside a canteen inside Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.Photograph: Aakash Hassan/The Observer“Families contribute their savings, take out loans from banks and borrow from relatives, all in the hope that the student will secure a good job abroad, repay the debt, and build a promising future,” said Devatwal. “In such uncertain circumstances, parents are understandably reluctant to let their children take such a risky path.”Brijesh Patel, 50, a textile trader in Surat, Gujarat, said he had been saving money for over a decade to make sure his son could go to a US university, including selling his wife’s jewellery and borrowing money from relatives.“Everyone in the family wanted our son to go to the US for his studies and make something good of his life,” said Patel. His 21-year-old son, who he asked not to be named for fear of retribution by the US authorities, had secured a place at two American universities for his master’s degree and Patel had already paid 700,000 rupees (£68,000) to consultancies who helped with the applications.But amid the turmoil under Trump, Patel said his son was being advised not to even apply for his student visa, due to the uncertainty and high probability of rejection. “We simply can’t take that risk. If our son goes now and something goes wrong, we won’t be able to save that kind of money again,” he said.However, Patel said he was not willing to give up on the family dream just yet. “I am an optimist, and my son is willing to wait a year,” he said. “We’re hoping that things improve by then. It’s not just my son who will be living the American dream, it’s all of us: my wife, our relatives and our neighbours. I’ve struggled my whole life – I don’t want my son to face the same struggles here in India.”The fear among prospective and current students was palpable. Several Indian students studying in the US declined to speak to the Guardian, fearing it could jeopardise their visas.In India, a student selected in December to be one of this year’s Fulbright-Nehru doctoral fellows – a highly competitive scholarship that pays for the brightest students to study abroad atUS universitiesas part of their PhD thesis – said the applications of their entire cohort had recently been demoted back to “semi-finalists”.The student, who asked to remain anonymous over fears it would affect their application, said they had invitation letters from top Ivy League universities for the fellowship, which is considered one of the most prestigious scholarships in the US, but now everything was up in the air. “We are supposed to start in October and our orientation was scheduled for May, all the flights and hotels were even booked, but then it all got cancelled. Now we’ve been informed all our applications are under review by the Trump administration,” said the student.They said it had caused “huge panic and anxiety” among those accepted. “I know a lot of people are going back through their social media, deleting things and doing a lot of self-censoring.”Piyush Bhartiya, a co-founder of the educational technology company AdmitKard, said many parents who had been set on sending their children to the US were rethinking their plans. He cited one example of a student who had been admitted to New York University for the coming year but was instead planning to go to the London School of Economics after the US visa interviews were paused.Bhartiya said Indian students primarily went to the US to study Stem subjects – science, technology, engineering and maths – and so the focus had shifted to other countries strong in these areas.“Germany is the main country where students are shifting to for Stem subjects,” he said. “Other countries like Ireland, France, the Netherlands, which are also gaining substantial interest in the students. At the undergraduate level, the Middle East has also seen a lot of gain in interest given parents feel that it is close by and safer and given the current political environment they may want their kids closer to the home.”Among the Indian students forced to abandon their plans is Nihar Gokhale, 36. He had a fully funded offer for a PhD at a private university in Massachusetts, but recently received a letter saying the funding was being withdrawn, as the university faced issues under the Trump administration.“It was quite shocking. I spoke to people at the university, and they admitted it was an exceptional situation for them too,” said Gokhale.Without the funding, the US was financially “out of the question” and he said he had an offer from the UK he now intended to take up.“For at least the next three or four years, I’m not considering the US at all,” he said.Explore more on these topicsIndiaUS universitiesTrump administrationHigher educationDonald TrumpUS educationHarvard UniversityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Trump’s growing frustration with Putin has emboldened some in the GOP to begin speaking out on the conflict again – with the notoriously flexible Grahamleading the charge for tougher sanctions on the Kremlin. Is it nearing a critical mass moment in Congress – a body that has largely abdicated its role in foreign policy since Trump’s inauguration?“I hope so, because it is the right action to take,” said Don Bacon, a Republican House representative who has criticised the White House on its Ukraine policy. “But it is risky to speak for others. I know where I stand. The Senate has an overwhelming majority in support of sanctions and we should move out. It is in our national security interests thatRussiafails here and it should be obvious that Putin doesn’t want peace, but wants dominance over Ukraine.”Trump’s shift on Russia has come as his efforts to negotiate a speedy ceasefire have failed.Talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on Monday led to little progress, and continued outreach from his personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the Kremlin has not brought concessions from Vladimir Putin. A leaked draft of Russia’s demands at the negotiations depicted a capitulation: withdrawal from Ukrainian territory claimed by Russia, no Nato membership for Ukraine, caps on the size of the country’s military.Yet it has specifically been the bombardment of cities that has upset Trump, proving once again that Putin has managed to be his own worst enemy when it comes to negotiations.“I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him,” Trump said last week, repeating part of the comments in public. “He has gone absolutely CRAZY! He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I’m not just talking about soldiers.Missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever.”As the White House looks for means to increase pressure on Russia and its enablers like China, the bill backed by Graham and the Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal has become a convenient tool to do just that. One person in GOP circles said that the White House was considering letting Republicans “vote their conscience” – in effect allowing Congress to support the bill without facing blowback from the Trump administration.But that would involve a final decision by the White House, and Trump has still not openly backed new sanctions as more than just a contingency.“Despite support of 82 or so senators, the bill can’t move without support in the House, and the speaker of the House won’t move it without the president’s support,” said Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. “And it’s not clear the president has really decided Putin’s the impediment to a ceasefire. Additionally, the Senate will be consumed with passing the reconciliation bill for the next few weeks.”But as of Tuesday, the leadership appeared ready to move forward.The weather vane for Trump’s gusty foreign policy on Ukraine has been Graham, a veteran political survivor who has built a strong relationship with the president through relentless flattery and has tailored his views to match Trump’s when convenient. On Ukraine, he has been so bendable that he could not be broken.“They play a very careful game because they don’t want to upset their relationship with the big guy,” said one person knowledgable about discussions among congressional Republicans. “At the same time, I do think his heart and his head is in the right place. Just really not quite his own courage.”Graham’s interventions have been meaningful. He was instrumental in pushing the minerals deal thatUkraine signed with the US as a way to get Trump’s buy-in for its defense. Over a game of golf, he pitched Trump on the “trillions” in mineral wealth in Ukraine and later showed him a map (Trump said he wanted “half” according to one account).At the same time, he publicly fumed about Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the disastrous White House meeting of late February when Trump and JD Vance argued with the wartime leader. “I don’t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again,” Graham said, alsosuggesting that the Ukrainian leader should resign.(Zelenskyy shot back later that he was ready to offer him citizenship if he wanted to discuss who should lead Ukraine).Graham’s latitude has stunned some of his former colleagues. A former colleague who had worked with Graham on Ukraine policy said that his remarks about Zelenskyy had given him “whiplash”. Asked if Graham had a coherent strategy to influence Trump, the person said: “Graham’s strategy is to put Graham first.”“I think that he understands the big game,” said another person familiar with discussions over the bill. “He would like the policy to be sound, which means [putting sanctions] on the Kremlin. But he values his relationship with the president and that that trumps the first calculation. So if he really feels the president’s against, he’s not going to go for it.”Now, with Trump signaling greater readiness for sanctions, Graham has traveled to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy (all smiles) and to Brussels, where he and the EU president, Ursula von der Leyen, discussed potential EU and US sanctions packages to turn up the pressure on Moscow.“Senator Graham deserves a lot of credit for making the case for tougher pressure on the Kremlin,” said John Hardie, the Russia program deputy director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a conservative thinktank. “Carrots clearly haven’t worked, so it’s time to start using some sticks, including by going after Russia’s oil revenue. This economic pressure should be paired with sustained military assistance for Ukraine.”Hardie and others noted that Trump could increase pressure on Russia without the Senate bill.“If President Trump were to decide to go the pressure route, he already has the tools at his disposal to do so,” said Hardie. “For example, he could immediately designate the rest of Russia’s shadow fleet and other non-western entities facilitating Russian oil exports and could join with G7 partners in lowering the G7 oil price cap.”And even if the sanctions are passed, they will ultimately rely on Trump’s decision to enforce them.“The Senate is prepared either way,” Graham wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last week. “I have coordinated with the White House on the Russia sanctions bill since its inception.

Now, for the movie’s 50th, it’s doing it again … but with a Lord of the Rings Harfoot. Brace yourself for SHARK! Celebrity Infested WatersStuart HeritageTue 3 Jun 2025 09.42 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 10.08 EDTShareJaws turns 50 this year – a momentous occasion for arguably the most influential movie ever made. After all, we are talking about a piece of entertainment that – for better or worse – we are still living through. This sort of anniversary doesn’t come around very often and, now that we are witnessing the slow death of the theatrical experience, it deserves to be commemorated in the most lavish way possible. By this, I mean that ITV should gently lowerRoss Nobleinto shark-infested waters.And I am not the only one who thinks this, since ITV has just announced the lineup of its new “wildlife crossover format” SHARK! Celebrity Infested Waters, in which some famous people will swim with sharks for a bit. Or, to quote the press release, “a group of ocean-phobic celebrities confront their greatest fear – sharks. Throughout their adrenaline-fuelled, challenge-heavy journey in the Bahamas – the shark capital of the world – these A-listers will push past their limits to come nose to nose with nature’s ‘villains’.” The lineup in full isAde Adepitan,Helen George,Sir Lenny Henry, Ross Noble,Dougie Poynter,Lucy PunchandRachel Riley.Now, if this sounds at all familiar to you, it might be because you’re old enough to remember the show ITV made to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Jaws. That show was entitled Celebrity Shark Bait, and it saw Richard E Grant,Amy Nuttalland others being gently lowered into shark-infested waters. And it wasn’t very good, to the point that at times it felt like a thorough scientific experiment to make the least interesting shark-based TV programme possible. The jeopardy was minimal. The celebrity reactions were muted. The shark footage wasn’t particularly spectacular. When it was broadcast, theManchester Evening Newscalled it “the biggest waste of time of them all”.So why do it again? Well, there are two competing arguments. The first is that nobody watches linear TV any more, so ITV hasn’t really got anything to lose by remaking a 20-year-old flop. The second is that, if you parse the press release closely enough, you can just about tell that this is an attempt to improve upon what went before.Yes, the ITVness of it is the celebrity aspect – part of the show has clearly been designed to appeal to the very specific subsection of people who want to see Rachel Riley have a panic attack in a swimsuit – but there does seem to be more of a conservation focus this time too. The press release points out that, as well as almost getting eaten, the celebrities will “come to appreciate sharks’ valuable place on the food chain and in our ecosystem”.Better still, the show actively seems to want to commemorate Jaws by undoing some of the harm it has done to the reputation of sharks. That is, unless Henry gets his leg bitten off along the way, because that probably wouldn’t help a lot.So is it silly? Yes. Does it signify that ITV is running out of ideas? Yes. Does it have the very worst title you have ever seen? Yes, and quite frankly the government should step in and legislate against television shows with names that you’re expected to yelp at. But does SHARK!CelebrityInfested Waters have potential? Absolutely.In fact, so odd is the format of the show’s name that a franchise seems likely. If SHARK! Celebrity Infested Waters is a success, then maybe we can expect other shows about animals that modern culture has taught us to fear, like BEAR! Celebrity Infested Forests, or SPIDER! Celebrity Infested Attics. Look me in the eye and tell me that you wouldn’t want to see Peter Andre and Adam Woodyatt star in a series called FISH THAT SWIMS UP YOUR URINE STREAM AND GETS LODGED IN YOUR URETHRA! Celebrity Infested Rivers. I know I would.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionReality TVCelebrityWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her Serpentine pavilion – part tropical glasshouse, part 70s office block – is a chic, meditative place for an overpriced coffeeOliver WainwrightTue 3 Jun 2025 10.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 22.06 EDTSharePast pavilions have taken the form of inflatable balloons, teetering plastic pyramids and cork-lined lairs dug into the ground. We have seen afibreglass cocoon perched on boulders, a wildflower garden enclosed by tar-daubed walls, and anassortment of undulating canopies, clad in polished steel and jagged slate. Now, to celebrate 25 years of building experimental structures on its front lawn, London’s Serpentine gallery has unveiled its first pavilion that moves.“Every time you think of an idea for the project,” saysMarina Tabassum, the Bangladeshi architect behind this year’s kinetic enclosure, “you realise, ‘Oh, that’s already been done.’” This is the eternal dilemma for any designer selected for this prestigious annual commission: how to concoct a novel structure on a tight deadline that will enrapture park-goers, entertain corporate sponsors, and appeal to collectors,who are ultimately expected to acquire the thing– as well as, most importantly, provide a shelter for an overpriced coffee.She wanted to clad her structure with coarse jute – but fire safety regulations and British rain put paid to thatTo the Serpentine’s quarter century of domed, cylindrical and cocoon-shaped cafes, Tabassum has now added a pill-shaped pavilion. “A capsule in time” is how she describes her 55-metre long structure, formed of timber arches 28m high, clad in translucent brown panels, sliced open in places for entrances and views of a single gingko tree, poetically planted in line with the gallery’s roof tower. The vaulted enclosure terminates in a momentous domed apse at either end, recalling tropical glasshouses and church naves, while the zigzag cladding gives it the look of an expanding crepe-paper ornament, as if it might fold itself away at any moment.None of these things were on Tabassum’s mind. Instead, she citesshamiana, the ceremonial tents erected for festive gatherings in south Asia. Their “beautiful quality of filtered light” is what she was keen to bring here. She had originally hoped to clad her structure with coarse lengths of jute, but a combination of fire safety regulations and British rain put paid to the sackcloth. It’s a shame the fabric was ditched. The tinted brown plastic, fixed to a chunky steel frame between the big brown arches, calls less to mind a festive tent than the vaulted atrium of a 1970s office block – a chic one, nonetheless.View image in fullscreenMoving at imperceptible speed … the brown tinted roof of the pavilion.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightThe plastic does the job, though, keeping the rain out and filtering light through the variously tinted panels, but it has a corporate slickness at odds withTabassum’s work in Bangladesh. Her buildings there revel in their rough brickwork, raw concrete, and use of slender bamboo – and their ability to do a lot with minimal means. She has built emergency homes for the delta-dwellers of the Ganges that are essays in lightweight, modular elegance, using woven grass and bamboo. This five-month summer canopy feels hugely over-engineered and carbon intensive in comparison.It is a common curse of the annual commission, which often sees architects’ ideas lost in translation by the Serpentine’s speed and prefabrication-oriented engineers and builders, Aecom and Stage One. Plans forearth bricks result in blocks of wood; ideas for transparent panels bringsheets of CNC-milled plywood; dreams of handmade clay domes end up asprefab wooden cylinders. Any hope for true material experimentation is ultimately lost, which seems to undermine a central point of the commission.The dissonance this year is no more evident than in the kinetic gadgetry. As we speak, a 10-tonne chunk of Tabassum’s capsule begins to move, at imperceptible speed, closing one of the gaps. “I wanted to keep the sense of openness to the park,” she says. “So it was very important to keep these cuts in the structure. But the brief also requires a covered space for 200 people, for events, so we had to be able to close it up.” She says the solution – an underground hydraulic machine – was one of the most expensive parts of the project, and it seems like a herculean effort to move the canopy just 1.4 metres. You might struggle to spot the difference, before and after the great manoeuvre.I would like this to be a space where people can come together and forget their differencesThe surprisingly substantial nature of the pavilions is partly down to the fact that they are intended to live on, in the parks and gardens of their millionaire collectors. No future for Tabassum’s capsule has yet been announced, but she has an idea in mind. “If my wishes are of any value, I would like it to become a library,” she says. Hinting at its afterlife, she has equipped the space with shelves, and a selection of books that celebrate the richness of Bengali culture, literature and poetry, and the ecology of Bangladesh.In the meantime, she wants it to be a place for dialogue. “This has been a year marked by intolerance, wars, countless deaths, protests and suppressions,” she says. “I would like this to be a space where people can come together, forget their differences and just talk about humanity.” Could this be the first protest pavilion?View image in fullscreenDreams of a library … Marina Tabassum.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianIt is a suitably calm space for taking the heat out of discussions, and the apses should provide great natural acoustics for lectures and events. But the sense of tranquility is thrown into sharp relief by what stands next door.Like a brash uncle in a loud comedy shirt muscling his way into the wedding photos, a second pavilion has been built just a few metres away, across the entrance path, doing its best to upstage Tabassum’s restrained enclosure. It is the work of 88-year-old Sir Peter Cook, a co-founder of the radical 1960s group Archigram, former head of UCL’s Bartlett school of architecture – and more recently consultanton desert fantasies for Saudi Arabia’s regime.In an astonishingly ill-judged move, the Serpentine has commissioned Cook to conjure a“play pavilion”for its 25th anniversary, suggesting the work of a woman from the global south is not quite enough on its own. Looking like a crumpled cheeseburger, with a domed bun-like canopy hovering above a fluorescent orange cylinder, clad with what look like globular smears of ketchup and mustard, Cook’s structure is a clumsy eyeful. It is “the fool, the joker, the mischievous child,” he claims in an accompanying text, a reminder that “we should never take ourselves too seriously.” One might have hoped for a bit more seriousness than this drunken napkin sketch.View image in fullscreenA clumsy eyeful … Peter Cook’s ‘play pavilion’.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightSponsored by Lego, it contains a lumpen series of plastic brick towers, while a yellow plastic slide is bolted on to the side, as an invitation to “become part of this jolly thing”. In its dad-dancing desperation to be fun, the sorry structure merely serves as a reminder that the park’s nearby playgrounds are a good deal more inventive and playful than this washed-up sponsorship opportunity. Numerous other young architects could have conjured a more inventive play space, should the gallery have taken the idea seriously.Why choose Cook? Maybe they held a seance. The Serpentine cites the posthumous wishes of its first pavilion architect, Zaha Hadid, as the reason. Bettina Korek, chief executive, and Hans Ulrich Obrist, artistic director, said in a statement: “Zaha Hadid long envisioned a collaboration between Serpentine and Peter Cook, whose radical design philosophy perfectly aligns with her belief that ‘there should be no end to experimentation’. Now, that vision is becoming a reality.”But perhaps Cook’s squashed Lego burger makes a fitting final bookend to this 25-year jamboree of pavilions, a tradition that seems to have had its day. It could follow in the footsteps of Zaha’s angular marquee, which unexpectedlyended up in Flambards theme park in Cornwall, where it enjoyed a second life hosting children’s birthday parties, until the place was shuttered last year. We can look forward to Cook’s structure being unearthed in a McDonald’s car park in years to come, the jaunty legacy of Archigram adorned with discarded Happy Meals.Marina Tabassum’sSerpentine Pavilionis open from 6 June until 26 October; Peter Cook’s play pavilion is open from 11 June until 10 AugustExplore more on these topicsSerpentine pavilionArchitectureArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was also new to the job’: read the first instalment of her memoir hereJacinda ArdernTue 3 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTShareSeventy-two hours after our daughter, Neve, was born, Clarke and I held a press conference to introduce her to the world. We planned the whole thing before I gave birth, and I’d been sure it would be fine.KateMiddletondid it,I’d thought.I can make it work.Now that I’d just given birth, it did not feel fine.I had spent most of the waking hours since Neve arrived just staring at her, the way new parents do. For so long, I had waited and worried, and now she was here. I was relieved and elated.My body, though, was another matter. Even the easiest birth knocks a body in two, and Neve’s wasn’t entirely straightforward. Close to delivery, her heart rate had dropped precipitously, and she’d emerged with the cord wrapped around her neck. Her first night, she’d been up for 12 hours straight, which meant I had, too. By now I felt almost delirious from lack of sleep.I’d also barely got out of my pyjamas since she’d been born. My hair was unwashed, and the best hope was to pull it back in a bun. My postpartum stomach was, shall we say, not minimal. And walking any distance at all made me feel as if my insides were falling out.View image in fullscreenThe Princess and Prince of Wales with newborn son George.Photograph: Beretta/Sims/Rex ShutterstockI remembered how Kate Middleton looked on the day she introduced a newborn Prince George to the assembled throng, to the media, to the world. How composed and put together she looked in a powder-blue polka-dot dress. She’d made it look easy.How, exactly,I wondered, as I hobbled down the hallway toward the hospital atrium for my own press conference,had Kate done this?I held Neve in my arms. She was wrapped in a blanket knitted by Clarke’s mother, wearing a little green knit cap that my seasoned midwife, Libby, had given us. Clarke stood next to me, beaming in a woollen cardigan with a southwestern pattern.I didn’t tell the reporters everything, of course. I didn’t tell them that the hospital room I’d been staying in had a little vestibule at the entrance for protection officers, because it had been designed to hold incarcerated people from the nearby Mount Eden prison who might need hospital treatment. I didn’t tell them that Clarke had snuck past the media while I was in labour to get me a lemonade Popsicle, or that the first meal I’d had after the birth – Marmite on toast with a cup of Milo – was probably the best meal of my life. I didn’t tell them what Clarke had told me: that the first time I held Neve, I looked like a crazy person, and that I in turn asked him how exactly he would have looked after that labour? Instead, as I looked at the cameras and microphones in front of me, I simply said that it was a joy to introduce our child to the country.‘Empathy is a kind of strength’: Jacinda Ardern on kind leadership, public rage and life in Trump’s AmericaRead moreThe first question we were asked was easy, about the origin of Neve’s name: Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford. Her middle name, Te Aroha, of course, was the mountain beneath which both of my parents were born, the one that in Māori means simply “the love”. If anything was going to make me cry during the press conference, it was this part. My voice wavered as I explained that her name captured what we felt from the moment we announced her existence to the world: love. Love from strangers, friends, family,iwi,Māori. A whole country. Just love.After that, I wanted to go inside, to bundle Neve into her car seat and leave the hospital for home. But there were more questions. I rocked back and forth on my feet, hoping to keep everything where it belonged – organs, emotions, body fluids – as I took a second question. This one came from a TV journalist.“Prime minister,” he began. “What have you learned about the state of the public health system?”It seemed I was a mum for all of four minutes. Now I was back to prime minister.View image in fullscreen‘How, exactly, had Kate Middleton done this?’ … Jacinda Ardern leaving hospital with Neve and her partner, Clarke Gayford.Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty ImagesI’d known exactly what kind of mother I wanted to be. I didn’t want to obsess about breastfeeding, about feeding schedules, about exactly how many minutes of sleep the baby had. I definitely didn’t aspire to feel overwhelmed, weary, or snappish with Clarke’s efforts to help. No, I planned to spend my maternity leave soaking up every minute with beautiful Neve.But even with Clarke having taken time out from filming his TV show, and even with my mum bustling about our home in Auckland, cooking and cleaning and filling me to bursting with lactation cookies and tea, I still ticked off all the things Iwasn’tgoing to do like they were agenda items.For one thing, I expected breastfeeding to be a lot more straightforward than it was. I knew that wasn’t the case for lots of new mums, and I had heard a few horror stories including from my sister. But that didn’t change my assumption that eventually my body would just do what it was meant to. But within a few days, Neve began losing weight. So, to boost my supply, I hooked myself up to a pump. I pumped almost nonstop, obsessively.Does any mother ever look back and say, “I wish I’d spent more time on a breast pump?” Maybe not, but I still felt as if I were failing my first test. And eventually, it became clear: I would have to supplement feeding Neve with formula, and it also looked as though it would have to stay that way.Then there was the issue of sleep. Neve slept well during the day while I tried to work – because even with my deputy, Winston Peters, temporarily at the helm, even though I left everything as organised as it could possibly have been, there were still papers I needed to review, political issues I had to be involved with, plans I needed to weigh in on. So, I joined conference calls with Neve across my lap, trying to straddle two different universes.By night, Neve was unsettled – a “party baby”, as Clarke would call her. At first, this turned the days into a hazy blur. But after a few weeks, the sleeplessness became something else entirely. Being woken up so often felt so physically painful that I began to dread the night.There was also the simple reality of physical recovery. From the moment I learned I was pregnant and was given the label geriatric mother, I expected more twists and turns. But it also meant I marvelled just a bit more, too. My 37-year-old body had managed to create this entire human being, and to sustain the two of us for nine months. It had eventually brought her airside, wide-eyed and perfectly formed. But that didn’t mean my body was happy to just bounce back in the aftermath as I needed it to. For weeks after, I still struggled to stand fully upright. I wondered whether this was just how I would be from now on.But as the weeks went by, Neve’s nights got a little easier. The formula helped, and so my obsession with feeding eased some. I began to walk a little farther, a touch more upright. And by the time I could do those things, six weeks had passed. It was time to return to Wellington, and to the role of full-time prime minister.Come September, I was due to speak at the United Nations general assembly. I knew what I wanted to talk about, too: the climate crisis, its impact on our region and the desperate need for nations to work together on solutions, just as leaders of Nauru and atolls like Tokelau were asking us to. Since a trip to New York City is too long for a breastfeeding mum to make alone, Clarke, Neve and I stepped on to a 13-hour AirNew Zealandflight and flew through the night, Auckland to Houston, then another three and a half hours to JFK. By the time we got to our hotel, it was one o’clock in the morning in New York and already dinnertime in New Zealand.By this point, Neve’s nappy had been changed on aeroplane floors. She’d been whisked through airports and strapped in and out of her car seat many times. She was completely spent, her sleep rhythm off, and so she did what any reasonable 12-week-old would under the circumstances: she screamed. And she would not stop.We sang lullabies into her ear, paced back and forth, rocked her, but she was inconsolable, her face red and twisted, her head thrown back. Her tiny limbs flailed, fighting back against sleep. I felt responsible for her being there, responsible for her being so uncomfortable and unhappy. I glanced at the clock: I was due to speak at an event on sustainable development in the morning, which meant I needed to be up in four hours.Finally, Clarke sent me to bed. “You need sleep,” he insisted. He was pacing around, rocking Neve up and down in his arms the way he did at home when he tried to settle her. I could tell how tired he was. “We’ll be fine,” he said, his voice quiet. We both knew that I was the one who had to get up and speak in the morning. I kissed them both good night, and I crawled into bed, covering my head with a pillow.A few hours later, just as the first light was breaking, I found Clarke sitting up in his boxers, wide awake, on the foldout couch of our hotel room. Neve lay against his chest, quiet now, but her eyes open. The television was on, sound down, both mesmerised by what appeared to be a UFC fight.I stood there in my dress and blazer. “You guys OK?”Clarke nodded.“Did you sleep?” I asked.“Yeah, Neve nodded off eventually.”“And you?”“A bit.”I handed him some milk, kissed them again, and headed out the door.View image in fullscreenTaking Neve through the turnstiles at the United Nations building in New York in 2018.Photograph: Vanessa Carvalho/ShutterstockA few days later I spoke at a Nelson Mandela commemorative event in the general assembly. Clarke and Neve joined in the wings, just in case Neve needed to be fed.When I finished speaking, we all sat down together in New Zealand’s designated seating on the general assembly floor. That’s when I heardclick, click, click.I strained around awkwardly. I couldn’t see where the noise was coming from until our high commissioner pointed up to a row of booths above the floor. “There’s a few media up there,” he said.Still not really registering that it was us they were interested in, I made stupid faces at Neve while Clarke held her. By the end of the day, these images would travel around the world.These pictures mark the first time a baby was brought to the floor of the UN general assembly. But when I look at them – at Neve’s double chin, her blue-and-white-striped dress – it’s not the historic occasion I think about.View image in fullscreenAll eyes on Neve at the UN general assembly.Photograph: Carlo Allegri/ReutersInstead, I think about all the people just outside the camera frame: the foreign policy adviser who babysat so we could attend an event with the American president. The high commissioner who found bassinets, sterilisers and a playpen. Clarke, who changed the nappies, rocked Neve to sleep and followed me around for feeds.I worried that this photo could become a banner for “women doing it all” or some kind of proof point that women should never complain about how much they have on their plate, because, look, here’s a woman running a country and being a mother. Sure, women can do it all; they are mothers, workers, caregivers, change makers, advocates, counsellors, cheerleaders, often doing these things with little support. But that doesn’t mean they should.Women shouldn’t have to choose – the way our mothers so often did – between being good at their profession and being a good mother, or daughter. There should be support networks, a village, whatever you call it, that can help them be all of those things without completely losing themselves in the process. That’s what I was blessed to have, at the UN and elsewhere: the love and support of others. And today that’s exactly what I say when anyone brings up that photo, or when they stop me in the supermarket to ask how I did it.That trip to the UN was historic, but in some ways it was also bittersweet. On the second day, I noticed that Neve was fussing every time I tried to feed. Clarke saw me struggling, so I tried to explain it away. “It’s probably the different time zones.” But even as I said it, I knew this wasn’t true. I had felt this coming.I wasn’t giving up on breastfeeding, but Neve was. She’d had enough of feeding when I was available. Of my patchy supply. Of my sometimes-hurried approach to it all. But I hadn’t wanted to concede, because conceding in my mind meant I was somehow failing. It also meant that I would have no excuse anymore to have Neve with me, on the road, or in the office.If I’d been at home, I would have sat quietly and alone in the corner of a room and had a cry. I’d have mourned this thing I’d never quite mastered, and which as a result made me feel as if I’d failed my first test of motherhood. I was in New York, surrounded by people who wanted nothing more than to help me. But the one thing I needed at that moment, no one could help me with.I just wanted to feel like a good mum. And right now I didn’t.View image in fullscreenArdern marks Waitangi Day with Neve, age two and a half, in 2021.Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty ImagesIn December, just before the Christmas break, I took home my final briefcase of the year. I finished my paperwork, slipped the papers into a manila folder, then slid it back into the bag.There were new things to worry about: lower-than-expected GDP numbers, a minister who was being scrutinised for his handling of an immigration case, a complaint and report about one of our police appointments. There wasn’t enough time, not enough hours in the day, the universal plight of every mother.I peeked in at Neve. She was sound asleep. I closed the door to her room, walked to mine, crawled into bed, and pulled the covers up around me. It had been a long year.“Next year,” I said to Clarke. “Next year will be easier.”This is an edited extract from A Different Kind of Power: A Memoir by Jacinda Ardern, published globallybyPan Macmillan in the UK;Crown in the US(a division of Penguin Random House LLC);Penguin Random House NZ; andPenguin Random House Australia.To support the Guardian, order a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

In his own words, his VJ debut, Rambo III, “lacked a bit of skill”, but he went on to master his craft by studying the works of pioneers like KK the Best and VJ Jingo.VJ Junior’s breakthrough came in 2009 when he translated The Promise, a Filipino soap, for the local station Bukedde TV. “It was a big hit and it made a big brand for me,” the 40-year-old said. “People started believing in my work.”Ronnie’s Entertainment, a video store in Katwe neighbourhood, was a beehive of activity: shoppers perused shelves stacked with thousands of VJ DVDs while employees sat in front of computers copying movies to waiting customers’ flash disks. DVDs sell for 2,000 Ugandan shillings (£0.41), and titles copied to flash disks go for 1,000 shillings.The shop’s proprietor, Ronald Ssentongo, said he sold hundreds of films and TV shows every day, and that some of the most popular titles included Marvel movies and the TV shows Prison Break and 24. “These titles are already available in their original English versions, but people don’t watch them,” he said. “They’re waiting for VJ Junior’s translation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As foreign movies on VHS became more available in the 1980s, video halls started popping up. To overcome the language barrier, video hall proprietors hired VJs to translate them to local languages in real time.As technology advanced, VJs moved to distributing their work on VHS tapes, VCDs, and now DVDs and flash disks. Many have created websites for viewers to stream and download their material upon subscription.The industry is growing in other ways too. Some VJs are increasingly dubbing Ugandan movies and TV shows, and new VJs have emerged to translate to languages other than Luganda, the most widely spoken in the country.View image in fullscreenDVDs on display for sale at Ronnie’s Entertainment.Photograph: Carlos Mureithi/The GuardianBy localising foreign films and TV shows and helping Ugandans make sense of them, VJs make audiences feel valued, said John-Baptist Imokola, a lecturer at Makerere University whohas researchedthe work of VJs. “They feel appreciated, they feel recognised and they feel known,” he said, though he also warned of the risk of oversimplified translations that deny audiences an understanding of the themes and messages the original films intended to convey.VJs and their distributors occasionally have run-ins with authorities over copyright infringement, with police sometimes raiding video stores and confiscating DVDs and equipment used to copy films. VJ Junior said the copyright issue was a big challenge for his business and that it was “very difficult” to get the rights to dub foreign films.VJ Junior, who described the role of a VJ in Ugandan society as “helping people understand movies, entertaining them, and inspiring them”, said he dubbed an average of 10 films or TV episodes every week.“You have to do research, you have to be informed and you have to be educated,” he said of the skills required to do his job. “The industry has grown and so has demand.”Explore more on these topicsUgandaAfricaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But subtleties get lost and truly unleashed people reactTue 3 Jun 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 18.14 EDTShareIt happened again. The third time this year that Jewish people were attacked with murderous intent in a major US city under the guise of the assailant caring about the plight of the Palestinians inGaza. It’s the second time that fires were set. The first happened when an attacker – a US citizen – broke into the official residence of Pennsylvania’s governor in Harrisburg, on the evening of Passover and set fire to the residence. The only thing that saved governor Josh Shapiro and his family was a quick response from security guards, leaving only some Passover Haggadahs, the text that charts Jewish hopes for freedom and liberation from one generation to the next, to burn on the tables still set from dinner.About two weeks ago, there was the murder of two innocent Jewish Israeli embassy workers who were attending an event hosted by the The American Jewish Committee at the Jewish Museum in Washington DC on how to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza; these young people were chosen at random from a crowd apparently targeted intentionally since the murderer, again a US citizen, appeared to have wanted to hunt down and kill Jews in response to Israel – a sovereign country’s – military acts. Tellingly, the gunman had a brief association to the far-left Party of Socialism and Liberation (PSL said in astatementthat he is not a member and that his association with the group ended in 2017).And now, again with the element of fire, we wait for word on the condition ofat least 12 victimsof a torching in broad daylight in downtown Boulder, Colorado, by an assailant namedMohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national, who yelled “Free Palestine” and scorched the skin of activists ranging from their 50s to the 80s whogathered peacefully in that squareeach week demanding one thing: bring the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas home.This group of activists, part of the international movement that posts on Twitter/X as #RunForTheirLives walks and runs each week, in Boulder, in New York’s Central Park, in Mexico and around the world, in support of freeing the hostages. They also post this missive for participants, beginning by asking: “Should I be scared to participate?” Their response: “That’s a valid concern these days. Make your best judgment to decide if it’s safe. However, we encourage a couple of principles to make this safer: don’t protest! Don’t disturb your neighbors. Do it quietly and don’t block roads. Be polite and peaceful. Focus on humanity. This is about innocent children, women, the elderly, and other civilians being held by terrorists – not about the war. We encourage carrying flags of all countries from which there are hostages.”Why is a pro-Israel group asking the US to investigate Ms Rachel?Read moreThey encouraged bringing kids. “This is a family-friendly event. It is non-violent and does not focus on the traumatic events that occurred during the hostages’ captivity. Our events are meant to be quiet and peaceful.”Jews demonstrating in an open town square were burned solely because they are Jews. It’s way past time; there needs to be a real and deep understanding of how ugly some factions of the US left became, both pre and post 7 October’s attack by Hamas, with a delegitimizing ideology about “settler colonialism” the wishful erasure ofIsraelas a state by proclaiming support for a future Palestine in a region where some protesters hope to annihilate Israel, silencing of Israeli and Jewish voices even when they are voices of protest against Benjamin Netanyahu’s government or even if the assailant has no idea what the victim’s position is on Israeli policies. This desire for erasure opened the floodgates to those who think they are being one of the team by killing with a slogan as their battle cry.This is not about parsing legalisms of whether it is a legitimate protest to harm or kill civilians. It isn’t. Full stop. (And, I have said and written the same thing regarding Palestinian civilians being killed and will continue to write and protest any innocent civilians being killed. I also reject any attempts by any person or group or government to blame all Palestinians for Hamas’s actions. Also, perhaps it needs to be said here and time again: I fully support, and have spent my life fighting for, freedom and self-determination for the Palestinian people, acknowledging the rights of two people to one plot of land).One of the first things I did after 7 October was to purchase and wear a Jewish star around my neck. In my 69 years, I had never worn my religion or my identity on my person. But since 7 October, perhaps defying the odds – but more so, wearing my pride, I purchased a star which I wear proudly. In solidarity with those in Israel and around the world who are demanding that the Israeli hostages come home, I also wear a yellow ribbon affixed to my bag whenever I leave my home. It is perhaps the sort of symbol that is an “if you know, you know,” but I want the world to know two things: this is not OK, and no one will scare me off because of my Jewish identity or my support for an end to the poisonous Hamas’s incursion of 7 October.I intensely hope this is obvious: you can oppose policies without setting people on fire because they are Jewish. The majority of US Jews overwhelmingly oppose the Israeli prime minister’s policies. But subtleties get lost and truly unleashed people react. The leftwing reaction to an horrific action like this has to be swift and soul-searching. Again, while this current perpetrator apparently has no ties to the left, the rhetoric of the left – and the actions of some leftwing organizations – have to be examined. Imagine a situation where there was in fact an American left that embraced peace efforts on both sides instead of demonizing one side or the other, which is by the way, a mirror image of what the right wing does. Two sides. Two peoples.I write this as someone whose entire life has been lived on the left, as a prominent activist and one who continues to believe in my gut in the values of a humanitarian left. I won’t allow a very real fear to stop me – not to stop me from being a proud Jew or an outspoken leftist demanding my rightful place in the lexicon of what must be an inclusive movement promoting humanity for all and freedom for all. No erasures. No exceptions.Meanwhile, it’s important to also call out the sickening and cynical usage of antisemitism on the right by Donald Trump and his allies. The US president is handily and cynically already using the Boulder attack to attack all immigrants and to promote his heartless expulsion agenda with barely a mention of the victims of the crime. He has used antisemitism throughout his term in the most cynical of ways, never showing any genuine interest in eradicating it or embracing the victims. He pretty much ignored the heinous attack on Shapiro, most likely because Shapiro is a vocal and effective opponent of Trump. And, of course, Trump’s Darth Vader imitator Stephen Miller is hard at work using these crimes to promote his anti-American agenda to attack immigrants in the US as well as attack universities and legitimate protest. Trump’s destructive weaponizing of antisemitism to promote his own authoritarian agenda will not keep one Jew safe: in fact, it does the opposite.Jews don’t want to be played by the left or the right. We don’t want to be pawns tossed back and forth. We want to be safe. We want to be heard. We want to be seen in our diversity, as would any people. We don’t want our lives to be at risk. Listen to and watch what each person says. See each person as an individual. Please build a serious political program that doesn’t cancel or promote violence of any kind but rather lifts up the hopes and desires of everyone. The alternative is deadly.Jo-Ann Mort is co-author of Our Hearts Invented a Place: Can Kibbutzim Survive in Today’s Israel?

The public has a right to knowJeremy CorbynWhen I was Labour leader, the Chilcot report condemned the party for its disastrous war in Iraq. We need a similar inquiry nowTue 3 Jun 2025 10.28 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 10.32 EDTShareHussam, 13, and Muhammad, 14, were killed by air-dropped cluster bombs. These bombs were made by the United States and were dropped in a military campaign supported by the British government. Hussam and Muhammad were born in Baghdad and died in 2003. “The bomblet ripped off their legs and ultimately killed them,” according toHuman Rights Watch. They were two of about200,000 civilianswho were killed in the Iraq war.For years after that conflict, the government tried to resist several attempts to establish an inquiry into the policymaking of British officials. However, it could not prevent the inevitable – and in 2016 we had the publication of the Chilcot inquiry. I was the leader of the Labour party when the report was published, and it found grave failings within the British government. After I had responded to the Chilcot inquiry in parliament that day, I then went over the road to Church House, where we had invited war veterans, Iraqis and the families of British soldiers who had lost their lives. Iapologisedon behalf of the party for its catastrophic decision to go to war in Iraq. Today, history is repeating itself – and a Labour government is making another grave mistake.After 20 months of Israeli bombardment, the death toll in Gaza hasexceeded 54,000. As for the survivors, the injured and the bereaved – they will face lifelong scars for generations to come.Israel has not been acting alone. It has relied on military, economic and political support from governments around the world. Britain may have had a change in government since 7 October 2023, but one thing has remained constant: the steady supply of arms to Israel. Last year, between October and December alone, Labour approved more arms exports licences to Israel than the Conservatives approvedbetween 2020 and 2023. This was in spite of the government’s announcement ofa part suspensionin September 2024.Many of us have continued to express our disgust over the continued supply of components to theF-35 jet fighter programme. I remain astounded that the government openly admits it is making an “exception” to its part suspension. Is this an exception to its legal obligations to prevent genocide? One thing is beyond doubt: this government is still allowing the supply of arms to a nation whose leader iswanted by the international criminal courtfor alleged crimes against humanity.We have also repeatedly asked for the truth regarding the role of British military bases in Cyprus, concerning thetransfer of armsto Israel and the supply of military intelligence. When Keir Starmer visited RAF Akrotiri in December 2024, he wasfilmed telling troops:“The whole world is relying on you, and everybody back at home is relying on you.”He added: “Quite a bit of what goes on here can’t necessarily be talked about all of the time … We can’t necessarily tell the world what you’re doing here.” What does the government have to hide?Our questions have been met with evasion, obstruction and silence, leaving the public in the dark over the ways in which the responsibilities of government have been discharged. Transparency and accountability are cornerstones of democracy. The British public deserves to know the full scale of the UK’s complicity in crimes against humanity.That is why I am tabling a private members’ bill tomorrow calling for a full, public, independent inquiry into the UK’s role in Israel’s military assault in Gaza. This inquiry would seek to establish the truth about Britain’s military, economic or political cooperation with Israel since October 2023. Any meaningful inquiry would require the full cooperation of government ministers – Conservative andLabour– who have been involved in the decision-making processes.This inquiry must find out: what arms have been supplied to Israel? Which of these arms have been used to kill Palestinians? What legal advice has the government received? Is RAF Akrotiri being used as a route for weapons to be deployed in Gaza? What video footage does the government have of the war zone? What intelligence has been passed to Israel?Over the past20 months, human beings have endured a level of horror and inhumanity that should haunt us for ever. Entire families wiped out. Limbs strewn across the street. Mothers screaming for their children torn to pieces. Doctors performing amputations without anaesthesia. Home by home, hospital by hospital, generation by generation. We have not been witnessing a war. We have been witnessing a genocide, livestreamed before the entire world.No one can pretend they did not know what was happening. In October 2023, we warned that we were witnessing the beginning of the total annihilation of Gaza and its people. We said Palestinians were being collectively punished for a terrible crime they did not commit. We pleaded with political leadersto call for peace.We were ignored. Today, some politicians have finally started to backtrack, perhaps frightened by the consequences of their inhumanity. If they had any integrity, they would weep for the 54,000 Palestinians buried under the rubble by their moral and political cowardice. Today, schoolchildren are taught about history’s worst crimes against humanity. In the future, our history books will shame those who had the opportunity to stop this massacre but instead chose to enable one of the greatest crimes of our time.This issue is not going away – and we are not going anywhere. The government must decide: will it support this inquiry, or will it block our efforts to establish the truth?Jeremy Corbyn is the MP for Islington North.

Two feuding brothers. An ambitious American actor wife … the Beckhams certainly seem to have a lot in common with the SussexesTue 3 Jun 2025 09.53 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 12.50 EDTShareSo long, and thanks for all the jam. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and queen of Montecito, recently announced that she is reimagining As Ever, her raspberry spread and “flower sprinkle” business. In aninterview with Fast Company, which Meghan conducted in fluent buzzword, the actor and entrepreneur said she is thinking bigger than jarred goods and partnering with Netflix to bring forth a vision in which “content and commerce meet, not in a product placement way, but rather in an ideological way”. (I think the ideology she is referencing here is capitalism). Meghan is now involved with so many different projects that she notes: “If I had to write a résumé, I don’t know what I would call myself.”It looks as though her husband, Henry Charles Albert David Mountbatten-Windsor, doesn’t know what to call himself either. Thebig Harry newsfrom recent days is that the Duke of Sussex had a moment where he considered changing his double-barrelled last name to “Spencer”, in a nod to his late mother and a middle finger to the rest of his family.While the Sussexes seem to be having something of an identity crisis, they are both still generating headlines. But notquiteso many as they used to: Harry-and-Meghan-mania seems to have heavily subsided since Harry’s big tell-all, Spare, came out in 2023. Which was only to be expected. We know all there is to know about Harry’sfrostbitten penis and drug habits; now only dull dregs of gossip remain. Meghan’s Netflix show has been widely written off as “boring”. The US media, at least, seem to be getting a little tired of the pair.As the Sussexes become old news, attention has been turning to Britain’s other US-based royal family: the Beckhams. Or, more accurately, the Peltz Beckhams: Brooklyn Beckham (David and Victoria’s eldest son) and Nicola Peltz (daughter of a US billionaire) combined their last names when they got married in 2022. “Not many guys take their wives’ names,” Brooklyn said at the time. “So, I was just like, ‘Why not?’” He also got about 70 tattoos in honour of Nicola, including the word “married”. Explaining the inspiration for that tattoo, Brooklyntold USA Today: “I kind of was just like, ‘Oh, we’re married, why not?’”Despite the fact that he now owns an artisanal hot sauce business (why not?), Brooklyn is one of the blandest people on the planet. So is his wife, Nicola, who is a film-maker and actor. (Wikipedia, in a savage move, says that she was cast in a role in The Last Airbender “at the insistence of her father, who was a producer on the film”.) And yet the pair now seem to be absolutely everywhere and mired in controversy. On Tuesday they were the focus of a Glamour cover storythat called them“the world’s most talked-about couple”.The talking isn’t entirely complimentary: for months there has been rabid speculation about a feud between the Peltz Beckhams and the wider Beckhams. David and Victoria don’t like Nicola! Victoria sabotaged Nicola’s wedding! Brooklyn skipped all three of his dad’s 50thbirthday celebrations! Brooklyn is feuding with his younger brother Romeo because Romeo is dating Brooklyn’s ex-girlfriend! And on it goes. I won’t go through every bit of gossip, but there are striking parallels between the Peltz-Beckham drama and the Sussexes. You’ve got the American actor wife that the famous British family seems to have a problem with. You’ve got two brothers feuding. You’ve got misogynistic speculation that a dim but affable man is being “controlled” by his ambitious wife.The parallels don’t seem to have bypassed the foursome. Last month there were tabloid reports that the Peltz Beckhams had dinner with the Sussexes in Montecito, where they bonded over everything they had in common. “Nicola and Meghan also had a bit of a ‘deep’n’meaningful’ as obviously both women have been positioned in the media as home-wreckers,” asource told the Sun. Over the weekend it was also reported that the Peltz Beckhams have now hired a British lawyer who had previously worked with the Sussexes to help with their “reputation management”.While Brooklyn and Nicola seem keen to model themselves on the Sussexes, I rather think Harry should brand himself like Beckham. Can you imagine how wound up all the Harry-haters would be if he got 70 Meghan-related tattoos? Even better: if he’s still keen on changing his name, he should forget Spencer and simply become Harry Markle. Far more modern of him than clinging on to his titles.

Actually, KKR hates the decades-old description, but the US private equity firm is still meant to have a fearsome reputation for doing its homework, being a cute judge of political risks and going where others fear to tread. All of which makesits 11th-hour abandonment of its £4bn bid for Thames Watervery odd.The suggestion is that the big bosses in New York couldn’t stomach the political and reputational risks of owning the UK’s largest and most crisis-ridden water company. If that’s the reasoning, though, KKR should explain itself. The political risks aren’t obviously worse than six months ago – and arguably are less now that the government’s water commissioner,Sir Jon Cunliffe, is talking aloud about “how to restore the stability and predictability of the regulatory system” in his interim report published co-incidentally on Tuesday. Thames’s reputation is still in the gutter, but that’s not fresh news.The government, too, seems to have been as keen as mustard on KKR. But, as the US firm should know, there are still limits on how many soft promises can be made, and how far the regulatory regime can be bent out of shape before Cunliffe’s final report. And, if you can’t handlethe odd political spat over executive bonuses, the UK water industry was probably never the place for you.KKR was not an unproblematic rescuer,as argued here previously, but, in two important ways, it is a shame it has scarpered. First, KKR was a grown-up international name in infrastructure and was imagining a 10-year commitment to Thames before listing it on the stock market, a good end-point. Second, Thames’s fall-back plan – a recapitalisation led by the bondholders – is messy.There are 100 financial institutions in the creditor group owed £13bn collectively. They are all, apparently, aligned in support of a version of a debt-for-equity proposal, but the sheer number of firms involved can only add complexity. The exercise may not be quite like herding cats, but at least there was only one KKR.Nor, to put it mildly, do all 100 members of the creditor group fit Cunliffe’s description of the preferred type of shareholder for water companies: those who seek “low risk, low returns”, such as pension funds, for the very good reason that treating sewage and supplying drinking water are not meant to be exciting.Silver Point Capital is a US hedge fund thatdescribes itselfas “a leader in global credit investing”. In other words, debt, not equity, is its game. Fellow US hedgie Elliott is a jack of all trades, but note its un-Cunliffe description ofits thrill-seeking style when owning equity– “positions with a high asymmetry of reward to risk” and “a high degree of optionality.”Others in the creditor group will be debt-only funds that aren’t allowed to own equity. Maybe the coalition will hold out of fear that special administration, AKA temporary nationalisation, would mean a worse outcome for all. But plan B is plainly sub-optimal. There were good reasons why KKR was selected as “preferred bidder”.An open question, though, is why Thames’s board, from a field of six, selected only KKR. An obvious alternative would have been CK Infrastructure, which owns 75% of Northumbrian Water. The need for speed and exclusivity apparently trumped everything, but that now looks a poor call. If it really is too late to summon CKI back, it is only the creditor group’s proposal that is standing in the way of special administration. It may feel like Thames has been drinking in the last-chance saloon for about two years, but this time it genuinely is.From the government’s point of view, a good outcome at this point may be one in which the creditors shuffle the pack among themselves, with cuddlier names such as Aberdeen emerging as core would-be shareholders and the debt opportunists relegated to minor roles. That could be a workable fudge for a while. But the position is now properly unstable. A lot of time has been wasted on KKR’s non-bid. Special administration, the outcome the government has desperately been trying to avoid, is a real possibility.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterUtilitiesPrivatisationHedge fundsEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

Why so harsh? Because protest worksIndigo RumbelowThe judge wanted us to show remorse, but I can’t apologise for fighting the climate disasterTue 3 Jun 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 12.41 EDTShareLast week, at Minshull Street crown court in Manchester, I was sentenced to two and half years in prison for conspiring to intentionally cause a public nuisance. The prosecution’s case was that I intended to “obstruct the public or a section of the public in the exercise or enjoyment of a right that may be exercised or enjoyed by the public at large” – in other words, that I was part of Just Stop Oil’s plan to obstruct planes at Manchester airport. I did intend that – and I have a defence for my actions.The offence of public nuisance – which falls under the Criminal Law Act 1977 and the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 – was traditionally and frequently usedto prosecute significant environmental offences. It punished big corporations causing real harm to the general public by poisoning water, polluting air,emitting dust and noiseor dumping chemical waste. There is no irony lost in the fact that the same offence in statutory form is now being zealously deployed to prosecute environmental protesters.After spending nine months in prison on remand, my stomach was tied in knots but my head was held high as I climbed the steep, gloomy concrete steps from the court cells into the glass dock, which stands in the centre of the imposing Victorian gothic courtroom in Manchester. At last I was due tofind out my sentence. At the end of the long ruling our fate was made clear: Leanorah Ward, Margaret Reid, Daniel Knorr and I were given 18 months, 18 months, 24 months and 30 months respectively. I was taken back to prison, where I remain, with time left to serve.Make no mistake, this sentence was passed because nonviolent resistance has the potential to spark revolutionary change. The judge, Jason MacAdam, deemed it necessary to hand down “deterrent” sentences in order to inspire fear in others considering similar actions. There was much in the judgment that I disagree with, but I do agree withthe judge’s assertionthat I considered “the cause to trump inconvenience to others whether that be the general public at Manchester airport or other court users”.The climate crisis is notourcause; it’s a matter of life or death for everyone. We set out to disrupt the planes atManchesterairport because history shows that resistance can be a catalyst for change, and science shows that we need to change our destructive way of life now to prevent disaster. When we were arrested on the way to airport, we had a banner in our pockets that said “Oil Kills”. When we were sentenced in court we each raised signs saying, “Billions will die”. The science is clear, and the judge is right: I consider the facts to be so alarming, so stark, so utterly heartbreaking that disruption to everyday life is warranted. AndI have spent each day in custody, questioning why others equipped with the same knowledge as I have do not feel the duty to act in the same way that I do.The judge agreed that we acted on our conscience, but for sentencing he wanted to see remorse. But how can it be possible to take part in an act of conscience and then show remorse? How could I be morally compelled to take action one week, and then filled with regret for acting the next? I took action to disrupt the status quo, as I believed that carrying on as normal meant complicity in many unnecessary deaths. I pleaded not guilty and chose to defend my actions in court because I wanted to present the case that I was acting out of necessity to prevent harm. But this defence was ruled out.The judge stated that “the stance taken by you [by pleading not guilty] distinguishes you all from others who have chosen to follow the long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience on conscientious grounds, that is accepting that you have broken the law and accepting the punishment that follows”. In doing this he not only disregarded the 1670 trial of Penn and Mead (where Quakers pleaded not guilty to unlawful assembly), the Ploughshare Four trial (where peace activists defended themselves by arguing that they acted to prevent harm), and the Rivonia trial of Nelson Mandela (who defended himself against conspiracy charges brought by the apartheid South African government). They all pleaded not guilty.He also denies the very essence of the tradition of protest: its ability to evolve and adapt to different contexts in order to find the confrontational edge essential to nonviolent action. Just Stop Oil is not a re-enactment group, it is an action group, which has taken a strategic decision to continue resistance into the courtroom. By asserting the necessity for our actions, we include the legal system in the debate over our duty and responsibilities.Later in the judgment, MacAdam appeared to reveal outright contempt for those in resistance, as he mused “how wrong it is in a free and democratic society to consider that your own belief in the worthiness of a cause to be justification for breaking the law”. As if centuries of political and social struggle had never taken place, as if the current “free and democratic society” has delivered the protection and defence we need from ever-increasing heating and extreme weather events.My time incarcerated will be spent in service. I will continue to follow in the noble tradition of civil resistance, using my time to read about past campaigns and the people behind them. People who also served time in prison, in the belief that despite the reaction of the state, their actions were a necessary public service.I will consider how to hold those responsible for the greatest crime ever committed against humanity to account.Indigo Rumbelow is co-founder of Just Stop Oil.

It’s made him incredibly dangerousOwen JonesOnce a pro-remain Cameronite, he’s now engaging with the far right – and he’s in pole position for the Tory leadershipTue 3 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 13.13 EDTShareThe shameless opportunism of a scandal-hit political climber could have profound consequences for our democracy. The British public still knows little about Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary who was seen off by Kemi Badenoch in last year’s race for the Tory crown. That will soon change, becausethe implosionof the hapless Conservative incumbent is safely filed under “when, not if” – and Jenrick will almost certainly succeed her.Jenrick’s political evolution reflects the trajectory across the west of the so-called centre right, which has either been eclipsed by the radical right or adopted its positions. When Jenrick won the Newark byelection in 2014, he was – in the words of then nearby Tory MP Anna Soubry – a “full-fat subscriber to David Cameron”. Having defeated Nigel Farage’s then rising party, the now virtually extinct Tory wetshailed his victoryat the time as evidence that the party must resist becoming “Ukip lite”. It was a conclusion that Jenrick – who avoided campaigning on either immigration or the EU – endorsed, declaring: “You win elections at the centre.”At the time of the referendum, Jenrick was a staunch opponent of Brexit,signing a letterthat declared that leaving the EU would “lead us into dystopia”. Even as recently as 2022, when demagogic then home secretary Suella Braverman declared that southern England faced an “invasion” of illegal migrants, Jenrick rebuked his own boss. “It’s not a phrase that I’ve used,”he saidwhen asked if she’d used the wrong term, adding: “I think in this job you do have to use your language carefully.”Well, Jenrick has managed to drastically outbid Braverman on extreme language. Britain has imported “hundreds of thousands of people from alien cultures who possess medieval attitude towards women”,he declares. Where his former mentor Cameron once dismissed Ukip as “fruitcakes, loonies or closet racists”,Jenrick declareshe would welcome Farage into Tory ranks. The once passionate remainernow demands that Britainleave the European court of human rights. And when Britain was in the grip of racist, Islamophobic riots,Jenrick calledfor anyone shouting “Allahu Akbar” to be arrested – in other words, criminalising the most common phrase used by observant Muslims.Is this all a ruse to get elected leader before shifting in a completely different direction – a Tory Keir Starmer, if you will? Braverman certainly wasn’t convinced last year,declaring that Jenrick hails“from the left of the party” and looked “horrified” when she floated leaving the European court. But Jenrick is hardly unique. Consider Liz Truss, a former monarchy-trashing Liberal Democrat activist who also campaigned for remain. She now denounces the “deep state”, shares platforms with far-right US strategist Steve Bannon ashe praisesTommy Robinson as a “hero”, and this weekend attended a rightwing conference in Hungary, a quasi-dictatorship, where she talked about the “free speech crisis in Britain”.What Jenrick truly believes is a secondary consideration: you would hardly call Donald Trump a natural ideologue, and yet he operates as a faithful executor of far-right causes. Jenrick’sallies claim he was “radicalised”by his experience at the Home Office. Alarmingly, in leaked correspondence last year with an anonymousfar-right Twitter accountthat demands “mass deportations” and banning the Qur’an, Jenrick declared himself “a great admirer” of its tweets, saying: “We agree however on what needs to happen.”Like Trump, Jenrick will undoubtedly style himself as a man of the people, despite all evidence pointing in a different direction.Among his multiple propertiesare a £2.6m central London townhouse and a stately home: in 2020 he was accused of (but never prosecuted for)breaking lockdown rulesafter driving to the latter during the pandemic. The same year, he overruled civil servants to rush through a£1bn property dealbacked by Tory donor Richard Desmond, who had lobbied him to speed up the development to save him £40m in tax. The decision was later to befound to be unlawful. But adopting rightwing populism offers cynical aspiring demagogues protection from such scrutiny, which they present as a conspiracy to silence them.It’s easy to dismiss Robert Jenrick’s fare-dodging stunt. But he understands something Keir Starmer doesn’t | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreHere’s why a Jenrick leadership will be dangerous. Across the west, there is an obvious political direction: a drift towards rightwing authoritarianism. In Hungary, democracy was destroyed by Fidesz, a supposedly centre-right party and one-time member of the Liberal International, which radicalised in power. Its leader, Viktor Orbán – like Jenrick – wasa lawyer who was presented as a moderate. The Tory faction Jenrick once hailed from is largely gone, and the prevailing Conservative wisdom is that only by lurching rightwards can the Farageist threat be dispelled.Unlike Badenoch, who seems allergic to anything resembling a cut-through message, Jenrick will ruthlessly communicate his demagoguery, asthe latest videoofhimchasing after fare dodgers underlines. And here’s the big problem. Labour under Starmer has shown it will raid the policies and rhetoric of Farageism rather than offer an alternative to a broken economic model that is the key driver of disillusionment. When Jenrick has the top job, Britain will have two high-profile rightwing agitators spraying political discourse with incendiary rhetoric. Labour will respond by echoing their bile, legitimising a rightwing lurch rather than seeing it off. If – like the US – Britain falls into an authoritarian mire, then Jenrick’s cynical political manoeuvring may well accelerate the descent.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the public will want to see cheaper tickets tooTue 3 Jun 2025 13.49 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 16.08 EDTShareGovernment guidance documents rarely feature soaring prose to fire the imagination. But a recent Department for Transport policyupdatecontained one passage to lift the spirits of train users up and down the country. Setting out the future of Great British Railways (GBR), the public body that will oversee a renationalised and reintegrated rail network, its authors observe that “instead of having to navigate 14 separate train operators, passengers will once again simply be able to use ‘the railway’”.Last month, this journey back to the futurebeganas the first renationalised South Western Railway (SWR) service departed Woking for London Waterloo, complete with union jack branding and the logo “Great British Railways: coming soon”. The remaining nine private franchises will be back in public ownership by 2027, by which time a new GBR headquarters will be up and running in Derby. The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, hailed the moment as a new dawn. There can be little doubt that a reset is badly needed. Fragmentation, in the name of competition, was the original sin of the destructive and ideologicalprivatisationof the rail network in the 1990s. The wrongheaded decision to separate the management of track and trains led to confused accountability and buck-passing between train operators and Network Rail.Accompanying marketisation, and the restless search forprofit, inaugurated an era in which a baffling profusion of ticket types did little to mitigate the cost of travelling on the mostexpensivetrains in Europe. Poorperformanceby franchises such as Avanti West Coast and TransPennine Express (takenbackinto public ownership in 2023) undermined public confidence in an industry crucial to Britain’s green transition. A period ofdisastrousindustrial relations, and reduced passenger numbers since the pandemic, have compounded a sense of crisis.It would be foolish to hope for an instant turnaround. The future shape and finances of rail travel are still unclear, following the post-Covidcollapsein lucrative commuter and business travel. But having been constituted explicitly as a publicly run “guiding mind” for the whole network, carrying responsibility for both track and trains, GBR will have the power to rationalise its operations and place the interests of passengers first. A simpler, more joined-up ticketing system should be a priority.Somewhat bathetically, the optics of last month’s SWR launch were compromised by Sunday engineering works and the need for a rail replacement bus from Surbiton to London Waterloo. Some things never change. But though free-market dogmatists will have relished that hitch to proceedings, a large majority of the population stronglywelcomethe prospective return of a vital public good to public hands. Much of their support, however, is undoubtedly linked to a hope that GBR will do something to address the often prohibitive cost of travelling by rail in Britain. On the subject of cheaper tickets, Ms Alexander has been noticeably reticent,pointingto current subsidies of £2bn a year.Labour should think bigger. In the 1960s, Ms Alexander’s predecessor in the Department for Transport, Barbara Castle,pioneeredthe idea of a subsidised “social railway” in the wake of the deeply unpopular Beeching cuts. After a disruptive and demoralising period, a similar level of imagination is needed today for an industry that delivers crucial economic, environmental and societal benefits.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Poland’s new head of state will beKarol Nawrocki, a conservative historian endorsed byDonald Trump. Mr Nawrocki’s improbable rise – from relative obscurity to the presidency – signals the unfortunate entrenchment of nationalist grievance in Polish politics.He now stands poised to paralyse Mr Tusk’s agenda and perhaps derail Polish access toEuropeanfunds – using his presidential power of veto to block government legislation or simply relying on the influence of the conservative constitutional court. Key reforms –judicial overhaul, civil partnerships and abortion rights– are off the table. For a country that once dreamed of anchoring the EU’s eastern flank, it is a backward lurch.Mr Tusk’s government is a coalition born out of a determination to oust the nationalist-conservative Law and Justice party (PiS), which gained full control of government in 2015 and implemented sweeping changes to the judiciary, media andeducation. Clashes with Brussels overrule-of-law concernswere a feature of its time in office. However, Mr Tusk’s ideologically diverse alliance is fraying under the weight of its own contradictions. Bound more by opposition to the previous regime than a cohesive vision, the coalition hasstumbled, hindered by internal conflict between agrarian conservatives and urban progressives. It had hoped its liberalcandidatecould break the deadlock.As a historian, Mr Nawrocki will be familiar with PiS’s winning strategy. This mixes reactionary populism with a cultural reprogramming that seeks to rewrite Poland’s recent past to polarise opinion. The party aims to renarrate the country’s history with controversial interpretations of Poland’s role in theHolocaust, “decommunisation” and a left-soundingcritiqueof post-1989 economic liberalism.Mr Nawrockitriumphedby tapping conservative, rural and anti-elite sentiment, but also by posing as an outsider. A political novice and former head of a state historical institute, he carried no party baggage and could disavow past PiS failings while vowing to block Mr Tusk at every turn. His blend of historical populism andEuroscepticismstruck a chord in a Poland still wrestling with its past and wary of Brussels. Meanwhile, Mr Tusk’s popularity is eroding and his authority is weakening: the left calls him ineffective, the right accuses him of betrayal. His hope that voters would tolerate paralysis for the sake of stability has proven misplaced. With President Nawrocki in office until 2030, key reforms are blocked and a second term in 2027 looks unlikely. A resurgent PiS and rising far-rightConfederationthreaten to consolidate an illiberal majority.Mr Tusk may pursue secondary legislation to get his way. He is calling his allies’ bluff with aconfidence vote. However, unless the coalition proves it can govern, disillusionment will deepen. Poland’s economic success – rooted in EU funds, German supply chains and monetary sovereignty – has produced a paradoxical politics. AsJarosław Kuiszobserves in The New Politics of Poland, PiS took Brussels’ money while scorning its values. Mr Tusk must defend democracy not just with words but with outcomes. If pro-European governments cannot deliver tangible change, voters will fall for the empty authoritarian promises of certainty. To defeat the populist right, Europeans must prove that democracy works – not just in principle, but in people’s lives.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Stanway was withdrawn at half-time but Wiegman clarified that the 26-year-old had not suffered a setback, saying: On Stanway: “No [she does not have an injury], she’s in a very good place.“But she hasn’t played for such a long time – Friday’s were her first minutes after she’d been training, of course. She could play [only for] 45 minutes. I think she wanted to play more, of course, she always wants to play more, she’s in such a good place, but I think this was very smart [to substitute her] to take care of her.”Wiegman also paid tribute to Fran Kirby, after the Brighton forward’ssudden announcement of her retirement, adding: “First of all I love working with her [Kirby]. She has had an incredible career and it is still going on in the WSL.

The match, however, included a moment of jeopardy after he kicked a ball towards the back fence. It rebounded against the shoulder of an unflinching line judge. Musetti received a code violation warning for unsportsmanlike conduct.Swiatek sweeps past Svitolina to set up Sabalenka showdown at French OpenRead more“Honestly it was really unlucky coincidence,” said Musetti. “I was a little bit, honestly, scared, because I really didn’t want to harm nobody, of course. So I immediately went to the line umpire, and I of course said sorry. I apologise to everyone. It was right to have a warning, but I think the umpire saw that there was no intention about that, and that’s why he probably just let me continue my game.”Afterwards, Tiafoe described the ruling as “comical” and suggested that there are inconsistencies within the rules. There have been numerous examples of players being defaulted over the years for unintentionally hitting people with a tennis ball. Two years ago in Paris, the Japanese player Miyu Kato was disqualified from the women’s doubles tournament, along with her partner Aldila Sutjiadi, after unintentionally hitting a ballgirl.“Obviously he did that and nothing happened,” said Tiafoe. “I think that’s comical, but it is what it is. Nothing happened, so there’s nothing really to talk about. Obviously it’s not consistent, so it is what it is.”On the court, Musetti continues to enjoy a breakout run this year. After a career best 2024 season in which he reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon and won a singles bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, the 23-year-old Italian has taken another massive leap forward during this clay court season. He followed up his first Masters 1000 final in Monte Carlo by reaching the semi-finals in the Madrid Open, Italian Open and now at the French Open. He is just the fifth player since the ATP was formed in 1990 to reach the semi-finals or better at all three clay Masters 1000 events and the French Open in one year.Having accrued so many points in recent weeks, Musetti will rise from No 16 at the beginning of the clay court season to at least No 7 in the ATP rankings and he sits at No 5 in the live rankings. He could leapfrog Jack Draper to No 4 in the live rankings with a win.Musetti will rekindle his rivalry withCarlos Alcaraz, the defending champion, in the semi-finals after the Spaniard found his best level at last during his 6-0, 6-1, 6-4 demolition of Tommy Paul. Alcaraz has now reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros for the last three years.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz enjoyed a comfortable win over Tommy Paul.Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty ImagesAlcaraz had endured a complicated path to the quarter-finals, dropping a set in three of his four matches as his patience occasionally waned. Considering his wavering level, a quarter-final meeting with Paul was potentially dangerous. Paul is one of the best athletes on tour, behind Alcaraz himself, and he has made life hell for the Spaniard in the past with his own ability to seamlessly straddle defence and attack, as Alcaraz can.But Alcaraz appeared to have the ball on a string in the early stages of the match. He tore through the first set with a demonstration of spectacular, varied shotmaking and kept on going: “I could close my eyes and everything went in,” said Alcaraz. “My feelings today were unbelievable. I was starting to give every shot at my 100%.”While Alcaraz performed at an incredible level throughout, Paul understandably looked weary from early on. The American had been struggling with an abdominal issue from early in the tournament but he came through consecutive five set matches in the second and third rounds en route to the quarter-finals. Even in perfect health, however, he may not have had any response against a special, singular talent in full flow.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenTennisCarlos AlcaraznewsShareReuse this content"

With a barrage of boundaries from Jamie Smith and Ben Duckett the home side took control of a match that was delayed after the players got stuck in traffic, and then abbreviated by rain, before with an explosive cameo from Jos Buttler they sped to victory by seven wickets, with 62 balls to spare.The series thus ended as it started, with a one-sided victory. The match in between was much more competitive but this was a very different display from England, whose fielding was as sharp as it had been sloppy on Sunday, and in particular from their openers who in Cardiff had scored a combined total of nothing but here each reached rapid half-centuries.England cricketers forced into emergency travel plans before third West Indies ODIRead moreSmith might have travelled in by train, but as soon as he had a bat in his hand he was motoring, hammering 64 runs off just 28 balls, 46% of which went for boundaries. The first of them, it is true, came off the inside edge, but from there his bat seemed to be made entirely of middle. England rushed to 50 off just 28 legal deliveries – at this point Smith was on 41 and Duckett on three – and by the end of an abbreviated, eight‑over powerplay they had already scored 100.Harry Brook of Smith: “He’s gone out and played extremely well, but he’s not a slogger, is he? He’s playing proper shots, and he’s putting them under immense pressure. We want batters that can put their best bowlers under pressure, manipulate the field, and score big runs. He did that today.”There was just a little bit of luck along the way, and Smith was dropped at midwicket by Jayden Greaves off the first ball of Gudakesh Motie’s opening over, Motie having himself dropped Duckett moments earlier. The bowler gained revenge by dismissing Smith with the final ball of the same over, though the four in between had disappeared for 20.By this point England, having come in needing 6.15 an over, had whittled the required run rate down to something only marginally less pedestrian than some players’ journeys to the ground, and when Duckett ended an excellent over from Roston Chase by spearing to cover having by then scored a 46‑ball 58 they were most of the way there. Brook was also dropped in what, but for the efforts of a couple of batters, was a dismal West Indies performance, before Buttler’s firecracker 41 – 32 of those from boundaries – took England over the line.View image in fullscreenSherfane Rutherford hit an explosive 70 for West Indies.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockGiven their late arrival at the ground it was perhaps understandable that some of West Indies’ batters looked underprepared as the game got under way, and both Shai Hope and Chase lasted only one ball – the latter falling to his first delivery for the second time in three days.They were not helped by England’s excellence in the field, and this time the only catch that did not stick was by Brydon Carse, sprinting to his left on the square‑leg boundary, though even if he had somehow clung on to Sherfane Rutherford’s mighty blow his momentum would have carried him beyond the rope.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Coming in with the West Indies innings almost as troubled as their journey to the ground, he took only two balls to get his eye in, before hitting his next two for four to slide smoothly into gear.The 26-year-old ended with 70 off 71, very slightly reducing his average in a format in which he has scored six fifties and a century in just 11 innings to 70.87. “He’s like a video game player,” Hope said. “He’s been scoring runs for fun.”With Motie contributing 63 off 54 and Alzarri Joseph adding a handy 41, West Indies recovered from 28 for three and 154 for seven to post 251, adjusted under the DLS method to leave England with a target of 246 and 40 overs to do it. It felt just about defendable, until England’s openers got to work.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Reaching thePremier Leagueis the ultimate ambition for clubs in the second tier, but staying there is becoming increasingly difficult. The gap between the top flight and Championship is widening with each passing season. When the three promoted clubs – Luton, Burnley and Sheffield United – went straight back down last year it seemed like a quirk, something that had only happened once before in the history of English football, in the 1997-98 season. But now it feels like a trend.Southampton, Leicester and Ipswich have gone down without putting up much of a fight; they picked up just 59 points between them, down on the already paltry total of 66 points that Luton, Burnley and Sheffield United won the season before as they slipped back to theChampionship. To put that in some context, the promoted teams won 100 points a decade ago and 151 two decades ago. The “battle” to avoid relegation this season was settled with four games to play – the earliest in Premier League history – and the best of the promoted teams, Leicester, finished 13 points adrift of the team in 17th, the biggest gap between relegation and safety in the history of the league.The challenge for Leeds, Burnley andSunderlandis a big one – and the stakes are high. Luton, relegated from the top flight just a year ago, are now preparing to play in League One. The message is clear: the Premier League is only the promised land if you stay there. So how do the three teams coming up avoid suffering the same fate?Southampton were doomed from the beginning as Russell Martin refused to budge on his principles. The manager had guided Saints to the Premier League by playing dominant, attacking football. They secured promotion while having more possession (65.6%) than any other team in the Championship. However, the Premier League is a whole different level. When you’re conceding goal after goal by trying to pass the ball out from the back, it’s worth admitting that pragmatism, not idealism, is what keeps teams afloat.View image in fullscreenSouthampton fans give their view on Russell Martin.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersMartin’s refusal to adapt his tactics ended in tears. His record in the Premier League was awful: one win and 13 defeats in his 16 games in charge, with the team conceding 36 goals and scoring just 11. The decision to pull the trigger on Martin came too late to give them a real chance of consolidating a Premier League spot.By appointing Ivan Juric, a manager whose approach is the polar opposite of Martin’s, the club was essentially admitting defeat in their bid to outplay opponents. But changing a team’s whole style midway through the campaign is easier said than done. Juric took over a side that had been coached to play a completely different way for the previous 18 months, and it showed. The former Roma manager (who had been sacked by them after just 12 games earlier in the season) picked up 0.29 points per game at Southampton, one of the worst records in Premier League history.By contrast, Leicester chose to sack Steve Cooper far earlier than many expected. Cooper wasn’t a popular appointment in the first place given his Nottingham Forest roots, but he was sacked with the club in 16th and having claimed commendable results against Tottenham, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth. They brought in Ruud van Nistelrooy, quickly dropped into the relegation zone and went on to set a new record English football for losing eight home games in a row without scoring a goal. The grass isn’t always greener.Premier League 2024-25 season review: our predictions versus realityRead moreTiming, then, is vital if clubs are looking to change their manager. Getting it wrong can prove costly. The same can be said of recruitment. The Premier League is a far more physically and technically demanding league than the Championship. The temptation can be to assemble a bigger squad to cope with the demands of playing tougher opponents but the signings need to be of the right profile.Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester all suffered due to a lack of experience in their squads, especially in defence. Indeed, Southampton’s biggest signing last summer was the centre-back Taylor Harwood-Bellis. He may have a great future ahead of him but, at 22 years of age with no Premier League experience, he wasn’t the experienced head they needed in their backline.Ipswich invested in centre-backs Jacob Greaves and Dara O’Shea, two standout performers in the Championship, but they did not have the calibre to keep the club afloat in the top flight. Factor in the questionable decision to sign Arijanet Muric, a goalkeeper whose limitations had been exposed the previous campaign atBurnley, and it was always going to be an uphill struggle. If you are going to revamp the most important part of your team – the centre of your defence – find experienced players who can cope at Premier League level.View image in fullscreenIpswich goalkeeper Arijanet Muric concedes against Southampton.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersLeicester also failed to sort out their defence before the season. They only signed two defenders this season. Caleb Okoli was restricted to just 12 league starts due to injury, which was unfortunate, but their other signing, Woyo Coulibaly, did not arrive at the club until January. They needed to act decisively last summer. The promoted clubs have smaller budgets but it’s no wonder they conceded so many goals – 248 between them.So here are three key pieces of advice for Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland: their managers need to adapt their principles to beat the drop; the clubs should make early and realistic decisions about sacking their managers; and they have to ensure that they recruit to a Premier League standard, focusing on quality over quantity.Daniel Farke and Scott Parker should have learned a lot from their previous experiences in the top flight but Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland need to get their acts together quickly if we are to avoid seeing the three promoted sides succumb to relegation for the third year running.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsFootballGuardian Sport NetworkPremier LeagueSouthamptonLeicester CityIpswich TownLeeds UnitedSunderlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As I’ve always said, I would be willing to do it if United thought it was best to move on.“I spoke with Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it. I spoke to the club, who said they weren’t willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave. From my side, it was a very ambitious proposal, the president was a fantastic person.

Worldwide, at least 12 professional sides have gone out of business in recent years. It is just a shame about the rest of it, which has more holes than Newcastle’s defence.R360 is brought to us by the team ofMike Tindall, Stuart Hooper, whose management career at Bath was one seven‑year lesson in the Peter Principle that organisations tend to promote people to the point of their incompetence, player agent Mark Spoors and John Loffhagen, who had a 13-month spell as the chief legal adviser for LIV golf.England set to face Fiji, South Africa and Argentina in inaugural Nations Championship matchesRead moreTheir idea is to create two superclub competitions, one between eight male sides, one between four female sides, which would sit above the club structure. They would compete in a 16-match season in two windows from April to June and then August to September, with rounds taking place in a different city each week.The words are cheap, but what they are promising sounds very expensive. They say they want to hire the 360 best players in the world on double their salaries, mention São Paulo, Barcelona, New York and Los Angeles as potential venues and plan to run “a week of live events”, including gigs before every game. Investors from the Premier League, F1 and the NFL are said to have “expressed interest”, and “dozens” of players have apparently signed letters of intent. All of which will be good for nothing but hamster bedding unless the organisers can fulfil their end of the deal and raise all the necessary capital by September.There is (there always is) a lot of ready talk about emulating the runaway success of the Indian Premier League, which is built on the support of the largest single-sport market on the planet, and LIV golf, a competition launched by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund as a screw‑you to the PGA Tour after it refused to allow their players to compete in the existing tournaments. It is amazing what you can do when you have a billion fans with no worthwhile domestic competition to watch or the backing of a trillion‑dollar petrochemical fund run by a man with a grudge.View image in fullscreenMike Tindall is part of the group behind R360.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAWhat rugby does have, according toa Nielsen report from 2021, is 800 million supporters worldwide. That is 800 milllion supporters who like the game more or less the way it is and don’t necessarily want to tune in to a match between two newly minted teams designed by committee, see their favourite players creamed off from club rugby by a rival competition or ruled out of the next Test because they are playing in a domestic game that clashes with southern hemisphere internationals scheduled to take place in the August‑September window.That is if anyone who makes the hop across to the new competition is even allowed to carry on playing for their country. Right now, anyone who signs up would probably be ineligible to play for England unless the “exceptional circumstances” clause was triggered. That won’t happen unless World Rugby votes in favour of the enterprise and that won’t happen unless the unions are on board and all the anti‑doping and insurance regulation issues are resolved (all of which, you can be sure, would happen surprisingly quickly if R360 can persuade PIF to spend a few of its spare billions on all this).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In May last year,Tindall talked it all throughwith his former Gloucester teammate Mark Foster, who went on to become an executive at LIV, on an episode of his podcast The Good, the Bad and the Rugby. Tindall’s main complaint is that rugby is not extracting enough money from its fans. Foster explains that a new business model could conceivably involve charging £75 a ticket, and “£100 a day easy on food and beverages” so by the time you have bought your new team jersey “everyone there is spending £300 to £500” at the match.It’s worth a listen, not least because they say so much right about what is wrong with the game. Tindall absolutely has a point when he says that piecemeal change, when repeated tweaks are made to the existing game, have not worked and that something more radical thanthe Club World Cupis needed. But he has a long way to go, and a lot of money to find, to begin to persuade anyone this is it. You do not need to be a medical expert to know someone is sick, but it sure helps to be one when you’re trying to find a cure.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionLIV Golf SeriesSaudi Arabia and sportMike TindallcommentShareReuse this content"

Hamas-affiliated media also carried the reports.The United Nations’ human rights chief, Volker Türk, described the “deadly attacks” on civilians around food distribution as a war crime.“Deadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid inGazaare unconscionable,” Türk said. “Attacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.”Map“There were three children and two women among the dead,” Mohammed Saqr, the head of nursing at Nasser hospital, which received the 27 bodies, told the Guardian. “Most of the patients had gunshot wounds, others had shrapnel all over the bodies, which means they were targeted with tanks or artillery munitions.”Doctors at Nasser hospital said the Israeli forces had mostly targeted the heads, the chest and the upper parts of the bodies of the victims, and that the health facility was running out of blood units and medical supplies.Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, confirmed its field hospital in Rafah had received 184 wounded people, 19 of whom were declared dead on arrival. Eight more later died from their wounds.A video circulating on social media documented the arrival of injured people at the Red Cross hospital from a food distribution point in Gaza’s Rafah governorate. It showed dead bodies and the injured being dragged by people inside the health facility.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing “a number of suspects moving towards them”.“The forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces.“The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,” the military said, without specifying who the suspects were.View image in fullscreenRelatives mourn outside Nasser hospital in Khan Younis.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesA spokesperson for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israeli-backed organisation that has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza, told the Associated Press the group ‘‘was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”.Witnesses told the Guardian the shooting started in the city’s Flag Roundabout area, about 1km (0.6 miles) away from the food distribution hub.Fadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the aid site.‘‘When gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,’’ he said. ‘‘He was supposed to get married next month.’’‘‘Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren’t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger,’’ said Fadi.View image in fullscreenPalestinians carry bags away from the distribution site on Tuesday.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APAhmad al-Shaer, 22, who went to the aid distribution point with his friend Hasni Abu Shanab, 35, said the gunfire started at about 5am. “When the shooting began, Hasni lay flat on the ground to avoid the bullets, but even then a bullet hit him, it pierced one of his legs, exited, and then penetrated the other leg, where it lodged. The gunfire was coming from all directions and bullets were falling everywhere around him,” he said.Shaer said Abu Shanab was moved to Nasser hospital and that the facility was “full of people in critical condition. There aren’t enough beds, rooms or medical equipment for all the cases.”He added: “Hasni went to the aid site because he had no other choice. He was desperate to feed his three children. He had nothing to offer them and couldn’t meet their basic needs.”View image in fullscreenEleven-month-old Zakaria el-Mabhuh, one of hundreds of children diagnosed with malnutrition, as Israel’s ongoing air and ground operations, coupled with the closure of border crossings, have led to a worsening food crisis.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesTamer Nassar, 33, from Beit Hanoun, who has been displaced to al-Mawasi in Khan Younis said: “I went at dawn to the American food aid distribution point in Rafah. The gunfire suddenly and deliberately erupted at everyone present in the distribution area. Bullets were raining down on us from everywhere: from the sea, from the air, from the hills, from all directions. I was a victim, along with many others around me; some were injured, others were killed.“I raised my shoulder while trying to lie on my stomach, and that’s when the first bullet struck my shoulder,” he said. “Anyone who tried to help the wounded was also shot at. We decided to go there today despite the extreme danger. If we had food at home to silence our children’s hunger, we wouldn’t have gone and risked our lives. They took images of my injuries and found that the first bullet had entered and exited, but the second one remained lodged in the bone and shattered it.”Public support for Israel in western Europe at lowest ever recorded by YouGovRead moreThe shootings follow other similar incidents recently in which Palestinians have been killed and injured by Israeli fire as they sought food at newly established distribution points.Last Wednesday,Hamas accused Israel of killing at least three Palestiniansand wounding 46 others near one of the GHF distribution sites. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound to re-establish control as thousands of Palestinians rushed to the site.More than30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire on Sundayas they went to receive food at a GHF distribution point, according to witnesses. A hospital run by the Red Cross confirmed it treated many wounded.The Israeli forces denied “firing at civilians” in Sunday’s incident. However, an IDF official admitted that Israeli soldiers fired “warning shots toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops”, near the food distribution site, without specifying who the suspects were.Gaza’s Government Media Office said Israel had killed more than 102 civilians since the opening of the of aid centres run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.The GHF took over the handling of aid despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, who criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaHamasIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Those reports note that the navy secretary, John Phelan, was instructed to strip the ship of its name by Hegseth.The timing of the announcement, which comes during Pride month, was reportedly intentional.The renaming is being done to ensure “alignment with president and SECDEF objectives and SECNAV priorities of reestablishing the warrior culture”, referring to Donald Trump, Hegseth and Phelan, according to the memorandum.The decision to rename the ship will be publicized on 13 June, according to Military.comThe Guardian has contacted the defense department for comment.The vessel was initially named after Milk in 2016 during the Barack Obama administration. Milk was a prominent gay rights activist who served in the US navy during the Korean war. He later went on to run for office in California where he won a seat on the San Francisco board of supervisors. As one of the US’s first openly gay politicians, Milk became aforefront figureof the gay rights movement across the country before hisassassinationin 1978 by a former city supervisor.In addition to renaming the USNS Harvey Milk, the defense department plans to rename other vessels that have been given names of various icons throughout American history.Documents reviewed by CBS showed that vessels on the US navy’s “recommended list” include USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, USNS Harriet Tubman, USNS Dolores Huerta, USNS Lucy Stone, USNS Cesar Chavez and USNS Medgar Evers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The names of those who fought for civil rights and human rights bring luster to these ships – as their leadership brought luster to America.”She went on to say: “The reported decision by the Trump administration to change the names of the USNS Harvey Milk and other ships in the John Lewis-class is a shameful, vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American dream. Our military is the most powerful in the world – but this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the ‘warrior’ ethos. Instead, it is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryPete HegsethLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Remaining ministers will stay on in a caretaker capacity until new elections, most likely in October.“We have decided that there is now insufficient support for this government,” Schoof told reporters in The Hague after an emergency cabinet meeting, adding that he considered Wilders’s decision “irresponsible and unnecessary”.Wilders, whose populist, anti-Islam Freedom party (PVV)finished as the largest in parliament in the last election, said he would “fight the coming elections to make the PVV even stronger” and “with the aim of becoming prime minister next time”.The far-right leader had said earlier on Tuesday that all his party’s ministers would quit the government after the other three partners in the four-party coalition had rejected his radical proposals on immigration.“I signed up for the toughest asylum policy, not the downfall of theNetherlands,” he said. He had warned last week that if his plans were not adopted, the PVV – the largest party in parliament, with 37 seats – would be “out of the cabinet”.Wilders’ announcement followed a brief meeting of the already fractious and fragile coalition – the first to include the PVV – which consistently struggled to reach a consensus after being sworn in last July.The coalition between the PVV, the populist Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB), centrist New Social Contract (NSC) and liberal-conservative VVD took nearly six months to form and was repeatedly undermined by Wilders, who was not a cabinet member.He wanted it to adopt a 10-point plan aimed at radically reducing immigration and asylum, including enlisting the army to secure and patrol the borders, turning all asylum seekers back at the border and closing refugee accommodation facilities.Wilders also proposed sending all Syrian refugees home, suspending EU asylum quotas and banning family members joining refugees already in the country. Legal experts have said several of the proposals breached European human rights laws or the UN refugee convention, to which the Netherlands is a signatory.Remaining coalition partners reacted with anger and disbelief to Wilders’s decision. Dilan Yeşilgöz, the VVD leader, said Schoof had appealed to the four party leaders to act responsibly before Tuesday’s meeting.“He said we are facing enormous international challenges, we have a war on our continent, an economic crisis may be coming our way,” Yeşilgöz said, adding that she was “shocked” by Wilders’s decision, which she called “super-irresponsible”.Yeşilgöz added of the far-right leader: “We had a rightwing majority and he lets it all go, for his ego. He’s just doing what he wants … This is making us look like fools. He’s running away, at a time of unprecedented uncertainty.”Caroline van der Plas of the BBB said she was extremely angry, adding: “He is not putting the Netherlands first, he is putting Geert Wilders first.” Nicolien van Vroonhoven of the NSC said the move was “incredible and incomprehensible”.The remaining coalition members could in theory have tried to stay on as a minority administration, but most favoured snap elections. “The country needs clarity and a strong government,” Yeşilgöz said. “Elections must be held soon.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The party is polling at about 20%, roughly level with the Labour/Green alliance that is currently the second-largest in parliament.It is not the first time that Wilders – a polemicist who has spent years in opposition, has a conviction for discrimination and managed to strike a coalition deal only after abandoning his effort to become prime minister – has turned his back on power.In 2010 he pledged support to a minority government led by the former prime minister Mark Rutte, but walked away from the confidence and supply arrangement less than two years later after a dispute over government austerity measures.“You know that if you work with Wilders in a coalition … it won’t go well,” Rob Jetten, the leader of the opposition liberal D66 party, told the public broadcaster NOS. “If it hadn’t happened today, it would have happened sometime in the next few weeks.”Jetten said the government had been unable to take many decisions because it was prey to too many “rows and crises”, adding that the other three coalition parties had been taken “hostage” by Wilders.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsEuropeGeert WildersThe far rightMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He said he would not forget the duty of a president to unite the people.Lee, a 61-year-old former human rights lawyer who had made two failed attempts to become president, rode a wave of public anger that followed Yoon’s declaration of martial law in early December.The order, which was overturned in a matter of hours, sparked South Korea’sbiggest political crisis in decades. The country is also battling an economic downturn, income inequality and doubts over the US’s commitment to its security under Donald Trump.Kim, however, struggled to win over moderate swing voters while his People Power party feuded over how to view Yoon’s legacy.As South Korea heads to the polls, can Lee Jae-myung bring the country back from the brink?Read moreTurnout was high, at 77.8% an hour before the polls closed, surpassing the figure recorded in the previous presidential election in 2022, according to the national election commission. More than a third of the 44.39 million eligible voters had cast their ballots in early voting last Thursday and Friday.Some South Koreans view the election, called after the constitutional courtupheld Yoon’s impeachmentin early April, as evidence that their democracy is in good health. In a Facebook message on Tuesday, Lee had cast the election as voters’ opportunity to “save South Korea, which is in crisis due to the greed of the establishment”.But the division unleashed by Yoon is expected to follow Lee into his single five-year term, which begins on Wednesday without the traditional two-month transition period.Large crowds have taken to the streets in recent months todenounceor support Yoon, whose suspension, and then removal, left a leadership vacuum that shook the country’s diplomatic activities and financial markets.“The economy has gotten so much worse since December … Not just for me but I hear that from everybody,” said Kim Kwang-ma, an 81-year-old voter. “And we as a people have become so polarised … I wish we could come together so that Korea can develop again.”Lee Jae-myung: from child labourer to leader of deeply scarred South KoreaRead moreLee, a frontrunner since the start of the campaign, will face several major challenges, including a slowing economy, Trump’s trade war and the nuclear threat posed by North Korea.View image in fullscreenLee Jae-myung on the campaign trail.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn his final campaign speeches on Monday, Lee promised to revitalise the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions.Kim, a former labour minister under Yoon, warned that a victorious Lee would abuse his powers to retaliate against his political opponents and use his party’s majority in the national assembly to protect him in several court cases that will resume after the election.Lee “is now trying to seize all power inSouth Koreaand establish a Hitler-like dictatorship”, Kim told a rally in the south-eastern city of Busan.Lee, who headed the opposition-led campaign to oust Yoon, is a highly divisive figure in South Korean politics. He faces criminal trials including charges of bribery and alleged involvement in a property development scandal.Courts agreed to postpone further hearings of continuing trials until after the election, allowing him to contest the presidency while the cases remained unresolved. Lee denies all charges, describing them as politically motivated persecution.Lee, who grew up in a poor household and worked in factories as a child, has shown a more cautious side in recent speeches, despite his reputation as a radical reformer determined to take on the country’s conservative establishment.He has promised to be pragmatic in foreign affairs, committing himself to South Korea’s alliance with the US and vowing to continue Seoul’s partnership with Washington and Tokyo, mirroring the policies of his conservative predecessor.But he wants to move away from Yoon’s confrontational approach towards North Korea and re-engage with the South’s nuclear-armed neighbour. He has conceded, though, that it will be “very difficult” to quickly resume summits with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificYoon Suk YeolLee Jae-myungnewsShareReuse this content"

Dasgupta’s hard-headed number crunching showed that when nature is in decline, there is a financial as well as an environmental deficit.Fast forward to 2025, and Labour has promised to build 1.5m new homes by the end of the parliament and is already behind schedule. An expanding population and a reliance on private housebuilders, which drip feed homes into the market to maintain high prices, has left the UK with a significant shortage.Last year there was an estimated shortfall of 2.5m homes, despite there being 1.4m plots already with planning permission. And while some local authorities have insisted that developers include parks and tree planting in their schemes, along with a high percentage of affordable homes, they complain that appeals by developers to the secretary of state for relief from these responsibilities are often successful.But as the Labour government moves ahead with a planning and infrastructure bill designed to promote growth, there are understandable fears the landmark report has been sidelined. Nature loss in the UK has been significant over many decades, but Labour’s message in the bill is that the developer knows best, and other considerations can take a back seat.It’s why the National Trust has warned the bill is a “licence to kill nature” and the Office for Environmental Protection has advised the government that it is a “regression” in environmental law.Housingprojects that protect natural habitats, include public transport and divert wastewater from running into local watercourses are deemed too expensive. Current planning rules already allow developers, in almost all cases, to “value engineer” these elements out of the design.Traditional economic thinking is partly to blame. It excludes the world’s natural resources except when they are dug up or chopped down and become raw materials for various manufacturing industries.Dasgupta sought to change this, providing a way for economists to put a value on nature and calculate whether the type of growth in the economy enhanced or destroyed a broader definition of national wealth.Since 2021, he has been liaising with the Office for National Statistics to produce an alternative to gross domestic product (GDP). Currently, when governments consider how much economic progress they have made in the previous year they use GDP, which adds up the income from buying and selling goods in the public and private sectors to give a measure of national output. This single figure is Rachel Reeves’s guiding light.But the problem with it from an environmental perspective is that GDP includes lots of bad stuff, as well as what we might describe as progress. It calculates oil extraction in the North Sea without considering the implications for emissions and global heating, and classes peat extraction and the paving over of previously wooded land as adding to GDP without any negative cost.Dasgupta’s report found that between 1990 and 2014, the UK’s “produced capital” (including manufactured goods and built infrastructure) rose by a fifth but, in the same period, its stock of “natural capital” declined by 30%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The question hangs over the chancellor as to whether she is on board.Reeves recently waded into the controversy overa bat tunnelstraddling the HS2 train link from London to Birmingham to say that never again should the protection of bats hold up important infrastructure projects. Keir Starmer vowed to take on “the nimbys” by reducing legal challenges to infrastructure building – with a new approach stopping “newts and bats” from blocking construction.That could spell more trouble for the natural environment, not less.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentEconomic growth (GDP)HousingRachel ReevesEconomicsBiodiversityWildlifeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Lodge Hill, Kent – the best place for nightingales in BritainThe best site in Britain for the endangered nightingale, Lodge Hill was made a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) in 2013. But the following year it was earmarked for 5,000 new homes –the biggest attempt to build on an SSSI in Englandsince the wildlife laws of 1981 came into force.View image in fullscreenA nightingale in Lodge Hill, Kent.Photograph: David Tipling Photo Library/AlamyAfter widespread protests from ecologists and nature charities, Homes England withdrew its plans and said it would develop just 500 houses on the former MoD land, outside the SSSI.The scrubby, song-filled paradise of dense woodland and grassland is renowned for its bat roosts, exceptional reptile population, rare butterflies, flowers and three species of owl. But in an area under huge housing pressure, the site that was once used for bomb disposal training and is classified as “brownfield” is likely to be targeted for development once more.2. Tipner West, Portsmouth – internationally important tidal wetlandThe mudflats and coastal meadows of Tipner West are an internationally important place for waders such as black-tailed godwit and dunlin, as well as a wealth of intertidal marine life. As part of Portsmouth harbour and the wider Solent, it is home to 30% of Britain’s overwintering population of brent geese. The area is protected not only as a SSSI but also a special protection area (SPA) andRamsarsite – the highest tier of protection.View image in fullscreenBrent geese at Portsmouth harbour, Hampshire.Photograph: Mike Walker/AlamyHowever, in 2019, Portsmouth city council proposed a “super peninsula” on the site – a large-scale land reclamation project for housing that would have destroyed vast swathes of habitat. After 24,000 people objected, the council withdrew that plan but has continued to push for land reclamation and housebuilding that jeopardises vital intertidal habitats.Under current laws, SPAs and Ramsar sites can be built on only if there are “imperative reasons of overriding public interest” and no feasible alternatives. If building went ahead, the council would also have to create new mudflats and coastal meadows on a significantly greater scale than the area damaged. Such a high bar has never been hurdled by mere housing, and this springthe government rejected the council’s request. The council is now exploring how it can continue its development plans.Sources say housing minister Matthew Pennycook is interested in Tipner West being one of the first developments to happen if the planning bill goes through, when the council will be able to pay into a nature restoration fund and no longer obliged to provide alternative habitats nearby.3. Humber estuary, Yorkshire – vast home to nine internationally important bird speciesThe Humber estuary has almost every conservation protection going – SPA, SAC, SSSI – while also being a major shipping channel. Remarkably, it’s alsoresponsible for 20% of all surface drainagein the UK. The habitats regulations have helped protect its natural functioning for decades, ensuring that docks expansions and sea defence projects don’t destroy vital mudflats, sand flats and salt marsh for overwintering birds and declining breeding species such as little terns.Spurn Point, Yorkshire’s own Land’s End, is a hugely popular national nature reserve whose visitors contribute to the local economy.View image in fullscreenKnot in flight over the Humber estuary at Spurn Point, East Yorkshire.Photograph: DP Wildlife Vertebrates/AlamyPlanning reforms could disruptthe partnership between port, business and housing intereststhat has enabled economic development alongside wildlife protection. Further south, the similarly important Wash estuary isthreatened by a tidal barrage proposalwhich says it has funding to pursue adevelopment consent order.4. Thetford, Norfolk – unique heathland, rich in birds, flowers and invertebratesThetford, a rapidly growing town of 25,000 with a 5,000-home urban extension under way, is surrounded by SSSIs, special areas of conservation (SACs) and the Brecks SPA. This unique region of sandy heaths and dry grassland is home to 72 species found nowhere else in Britain. It is of European-wide importance for rare plants, invertebrates and birds including curlew, nightjar, woodlark and stone curlew. Rare and declining species here include turtle dove, goshawk, long-eared owl and lesser spotted woodpecker.View image in fullscreenThetford Forest, Norfolk at dawn.Photograph: Chris Herring/AlamyBirds such as nightjar and woodlarkoccur at lower densities in areas surrounded by housing, while heaths close to urban areas suffer from increased fire risk, trampling, disturbance by dog walkers, water pollution from dog fouling, and air pollution from road traffic. At the moment, there areprotection zones for the stone curlewswith no development permitted within 1,500m of a nesting site. Thanks partly to this protection,populations have increased.Under the new planning bill, however, developers can disregard such protections if they pay into a new nature restoration fund. Anecological assessment of Thetford’s local plansaid “the proximity of the Breckland European site’s boundary to the edge of the town in most directions remains a fundamental issue to overcome” before further homes can be built.5. Wolborough Fen, Devon – an ancient wetland and urban oasisA vulnerable wetland SSSI, theWolborough Fen nature reserveis home to emperor dragonfly, sphagnum moss and 30 species of bird. It sits beside a major development of1,200 new homes on the edge of Newton Abbot, which is earmarked to take a huge chunk of new homes planned for the region. Devon Wildlife Trust has warned a new road could jeopardise the wetland. A tranche of the development, for 150 homes, was rejected by planners in December because of concerns about damage to the wetland.View image in fullscreenAn emperor dragonfly laying its eggs.Photograph: Jason Hornblow/AlamyPolice were called in April when residents accused developer Vistry Homes of breaching the restrictions on its planning approvals. Local people blocked the bulldozers digging close to the nature reserve andthe council issued a stop notice to halt the work. Kate Van Dike of Wolborough Residents Association and campaign group Newton Says No said: “There was no feeling of trespass, just a united sense of [people] having the courage of their convictions.“The residents will continue to highlight unlawful acts by developers and call out any abdication of responsibility from the local planning authority who have a fundamental duty to protect an ancient and precious woodland, a hidden gem that is rare in the UK, with some species that can be found in only a few other sites in Europe.”6. Sittingbourne, Kent – irreplaceable ancient woodlandsJust 2.5% of Britain’s ancient woodland – land continuously wooded since 1600 – survives. It represents an irreplaceable combination of veteran trees, undisturbed soils, fungal networks and rare flora. Two separate applications by Quinn Estates for 8,400 new homes, a hotel, rubbish tip, relief road and primary and secondary schools are subject to a planning hearing after Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, “called in” proposals hours before they were set to be rejected by Swale borough council last November.View image in fullscreenWoodland in Sittingbourne, Kent.Photograph: Kent Wildlife TrustAccording to Kent Wildlife Trust and the Woodland Trust,the plans entail the direct loss of ancient woodland, local wildlife sites and priority habitatsincluding species-rich hedgerows and traditional Kentish orchards. The developments will also place indirect pressure – from pollution and people – on nearby Cromers Wood and Tonge Mill country park.Vulnerable species that would be directly affected include water vole, otter, yellowhammer, corn bunting, grey partridge and the critically endangered turtle dove. More than 700 local people have objected to the plans, which could sail through under the new legislation.7. Surrey Heaths – home to rare ground-nesting birdsVast swathes of nature-rich heathland have been lost to housing over recent decades, because it is relatively cheap land and easy to build on. The surviving fragments of the Surrey Heaths – including Colony Bog and Bagshot Heath, Ash to Brookwood Heaths and Chobham Common – have historically been protected as SSSIs. They are part of the Thames Basin SPA, protected by the habitats regulations, which seeks to maintain internationally important bird populations of nightjar, woodlark and Dartford warbler. All of these species nest on or close to the ground and so are highly vulnerable to people-pressure, especially from dog – walkers.View image in fullscreenBog asphodel on Thursley Common, Surrey.Photograph: Steve Taylor ARPS/AlamyUnder current planning laws, new homes close to vulnerable wildlife sites must provide suitable natural green space nearby so new residents don’t disturb those sites. Under the new bill, developers will be able to pay to create such green spaces further away – potentially in other counties. Even if wildlife sites are not built on, this risks creating more disturbance leading to local extinctions of vulnerable species.Becky Pullinger, head of land use planning at theWildlifeTrusts, said: “Places like the New Forest and the Surrey Heaths could be threatened by development that no longer has to avoid harm to those specific sites. On the Surrey Heaths, the clear impact the development can have is more people walking their dogs which can impact on birds in the area.8. Dibden Bay, Hampshire – important wetland for wildfowl and invertebratesPlans to hugely expand Southampton’s container port and reclaim land on the New Forest side of Southampton Water were first rejected back in 2004. Doubling the capacity of the port would destroy grazing marshes and mudflats that provide nesting for lapwing and winter homes for 50,000 birds such as wigeon and pintail.View image in fullscreenHeathland at Dibden Bay on the River Test in Southampton Water which the ABP wants to reclaim for a container port.Photograph: Roger BamberThe area is an SPA and contains several SSSIs, with Dibden Bay designated for its nationally important collection of invertebrates including 21 nationally rare species. The plans for a 1.85km-long deep quay would have destroyed 76 hectares (188 acres) of tidal foreshore designated as of international importance for birds. Associated roads would also threaten the New Forest national park.After being called in by the government, the then transport minister, Tony McNulty, acceptedthe planning inspector’s recommendation to reject the proposalsafter a 13-month inquiry. In 2023, owners Associated British Ports refused to rule out another attempt to develop the 500-acre site but said any new planning application was “many years away”. Under the new bill, mitigating for irreparable damage to protected sites caused by major infrastructure would become much simpler, making schemes such as Dibden Bay much more viable.9. Wensum Woodlands, Norfolk – site of a super-colony of barbastelle batsA mosaic of woodlands that is home toa super-colony of rare barbastelle bats, the Wensum Woodlands has long been threatened by a 3.8-mile dual carriageway that would complete a third ring-road around Norwich. A series of connected colonies, including one of more than 105 barbastelles, live either on the route or close to the proposed road. The area is being considered for designation as a SSSI by Natural England, which has previously designated sites with just 20 or 30 colonies.View image in fullscreenBarbastelle bat, such as the ones found in Norfolk.Photograph: Nature Photographers Ltd/AlamyIn 2023, the government committed to paying for 80% of the road scheme, but cash-strapped Norfolk county council announced this year that Natural England’s advice on the wildlife impacts meantit could not proceed with the £274m road, and withdrew its application. Landowners and developers have strongly pushed for the road, which they say will “unlock” land for businesses and housing. The planning and infrastructure bill is likely to revive many such “zombie” road projects.10. Swanscombe Peninsula, Kent – a globally important place for rare invertebratesEarlier this year, Keir Starmer claimed that plans for 15,000 new homes in Ebbsfleet had been stymied by the discovery of the raredistinguished jumping spider, and blocked by Natural England. “It’s nonsense, and we’ll stop it,” said the prime minister. In fact, the prime minister was talking nonsense: the vast majority of the 15,000 homes are being built, but1,300 homes planned for Swanscombe Peninsulahave been blocked. The peninsula – a portion of land on the fringe of the Ebbsfleet garden city project – wasdesignated a SSSI by Natural England in 2021because of its globally important collection of rare invertebrates.View image in fullscreenWalkers on Swanscombe Peninsula, Kent.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianNearly 2,000 species have been found at Swanscombe, making it one of the most biodiverse places in Britain. The existing planning regime has enabled a compromise, with thousands of new homes being built and the relatively modest SSSI protected. Under the planning bill, even SSSIs could be built upon in exchange for developers paying into the nature restoration fund, administered by Natural England which is both the executor and beneficiary of such schemes.Explore more on these topicsBiodiversityEndangered habitatsPlanning policyEnglandConservationWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They thrive in different ways depending on sunlight, nutrients and water temperature, factors that scientists are currently studying, Barnes said.Experts have also said that agricultural runoff, warming waters and changes in wind, current and rain could have an effect.While large clumps of algae in the open ocean are what Barnes called a “healthy, happy ecosystem” for creatures ranging from tiny shrimp to endangered sea turtles, sargassum near or on the shore can wreak havoc.It can block sunlight that coral reefs need to survive, and if the algae sinks, it can smother reefs and sea grasses. Once it reaches the shore, the creatures living in the algae die or are picked off by birds, Barnes said.Huge piles of stinky seaweed also are a headache for the Caribbean, where tourism often generates big money for small islands.In the popular tourist spot of Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, officials have invested in barriers to prevent sargassum from reaching the shore.In the Dutch Caribbean territory of Sint Maarten, crews with backhoes were dispatched in late May as part of an emergency cleanup after residents complained of strong smells of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which can affect a person’s respiratory system.“The smell is quite terrible,” Barnes said.Meanwhile, in the French Caribbean, officials expect to soon use storage barges and an upgraded special vessel that can collect several tonnes of seaweed a day.The sargassum “disfigures our coasts, prevents swimming and makes life impossible for local residents”, the French prime minister, François Bayrou, recently told reporters.But Frank Comito, special adviser to the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association, said such vessels were “massively expensive” and not a popular option, noting that another method – using heavy equipment – is labor-intensive.“You have to be careful because there could be sea turtle eggs affected,” he said. “It’s not like you can go in there and massively rake and scrape the whole thing.”Some Caribbean islands struggle financially, so most of the cleanup is done by hotels, with some offering guests refunds or a free shuttle to unaffected beaches.Every year, the amount of sargassum expands in late spring, peaks around summer and starts to decline in the late fall or early winter, Barnes said.The new record is likely to be broken – experts said they expect even more sargassum for June.Explore more on these topicsCaribbeanMarine lifeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Nearly half a century ago, the young ecologist had been out documenting fruit crops in a dense stretch of Costa Rican forest when he fell in a ravine, landing on his back. The long lens of his camera punched up through three ribs, snapping the bones into his thorax.Slowly, he dragged himself out, crawling nearly two miles back to the research hut. There were no immediate neighbours, no good roads, no simple solutions for getting to a hospital.Selecting a rocking chair on the porch, Janzen used a bedsheet to strap his torso tightly to the frame. For a month, he sat, barely moving, waiting for his bones to knit back together. And he watched.In front of him was a world seething with life. Every branch of every tree seemed to host its own small metropolis of creatures hunting, flying, crawling, eating. The research facility lay in a patchwork of protected rainforest, dry forest, cloud forest, mangroves and coastline covering an area the size of New York, and astonishingly rich in biodiverse life. Here, the bugs gorged, coating the leaf litter with a thick carpet of droppings.View image in fullscreenLight traps have long been used to monitor nocturnal insect numbers. In a photograph of one taken in 1978, about 3,000 species were identified.Photograph: Patrick Greenfield/The GuardianBut the real show was at night: for two hours each evening, the site got power and a 25-watt bulb flickered on above the porch. Out of the forest darkness, a tornado of insects would flock to its glow, spinning and dancing before the light. Lit up, the side of the house would be “absolutely plastered with moths – tens of thousands of them”, Janzen says.[The walls would be] absolutely plastered with moths – tens of thousands of themDaniel JanzenInspired, he decided to erect a sheet for a light trap with a camera – a common way to document flying insect numbers and diversity. In that first photograph, taken in 1978, the lit-up sheet is so thickly studded with moths that in places the fabric is barely visible, transformed into what looks like densely patterned, crawling wallpaper.Scientists identified an astonishing 3,000 species from that light trap, and the trajectory of Janzen’s career was transformed, from the study of seeds to a lifetime specialising in the forest’s barely documented populations of caterpillars and moths.Now 86, Janzen still works in the same research hut in theGuanacaste conservation area, alongside his longtime collaborator, spouse and fellow ecologist, Winnie Hallwachs. But in the forest that surrounds them, something has changed. Trees that once crawled with insects lie uncannily still.An image from 1984 of many insects on a sheet is contrasted with one from 2019 with far fewerA light trap set up by Daniel Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs two weeks after the beginning of the rainy season in 1984 and at the same period in 2019The hum of wild bees has faded, and leaves that should be chewed to the stem hang whole and un-nibbled. It is these glossy, untouched leaves that most spook Janzen and Hallwachs. They are more like a pristine greenhouse than a living ecosystem: a wilderness that has been fumigated and left sterile. Not a forest, but a museum.Over the decades, Janzen has repeated his light traps, hanging the sheet, watching for what comes. Today, some moths flutter to the glow, but their numbers are far fewer.“It’s the same sheet, with the same lights, in the same place, looking over the same vegetation. Same time of year, same time of the moon cycle, everything about it is identical,” he says. “There’s just no moths on that sheet.”Crumbling populationsThe declines witnessed by Janzen – anddescribed by others around the world– are part of what some ecologists call a “new era” of ecological collapse, where rapid extinctions occur in regions that have little direct contact with people.Reports of falling insect numbers around the world are not new. International reviews have estimated annual losses globally of between 1% and 2.5% of total biomass every year.View image in fullscreenJanzen and Hallwachs say that while the lack of insects in areas with heavy pesticide use is well documented, the collapse in protected areas is relatively new.Photograph: P Greenfield/GuardianWidespread use of pesticides and fertilisers, light and chemical pollution, loss of habitat and the growth of industrial agriculture have all carved into their numbers. Often, these were deaths of proximity: insects are sensitive creatures, and any nearby source of pollution can send their populations crumbling.But what Janzen and Hallwachs are witnessing is a part of a newer phenomenon: the catastrophic collapse of insect populations in supposedly protected regions of forest. “In the parts of Costa Rica that are heavily hit by pesticides, the insects are completely wiped out,” Hallwachs says.Run that forward four decades, that’s nearly half the tree of life disappearing in a lifetime … catastrophicDavid Wagner“But what we see here in the preserved areas – that as far as we can tell, are free of even these destructive insecticides and pesticides – even here, the insect numbers are going down horrifyingly dramatically,” she says.Long-term data for insect populations – particularly less charismatic species – is still patchy, but Janzen and Hallwachs join a number of scientists that have recorded huge die-offs of insects in nature reserves around the world.They include inGermany, where flying insects across 63 insect reserves dropped 75% in less than 30 years;the US, where beetle numbers dropped 83% in 45 years; andPuerto Rico, where insect biomass dropped up to 60-fold since the 1970s. These declines are occurring in ecosystems that are otherwise protected from direct human influence.View image in fullscreenDavid Wagner says ‘there just wasn’t any insect life’ in Texas.Photograph: George Ruhe/NYT/eyevineWhen David Wagner stepped out into the US’s southern wilderness this spring, he found landscapes emptied of life. The entomologist has devoted much of his career to documenting the vast diversity of US insect life, particularly rare caterpillars. He traverses the country to find specimens, often on long road trips searching for caterpillars by day and moths by night.Now, he finds himself coming home empty-handed. “I just got back fromTexas, and it was the most unsuccessful trip I’ve ever taken,” he says. “There just wasn’t any insect life to speak of.”It was not only the insects missing, he says, it was everything. “Everything was crispy, fried; the lizard numbers were down to the lowest numbers I can ever remember. And then the things that eat lizards were not present – I didn’t see a single snake the entire time.”Wagner recalls when a series of international reviews began hitting headlines in 2019, saying global insect biomass was declining at a rate of 1% a year (although some estimates put itas high as 2.5%).“We [entomologists] were thinking conservatively,” he says, looking at the data that has emerged in the five years since then.“I now think that that’s too low. Now I would say that 2% is happening in some areas, and we’re seeing some places threatened by climate change or urbanisation or agriculture get as high as 5% decline per year.”View image in fullscreenTheCalosoma sycophantabeetle, or forest caterpillar hunter, is in decline in Germany, where numbers of flying insects in 63 reserves fell by 75% in under 30 years.Photograph: T Lohnes/GettyA few percentage points a year may not have the ring of disaster. “But if you run that forward just four decades,” Wagner says, “we’re talking about nearly half the tree of life disappearing in one human lifetime. That is absolutely catastrophic.”Developing a clear picture of how many insects we have lost is complicated by a lack of baseline data for many species: while some eye-catching insects, such as butterflies, have been collected and monitored for decades, others have been mostly ignored.And within the overall declines, the picture is not homogeneous: populations and losses vary by species, by location, by habitat. The same heat that destroys the living conditions of one butterfly, for example, could expand the range of a mosquito or help a cricket species thrive.“No matter what we do in nature, there will be winners and losers,” Wagner says. “But we are seeing a lot of losers.”And those who doubt there is sufficient species data to prove the “insectageddon” can now track it by proxy, Wagner says: via the sharp declines in birds, lizards and other creatures that depend on them for food.View image in fullscreenResidents and scientists look for insects in the Xochimilco canals of Mexico City. Axolotls, which feed on the insects, are now an endangered species.Photograph: Tomas Bravo/ReutersScientists in the US, Brazil, Ecuador and Panama have now reported the catastrophic declines of birds in “untouched” regions – including reserves inside millions of hectares of pristine forest. In each case, the worst losses were among insectivorous birds.Atone research centre– falling within a 22,000-hectare (85 sq mile) stretch of intact forest in Panama – scientists comparing current bird numbers with the 1970s found 70% of species had declined, and 88% of these had lost more than half of their population.When I arrived here in 1963 the dry season was four months. Today, it is six monthsDaniel JanzenIn 2019, researchers found that almost a third of US birds –about 3 billion– had disappeared from the skies since the 1970s. The losses, however, werenot evenly distributed: those birds that ate insects as their main food had declined by 2.9 billion. Those that didn’t depend on insects had actually gained, increasing by 26 million.More recent research from the US found adecline in three-quarters of nearly 500 bird speciesstudied – with the steepest downward trend in stronghold areas, where they once thrived.In Puerto Rico’s Luquillo rainforest, scientists in 2018 mapped how the loss of insectsset other dominoes falling: as bugs declined, so too did the populations of lizards, frogs and birds. Their disappearance, they wrote, had triggered “a bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web”.View image in fullscreenAs numbers of pollinators collapse, Janzen now sees flowers failing to bloom in the forest he has monitored for so long.Photograph: Patrick Greenfield/The GuardianIn Costa Rica, Janzen described the fall in numbers of insectivorous birds in the reserve as “cratering”. A colony of about 20 nectar-eating bats have long nested in the dark nooks of Janzen and Hallwachs’ house, but Janzen has noticed the flowers they used to feed from are now failing to bloom.Hallwachs began to find their small, emaciated bodies lying on the floor. “Over a period of five days, I found three of these bats dead,” she says. Researchers at another site 20 miles away told her they were witnessing the same thing.Out of syncBehind the steepening declines, a clear culprit is beginning to emerge: global heating. A tropical forest ecosystem is “a finely tuned Swiss watch”, Hallwachs says – perfectly engineered to sustain a vastly biodiverse system of creatures.Each element is delicately tuned and interlocks with the rest: the heat, the humidity, the rainfall, the unfolding of leaves, the length of the seasons, the start and stop of the life cycles of insects and animals.With each incremental turn of one cog, the rest of the system responds.Insectsand animals have evolved to time their hibernations and breeding times precisely to small signals from the system: a change in humidity, a lengthening of the light hours of the day, a small rise or fall in temperature.View image in fullscreenA list of moths recorded on Brill Common in Buckinghamshire in 2013. Numbers of larger moths in Britain fell by 33% over 50 years.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/GettyBut now, the system has one gear spinning wildly out of time: the climate.“When I arrived here in 1963 the dry season was four months. Today, it is six months,” Janzen says. Insects that typically spend four months underground, waiting for the rains, are now forced to try to survive another two months of hot, dry weather. Many are not succeeding.The major drivers of biodiversity losses were land degradation and habitat loss … Now climate change is by far exceeding thatDavid WagnerAlongside the changing seasons are other shifts, such as in rainfall or humidity. “It’s just a general disruption of all the little cues and synchronies that would be out there,” Janzen says. Across the entire clock of the forest, plants and creatures are falling out of sync. In the background, the temperature is rising.“The killer – the cause that’s pulling the trigger – is actually water,” says Wagner. For insects, staying hydrated is a unique physiological challenge: rather than lungs, their bodies are riddled with holes, called spiracles, that carry oxygen directly into the tissue.“They’re all surface area,” says Wagner. “Insects can’t hold water.” Even a brief drought lasting just a few days can wipe out millions of humidity-dependent insects.View image in fullscreenWall brown butterfly numbers in the UK have dropped by 87% since 1976, making it one of the country’s most rapidly declining species.Photograph: Alex Hyde/WWFSome ecologists now believe these declines could mark a new era in which the changing climate overtakes other forms of human damage as the biggest driver of extinction.“We’re at a new point in human history,” Wagner says. Up until the last decade, “the major drivers of biodiversity losses around the planet were really land degradation and land loss, habitat loss. But I think now that climate change is by far exceeding that.”Losing hopeLast month, the journal BioScience published new research examining how thefive biggest drivers of biodiversity losswere affecting the US’s endangered creatures. For the first time – albeit by a very slim margin – the climate crisis emerged in front, driving the decline of 91% of imperilled species.Heat-driven declines could have repercussions far beyond their immediate surroundings. In the past, even if pesticides wiped out insects over an agricultural region, as long as healthy populations remained elsewhere, species could return if the spraying stopped.‘It’s a warning’: UK nature chief sounds alarm over ecosystem collapse as butterfly numbers halveRead more“Climate change is impacting all those different little spots at the same time. It doesn’t just affect one particular spot that gets a pesticide dose or gets a tree cut down,” Janzen says. “If the insect population collapses and it happens everywhere, you don’t have a residual population.”Today, as well as being an ecologist Wagner feels he has taken on a second role – as an elegist for disappearing forms of life.“I’m an optimist, in the sense that I think we will build a sustainable future,” Wagner says. “But it’s going to take 30 or 40 years, and by then, it’s going to be too late for a lot of the creatures that I love. I want to do what I can with my last decade to chronicle the last days for many of these creatures.”Decades on from his months spent bound to the rocking chair, Janzen still watches. He records the yearly data, the shifts in dominant species. But today, there is so much less to see. Once, when he and Hallwachs would type up their notes in the night, they would pitch a tent in the living room to protect their computers from thousands of moths that flocked to the blue glow. Now, they work with the house open to the forest air. “I find myself saying, ‘Winnie! A moth has arrived at the light on my laptop,’” Janzen says. “One moth.”Elsewhere in their profession, some scientists are starting to look away. “We know quite a number of entomologists who have experience dating back to the 70s, 80s or 90s,” Hallwachs says. “One of our very good friends – he now does not have the emotional courage to hang up a sheet to collect moths at night. It is too devastating to see how few there are.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsInsectsThe age of extinctionWildlifeAnimalsConservationCosta RicaAmericasTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The thousands of protected habitats are locations for threatened British wildlife such as nightingales, badgers, dormice, otters, butterflies, dragonflies, kingfishers, tufted ducks and egrets.The bill is the product of the government’s promiseto build 1.5m homes to help address the UK’shousing affordability crisis, and approve 150 major infrastructure projects, in this parliament. The pledge is key to Labour’s plan to boost economic growth; however,a recent study suggests the government is likely to miss its new homes target. The government says the bill does not weaken environmental protections.Areas of England that are currently protectedBut according to three separate legal opinions on the planning and infrastructure bill currently going through parliament, legal protections will be rolled back by the legislation, making it easier for developers to build on areas that have historically been protected under UK and international law.The Guardian has identified 10 protected sites that are under particular threat from development under the new legislation amid growing criticism of Labour’s bill.Ten jewels of English nature at risk from development and Labour’s planning billRead moreThey include one of the last strongholds for nightingales in England at Lodge Hill in Kent; a wetland dating back 2,600 years in south Devon; an internationally important tidal wetland at Tipner west in Portsmouth; and woods dating back as far as the 17th century at Sittingbourne, Kent, part of the 2.5% of the UK’s ancient woodland that still remains.These areas represent just a handful of the most protected environmental gems across England which include 4,100 sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs), all currently protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981; 71 wetlands protected under the internationally-binding Ramsar convention;256 special areas of conservation(SACs) and 824 special protection areas, (SPAs) all protected under UK and international law in the habitats directive.Though numerous, these protected areas in total only cover just under 8% of land in England. Critics of the bill say ensuring they continue to be protected does not amount to a block on building new houses.In a legal opinion, Alex Goodman KC said the consequences of the planning and infrastructure bill as drafted were that any adverse impacts a development inflicted on the most protected natural areas in England, including SSSIs, SACs and Ramsar sites, must be “disregarded”.“[The bill] thereby withdraws the principal legal safeguard for protected sites,” he said. “This amounts to a very significant change.”Goodman has provided one of three separate legal opinions on the bill since it was presented by Angela Rayner, secretary of state for housing, communities and local government.All, including that of the government’s own watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), challenge Rayner’s assertion to parliament that the bill is not a rollback of environmental law. Rayner has been threatened witha judicial reviewbrought by nature groups if she does not “correct” her comments.Goodman said: “The only possible reading is that the bill will have the effect of reducing the level of environmental protection provided.”Glenys Stacey, chair of the OEP, said: “The bill would have the effect of reducing the level of environmental protection provided for by existing environmental law. As drafted, the provisions are a regression.”Key concerns focus on part three of the bill, which provides a mechanism for developers to sidestep current environmental obligations by paying into a nature restoration fund, which will be used at a later date to create environmental improvements elsewhere.Once the fee is paid, the development can go ahead even if it “inflicts adverse effects on the integrity of a protected site”. Dubbed a mechanism to pay“cash to trash”, the bill contains no requirement for developers to measure what harms are taking place during the planning process. Irreplaceable habitats have no extra protection from development.Leading charitieshave called for this section to be scrapped entirely.Dr Ruth Tingay, co-director of Wild Justice, said the government seemed intent on causing unrecoverable damage.“Imagine flattening an irreplaceable grade I listed building like the Royal Albert Hall, replacing it with karaoke machines in various towns and then telling the public this is a ‘win-win’ for architecture and music. Swap the Royal Albert Hall for any one of the UK’s nationally important and protected habitats, swap the karaoke machines for a few pathetic tree-planting schemes, then tell people this is a ‘win-win’ for the environment and the public, and the analogy is brutally clear.”David Elvin KC, in a third legal opinion, said part three of the bill was regressive and potentially in breach of international law.Ellie Chowns, a Green MP, said there was a serious legal question with the bill because although the secretary of state asserted to MPs there was no reduction in environmental protections, the reality of the legislation was that the bill was in fact a rollback of environmental protections.“We have a responsibility to protect the most important, the rarest and most in need habitats, like chalk streams, ancient woodlands, peat bogs; these jewels in the crown of our ecological heritage have their protections weakened in this bill,” she said. “These are irreplaceable habitats, which by their very nature cannot be created anywhere else in some kind of compensation schedule.”A government spokesperson said: “We completely reject these claims, and have been clear that our planning and infrastructure will not weaken environmental protections.“The government has inherited a failing system that has delayed new homes and infrastructure while doing nothing for nature’s recovery.“That’s why we will deliver a win-win for the economy and nature as part of our Plan for Change, unblocking building and economic growth while delivering meaningful environmental improvements.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentPlanning policyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

I do not underestimate the ordeal that potentially lies ahead for each of them.”However, he said that the public nature of the collision, the details of which had already been widely publicised, and the fact that there was likely to be widespread sympathy, rather than animosity towards the victims, meant anonymity was not necessary.“The public nature of this incident, and the apparently blameless status of the complainants, make it difficult to see how identification would deter them from testifying,” the judge said. “Their accounts relate to events already widely discussed in the public domain. There is, it seems to me, no risk of victim-blaming or reprisals from any quarter, nor any indication that public identification would result in hostility.”He said that to allow anonymity would risk setting a precedent of not naming witnesses, contrary to the principle of open justice.“Anonymising adult complainants in such circumstances —absent compelling evidence – would risk setting an unfortunate pattern where anonymity becomes the norm for witnesses in criminal cases, or at least gives rise to an expectation on the part of witnesses that their personal details will not be reported,” he said.Lifting the restriction imposed at the magistrates court, Menary said: “In my judgment, the public interest in open and accurate reporting outweighs the potential distress, anxiety or discomfort to these witnesses. The restriction is not necessary or proportionate, nor convincingly established.”Doyle was not required to attend court for the hearing. He is due to appear for a plea hearing in August, with a provisional trial date set for November.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

It has barely been mentioned by ministers since last July. He published a new ministerial code last year, allowing the independent adviser on ministerial standards to start his own investigations into misconduct without requiring permission from the prime minister.But the standards regime is otherwise largely unchanged, with no updates either to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which is now without a permanent chair after the departure of Eric Pickles. Its interim chair until December is a HR executive from the banking and energy sectors.Government sources said work was continuing on the ethics and integrity commission, but also suggested that voters cared more about tough outcomes in relation to misconduct than about the process of setting up new bodies.Insiders also pointed to the fact that Starmer had pushed out two ministers who failed to uphold high enough standards under the current rules.Tulip Siddiq resignedas a Treasury minister in January after accepting that the government was being harmed by a furore over her close ties to her aunt, the ousted prime minister of Bangladesh, now accused of corruption. She denies wrongdoing.In November, No 10 told Louise Haigh to resign as transport secretary for a possible breach of the ministerial code, aftershe did not declare her spent conviction for fraudto the government when she became a cabinet minister.Since April, the government has twice avoided the question about setting up its ethics and integrity commission when asked about it in parliament.Pressed on what progress had been made, one Cabinet Office minister, Abena Oppong-Asare, said: “We are restoring confidence in government and the highest standards in public life and have already taken steps to improve probity and transparency, including through issuing a newministerial code, which highlights the importance of the principles of public life, by strengthening the terms of reference for the independent adviser, and by introducing a new monthly register of gifts and hospitality.”Georgia Gould, another Cabinet Office minister, said the government was improving standards in public life and was “committed to establishing the right structures to do so”, without specifically mentioning the new commission.Simon Hoare, a former minister in Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, said: “Significant commitments have been made to overhaul the ethics regime but we are yet to see much evidence of progress from the Cabinet Office. An upstanding government and good ministers should not fear but welcome a strong, rigorous and independent ethics and propriety regime.“This inquiry will allow us to push the government on its commitments, ensuring changes are properly stress-tested and scrutinised by parliament.”The committee said it would be “aiming to understand what progress has been made” on the independent ethics commission. It will look at how trust in government and its officials can be restored and ensured in light of concerns around lobbying and ministerial conduct. It will also study how enforcing high standards could positively affect the public’s trust in government and the wider political system in the UK.It will look at how effective the existing propriety and ethics structures have proved to be, with critics having long said the landscape is far too fragmented with different bodies responsible for policing different parts of politics, from the parliamentary commissioners on standards, to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, to the Electoral Commission, the adviser on ministerial standards and Acoba.A senior Whitehall figure involved said the government had discovered that policing standards in politics was more complicated than it first thought but that discussions about strengthening and potentially consolidating different watchdogs were still live in the Cabinet Office.They said there was an acknowledgment that some ministers tended to prioritise the politics rather than the changes to the machinery of state that needed cross-party support. However, they said it was important that the public’s deteriorating trust in institutions, as well as politicians, was addressed.William Wallace, a Lib Dem peer, who has secured a debate later this month on the lack of progress on the ethics commission, said: “TheLabourgovernment is being as timid on this as on its other manifesto promises to change the way British politics work.“Public trust in our political system is at an all-time low. After the scandals of the Conservative government, it should have been a priority for Labour’s first year to set up a stronger independent commission to oversee ethical standards in government.”The government’s language on the issue appears to have shifted as it did not restate its commitment to an ethics and integrity commission on Tuesday.In response to the inquiry, a government spokesperson said: “We are restoring confidence in government and the highest standards in public life. This government is committed to establishing the right structures to do so and has already taken steps to improve probity and transparency, including through introducing a new ministerial code, which emphasises the principles of public life, by strengthening the terms of reference for the independent adviser, and by introducing a new monthly register of gifts and hospitality.”Explore more on these topicsHouse of CommonsLobbyingLabourKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

All three were police constables at the time of the search, which allegedly took place without an appropriate adult present.Outrage over her treatment led to protests by hundreds outside a town hall and a police station after a safeguarding review revealed she had arrived at school for a mock exam and was taken to the medical room to be strip-searched while teachers remained outside.Elliot Gold, a barrister acting for theIndependent Office for Police Conduct(IOPC), which is bringing the case, said: “The search involved the removal of Child Q’s clothing including her underwear, her bending over and, thus, the exposure of her intimate parts including, necessarily on the (IOPC) director general’s case, her vagina and anus.“Child Q was menstruating at the time, as she told the two officers who searched her, but they nevertheless proceeded with the search. It is not disputed that Child Q’s sanitary pad was thereby exposed.The object was to search for cannabis but no cannabis was found, he said.The point where Child Q said she was on her period was “an obvious opportunity for the two officers to reconsider the necessity and proportionality of the search” but they instead told her “we are all women here”, or said that they were all “females”, and thereby treated Child Q as an adult rather than a child, Gold said.Linge and Szmydynski performed a search that exposed the girl’s intimate parts when this was “disproportionate in all the circumstances”, according to the allegations. Linge and Wray allegedly performed or allowed the search in a manner that was “unjustified, inappropriate, disproportionate, humiliating and degrading”.Gold also told the panel: “Black schoolchildren are more likely to be treated as older and less vulnerable or in need of protection and support than their white peers.”He said that sacking the officers would be “justified” if the allegations were proved, adding: “Their actions and omissions have resulted in Child Q suffering harm to her mental health and feeling physically violated.”The alleged actions of the officers had brought discredit on theMetropolitan policeand upset race relations yet further between the police and minority communities,” added Gold.Scotland Yard has previously apologised over the incident.Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policeYoung peopleHackneyLondonPoliceRaceIndependent Office for Police ConductnewsShareReuse this content"

A member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, she is listed as a voting member on thewebsiteof the Golden Globes.In recent months, Kurier has published Sereda-bylined interviews with several high-profile actors including Pamela Anderson, Sarah Jessica Parker and Jude Law.Sources close to Law said no interview between the British actor and the Austrian journalist had taken place and that the only time Kurier could have obtained direct quotes would have been at a press conference at the Toronto international film festival last year where Law spoke to promote his survival thriller Eden.Sereda has been approached by the Guardian for comment.Intended to mark Eastwood’s 95th birthday, the quotes featured in the Kurier piece attracted worldwide attention.“I long for the good old days when screenwriters wrote films like Casablanca in small bungalows on the studio lot. When everyone had a new idea,” the actor was quoted as saying. “My philosophy is: do something new or stay at home.”In his statement to the trade publication Deadline, Eastwood said: “I thought I would set the record straight. I can confirm I’ve turned 95. I can also confirm that I never gave an interview to an Austrian publication called Kurier, or any other writer in recent weeks, and that the interview is entirely phoney.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaNewspapers & magazinesClint EastwoodEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The center had generated more than $4.4m by this point a year earlier, according to data obtained by theWashington Post.The Post says that sales data was collected and shared by former Kennedy Center employees. The data was confirmed by a current staff member, who spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity.Arts groups for people of color steel themselves after Trump’s NEA cuts: ‘They poked the bear’Read moreThough the subscription data is only one source of revenue for the center, it could serve as an overall indicator of public standing. Other sources of revenue include donations, individual ticket sales and government funding. The Washington DC-based center’s budget for operation was $268m in 2024. About $125m of that came from earned revenue, such as ticket sales, the Post reported.The employee who leaked the data told the paper: “We understand providing information like this can be seen in a bad light. But we feel that it is necessary to show that mismanagement by the new leadership is becoming a real problem for the health of the organization.”The employee added that “we feel that we no longer have a choice but to force complete transparency with the public” after several staffers were ignored or outright fired for their opinions.Trump’sappointing himselfto be the chairperson of the Kennedy Center in February – less than a month into his second presidency – has ensnared the institution in controversy. He has since reshaped the center’s governing board with his own appointees. And the center’s former president, Deborah Rutter, has been replaced by the Trump ally Richard Grenell.Aboycott by Les Misérables cast memberswas the latest in a string of stars pulling out of shows and positions at the center since Trump assumed control.

Not about everything, but about a small slice – just enough to turn their regret, their buyer’s remorse, into criminality,” Aidala said. “Mr Weinstein sits here an innocent man. The presumption of innocence ... The only ones who can take that away are the 12 of you … ”He concluded: “If this guy wasn’tHarvey Weinstein, would we even be here?”Florida sandwich shop staffer helps free kidnapped domestic violence victimRead moreDistrict attorney Nicole Blumberg followed with a summation that Weinstein had used his power in the entertainment industry to “physically and emotionally overpower” his accusers.“He didn’t have an interest in their careers,” Blumberg said. “He had an interest in their bodies. He didn’t care what they wanted. He cared what he wanted.”Addressing Aidala’s claim that Weinstein was “the one getting abused here”, Blumberg said: “The defense is no victim in this case – and to suggest otherwise is offensive.” The prosecution is scheduled to continue its closing on Wednesday before the case is handed to the jury for deliberations.Six weeks after prosecutors began laying out their case against him (largely a re-airing of a 2020 criminal prosecution, with one additional accuser, that was later overturned on appeal), the matter will be deliberated again by jurors, without Weinstein testifying.He is charged with assaulting three women in Manhattan between 2006 and 2013 – Mimi Haley, Jessica Mann and Kaja Sokola – and has been appearing in court each day in a wheelchair from Manhattan’s Bellevue hospital, where he is being treated for a number of ailments, including chronic myeloid leukemia.Manhattan’s district attorney, Alvin Bragg, who is facing re-election this year, opted to retry Weinstein soon after his first conviction on third-degree rape and a criminal sexual charge was vacated because prosecutors were found to have prejudiced the jury by calling witnesses whose testimony was unrelated to the charges.The decision to bring a second prosecution inNew Yorkrequired the 73-year-old Weinstein to travel from California, where he was serving a 16-year sentence for sexual assault. The second New York trial avoided the most serious sexual assault charges that he was cleared of in 2020 to avoid double jeopardy.At trial, prosecutors have sought to establish that Weinstein used his power in the film industry to sexually assault and “exert enormous control” over the three women, each of whom were seeking to gain a footing in the business.In opening statements, assistant DA Shannon Lucey said Weinstein had offered his accusers film scripts and promises of fame, and he “used those dream opportunities as weapons”.Prosecutors avoided introducing so-called prior bad acts testimony – but brought an additional sex crimes charge related to Sokola, who accused Weinstein of performing oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel on one occasion in early 2006.Weinstein’s defense team pushed back on that claim, offering jurors the testimony of Helga Samuelsen, a friend of Sokola’s, who said Weinstein had visited Sokola months earlier in their shared apartment and spent about a half hour in a bedroom with her. Sokola earlier testified that the alleged encounter had not happened.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWeinstein’s defense also offered evidence that each of the three women had friendly relationships with the defendant before and after the alleged sexual assaults – and each had received compensation from a payout fund established after allegations were made against the movie mogul, triggering a public reckoning over gender power dynamics that came to be known as the #MeToomovement.Among the witnesses, Jessica Mann testified that she had what she considered a romantic relationship with Weinstein, who was then married. All three said they believed Weinstein could help them with their professional goals and maintained relationships with him, and, in some instances, he had helped them find work.Aidala told jurors that the three women had “fooled around with him consensually”, adding “they were flirtatious, they were friendly, they wanted him, they needed him, he could change the trajectories of their lives”.But a clinical psychologist, testifying for the prosecution, said that for a variety of reasons, it is not unusual for sexual assault victims to remain on good terms with their assailants after an assault.In total, prosecutors introduced evidence from 24 witnesses during Weinstein’s retrial. They included former assistants, friends of his accusers and workers at the hotels where the alleged assaults took place.Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty, elected not to testify in his defense – repeating the same decision he made in the earlier trials.Aidala said his client very much wanted to take the stand – and had been prepped to do so – before Weinstein decided against it as a matter of courtroom strategy.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

Three bridges over the Rhine have been closed and rail traffic has been halted or diverted.Numerous schools, kindergartens, museums and the tram network, as well as the home of the city’s philharmonic orchestra, have had to close after the entire old town was brought to a halt.The broadcaster RTL had to shift its news programmes to studios in Berlin as its Cologne building sits inside the evacuation area of about 1,000 metres in radius. Several programmes that were due to be transmitted live had to be recorded instead, the broadcaster said.The bombs are due to be defused on Wednesday morning. They are US-produced bombs, two of 1,000kg and one of 500kg. They were discovered on Monday on the right bank of the Rhine during building works near the Deutz shipworks. All three are equipped with impact fuzes intended to cause detonation on contact with a hard surface.Volunteers, police and other city authorities will carry out a round of checks ringing on doorbells, calling through letter boxes and gathering information from residents about their neighbours on Wednesday morning before attempts to defuse the bombs can start. Police have said they have the authority to use force to remove anyone who refuses to leave voluntarily. Locals can call a hotline or refer to awebsitefor advice.Tents and other facilities such as sport halls and churches outside the evacuated area will be open to provide people with food, refreshments and support, city authorities said.Eighty years after the end of the second world war, such finds are stillnot unusual in Cologne, which was among Germany’s most heavily bombed cities during the conflict. It was hit in 262 air raids carried out by the RAF, sometimes using US-produced bombs, especially towards the end of the conflict. About 20,000 people were killed in the bombing raids.On the night of 30 May 1942, the city was the target of the RAF’s first “thousand-bomber raid” on a German city. More than 1,000 aircraft were dispatched, flying in a narrow “bomber stream” formation, the density of which had the effect of overwhelming German radar and defences. On this single night, 868 bombers attacked the city with 1,455 tons of bombs in what was known as Operation Millennium.It is not yet known exactly when the bombs currently awaiting defusing were dropped.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

Visitors flock to its extraordinary garden, in the shadow of Dungeness nuclear power station, in search of solace and relaxation. Yet focusing on this artistic haven threatens to overshadow Jarman’s actual work, which was far from tranquil and domestic, and often angry, dark and disturbing.Two examples of this more challenging side of Jarman’s output are about to resurface. The first is the publication of a treatment for an unfinished film called The Assassination of Pier Paolo Pasolini in the Garden of Earthly Delights, which Jarman wrote in 1984 as he was struggling to get his film Caravaggio made. Like Jarman, Pasolini was a queer film-maker (and writer) whose work often expressed a cri de coeur against political and sexual repression. “I think Derek related to Pasolini because he carved his own path and made films in a very singular, distinctive way,” says Tony Peake, Jarman’s biographer. “He was also someone who stuck his neck out.”Pasolini was murdered aged 53 in November 1975, three weeks before the release of his final film Salò, an indictment of fascism and a gruelling depiction of its sadism. A 17-year-old rent boy called Giuseppe Pelosi confessed to killing Pasolini after the director picked him up, and it’s this interpretation that Jarman riffs on in his film treatment, a vision of decadence and gay desire leading to doom, inspired by Hieronymus Bosch’s painting, which Jarman saw in the Prado in Madrid.View image in fullscreenEmbedded meaning … This Instant, 1987.Photograph: Courtesy Keith Collin Will Trust and Amanda Wilkinson, LondonYet since Jarman’s death at 52 in 1994,new evidence has come to lightsuggesting that Pasolini, an outspoken Marxist who often wrote newspaper articles excoriating the Italian government, was killed by a far-right terrorist group working with the tacit approval of the secret services, a possibility Olivia Laing imagines in their compelling forthcoming novel, The Silver Book. Pelosi retracted his confession in 2005 and it’s hard to believe that a single teenager could be responsible for the violence that Pasolini suffered in his final moments. He was run over several times by his car and his testicles were crushed, probably with an iron bar.Though Jarman wasn’t aware of these horrors, there were plenty of others that oppressed him. On 22 December 1986, he was told that he had contracted HIV, a diagnosis that then meant certain death, and a stigma which Jarman defied by being open about his condition – kicking off the activism that coloured the final years of his life.The following year, the British government’s campaign of leaflets and TV ads to warn the public about the danger of Aids brought forth a savage backlash against gay people, cruelly whipped up by the tabloid press. In response, Margaret Thatcher’s government brought in Section 28, which banned local authorities from “promoting” homosexuality and seemed to have work like Jarman’s, with its unequivocally queer perspective, in its sights. “All those things together felt particularly difficult and hostile,” Peake says. “And he felt that very, very strongly.”Jarman’s fear and fury came out in his 1987 filmThe Last of England, which depicts the nation as a crumbling, authoritarian dystopia, culminating in a scene in which a screaming Tilda Swinton, playing a bride whose husband has been killed, tears off her wedding dress. He also started to make a series of “black paintings”, which are going on show in chronological order at Amanda Wilkinson’s gallery in London this week. Wilkinson says that Jarman’s companionKeith Collinstold her Jarman insisted on total privacy when making the paintings, “and sometimes he used to cast spells over them. I don’t know whether that’s true or not.”Thick black oil paint is smeared on to the canvases, into which Jarman has embedded objects ranging from sticks, a pebble and a circular blade in Dead Souls Whisper, to toy cars, barbed wire and broken crockery in Home Counties. Some paintings include text that draws on the formidably well-read director’s fascination with psychoanalysis, Shakespeare and alchemy; another, called Strange Meeting includes two wedding rings and a protractor, and alludes to the Wilfred Owen poem in which he descends to hell and meets the German soldier he killed in the first world war. Then, in a second tranche of black paintings, there’s Dear God, whose chalked text, laid besides nails and a pressed flower, implores the deity to “send me to hell. Yours sincerely,Derek Jarman.”View image in fullscreen‘He kept flying through the flak’ … Jarman.Photograph: Leonardo CendamoThe paintings’ darkness speaks to a current moment in which LGBTQ+ rights are once again being assaulted around the world, as fair-weather corporate “friends” take down their rainbow flags for fear of getting on the wrong side of Donald Trump and other authoritarians. It’s also apt that the black paintings are being exhibited at the same time as theUK Aids Memorial Quiltbeing displayed in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, each homemade panel commemorating a beloved friend, partner or family member whose life was prematurely claimed by the disease in the 80s and 90s.Yet for the modern viewer, there’s also something galvanising about Jarman’s resourcefulness as well as his rage, his protean creativity, and his determination to live his life and make his work regardless of the forces of repression ranged against it. “He kept flying through the flak,” Peake says. “He kept going forward and he was extremely unapologetic about who he was and what he liked to do. Shadowing his work is a great deal of distress and trauma, but you were very seldom aware of it in his company because he was immensely warm, positive and joyful.”Despite his work being unashamedly left-field, Jarman was also a prominent public figure in his later years, in a way that has few – if any – parallels now. I remember him being interviewed on Nicky Campbell’s late night show on BBC Radio 1 in the early 90s when I was a teenager, around the time he published his journals, Modern Nature, which had caused tabloid outrage due to sections in which he described cruising on Hampstead Heath (Sun journalists expected gay men with Aids to become celibate). Jarman chose the Rolling Stones’ You Can’t Always Get What You Want for the DJ to play, but stressed that the title didn’t express what he felt about his life. “I did get what I wanted,” he said. “Or most of it, anyway.”The Assassination of Pier Paolo Pasolini in the Garden of Earthly Delights ispublished by Pilot Press on 7 June, £12. The Black Paintings: A Chronology Part 1 areat Amanda Wilkinson, London, 6 June to 11 July.

In the lyrics, she states: “You’re not radical … You’re not rad at all,” and that “using feminism to erase the rights of others and endanger them is inherently un-feminist”. It arose from Nash seeing “trans-exclusionary radical feminist” –the contentious term “terf”– as something of a misnomer. Those who espouse gender-critical views are, in her opinion, neither radical nor feminist.The song was written in response to last month’ssupreme court rulingthat the legal definition of “woman” ought to be based on biological sex (a judgement that doctors at the British Medical Association have called “scientifically illiterate”). “I have a lot of trans people in my life that I care about,” Nash tells me on the day the track is released. “This feminist-trans ‘debate’ – it’s not a debate to me. A friend of mine was the victim of a hate crime last year. I took the ruling very personally.” She says the time felt right for her to speak out. “The LGBTQIA+ community supports women so much, and they have been there for me in my life and career. That’s why I think cis women really owe it to trans people to step up at this moment. This song is for that community.”Within hours of the song going live, Nash was trending on X. On the one hand, Nash was praised by LGBTQ+ advocates and allies for showing support for trans people at a time when their rights are being eroded. “A lot of the queer community have been really grateful,” says Nash. “I’ve received some beautiful messages about what it means, when there’s so much uncertainty and fear and a loss of confidence for a lot of trans people. That’s been really moving.”On the other hand, gender-critical voices online suggested that Nash was “enabling abusers” by calling for trans women to be admitted into single-sex spaces. Nash finds the accusation “absurd”. Critiquing different ideologies is important, she says, “but there’s a difference between critical thinking and what’s happening in this debate. I’m really open to nuanced conversations. I was preparing myself for this really amazing argument that stitches me up, a big ‘gotcha’ moment’. But all the insults are calling me old, a bint, a slag, a has-been. I’m shocked at how juvenile and misogynistic the comments are.”View image in fullscreenKate Nash performing live in April.Photograph: Lorne Thomson/Redferns“Germ”, Nash is aware, is another insult now added into the mix. “I’m taking my artistic liberty there as a musician – I can be highbrow and I can be lowbrow. But I also do think it’s important for feminists to voice that transphobia is not feminist, so I stand by it.” She is ready for the inevitable backlash. “I’ve been trolled since I was 18. Bring it on. I’m OK with whatever insults people want to throw at me – I can handle it. It’s not going to be as difficult as what a trans person is having to go through at this moment.” She hopes the song encourages others to speak up despite it being such a divisive subject. “It felt like a scary thing to voice, because it’s this hot topic, but as a musician you can make something that’s quite fun and catchy and a little bit empowering.”Nash has long been an advocate for women’s rights, calling herself a feminist in interviews since she started releasing witty, acerbic songs in the mid-2000s, before Taylor Swift and Beyoncé made the term a pop cultural concern. She is worried that the label has been hijacked by a gender-critical group who are “very vocal and very organised”, and that resources would be better spent finding solutions to more pressing problems faced by women, such as sexual violence and femicide, which occuroverwhelminglyat the hands of men.View image in fullscreenSpeaking out … a still from the video for Germ.Photograph: YouTube/Kate Nash“Taking away the rights of vulnerable people who are not a threat is obviously the wrong thing to be doing,” she says. “I’m not willing to trample on people that have less autonomy over their bodies and less safety in the world than me in order to ‘protect myself’. I do not think cis women are more important or better than trans people.”Nash also made headlines earlier in the year by announcing she was selling photos on OnlyFans to help subsidise her tour. This was done in part to make a serious point about the ways the music industry is failing artists, especially those from working-class backgrounds: “Artists can’t make money from touring and they can’t make money from recorded music.” Nash explains that touring comes with a whole raft of costs, such as renting a tour bus, paying for a band and crew, food, petrol, hotels. Streaming was “built unethically from the start”, she says, with major labels and streaming services defining the terms and conditions – not artists – and not updating pre-streaming contracts to reflect the new reality. “Who you listen to isn’t where your money directly goes, and I don’t think that’s right. The way the music industry has been structured, historically, has been exploiting artists. And we’ve been exploited yet again.”Kate Nash looks back: ‘I trusted the wrong people with my money and had to move back in with my parents; 15 female wrestlers saved me ...’Read moreNash has personal experience of the shadier side of the business. Her former managermisappropriated large amountsof her money during the mid-2010s. (They reached an out-of-court settlement.) During a lengthy legal battle, Nash had to move back in with her parents. “It was a really difficult thing for me to experience,” she says. “But overall I think it’s informed me, and I feel capable of speaking on issues like this now. I feel really empathetic to artists – it’s made me aware of how toxic the environment is.”The decision to sell her pictures online drew criticism, with people accusing Nash of being a bad influence on young girls. “I’m a fantastic influence for young girls,” she counters. “I’ve fought my entire career for young women – representation is extremely important to me.” The photos were also a way of taking control of her sexuality. As an actor on Netflix series Glow, “I’ve been naked on TV,” she says. “I’ve simulated a threesome. I use my body all the time on stage to move, to sing, to connect with an audience. But if I’m completely in control of it, that’s ‘wrong’. Is it wrong? Our bodies are so politicised, and the world has an opinion about how to prevent us from being able to make choices about them.”Last weekend, Nash premiered Germ at the Mighty Hoopla festival along with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Later this month she will headline Glastonbury’s Left Field stage on the Saturday night. She is excited to play the song in front of an audience: “I think that will be quite a punk, exciting moment in the set.”Nash is undeterred by the internet noise the song has caused. “I mean, sure, attack me online, but I’m still right,” she says. “I wanted to leave a record in musical history of a feminist who is outspoken as a cis woman: this is my opinion, and I don’t want the loudest cultural voice in the room to be anti-trans. That is not what feminism has taught me.”Explore more on these topicsKate NashGenderPop and rockTransgenderFeminismLGBTQ+ rightsWomennewsShareReuse this content"

When our opponent isn’t a state, it’s easier to rationalise our failure to stop them causing us pain if there’s super-villain lore around them. That a lone Venezuelan called Ilich Ramírez Sánchez could become the scourge of top intelligence agencies would be a humiliation; rebadge him as the impressive “Carlos the Jackal” and we can cope. As the Israeli-made Storyville documentary The Jackal Speaks: Inside the Mind of a Mass Murderer profiles Sánchez and interviews him, that mystique evaporates.After growing up in Caracas in a family home that has a cook, a cleaner, a gardener and a large photograph of Stalin on the wall, the teenage Sánchez is relocated to London and then Moscow in the late 1960s, dismaying his father – and, in the Soviet Union, annoying the KGB – with his preference for partying over studying. In 1969 he enrols with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), fighting for them in the Black September conflict in Jordan and, most likely, conducting his first solo mission by attempting to assassinate the vice-president of the British Zionist Federation in London in 1973.View image in fullscreenCarlos the Jackal in an airport, in disguise, from a Stasi surveillance photo.Photograph: BBC/Bundesarchiv, Stasi-Unterlagen-Archiv/Kan/Kuma StudiosIn the film, Sánchez denies that one, but it’s definitely him firing rocket-propelled grenades at Israeli passenger jets at Orly airport in 1975. When an informant turns on him by revealing his location to Paris police, Sánchez kills his former associate and two of the officers who arrive to arrest him. Now internationally notorious, he’s nicknamed Carlos the Jackal, the moniker coming half from his South American heritage, and half froma Guardian journalist visiting the flat of an ex-girlfriend of Sánchezand noticing a copy of The Day of the Jackal by Frederick Forsyth. As if to reward the media’s interest, “Carlos the Jackal” pulls off his biggest job when he and his team take dozens of hostages at an Opec summit in Vienna in December 1975, acting on behalf of the PFLP and Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.View image in fullscreenIlich Ramírez Sánchez, AKA Carlos the Jackal.Photograph: BBC/Bundesarchiv/Stasi-Unterlagen-Archiv/Kan/Kuma StudiosAll this is recalled using the usual documentary mix of biographers, experts and retired spies, boosted by a telephone interview with the imprisoned Sánchez himself, conducted in 2021 by director Yaron Niski. When the supply of evocative archive footage runs out and there’s nothing for the star of the show to talk over, the film resorts to slightly comical images of Niski with a phone to his ear, dramatically shot in small rooms half-lit by the dim glow from a single window.Still, it must be worth it for an exclusive chat with the former most wanted man in the world? Barely. Sánchez, rambling unchallenged down an indistinct line, is hard to follow even when you can make out what he’s saying, which isn’t always. He doesn’t offer any insight into why he chose the Palestinian cause, or why he was drawn to political violence. He doesn’t sound like a criminal mastermind; instead, the overall impression is that he was narcissistic enough to believe he could get away with outrageous schemes, and psychopathic enough to do the cold-blooded killing. That, rather than any piercing strategic or political vision, was enough.Chiefly, Sánchez’s contributions are notable for their Trumpian self-aggrandisement: “I was the best shot. I shot better than anyone else,” he says of his formative months at a PFLP training camp. “The only person who could maybe direct such an operation in such a short time is … Carlos!” he claims, talking about how silly Col Gaddafi hadn’t left enough time to plan his attack on the Opec meeting, so Sánchez graciously bailed him out.The tapes also reveal Sánchez to be quite the creepy misogynist. He looks to reinforce the legend that he is a philanderer by commenting on the quality of the women in the many countries he’s lived in, an observation that usually comes with an approving reference to how “clean” these conquests were. The love of his life, Frankfurt Revolutionary Cells member Magdalena Kopp, receives the special accolade “very clean, everywhere”.It might seem trivial to worry about the icky gender politics of a mass-murdering mercenary, but this guy has been romanticised as international terrorism’s answer to James Bond – a man of mystery as suave as he is elusive. Close up, he gives off loner vibes, and the photos we see of his various guises don’t burnish his cool-villain credentials, either: he almost always looks like a beady uncle whom female guests have to avoid at a wedding disco. The picture that has become an icon, where he’s wearing wraparound shades, is the only one where he looks badass. The story was that the people employed to keep us safe were given the runaround by a unique force of evil, a ghost; it now seems they actually spent years chasing a loser.The Jackal Speaks: Inside the Mind of a Mass Murderer aired on BBC Four and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewCarlos the JackalreviewsShareReuse this content"

You’ll never look at a loo brush the same wayRachel AroestiTue 3 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 12.29 EDTShareThe title suggests a generic experience of nascent womanhood, but What It Feels Like for a Girl is miles from your typical female bildungsroman. This adaptation of journalist Paris Lees’ excellent memoir about growing up in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire (or ’Ucknall, as the book, with its mesmeric phonetic dialect, has it) chronicles the coming-of-age of Byron, who is seen by others as a boy. Initially, our protagonist doesn’t really push back on that; despite some early gender dysphoria – angrily dismissed by their macho father – the prospect of one day openly living as a woman is completely outside their frame of reference. (Lees herself prefers to use “they/them” for Byron now.) On a visit to a nightclub, Byron (Ellis Howard) encounters future friend Lady Die, who makes a joke about someone being a transsexual. “What’s a transsexual?” asks Byron – smiling, mystified.This is the early 00s, you see: pre Nadia’s Big Brother win, although a couple of years post Hayley Cropper’s Corrie debut. Still, in terms of the general public’s comprehension of trans issues, it is the dark ages. (Thanks to the current Y2K fashion renaissance, however, the aesthetics are positively aspirational: dumbphones, chokers, FCUK slogan tees, Kappa tracksuits.) Yet Byron’s eventual gender transition isn’t what makes this an extraordinary and at times deeply disturbing account of a partly misspent youth. The reason 15-year-old Byron is at the aforementioned club in the first place is because they are searching for their erstwhile boyfriend Max (Sweetpea’s Calam Lynch). But Max isn’t just Byron’s first love – he’s also their pimp. A chance encounter in a public toilet introduced Byron to cottaging; they then begin performing sex acts on strangers for money. Byron’s success in the field – and enthusiasm for the job – means they are soon headhunted by Max to meet the demands of wealthier clients.View image in fullscreenThe Fallen Divas … Laquarn Lewis as Lady Die, Hannah Jones as Sasha, Ellis Howard as Byron, Alex Thomas-Smith as Sticky Nikki, Adam Ali as Dirty Damian.Photograph: Photographer: Enda Bowe/Enda BoweYet when Max is warned off by the underage Byron’s usually uninterested mother, our hero finds solace in a raucous bunch of like-minded trans and queer pals, who call themselves the Fallen Divas. They live in a nocturnal Nottingham underworld of copious drugs and endless trysts; Byron has a voracious appetite for both. One love interest, the intimidating Liam, is also secretly a sex worker and has a brilliant idea: why don’t the pair rob a particularly pervy patron at gunpoint? Unfortunately for them both, it’s not the perfect crime Liam thinks it is.What passes as fun for Byron – servicing grotty men in grotty bogs, and risking life and limb in the process – will probably look like a living nightmare to others. But we must consider the context: beforehand, Byron’s life involved being constantly attacked for being a “bender”, both by local meatheads and their seething father (Michael Socha), who seems to view Byron’s effeminate ways as a threat to his own masculinity. Byron’s mum (Laura Haddock) might not be so aggressively disapproving, but she is selfish and neglectful. Until Byron meets the Fallen Divas, their beloved grandmother – or “Mommar” – is their only safe space.View image in fullscreenClever, arrogant and absurdly vicious … Ellis Howard as Byron in What it Feels Like for a Girl.Photograph: Hera Pictures/BBC‘All of us felt like we had touched gold’: What It Feels Like for a Girl, the BBC’s electric coming-of-age taleRead moreDespite this – and the fact they are repeatedly groomed and exploited by older men – Byron never comes across as a victim. We are not invited to pick holes in the fearlessness they display when propositioning a police officer while sporting a wig and mini dress. Once Byron starts regularly dressing in women’s clothes, sex takes on a new meaning. Risky, borderline violent encounters aren’t self-destructive – they’re self-affirmative, an opportunity to achieve something crucial: “pride that he actually thinks I’m a girl,” as Lady Die puts it.Byron’s personality also repels any underdog narrative: clever, arrogant and almost absurdly vicious, they are a natural when it comes to drag queen-esque bravado and acerbic wit. But they are also often just plain horrible – delighting in highlighting trans pal Sasha’s “big fucking hands” – and soon friends old and new begin to sever ties. This feels like a satisfying comeuppance. It is tricky to sympathise with a protagonist so bolshie, self-obsessed and eager to bring others down. Yet Byron is easy to admire, and – via a screen, at least – good company; Howard is charismatic and convincing in the role.The series concludes on a relatively conventional note: a redemptive spell inside, a devastating death and a fresh start. It feels like a spoonful of sugar after a resolutely unsentimental tale of a chaotic, morally ambiguous period of transition. It’s certainly a wild ride – I’ll struggle to look at a toilet brush the same way ever again – but if you stay on board until the end, a memorably complex psychological portrait will be your reward.What It Feels Like for a Girl is on BBC iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTransgenderSexualityreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her gravestone declares her a poet; posterity knows her as the author of 22 short, indelibly strange and subversive novels. In life, she was by turns an editor, critic, biographer, playwright, Jewish Gentile, Catholic convert, divorcee, abandoning mother, spy. As Frances Wilson observes in this canny biography, she looks in every photograph as if she is played by a different actor, so drastic are the changes in her face and style. From precocious Edinburgh schoolgirl to unhappy Rhodesian wife, spirited London bohemian to poised Roman socialite, Spark made an art of unsettling transformations. She was the queen of narrative control, not least the narrative of her own life.She was also the enemy of biographers, a pursuer of lawsuits who managed to delay the publication of her own authorised biography by seven years (“a hatchet job; full of insults”, she said, unjustly), and went to war with the former lover who wrote two accounts of her life. And yet she didn’t hide her traces, leaving for researchers not one but two vast archives, of her personal papers and her working process, neatly organised in box files that total the length of an Olympic swimming pool.It’s Wilson’s belief that Spark was playing a cat and mouse game with the future, packing her novels with clues and cryptic mementoes from her own past. Rather than the conventional cradle to grave, Wilson’s focus here is on the first 39 years of Spark’s life, culminating in the publication of her debut novel, The Comforters,in 1957: “the years of turbulence, when everything was piled on”. This doesn’t mean that later masterpieces like A Far Cry from Kensington or Loitering With Intent are ignored, but rather mined for evidence of their real-life antecedents. Time slips and shuttles, fittingly for a writer who was such a master of prolepsis, those devastating little glimpses into the future that make novels like The Driver’s Seat and The Girls of Slender Means so uncanny.A formidable student, whose first poem was anthologised at the age of 12, Camberg didn’t go to university. Her parents – ordinary class, in her estimation – were too poor, and so instead she took a precis-writing course and a position in a school, where she learned shorthand in lieu of pay. Her next job was as a secretary, this time for hard cash, which she spent on the jazz dances at which she met her future husband, Sydney Oswald Spark, known as Ossie. “I thought him interesting,” she said, and: “I didn’t know that a girl could break away and get herself a flat.”It wasn’t a happy marriage. Ossie had failed to mention that he was subject to violent paranoia, under psychiatric care, and no longer employable as a teacher in Britain due to his erratic behaviour. In 1937, the couple married in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, now Harare, Zimbabwe. By Christmas she was pregnant and trapped amid the stultifying, amoral racism of the settlers. “He was camouflaged in the colony,” Wilson writes of Ossie, “in the sense that his illness, which took the form of berserk and violent outbursts, was indistinguishable from the berserk and violent outbursts of those settlers who didn’t suffer from Ossie’s condition.” After he tried to shoot Muriel, she escaped with her two-year-old son Robin and his nanny.Brilliant, beautiful and disinclined to conceal her talent or ambition, Spark was much desired and much despised in LondonThe war meant it took her five years to get home. She left Robin in a Catholic boarding school, and fled via Cape Town. Though she eventually managed to get Robin to Edinburgh, where he was raised by her parents, she would never live with him again. This is considered one of the Great Crimes of Muriel, along with the supposed fact that she concealed her identity as a Jew. It was Robin, victim of the first, who was her accuser in the second. In adulthood he converted to Orthodoxy, and announced to the world that Spark’s mother was not a Gentile but a Jewish convert (her father was Jewish, a fact she hadn’t concealed). Nonsense, retorted Spark, salting the wound by saying of her only child: “He’s never done anything for me except for being one big bore.” But her cruelty conceals the desperate attempts she made in London to find herself a job and a new husband, so that she could get custody and provide a home for her young son. The law, in its wisdom, had granted custody to a violent man in psychiatric care rather than the woman who fled from him.Brilliant, beautiful and disinclined to conceal her talent or ambition, Spark was much desired and much despised in London. After working in black propaganda during the war, she became general secretary of the Poetry Society and soon after editor of its journal, the Poetry Review. The society was an internecine and antiquated establishment that she attempted to drag into the 20th century. This was not a success. Her close encounter with irrationality and malevolence, which later provided satirical material for Loitering With Intent, left her isolated and determined to make her own way as a writer.Before the novels began, Spark underwent one last enormous transformation. In the early 1950s, she suffered a breakdown, precipitated by her use of Dexedrine as a diet pill, and converted to Catholicism. From now on God was in charge, even if her faith was distinctly unconventional. She believed in angels and liked miracles, but was pro-choice, didn’t go to confession, and tended to skip the tedium of the sermon, arriving just in time for the eucharist.It’s interesting that Wilson describes Spark as being unable to grasp that misogyny was her real enemy, the disguised combatant behind many of her episodes of paranoia. She certainly saw it in her books. It’s hard to think of a more knowing account of male violence against women than her short story The Portobello Road, with its beyond-the-grave narrator, murdered in a haystack. I suspect the real reason Spark didn’t participate in the struggles of feminism was that she believed the earthly world would always be divided into the powerful and the powerless, and that her task was to record the struggle. Laughter was her weapon, a purifying absurdity – a “derisive undermining of what was wrong,” as she once put it. Give them enough rope and they’ll hang themselves, you feel her thinking, the pompous and the cruel, the self-serving and self-deceiving.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

To read them is to be inducted into a code, to move between the lines, to grasp both the stock phrase and the terrible unsaid that lurks behind it. Pleasurable and interesting as this biography is, it feels as if it misses the point of the impersonal in Spark’s approach. Her own life is in there, for sure, but distilled into its purest form, which is to say a human comedy, where dark forces seem to triumph, unaware that they are being skewered by a sharp and all-seeing eye.Olivia Laing’s new novel, The Silver Book, will be published in November.

In this case, it’s Poppie Jae Hughes, having the time of her life hissing and snarling, caked in makeup and rocking some evil looking prosthetic fangs. Perhaps Hughes outclasses the adults so easily because her role doesn’t require much in the way of dialogue. The rest of the cast are mostly British actors hamming it up with absurd sounding “southern” American accents that range widely across the territory below the Mason-Dixon line. Compelled to deliver way more dialogue than they can feasibly handle given their meagre performing skills, it’s not pretty.Otherwise this is a cheap as chips but not unamusing farrago that unfolds in a wee vampire community known as Bogieville, a trailer park where visitors either become lunch or never leave. The latter seems to be the fate of unlucky couple Ham (Arifin Putra) and Jody (Eloise Lovell Anderson) who stumble on Bogieville accidentally, and are chosen by the sole non-vampiric resident, caretaker Crawford (Hanathan Hansler), to look after the community after he dies someday. While the young lovers are subjected to vast wodges of verbal exposition and clunky flashbacks from Crawford, the film occasionally cuts away to the police and a doctor (Angela Dixon) who have cottoned on to the bloodsuckers’ presence in the vicinity and are out to hunt them down.Director Sean Cronin also plays Bogieville’s undead leader; every line of his dialogue is rendered in a subsonic, incomprehensible growl, which sort of goes for his directing style too. At least the makeup and the gore effects are competently executed, making the ensemble look like blood smeared meat-puppets on a rampage.Bogieville is on digital platforms from 9 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

We’ll have our final episode sometime in the fall.”Maron says he and his producer, Brendan McDonald, are “tired” and “burnt out” but “utterly satisfied with the work we’ve done”.Marc Maron: ‘I’m familiar with coke, anger, bullying, selfishness’Read moreWhen he began WTF in 2009, Maron was a veteran standup comic whose radio show on Air America had just been cancelled: he used his keycard to sneak into Air America’s studios to record the first episodes of WTF without them knowing,before setting up a studio his garage. In its earliest days, WTF was a space in which Maron aired his insecurities about his career, his divorce and worked out his feelings with fellow comedians who he felt had essentially left him behind.But as Maron opened up more about himself – his upbringing, his struggles with drug addiction and his romantic relationships – the show became less about his cranky resentments and more about how creative people find personal fulfilment. Actors, directors and musicians began coming on more and Maron’s deceptively simple, slightly rambling interviewing style encouraged even the most famous guests to tell stories they’d not shared before.If you have a bit of time to kill, there are more than 1,600 WTF episodes out there waiting for you (though the older ones are behind a paywall). The best ones are usually with (male) comedians (Conan O’Brien, Mel Brooks and Norm Macdonald all almost made the list); the worst ones include Courtney Love and Ben Kingsley. But here are five of the best:View image in fullscreenThen US president Barack Obama recording a WTF episode in Maron’s garage in Los Angeles.Photograph: Pete Souza/The White HouseFive of the best Marc Maron interviews1.Barack Obama(episode 613, 2015)It had to be here. This episode arguably redefined podcasting, turning it into a serious medium that was powerful enough to lure a sitting US president to a Los Angeles garage to discuss fatherhood, racism and gun control. Just as good is the following episode, titledThe President Was Here, in which Maron and McDonald unload about the strange experience of having the secret service sweep in.2.Robin Williams(episode 67, 2010)This emotional 2010 interview with Williams, in which he talks about his struggles with depression, alcoholism and suicidal thoughts, was rereleased on the day of Williams’ death in 2014 with a new introduction by Maron. The episode earned a place in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress.3.Louis CK(episodes 111 and 112, 2010)Over two hours in 2010, Maron and his fellow comedian, Louis CK, famously recorded what was essentially a therapy session in which the two former friends unpicked why they had drifted apart. CK felt Maron had abandoned him during some tough times; Maron admitted his professional envy over CK’s stratospheric rise. (This was seven years beforeCK admitted to masturbating in front of women without their consent.) “You’re letting me down as a friend, by being jealous,” CK tells him. “I could’ve used you. I got divorced. I got a show cancelled … but you shut me out because you were having a hard time.”Slate called it the best podcast episode of all time; Maron himself said he didn’t think it was a great interview but said: “It helped me a lot as a person.”4.Lynn Shelton(episode 627, 2015)This episode marked the first time Maron met Shelton, a indie film-maker. She was married and he was dating someone else, but you can hear them clicking in real time; Maron is audibly charmed by her vivacity. They later fell in love and stayed together untilher sudden death in 2020from a previously unidentified blood disorder, aged 54. A couple of days after her death, Maron rereleased the interview – which WTF always does when a previous guest dies, but this stood out for his deeply emotional introduction in which he talked about why he loved her. “I don’t even know if I should be out in public talking,” he says, “but this is what I do.”5.David Spade(episode 669, 2016)Most people will know Spade as either Joe Dirt or the horny guy in Just Shoot Me but the episode is a true all-timer – partly for revealing how funny Spade is when he’s just being himself, but also for the astonishing story he tells about the time he was attacked by his personal assistant in his own home, having to bar himself in the bathroom with a shotgun. “I had him down to two days a week after that,” Spade says.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsDigital mediaInternetComedyBarack ObamaRobin WilliamsLouis CKfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is also the author of a memoir published this week titled I’ll Tell You When I’m Home.To pre-empt a skeptical raised eyebrow over a memoir at 38, be assured: this is an unusual book. It is a story of the violence of exile over generations, a profound desire for motherhood, as well as surrogacy, addiction and the importance of remembering. The book is also a rumination on the nature of memoir and the often impossible attempts to reclaim and understand one’s past.The cover of Hala Alyan’s book I’ll Tell you When I’m Home features the lower half of a woman’s face and a picture of rubble in a fieldAlyan was born in the United States, and though she has never lived inPalestine, early in the memoir, she writes:I have never not been a Palestinian. That has never not been written upon my body. In Lebanon, in Kuwait, in Oklahoma – I am what my father is, and my father is a man who was once a boy who was born to a woman in Gaza. Who speaks with the accent of that place.Her paternal grandparents were displaced in 1948 from Iraq Sweidan and al-Majdal – Palestinian villages that are today considered part of, or near, the city of Ashkelon inIsrael. Her father moved to Kuwait in 1958 where he met Hala’s mother, and when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, they were uprooted again. This story of ongoing migration is common to so many millions of Palestinians, and the book explores the intergenerational trauma of displacement so deeply felt in her own family.Alyan’s two novels, The Arsonists’ City,and Salt Houses,deal with the legacy of war in the Middle East, as do many poems in her five collections of poetry. The memoir, however, is by far her most personal, and confessional.How to explain being Palestinian and American? You must disavow the former to prove the latterHala AlyanAlyan’s body is central to this story. Herheart-shaped uterusappeals to her poetic side, but it does not do the job it is intended for. After five longed-for and failed pregnancies, including an ectopic one, her decision to opt for surrogacy leads to this memoir, in both content and form. It is structured over nine chapters, nine months during which she waits for the birth of her biological child, growing in the body of another woman, thousands of miles away in Canada. It was a time when she felt disassociated from her own body, unable to do what she desired most, unsure if her marriage would survive.Her impulse was to write, to piece together different fragments of her life, including self-destructive phases of alcohol addiction, as well as the lives of those who came before her, particularly her grandmothers.View image in fullscreenIsraeli military tanks and vehicles idling in the dirt outside of a destroyed building in Gaza, November 1967. Alyan’s memoir, I’ll Tell You When I’m Home, explores the intergenerational trauma of displacement.Photograph: Morse Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesIt is a story of war and loss – of country, but also of friends, lovers and ultimately her marriage. And her fertility journey mirrors some of this in microcosm: a uterus that cannot sustain a fetus to term is in some senses a body at war with itself. Her story of surrogacy becomes a metaphor for exile.And it is in the forefront of Alyan’s mind that her book is published at this heightened moment for Palestine, with Palestinians in Gaza not just dying from starvation and bombs, but living with the continuous threat of displacement and expulsion – a relentless repetition of history.When I meet Alyan in her Brooklyn apartment, littered with the toys of her now three-year-old daughter, Leila, she explains what having a child means to her. It is a “gift to steward something, to be of service to something”, she says. “I think I say in the book, I wanted to matter less. I wanted something to matter more.”She is also aware that the joy of a much-wanted child is set against the lineage she is a part of, as both American and Palestinian. And that, she says, “feels terrible”.The previous ease in our chatter, punctuated by laughter, tea and biscotti, turns to a faster and more urgent conversation relating to Washington’s support forIsrael.She writes in the book: “How to explain being Palestinian and American? You must disavow the former to prove the latter. You exist in both identities like a ghost, belonging to neither.”When I ask her about this, she says that while she is fully aware of US complicity inIsrael’s actions in Gaza, “I have nevertheless been startled awake by every veto hand raised at the UN, every new bill to send billions to Israel. But much more the silence, and then the vitriol, and then indifference, and in some the genuine desire for more dead Palestinians.”More than 600 days on, her question for America today is stark: “Just how many slaughtered Palestinians are enough slaughtered Palestinians?”View image in fullscreen‘Just how many slaughtered Palestinians are enough slaughtered Palestinians?’ asks Alyan.Photograph: Kholood Eid/The GuardianIn the midst of the slaughter is another erasure – that of the stories of Palestinians, and Alyan’s book contributes in a modest way towards restoration. We tell and read stories to make sense of the world, to amend our bewilderment. In some ways, the stories we tell are a record of existence and survival. Alyan reminds me of a potent moment a few weeks post-October 7, in which a photograph, shared widely, showed a whiteboard in a hospital inundated with mass casualties. The upcoming surgeries were wiped clean and replaced with words written in blue marker, by Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, a Doctors without Borders medic: “Whoever stays till the end will tell the story. We did what we could. Remember us.”When you decimate the universities, you blow up libraries [...] you’re acknowledging that stories matterHala AlyanOur conversation turns to what each of us can do, in the face of the gravity of the situation in Gaza. Bearing witness is the bare minimum, and for Alyan, what matters is what makes a good witness, especially in a climate of fear. By now, she tells me, no one can say they don’t know what is happening in Gaza. “The person who sees and stays silent or looks away is useless,” she says. “The purpose of a witness is someone who is articulate, unswayed by fear or threats.”One reason why this matters is the relationship between erasure and archive. On this point, she is at her most passionate. “When you are eradicating children, you are cutting off the story just as it is starting to be told, and in the assault on elders, you are eradicating the history, the memory, the archive,” she says. “When you decimate the universities, you blow up libraries, you get rid of the poets, the journalists, anyone who holds a kind of collective memory, you’re acknowledging that stories matter, memory matters. It is a systematic intention to do this. And what you are left with are fragments and so you have to do something with the fragments.”What she does with the fragments is recast them, sometimes presenting them as they are. In some of her poems, she redacts words, highlights some and keeps others in faded relief. Her memoir is a series of vignettes that go back and forth in time, in a writing style that is frantic, questioning and lyrical, designed to help the reader enter the darkest corners with the writer, almost inside her consciousness.View image in fullscreenOutbuilding structures and telephone poles in Gaza, November 1967. ‘I am what my father is, and my father is a man who was once a boy who was born to a woman in Gaza. Who speaks with the accent of that place,’ Alyan writes.Photograph: Morse Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesAmong the unflinching accounts of self-destruction and alcoholic blackouts is one that occurs in Mexico City, when she is barhopping alone after years of sobriety, flirting with a stranger. Her phone is dead and her husband is frantically trying to reach her. She recalls looking in the bathroom mirror of one bar:It is the strangest thing: remembering the self. Remembering the self you evicted. I want. I want. There was something that screamed and there was something that could muffle it. I’ve not kept on nodding terms with this girl; I buried her, or thought I had. And here she was, 12 years later, and all her messy glory, hurling her laugh across the room like an arrow. She was awake after 100 years of slumber. She was hungry. She was taking the whole city down with her. I look into the mirror, blurred from drink. I blow a kiss. She blows one back. There it was. I’d wanted to do it and now I’d done it.The memoir revisits two foundational stories in the eastern and western canon, One Thousand and One Nights and Homer’s Odyssey.Alyan is drawn to Scheherazade, who saves herself night after nightfall by telling the king cliff-hanging tales. For her, these are “archetypes of waiting, of survival narratives”, which connect her to her own excavation of storytelling; a delicate weaving, attempting to connect the threads of her life to a bigger tapestry.‘I am not there and I am not here’: a Palestinian American poet on bearing witness to atrocityRead moreIt is primarily women who help her do that: grandmothers, aunts, her mother, the surrogate, Scheherazade, Penelope. They all have superpowers, she says, and when I ask her what hers is, she says: truth-telling.She theorizes that Scheherazade was probably the first female psychotherapist in history, because she transformed “the passive female listener into a storyteller. She told, and her telling rehabilitated.”And then there is the shattering truth that the current moment – what Israel is doing to Palestinians in Gaza – defies expression, let alone rehabilitation through storytelling and remembering.As a psychologist, Alyan knows that post-traumatic healing can only come when the trauma ends. And alongside it, she says, a reckoning for Israel and those who supported its actions, as well as those who saw and stayed silent.This article was amended on 3 June 2025 to correct details of Hala Alyan’s account of her time in Mexico City that appear in her memoir."

In dizzying detail, Baker charts and reports the chaos. In interludes, she examines the dark history of a city long linked to racist oppression, from the days of Thomas Jefferson, Robert E Lee and slavery to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and resistance to civil rights reform.Putting it all together was a new challenge for a writer whose books include In Extremis, a biography of the 20th-century poet Laura Riding, and A Blue Hand: The Beats in India.I crisscrossed America to talk to people whose views I disagreed with. I now have one certaintyRead more“As a literary biographer, a narrative nonfiction writer, I mostly work out of archives and libraries and letters and diaries and things like that,” Baker said. “And of course, for this, there wasn’t anything like that in a library or institution. So I had to make my own archive, which involved the interviews I did with around 100 people but also old Twitter streams.”Many such streams were shot by progressive protesters and citizen journalists who rallied with local clergy and citizenry against the white supremacists, neo-Nazis, Klansmen, militiamen and alt-right provocateurs who descended on their town.Theycamebecause the city government had voted to remove a statue of Lee the slave-owning Confederate general who lost the civil war – a reminder that national debate over racism and US history long predated the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the turmoil that followed.As Baker shows, tensionsflickered and spatin Charlottesville for months, the town riven by internal disagreements, democracy playing out its messy truths in endless rallies and meetings about what to do with the statues and the version of history they told.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: APThen came the night of 11 August, when khaki-clad white men carrying tiki torches chanted “Jews will not replace us” as theymarched to a statueof Jefferson on the grounds of the University of Virginia. The next day, a “Unite the Right” rally produced hours of frenetic face-offs and the awful moment when a white supremacist used his car to drive into counter-protesters, injuring 35 and killing one,Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal.“The prospect of talking to not just living people, and asking them questions about this deeply traumatic event in the center of their lives just made me quail,” Baker said. “It’s one thing reading people’s private letters and diaries, and especially dead people. It’s completely different when you’re actually faced with a person, someone who’s half your age, who’s grown up in a world that’s as foreign to you as India might be to an American.”Baker is 66. Many of those who marched against the right in Charlottesville, if by no means all, are 30 years younger or more. Writing their stories meant understanding their worldviews.“I was just learning about the parameters of an online existence that was very unfamiliar to me,” Baker said. “Luckily, I had people who were very patient with my learning curve.“I didn’t know what this historical period was. It was very hard for me to understand the present. I thought certain things were assumed. You know, that Nazis were bad. We figured that one out, I thought. I guess you have to keep refreshing that narrative.”Married to the writer Amitav Ghosh, Baker splits her time between Brooklyn and Charlottesville. But as the subtitle to to her book says, in writing about her home town she also set out to write “An American Story”, particularly about the rise of the far right underDonald Trump.When she started writing, in the first days of 2021, Trump had been beaten by Joe Biden. It seemed the far right had reached its high-water mark: the deadly January 6 attack on Congress. But manytraced paths from the Capitol back to Charlottesville, particularly to the moment when Trump failed to disown the rightwingers who marched in his name.Baker writes: “For those watching around the world, Charlottesville’s fate as the global synonym for ‘white supremacy’ and ‘white nationalism’ was sealed when the president of the United Statesdeclaredthere were ‘very fine people on both sides.’View image in fullscreenWhite nationalist demonstrators walk into Lee park surrounded by counter-demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, on 12 August 2017.Photograph: Steve Helber/AP“Hedoubled downseveral days later to describe the violence of an imaginary ‘alt-left’ … Trump’s remarks seemed to open the gates of hell. The next 18 months saw a surge in white supremacist violence across the country.”Trump left office butfar-right violence continued. Trump didn’t leave the stage either. Seven years after Charlottesville, he is back in the White House, attacking anything in government seen to even acknowledge the US’s racist past, using claims of “white genocide” to importwhite Afrikaners.“American democracy was failing the whole time I was writing,” Baker said, “and I didn’t realize that it could fall that much further. And obviously it’s falling very fast now.”She notes how policeviolently broke uppro-Palestinian protests at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville last year, aggressive behavior in stark contrast to restraint shown to the white supremacists who marched eight years ago.She wonders about the effect her book might have on people “that didn’t quite register what happened in Trump’s first term, and about the sense of deja vu not only with 2017 but also these other periods of history which we have conveniently forgotten or swept under the rug, whether it’s the Klan or the White Citizens Councils”, groups that sprang up in the 1950s, in opposition to attempts to end segregation.In the historical sections of her book, Baker considers famous figures including Lee, and particularly Jefferson, who lived at Monticello above Charlottesville anddesignedthe UVA campus.She also provides studies of some now forgotten. Prominent among them is John Kasper, an esoteric young demagogue, close to the fascistic poet Ezra Pound, whostaged cross burnings in Charlottesvillein the 1950s. Kasper died in 1998, long bypassed by history. But as Baker studied the resurgence of a far-right threat she had thought long buried, so she sensed echoes including something of Kasper in the polished figure of Richard Spencer, the “alt-right” leader who achieved a sort of national prominence around events in Charlottesville in 2017.“They’re like doppelgangers,” Baker said. “You know: kneejerk contrarianism, superficiality, really just hunger for fame and attention.”View image in fullscreenWwhite nationalist groups march with torches through the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville, on 11 August 2017.Photograph: Mykal McEldowney/APSpencer also saw his star fade. The Lee statue, and other contentious Charlottesville monuments, finallydid come down.The statue of Lee and his horse, Traveler, is “the only one that has been actually destroyed”, Baker said. “The rest of them are all in storage rooms, or they’ve been moved to battlefields. I’m glad this one is gone. It really is due to this group of Charlottesville women who were very set on not justmelting it down and destroying itbut set out to make some new kind of art and give to the city.”One day soon, via theSwords Into Plowsharesproject, the bronze once used in the statue of Lee will form something new.Baker is under no illusion that the far right is defeated. Four months into Trump’s second White House term, she is “surprised that I haven’t seen more violence already”.“I think there was a kind of giddiness when he was first elected,” she said, describing “a sense that they had their presence. They did these marches for Trump. They had their boat rallies. They had their truck rallies. They had their guy.“There hasn’t been as much of that so far this time. That isn’t the form that it’s taking. Maybe they just don’t feel like they have to be so active.”Charlottesville isout nowExplore more on these topicsBooksRaceHistory booksVirginiaThe far rightFar right (US)Donald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The social and political turbulence of the decade provides the perfect landscape for Claire Lynch’s dual-timeline debut novel A Family Matter, which alternates between 1982 and the present day. On the surface, it is the story of a father-daughter relationship. Heron – an elderly man deeply fond of rules and routine – has recently received a terminal cancer diagnosis, but rather than share it with his grownup daughter, Maggie, who now has a family of her own, he chooses to bear the burden alone. As we learn that Heron raised Maggie by himself, it’s clear this urge to shield his only child from harm is a continuous theme. There is no mention of another parent, just that Heron was divorced many decades ago; it’s only when Lynch takes us back to 1982 that we discover the true story.When Maggie was a toddler, her 23-year-old mother, Dawn, met another woman at a jumble sale. It was a chance encounter, and they clicked. Hazel, a newly qualified primary school teacher, had recently moved to the town, and Dawn was flustered by Hazel’s obvious life experience, feeling that “her mouth was full of all the things she would say if she wasn’t too embarrassed to put herself into words”. Hazel is equally smitten, and as the intensity between the two women grows, it isn’t long before their friendship develops into a romance. A secret romance to begin with, not just because Dawn is married to Heron and her life is dedicated to their beloved Maggie, but because 1980s provincial Britain was far more attached to the idea of a nuclear family than it was to the concept of true love. “You wanted to collect the set, the wedding, the house, the baby?” Hazel asks. “I didn’t know you were allowed not to,” Dawn replies.The brutal and savage words spoken during Maggie’s custody hearing are taken from real-life court transcriptsProvincial secrets, however, have a habit of escaping, and inevitably Dawn must explain herself to Heron, because her sexuality was “something she had always known, as deep and bright as bone”. A product of his environment, Heron’s reaction is predictable. Tempers flare. Locks are changed. Solicitors are consulted. Both Dawn and Heron are swept along by a system clinging to the archaic belief that a child exposed to same-sex relationships will become damaged. In the custody court, Heron puts his trust in “the men wearing cufflinks”, while Dawn wonders “what combination of arms and eyes and mouth will keep her from looking ashamed”.Present-day Maggie, now with her own (often less than perfect) nuclear family, has no knowledge of her parents’ ancient battle. She just knows that Dawn left, and Heron stayed. However, when terminally ill Heron’s attempts atSwedish death cleaningunearth long-forgotten court documents, Maggie must reframe being abandoned by her mother in the face of this newly found truth.From Zadie Smith’sWhite Teethto Douglas Stuart’sShuggie Bain, literature is peppered with compelling tales of homophobia and prejudice in the 1980s. It is a decade slowly edging closer to being classed as historical fiction, a soothing balm perhaps. However, in this small and powerful story, Lynch forces us to stare bigotry in the eye. She does this not only with smart and often heartbreaking observations of human behaviour, but also by weaving in difficult truths. Her author’s note reveals that the brutal and savage words spoken during Maggie’s custody hearing are taken from real-life court transcripts. At the time, almost all lesbian mothers involved in divorce cases like Dawn’s lost legal custody of their children.One of the most important roles of a writer is to give a platform to those less often noticed. Not only does Lynch’s novel lend a voice to the many thousands of people who were forced to remain silent, bound by the prejudice of “different times”, it shouts that injustice from its pages.A Family Matter by Claire Lynch is published by Chatto & Windus (£16.99).

Who could have foretold that the hero of the PlayStation launch would be a fireworks simulation (Fantavision), or that the most joyous title in the initial GameCube lineup would involve simians racing each other in giant transparent globes (Super Monkey Ball)?The latest example could well be Konami’s Survival Kids, the only new third-party game in the Switch 2 opening wave. It’s the latest in the publisher’s cult series of tropical island survival sims, which began on the Game Boy Color and, despite never really attracting vast global success, continued on to theNintendoDS under a new name, Lost in Blue. Now it’s back as a familyfriendly co-op survival adventure, in which groups of up to four players are shipwrecked on a mysterious archipelago, and must survive by gathering resources, crafting tools, finding food and exploring a series of lush, cartoonish environments. Four people can play online, but the game also supports Switch 2’s game sharing, which lets one person who owns the game connect wirelessly with other consoles to play together.View image in fullscreenLush, cartoonish environments … a still from Survival Kids.Photograph: Konami Digital EntertainmentAndrew Dennison, who heads the game’s developer Unity, sees this as one of the Switch 2’s key features. “With splitscreen you have one machine rendering two different versions of the game,” he says. “With GameShare, we can compress one of those views and stream it … we render everything three times and push that out to two other consoles. As much as you can deep dive into tech specs, the benefits of GameShare are delightful. Other players in the same room as you don’t have to own the game, they don’t have to download anything … they can just turn on their Switch or Switch 2, push a button and they’re playing a game.”Unlike survival titles such as Don’t Starve or Project Zomboid (or indeed Lost in Blue), there’s no mortal peril in Survival Kids. Running out of food hampers your progress, but you can’t actually starve; if you die, you just – respawn nearby. “We wanted to make sure the game was enjoyable for people at every skill level,” says Dennison. “It’s a balancing act – we don’t want to bore experienced gamers – but you can streamline gameplay challenge without simplifying to the point of making it irrelevant.” Due to the strict NDAs around the Switch 2 hardware, the developer couldn’t bring in many external testers to fine-tune the difficulty – so Dennison ended up testing the game on his nieces, and on the finance department.View image in fullscreenAll about co-operation … Survival KidsPhotograph: Konami Digital EntertainmentBuilding tools is key – combine a vine and a stick and you get a fishing rod with which to lasso useful objects. Construct an umbrella and you can glide across wide canyons. There are no cumbersome item-inventory screens: when you need to build a tool or contraption, you can take what you need and drop it all into a bucket that magically spits it out. Tools are all stored at base camp, not in a menu, so that you can easily take a path home to pick up what you need.As with Overcooked, Survival Kids is all about streamlined cooperation and carefully divvied-out tasks. Chopping wood and breaking rocks is faster with two people, so you need a physical labour team; meanwhile food provides the energy needed to climb cliff faces and carry heavy relics, so you’ll need a chef to gather plants and make dinner. “We really wanted people to go back and eat at the base camp together,” says Richard Jones, creative director for Konami Digital Entertainment. “This way, the base camp becomes a place to return to – a sort of communal kitchen.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s also possible to go back and re-try levels to get a quicker time. Despite the family look and feel, there are some interesting and quite demanding physics-based challenges with multiple solutions. There’s a nice humour and lightness to the game as well, perhaps an inevitability considering that Dennison and many of the development team at Unity’s Stratford-upon-Avon office came from Codemasters and Rare.Will Konami bring more of its classic titles to Switch 2? “We know there are other Konami teams who are interested in this platform – we’ll be able to help them,” says Jones. “So yeah, fingers-crossed we’ll see some more Switch 2 projects from Konami.” For now Survival kids feels like a great test case for the new console’s family oriented game sharing.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendoNintendo SwitchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does this remind you of anyone?Hamad Butt is the Damien Hirst who got away, the Young British Artist of the 1990s who didn’t win the Turner prize, make millions or lose his youthful talent and turn into a bloated mediocrity. Now he is a cult figure precisely because he is none of those things and can instead be presented as if he was a complete unknown, whose art expresses his queer Pakistani identity rather than being part of afin-de-siecleart movement of sensation and creepy science. I couldn’t find any reference, even in the moving array of Butt’s working documents on show, to the fact he studied at Goldsmiths alongside Hirst, Collishaw, Wearing and more.If we need to detach this brilliant artist from that generation to celebrate him, it’s better than forgetting his work. But as soon as you walk into this convincing retrospective you’re back in 1992. Occupying the whole of the Whitechapel’s main ground floor gallery is Butt’s three-part installation Familiars. Like a giant executive toy, spherical glass vessels are suspended from the ceiling by thin threads in a long row. Pull the first one back, as it is weirdly tempting to do, and you’d set them going by action and reaction. Except it would surely shatter these vessels and kill you, or at least make you very ill.The coloured gas inside each sphere is mustard-coloured, as in mustard gas. This is gaseous chlorine, first used as a chemical weapon by Germany in 1915 and in these static, sealed bottles it looks lovely, golden, glowing in the gallery lights.It’s disturbing but, let’s be honest, darkly thrilling to be only a thin glass wall away from a first world war soldier’s death here in an art gallery. To put it another way it’s sublime. One of the sculptures in this installation is actually entitled Substance Sublimation Unit, a play on chemistry and aesthetics.The other two elements of this epic sculpture look equally hazardous: a ladder with rungs that light up with blazing gas like a stairway to hell, and three curving, blood-red glowing spikes.View image in fullscreenBeauty and violence in a gallery … Hamad Butt: Apprehensions, Whitechapel Gallery, London.Photograph: Damian GriffithsTo feel such beauty and violence in a gallery may strike you as shockingly new or oddly nostalgic. In the archives room there’s a 1995 Jak cartoon from the Evening Standard, depicting a dodgy geezer selling gas masks outside the Tate – a reference to a leak from this installation when it was in a show called Rites of Passage, alongside Louise Bourgeois.Hamad Butt was not alive to laugh at Jak’s cartoon. He died in September 1994, at the age of 32, from Aids-related complications. In a video interview, lying on a sofa at his family home in Ilford, he’s still talking vividly about his future projects, months before his death. What a compelling presence he is, how deeply intelligent and imaginative.His gripping art makes you aware of how quickly and suddenly you can stray from civilised normality to mortal danger. His installation Transmission glows with gorgeous, if clinical, blue light – but look for too long, or without the protective glasses you are offered, at its ultra-violet bulbs and you risk damaging your eyesight. The bulbs rest on a circle of opened books made of glass, on which the monstrous people-eating, world-conquering flora from John Wyndham’s novel The Day of the Triffids are engraved.In another classic trope of Young British Art, that of appropriation, his design of a Triffid, with its fat vegetable body, long sucker and libidinous tongue, is borrowed wholesale from the cover of the original Penguin paperback of The Day of the Triffids.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, in the video interview, he says “transmission” refers in the first place to the transmission of light. He clearly did not want his art to be understood only one way.Today figurative painting is back in fashion, so this exhibition includes Butt’s early canvases before he turned conceptual. On the sofa on screen he explains he had to stop because he was too in thrall to Picasso and Matisse. You can see Picasso’s shadow over his paintings of sensual Minotaur-like men.This exhibition risks removing him from his wider context, but it can’t go very wrong with such art. It’s right to include his paintings, drawings and archives because we possess so little of such magnificent promise. Hamad Butt died so long before his time, yet his work is a living thrill. He is the Young British Artist who is for ever young, for ever lethal.Hamad Butt: Apprehensions is atWhitechapel Art Gallery, London, from 4 June to 7 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designWhitechapel GalleryExhibitionsArtAids and HIVreviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the dilemma at the heart of Hunia Chawla’s play Permission. Set across continents, on rooftops in Karachi and in university halls in London, it follows Hanna (generously performed by Anisa Butt), a young Pakistani woman with a rebellious spirit, who moves across the world in search of independence.View image in fullscreenRea Malhotra Mukhtyar in Permission.Photograph: Adam RazviChawla’s writing is knotty and crackles with conflict. Hanna feels stifled by the patriarchal structures of her home town, which prevent her from walking the streets alone or dating without fear of being stopped by the police. But life in London brings with it its own confinements. Here, she meets Anushe (a straight-talking Rea Malhotra Mukhtyar), a third-year student who encourages her to join protests against the university’s acceptance of funding from arms dealers – overlooking that speaking out carries far greater risks for someone like Hanna, who is living in the UK on a visa.Ultimately, neither Karachi nor London gives Hanna the full life of autonomy she craves. The comparisons between the cities feel nuanced and layered, showing how systems of control operate in different contexts. Behind the politics, though, is a platonic love story. While Hanna leaves for London, her best, friend Minza (also played by Mukhtyar) chooses to stay and study in Karachi, joining the Aurat Marches on the city’s streets.Despite their distance and growing differences, their friendship lives on through phone calls. The pair’s conversation bounces from teenage anxieties to bigger discussions about women’s rights. Directed by Neetu Singh, it is in these scenes of dialogue where the play lands on its quietest, most intimate flashes. But their affection is not quite enough to wipe away the play’s creative inconsistencies.It starts with Butt, as Hanna, performing one side of a conversation; immediately, Permission centres itself as a story about women’s experiences. Later, though, the voices of other male characters begin to play through speakers. What emerges is a play that feels torn between competing impulses.There are other gripes, too. Audience interaction is thrown in a little too late to feel authentic, while a scene where Hanna is found smoking weed by her father appears to have no consequences. It’s frustrating, as Permission has the beginnings of something truly unique, but too many decisions lack clear reasoning, leaving the play’s bold ideas only partially realised.Permission is atTara theatre, London, from 30 May until 7 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatrePakistanWomenreviewsShareReuse this content"

In it, his all-male company were dressed in the full frills of traditional women’s flamenco dresses, pulling at the seams of the dance form’s carefully constructed gender roles. New work Muerta de Amor may have less overt a concept, but it’s still rich in originality, with a few genius moments (and he hasn’t completely jettisoned dresses). This time it’s out with the polka dots and in with sleek black fashiony takes on flamenco costume – sheer top, kilt-style skirt, long leather jacket. In power poses behind a row of mic stands the men look like a still-handsome boyband on their multimillion-dollar reunion tour.The show’s title might talk of the death of love, but desire – physical and emotional – are very much pulsatingly alive here, alongside vulnerability, angst, passion and humour. With Liñán, his six dancers and the band, is the mighty singer Mara Rey, who can blow your socks off with husky volume and dramatic chutzpah. But in this show, everyone sings, like a series of monologues (I say it every year, but with lyrics so central, some surtitles for non-Spanish speakers would be helpful).View image in fullscreen‘The singing’s good, but the dancing is excellent’ … Manuel Liñán, right, alongside the show’s dancers/singers.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThe singing’s good, but the dancing is excellent. From the fantastic chemistry between Liñán and Miguel Heredia, mirroring each other’s moves with relish, to the balletic flourish of José Ángel Capel. Liñán sits back on a chair to be regaled by Juan Tomás de la Molia’s torrent of footwork, full of peacocking prowess, jabbing at syncopations with sharp heels, racing neck-and-neck with the music, the rhythm driving through him just like the copious testosterone. The mood is flirtatious, and exhilarating. Best of all is a duet with Alberto Sellés, less blistering, more tender, more ambiguous. Liñán is most effective when forging specific gestures, knowing when not to move, to hold back rather than splurge everything out.I’ve never known a flamenco dancer who believed in the maxim “leave them wanting more”, and by the long final section, there’s more in this show than necessary. It risks undermining itself in an eruption of pleasure, ego and neediness, but that’s basically the show’s whole theme.

He was a 20-year-old poet who had lived through paediatric cancer, Ewing’s sarcoma. The cancer came back and he died five years later but in that time Ruhl and Ritvo wrote letters to each other with thoughts on life, death, God, faith and nothingness. That became the basis of a book published in 2018, two years after Ritvo’s death.Now adapted for the stage, they form a kind of modern-day Aristotelian dialogue, written by Ruhl (who previously wrote the epistolary play,Dear Elizabeth). Under the direction of Blanche McIntyre, Max (Eric Sirakian) and Sarah (Sirine Saba) variously become teacher and student for each other, and of life rather than merely playwriting. They walk past or around each other, not touching but sometimes in close proximity. The intimacies are in their words.It is an aural experience above all else. You see the beauty and richness of these words and thoughts on the page. Rather than becoming emotionally devastating, it is a contained and cerebral piece. The poise has grace – but also emotional distance.Dick Bird’s set design manifests the spiritual idea of looking through a glass darkly; there is a mirrored screen in the middle of the stage and the traverse seating arrangement sets up the same division. Sometimes, you see two versions of Max – the real and the mirror reflection. It builds visual metaphors on the abstruseness of life and death, albeit rather effortfully.Saba is a compelling and solid presence on stage, deliberately holding back emotion as Max slides further into serious illness. Sirakian is initially playful and already slightly other-worldly. The programme tells us that Sirakian knew Ritvo at Yale – he was a fellow student in Ruhl’s class – which gives his performance an added layer.Stunning cello accompaniment, composed by Laura Moody, acquires its own voice amid the spoken dialogue. There is a magnificent solo recreation of Philip Glass’s Einstein on the Beach, and a thrillingly atmospheric sequence of rainfall tapped on the wood of the cello to accompany a poem about rain.While it certainly captures a sense of expressing the ineffable on stage, you do not get the mess of Ritvo’s emotions and his closest relationships (he suddenly announced that he is getting married out of the blue). There is something rather curated in this withholding. In a race against death, he is in a rush to get his poetry out, rather like John Keats in the face of TB (who also died at 25). You hear he is scared, as one strand of thought, and that he’s bitter, as another, but the play quickly returns to its intellectual topics, as if ballast against dangerously uncontained emotion. There is a singular moment of eruption, when he shouts “I DON’T HAVE TIME” and this stands out. It is startling, angry, real and felt.AtHampstead theatre, London, until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreDeath and dyingCancerreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 2000, champion showjumper Nick Skelton broke his neck in a bad fall; two years later, he was back on a horse and out of retirement. He went on to win Olympic gold twice, firstin London in 2012, then aged 58at Rio in 2016(with a replacement hip), becoming the oldest British winner of an individual Olympic gold medal in more than 100 years. Skelton (and his horse Big Star) finally retired in 2017; his story is told in this solid but largely unrevealing documentary, flawed by tight-lipped interviews, no one rocking the boat.Skelton was born in Warwickshire, the son of a chemist. He rode his first pony aged 18 months (“we did everything together”) and after parting ways with school at 15, he went to work for tough guy horse owner and trainer Ted Edgar (“a bastard” according to one friend). Talented and ambitious, Skelton was a superstar showjumper, but back at the stables, boss Edgar still made him clean the lorries. In the end, Skelton decided to go it alone with his wife, Sarah; they mortgaged their house and bought a horse.In front of the camera Skelton sits straight-backed, a little stiff, telling very little. There’s a wink or two to hard-partying on the 80s showjumping circuit, but sadly no Jilly Cooper-worthy anecdotes. Skelton covers his divorce to Sarah in a sentence or two and even on the subject of the fall (he was initially told by doctors never to ride again) he gives little away. Like most of the talking heads here he’s much more lyrical about the horses, and this really does feel like a film made for showjumping fans. Funnily enough, the dullest interviewee is Bruce Springsteen, who turns out to be friends with Skelton. “He’s got a hot fire in the furnace,” says the Boss. It’s a shame we don’t get to see it.Big Star: The Nick Skelton Story is in cinemas from 6 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsEquestrianismOlympic Games 2012Olympic GamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not if this lot have anything to do with itEmine SanerTue 3 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareThe novelist Ewan Morrison was alarmed, though amused, to discover he had written a book called Nine Inches Pleases a Lady. Intrigued by the limits of generative artificial intelligence (AI), he had askedChatGPTto give him the names of the 12 novels he had written. “I’ve only written nine,” he says. “Always eager to please, it decided to invent three.” The “nine inches” from the fake title it hallucinated was stolen from a filthyRobert Burns poem. “I just distrust these systems when it comes to truth,” says Morrison. He is yet to write Nine Inches – “or its sequel, Eighteen Inches”, he laughs. His actual latest book,For Emma, imagining AI brain-implant chips, is about the human costs of technology.Morrison keeps an eye on the machines, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and their capabilities, but he refuses to use them in his own life and work. He is one of a growing number of people who are actively resisting: people who are terrified of the power of generative AI and its potential for harm and don’t want to feed the beast; those who have just decided that it’s a bit rubbish, and more trouble than it’s worth; and those who simply prefer humans to robots.Go online, and it’s easy to find AI proponents who dismiss refuseniks as ignorant luddites – or worse, smug hipsters. I possibly fall into both camps, given that I have decidedly Amish interests (board games, gardening,animal husbandry) and write for the Guardian. Friends swear by ChatGPT for parenting advice, and I know someone who uses it all day for work in her consultancy business, but I haven’t used it since playing around after it launched in 2022. Admittedly ChatGPT might have done a better job, but this piece was handcrafted using organic words from my artisanal writing studio. (OK, I meanbed.) I could have assumed my interviewees’ thoughts from plundering their social media posts and research papers, as ChatGPT would have done, but it was far more enjoyable to pick up the phone and talk, human to human. Two of my interviewees were interrupted by their pets, and each made me laugh in some way (full disclosure: AI then transcribed the noise).View image in fullscreenEwan Morrison: ‘It’s a product of venture capital gone nuts’Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty ImagesOn X, where Morrison sometimes clashes with AI enthusiasts, a common insult is“decel”(decelerationist), but it makes him laugh when people think he’s the one who isn’t keeping up. “There’s nothing [that stops] accelerationism more than failure to deliver on what you promised. Hitting a brick wall is a good way to decelerate,” he says. Onerecent studyfound that AI answered more than 60% of queries inaccurately.Morrison was drawn into the argument by what he would now call “alarmist fears about the potential for superintelligence and runaway AI. The more I’ve got into it, the more I realise that’s a fiction that’s been dangled before the investors of the world, so they’ll invest billions – in fact,half a trillion– into this quest for artificial superintelligence. It’s a fantasy, a product of venture capital gone nuts.”There are also copyright violations – generative AI is trained on existing material – that threaten him as a writer, and his wife, screenwriter Emily Ballou. In the entertainment industry, he says, people are using “AI algorithms to determine what projects get the go-ahead, and that means we’re stuck remaking the past. The algorithms say ‘More of the same’, because it’s all they can do.”I read because I want to understand how somebody sees the world. There’s no ‘somebody’ in the synthetic text-extruding machinesMorrison says he has a long list of complaints. “They’ve been stacking up over the past few years.” He is concerned about the job losses (Bill Gates recently predicted AI would lead to a two-day work week). Then there are “tech addiction, the ecological impact, the damage to the education system –92% of studentsare now using AI”. He worries about the way tech companies spy on us to make AI personalised, and is horrified at AI-enabled weapons being used in Ukraine. “I find that ethically revolting.”Others cite similar reasons for not using AI. April Doty, an audiobook narrator, is appalled at the environmental cost – the computational power required to perform an AI search and answer is huge. “I’m infuriated that you can’t turn off the AI overviews in Google search,” she says. “Whenever you look anything up now you’re basically torching the planet.” She has started to use other search engines. “But, more and more, we’re surrounded by it, and there’s no off switch. That makes me angry.” Where she still can, she says, “I’m opting out of using AI.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Kaan Illustration/The GuardianIn her own field, she is concerned about the number of books that are being “read” by machines. Audible, the Amazon-owned audiobook provider, has just announced it will allow publishersto create audiobooksusing its AI technology. “I don’t know anybody who wants a robot to read them a story, but I am concerned that it is going to ruin the experience to the point where people don’t want to subscribe to audiobook platforms any more,” says Doty. She hasn’t lost jobs to AI yet but other colleagues have, and chances are, it will happen. AI models can’t “narrate”, she says. “Narrators don’t just read words; they sense and express the feelings beneath the words. AI can never do this job because it requires decades of experience in being a human being.”Emily M Bender, professor of linguistics at the University of Washington and co-author of a new book,The AI Con, has many reasons why she doesn’t want to use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. “But maybe the first one is that I’m not interested in reading something that nobody wrote,” she says. “I read because I want to understand how somebody sees something, and there’s no ‘somebody’ inside the synthetic text-extruding machines.” It’s just a collage made from lots of different people’s words, she says.Does she feel she is being “left behind”, as AI enthusiasts would say? “No, not at all. My reaction to that is, ‘Where’s everybody going?’” She laughs as if to say: nowhere good.“When we turn to synthetic media rather than authentic media, we are losing out on human connection,” says Bender. “That’s both at a personal level – what we get out of connecting to other people – and in terms of strength of community.” She cites Chris Gilliard, the surveillance and privacy researcher. “He made the very important point that you can see this as a technological move by the companies to isolate us from each other, and to set things up so that all of our interactions are mediated through their products. We don’t need that, for us or our communities.”Despite Bender’s well-publicised position – she has long been a high-profile critic of LLMs – incredibly, she has seen students turn in AI-generated work. “That’s very sad.” She doesn’t want to be policing, or even blaming, students. “My job is to make sure students understand why it is that turning to a large language model is depriving themselves of a learning opportunity, in terms of what they would get out of doing the work.”Does she think people should boycott generative AI? “Boycott suggests organised political action, and sure, why not?” she says. “I also think that people are individually better off if they don’t use them.”I almost feel I have no choice but to use AI at this point. I might have to put morals asideSome people have so far held out, but are reluctantly realising they may end up using it. Tom, who works in IT for the government, doesn’t use AI in his tech work, but found colleagues were using it in other ways. Promotion is partly decided on annual appraisals they have to write, and he had asked a manager whose appraisal had impressed him how he’d done it, thinking he’d spent days on it. “He said, ‘I just spent 10 minutes – I used ChatGPT,’” Tom recalls. “He suggested I should do the same, which I don’t agree with. I made that point, and he said, ‘Well, you’re probably not going to get anywhere unless you do.’” Using AI would feel like cheating, but Tom worries refusing to do so now puts him at a disadvantage. “I almost feel like I have no choicebutto use it at this point. I might have to put morals aside.”Others, despite their misgivings, limit how they use it, and only for specific tasks. Steve Royle, professor of cell biology at the University of Warwick, uses ChatGPT for the “grunt work” of writing computer code to analyse data. “But that’s really the limit. I don’t want it to generate code from scratch. When you let it do that, you spend way more time debugging it afterwards. My view is, it’s a waste of time if you let it try and do too much for you.” Accurate or not, he also worries that if he becomes too reliant on AI, his coding skills will atrophy. “The AI enthusiasts say, ‘Don’t worry, eventually nobody will need to know anything.’ I don’t subscribe to that.”View image in fullscreenJustine Bateman: ‘It’s one of the worst ideas society has ever come up with’Photograph: NBC/Nathan Congleton/Getty ImagesPart of his job is to write research papers and grant proposals. “I absolutely will not use it for generating any text,” says Royle. “For me, in the process of writing, you formulate your ideas, and by rewriting and editing, it really crystallises what you want to say. Having a machine do that is not what it’s about.”Generative AI, says film-maker and writer Justine Bateman, “is one of the worst ideas society has ever come up with”. She says she despises how it incapacitates us. “They’re trying to convince people they can’t do the things they’ve been doing easily for years – to write emails, to write a presentation. Your daughter wants you to make up a bedtime story about puppies – to write that for you.” We will get to the point, she says with a grim laugh, “that you will essentially become just a skin bag of organs and bones, nothing else. You won’t know anything and you will be told repeatedly that you can’t do it, which is the opposite of what life has to offer. Capitulating all kinds of decisions like where to go on vacation, what to wear today, who to date, what to eat. People are already doing this. You won’t have to process grief, because you’ll have uploaded photos and voice messages from your mother who just died, and then she can talk to you via AI video call every day. One of the ways it’s going to destroy humans, long before there’s a nuclear disaster, is going to be the emotional hollowing-out of people.”We keep moving like zombies towards a world that nobody really wants to live inShe is not interested. “It is the complete opposite direction of where I’m going as a film-maker and author. Generative AI is like a blender – you put in millions of examples of the type of thing you want and it will give you a Frankenstein spoonful of it.” It’s theft, she says, and regurgitation. “Nothing original will come out of it, by the nature of what it is. Anyone who uses generative AI, who thinks they’re an artist, is stopping their creativity.”Some studios, such as the animation company Studio Ghibli, have sworn off using AI, but others appear to be salivating at the prospect. In 2023, Dreamworks founderJeffrey Katzenberg said AI would cut the costs of its animated filmsby 90%. Bateman thinks audiences will tire of AI-created content. “Human beings will react to this in the way they react to junk food,” she says. Deliciously artificial to some, if not nourishing – but many of us will turn off. Last year she set up an organisation, Credo 23, anda film festival, to showcase films made without AI. She likens it to an “organic stamp for films, that tells the audience no AI was used.” People, she says, will “hunger for something raw, real and human”.‘One day I overheard my boss saying: just put it in ChatGPT’: the workers who lost their jobs to AIRead moreIn everyday life, Bateman is trying “to be in a parallel universe, where I’m trying to avoid [AI] as much as possible.” It’s not that she is anti-tech, she stresses. “I have a computer science degree, I love tech. I love salt, too, but I don’t put it on everything.”In fact, everyone I speak to is a technophile in some way. Doty describes herself as “very tech-forward”, but she adds that she values human connection, which AI is threatening. “We keep moving like zombies towards a world that nobody really wants to live in.” Royle codes and runs servers, but also describes himself as a “conscientious AI objector”. Bender specialises in computational linguistics and was named by Time as one of the top 100 people in AI in 2023. “I am a technologist,” she says, “but I believe that technology should be built by communities for their own purposes, rather than by large corporations for theirs.” She also adds, with a laugh: “The Luddites were awesome! I would wear that badge with pride.” Morrison, too, says: “I quite like the Luddites – people standing up to protect the jobs that keep their families and their communities alive.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingWork & careersHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But your favourite? This basic £5.99 body lotion. Of course, it might have helped that it was chosen by skincare guru Caroline Hirons. “This incredible body lotion is my most used skincare product ofall time,” she said. “I’ve lost count of how many bottles I’ve got through. It has been around for 25 years, and my mum and nana used it almost as evangelically as I do.”The jeans that will change your lifeView image in fullscreenLee Rider loose jeansFrom £85 at Lee“If you make one change to your wardrobe in 2025, switching to a loose jean shape should be it,” said Jess Cartner-Morley in herMay style essentials. “I have found the holy grail of jeans for grownups, which look cool but not ridiculous.” And many of you agreed, judging by the popularity of these jeans from heritage denim brand Lee.The best eye creamView image in fullscreenMedik8 Crystal Retinal Ceramide Eye£42 at Cult BeautyBeauty journalist Sabine Wiesel has tested plenty of eye creams and serums over the years – but perhaps what most qualified her to test 25 of them for us is the fact that she’s afflicted with the issues they’re designed to address. “With undereye bags and dark circles revealing themselves when I haven’t had enough sleep, and fine lines that began to appear as I hit my 40s, I’m the perfect candidate,” she said inour roundup of the best eye creams. Her favourite was this Medik8 formula, which contains retinal, an advanced retinoid “known to work 11 times faster than standard retinol”. Her only negative? “On a personal note, [that] I didn’t start using this from an earlier age.”The bargain camping mattressView image in fullscreenSimond inflatable trekking mattress MT500£44.99 at DecathlonCamping season is upon us, and former science correspondent and regular camper Linda Geddes has been hard at worktesting 26 camping mattresses. She tested each mattress on top of sharp stones, Princess and the Pea style, and left 20kg of boxes on them overnight to see which could avoid the midnight sag. Linda’s top budget pick – this £44.99 inflatable mattress from reliable, affordable brand Decathlon – has been far and away your favourite.The wedding guest dressView image in fullscreenColour block pleated midi dress£259 at John LewisThis showstopper of a dress was chosen as an ideal wedding-guest look by fashion writer Ellie Violet Bramley in our recent roundup ofwomen’s spring wardrobe essentials. “The work of a popular recent collaboration between John Lewis and the British label Awake Mode, it’s a beautifully bold rebuke to all those years of quiet luxury,” she wrote. “Best worn for many years to come – and luckily the fit should mean it needs only very occasional (eco) dry cleaning.”The eco-friendly addition to your lawnView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacky Parker Photography/Getty ImagesWildflower seed collection£3.89 at AmazonIt’s not often you can buy something that’s beautiful, good for the environment, and cheap. But these £3.89 native wildflower seeds tick every box. “An immaculate, weed-free lawn is becoming as taboo as an outdoor heater,” wrote professional gardener Matt Collins inour guide to making your lawn more eco-friendly. The lawn still plays an important role in many of our gardens, though, so a lot of you were tempted by the idea of introducing some biodiversity. We’d like to think that thousands of these flowers are blooming in your gardens by now.The best cordless vacuumView image in fullscreenShark IP3251UKT PowerDetect cordless vacuum cleaner£349 at John LewisWhen we test products, we really test them: so when Andy Shaw rounded upthe best cordless vacuumsfor us, he had to clean up flour, cat litter and pet hair (sourced from the local dog groomer) repeatedly, on both hard floor and carpet, with all 10 models. This Shark vacuum was his all-round favourite – and not only because it’s an excellent cleaner. “If there’s one thing that makes cordless vacuum cleaners a pain, it’s the emptying,” he said. That won’t be the case with this one, though: “It empties itself.”The nautical phone strapView image in fullscreenNative Union City Sling strapFrom £19.99 at AmazonPhone straps have become a must-have: “On a practical level, it means you don’t have to root around in your bag every time you need to check Google Maps for directions,” wrote deputy fashion and lifestyle editor Chloe Mac Donnell, and “it could keep your mobile safer.” Your favourite of herpick of the best phone strapshas been this “minimalist, urban strap by Native Union, with nautical knots and an adjustable length to turn it from necklace to cross-body.

This versatility is their real strength. “Whether you’re strolling along coastal cliffs, bagging Wainwrights in the Lake District or traipsing around a field with the dog, this is the perfect boot for the job.”The rechargeable lightView image in fullscreenMushroom wall light£38.40 at John Lewis“In the past few years, rechargeable lights have become a mainstay,” said interiors expert Kate Jacobs inour guide to decorating small spaces. “They work brilliantly in spaces where wiring is hard to access or looks ugly.” You’ve been loving this simple, dimmable design from John Lewis, which comes in eight colours and is now 20% off.The 30-minute workoutView image in fullscreenSuspension trainer£19.99 at DecathlonCan you really fit a full-body workout into half an hour?

Food assistant: Clare Cole.Kitchen aideChefsWhich dips are OK to buy, and which should I make?Our expert panel recommends the dips that are worth whizzing up fresh at home, and which shop-bought options are good to be titivated before servingAnna BerrillTue 3 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareDips are a great unifier, whether they’re married to a big bowl of crisps and crudites or served as a companion for a picnic spread. If there’s hummus, cacik or borani in the picture, then it’s a party. Happily, says David Carter, founder ofSmokestak,MantecaandOmain London, “you can get a lot of good stuff in stores these days”. That said, he adds, anything involving vegetables is “always going to be best when made fresh”.If your dip needs lead you to the shops, the trick is to create contrast. Much like getting dressed, you first need to consider the temperature. “Let’s say you have some shop-bought hummus,” Carter says. “If you put that in a pan with a bit of hot water and maybe some lemon juice, then whisk, the hummus will loosen, turn creamy and completely change from the usual fridge-cold stodge.”Next, you’ve then got to accessorise your tub, which means toppings: “A lot of our dips in the restaurants have some form of texture, whether that’s crisp garlic, seeds or crisps,” he says. “If you’ve got something like a silky-smooth labneh and think, how am I going to jazz this up, spiced chickpeas would be one answer.” Similarly, Carter tops hisbaba ganoushwith a “very hot” tahini sauce and some crisp artichokes: “That’s contrast exaggerated.”Sami Tamimi, author ofBoustany(out in June), meanwhile, is not a fan of dips that take a lot of time, which is why you’ll always find yoghurt or labneh in his fridge (“I don’t make my own any more”). They’re an easy win, and can be quickly turned into a dip with the addition of a squeeze of lemon, some garlic and whatever spices or herbs (fresh or dried) you have to hand: “If you’re doing a barbecue – especially if there’s a fatty piece of fish or meat involved – mix yoghurt with tahini, and add a little sun-dried tomato, some garlic, herbs anda lotof lemon juice.”If, like Tamimi, your entertaining MO is to pile a load of dishes in the middle of the table, you also have to draw the line somewhere. For Tamimi, that line is tzatziki: “I just buy it, but the thing with readymade dips is that they don’t taste fresh, so you need to add a bit of zing.” That’s not to say you need to get all fancy, mind: just a squeeze of lemon, a bit of lemon zest and/or some fresh herbs (think mint, coriander) will “bring it to life”. While we’re at it, no one is ever making their own taramasalata (no arguments, please), so head to the shops and that’s a “really nice addition to brunch with bagels and smoked salmon”, Tamimi adds.One dip that you’ll never catch him buying, however, ishummus: “That’s a big no-no. Shop-bought versions have so many stabilisers, they always taste grainy and they’re made with not enough tahini and not enough, well, everything!” Hummus, he insists, should be made fresh (“I boil more chickpeas than I need and freeze half for another day”) and eaten within two days. “There are nicer things you can buy, so, when it comes to hummus, just make it.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Perhaps it’s the use of small pasta that makes me feel childlike, but either way, it is the kind of recipe that is immensely versatile: it can be an elegant, light spring meal finished with punchy extra-virgin olive oil, an extra sprinkle of pepper and a grating of pecorino, or you could label it kid-friendly and comforting. It’s not exclusively so, but I’d hazard a bet that they’ll enjoy it.Spring meatballs with pasta and peasPrep10 minCook30 minServes41 bunchspring onions, trimmed and finely sliced2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced50g breadcrumbs½ bunchflat-leaf parsley, picked and finely choppedA few mint sprigs, leaves picked and finely chopped400g pork minceJuice and finely grated zestof1 lemonSea salt andblack pepperOlive oil1litre chicken stock, or vegetable stock180g mini pasta150g peas, freshly podded or frozen40g pecorino, gratedPut half the spring onions in a food processor with half the sliced garlic, all the breadcrumbs, half the chopped herbs and all the mince.

Comparison sites – others include MoneySuperMarket, Confused.com and Compare the Market – let you easily see prices across dozens of insurers.Experts say getting quotes about three to four weeks before your policy is due to start often results in cheaper deals.Add an experienced driverView image in fullscreenLook for someone with a clean licence and several years of no claims.Photograph: Hongqi Zhang/AlamyAdding a parent, or any other experienced motorist as a named driver – as long as they drive the car occasionally – can help lower your premium. Insurers see this as spreading the risk as the vehicle is not just driven by someone with little experience.Look for someone with a clean licence and many years of no claims. Whatever you do, don’t pretend someone else is the main driver – that is known as “fronting”, and is illegal.Pick the right carGenerally, the smaller and less powerful the car, the cheaper it will be to insure. Go for something in a low insurance group (cars are put intoone of 50 groups), typically the less expensive models with small engines and where the cost of parts and repairs are generally lower.The cheapest for 17- to 25-year-olds include Volkswagen’s up! (averaging £576 a year), the Suzuki Alto (£597) and the Fiat 500 (£604), according to Go.Compare.“This shows it is smaller cars – specifically modest one-litre engine hatchbacks – which are taking the top spots as the cheapest cars to insure for young drivers,” says Tom Banks at Go.Compare.View image in fullscreenBuying a secondhand vehicle will help keep costs down.Photograph: Justin Kase z12z/AlamyBuying secondhand will keep costs down. Just make sure it is in good condition and has a full service history.“Avoid making modifications, too, as these could lead to a hike in the price,” says Andrew Lee at the insurer Marmalade, which specialises in young drivers.Consider a black boxA black box, or telematics, is a great way to reduce costs over time. A small device (or an app on your phone) tracks how safely you drive.If you stick to speed limits, avoid harsh braking and do not drive late at night, you could earn a lower insurance quote or repayments, adds Banks.“If the data shows consistent safe driving, insurers might reward policyholders with benefits like lower premiums, cashback or a voucher, either during your policy term, or when it’s time to renew,” he adds.According to Go.Compare, the median price for a 19-year-old driver with a telematics policy is £864 a year. This compares with £1,096 without telematics.At age 23, the difference is only £21: £636 with telematics; £657 without. If you don’t make a claim, you will earn a no-claims discount, which can further reduce costs.However, there are some potential disadvantages to a black box. It will record poor habits and so could result in higher premiums.“If you don’t drive carefully, or within pre-arranged limits of your policy, you could end up paying more,” Banks says.Avoid automatic renewalView image in fullscreenUse comparison sites to secure the best deal.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianIf you are already insured, do not just accept your renewal quote. Use comparison sites to see what others are charging for the same, or similar, cover, then go back to your current insurer and see whether it will match, or beat, those prices.Pay annually (if you can)Monthly payments may be easier for some younger people to handle, but they often involve paying interest on the premiums – sometimes as much as 30% APR. If you can afford to pay in one go, it is nearly always cheaper.If an annual payment is not possible, it is worth looking into alternatives such as a 0% interest credit card (provided you can pay it off before interest kicks in). Or set aside money each month.Up your securityView image in fullscreenInsurers like driveways more than street parking, so prices tend to fall if you have access to one.Photograph: Ellen Isaacs/AlamyWhere, and how, you park matters. Insurers like driveways more than street parking, so prices tend to fall if you have access to one. If your building has designated private parking, whether gated or residents only, that is also usually rated as safer than street parking. If you have a fob-controlled or gated car park, even better. Mention it when getting quotes.And adding a steering wheel lock, immobiliser or dashcam can help. The more secure your car, the less of a risk it poses – and the more likely something will be shaved off your premium.Tweak your job titleView image in fullscreenFalse information could invalidate your policy.Photograph: Andriy Popov/AlamyWhat you put as your job title can affect how much you pay – sometimes by hundreds of pounds. That’s because data based on years of claims is used. Some professions are flagged as higher risk, either because of how often people in those jobs claim, or the way they are perceived to use their cars.Many forms include a dropdown menu for job titles, and choosing a different, but still legitimately accurate, title – such as “writer” instead of “journalist” – could lower your premium. Make sure it is truthful. False information could invalidate your policy.MoneySuperMarket has a “car insurance job picker” to help you identify the role that best describes what you do, and find the average premium for each job.Increase your excessYour excess is what you pay towards a claim before your insurer chips in. It is usually split into two parts: a compulsory excess, which is set by your insurer and non-negotiable; and a voluntary excess, the extra you choose to pay on top.“The most common excess chosen by our customers is £250,” says Rhydian Jones, a car insurance expert at Confused.com. “But opting for a higher – or sometimes even lower – excess can help reduce the overall cost of your cover. Experiment with your excess amount when comparing quotes to see if you could save.”The higher the voluntary excess, the lower your premium tends to be. “Make sure you can afford to pay the excess amount you have stated,” says Lee, otherwise you could be left in a tricky situation.View image in fullscreenThe Fiat 500 is among the cheapest cars to insure for a 17- to 25-year-old, according to Go.Compare.Photograph: Flavio Lo Scalzo/ReutersBuild your no-claims discountThe discount increases with each year you drive claim-free. After just one year, you could get a 20% to 30% discount. After five years, some insurers will knock 60% or more off your premium.Your no-claims discount is tied to you, not the car – so if you change your vehicle or insurer, you can usually transfer it. Even if you have an accident, it will not always wipe out your discount – especially if you are not at fault and the other driver’s insurer pays.It is worth asking your insurer to confirm how much your premium would go up by if you made a claim.Explore more on these topicsCar insuranceMoney hacksInsuranceMotoringYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

For the son of one of those pioneers, it had a special resonanceMike MacEacheranTue 3 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 04.35 EDTShareAfew years ago, my dad told me of a mountain where I could easily sense another world. “There is a special air and light,” he had said, vaguely. “You just have to walk close to it to feel and see it. Stand in one place and just look up.”The mountain on my dad’s mind that day was the Eiger, Switzerland’s 3,970-metre ogre of limestone and ice. Like few others, the peak exerts a gravitational pull on climbers and it remains the chief symbol of the Bernese Oberland; its most notable feature, the 1,800-metre north face, is the largest in the Alps. This gigantic slab looms over the village of Grindelwald, to the south-east of the town of Interlaken, appearing at sunrise as an immense black spectre in a valley of green.Eiger mapAs well as being a promised land for daredevil mountaineers and other adventurers (bungee jumpers dive into the void from a 90-metre-high platform), Grindelwald is a happy hunting ground for hikers, and last June a themed trail opened on an existing path at the foot of the north face – theEiger Walk of Fame. It was established by Jungfrau Region Tourism to honour the stories of many who pioneered routes up its near-vertical face. So, as Zurich pushes close to 35C (95F), the cooler air of the mountains beckons and I head to the Jungfrau Region for a few days to measure my own experience of this new hiking path against that of the pioneers of Alpinism.It’s easy for me to feel a personal resonance here. My dad, Ian, successfully tackled a hitherto untried route on the north face in August 1970, before I was born, with companionsKenny Spence and Alasdair “Bugs” McKeith. At the time, the expedition by the unemployed, hard-drinking trio from Edinburgh was dubbed reckless. After all, the German nickname for the rock face isMordwand, meaning “murder wall”, and over the decades it has claimed the lives of 72 mountaineers. Now, I’m in Grindelwald, tilting my head towards the sun. Standing in one place as he’d told me to. Just looking up.View image in fullscreenThe writer’s father Ian, centre, with Bugs McKeith, left, and Kenny Spence before they started their successful ascent of the north face in 1970.Photograph: courtesy of Mike MacEacheranOn my first afternoon, I seek out the Walk of Fame, its 1½-mile (2½km) loop leading from the Eiger Express cable car top station, at 2,328metre, to Kleine Scheidegg, meaning “small watershed” in Swiss-German, a low mountain plateau crossed by rail lines and framed by the summits of Jungfrau and Mönch.The mountains look unreal, as if AI-generated, while the stories on the trail offer new perspectives on the achievements of the pastOn the trail, I am completely – wonderfully – alone. The Walk of Fame is shot through with melancholy and romance, bookended by both gravestone-like slabs that recount the mountain’s most pivotal moments at the start of the approximately 2½-hour trail and a memorial overlooking Lake Fallboden. In a valley of many high-altitude, straggling hikes, the view from this trail is the most extraordinary, giving a closer look at 1,000-foot rock pillars, ice fields and snow-filled cracks resembling enormous spider’s webs. Some of the mountains look almost unreal, as if AI-generated, while the stories told along the trail evoke awe and offer new perspectives on the bewildering achievements of the past.I learn about the variety of challenging routes to the summit, an average steepness of 64 degrees, and the trailblazers and unsung heroes who have gone before. There are grim examples too, of those who weren’t as lucky as my dad. The north face was first conquered in July 1938 by a German–Austrian party, including Heinrich Harrer, the author of Seven Years in Tibet. But until 1957, when the first rescue was carried out, bodies were merely retrieved at the base of the face.View image in fullscreenGravestone-like slabs on the Walk of Fame recount key moments in the Eiger’s history.Photograph: Mike MacEacheranThe light beginning to fade, I descend to Lake Fallboden and to Chilchli, once a transformer station for the Jungfrau Railway, but now home to an exhibition. Inside, Eiger stories play out in a sepia photo gallery, and a hand-carved wooden replica of the north face embedded with LEDs lights up with more than 30 seemingly impossible routes. Outside, the summits are mirrored in the still, blue-green water of the lake.Long a Swiss Shangri-la, Grindelwald has hostels and hotels to suit all budgets, yet doesn’t teeter on overdevelopment like so many other Alpine realms. You can bring your own tent, as my dad did in his wilder days, or stay somewhere ritzier such as Bergwelt Grindelwald, my base for three nights. The Eiger and shoulder-to-shoulder peaks Mettenberg and Wetterhorn give a lovely geometry to the valley, particularly when seen at twilight, beer in hand, from one of the resort’s south-facing balconies.Up close to the north face, I really sense Dad’s achievement for the first time. I am filled with admiration and prideThere’s another highly recommended walk, one that involves going down from Grindelwald, not up. The Gletscherschlucht is a 250m-year-old glacier gorge reached by a half-hour amble from the town. The 1¼-mile out-and-back walk rings with the sounds of cascades rushing down the ravine’s sides and the roar of water from the lower Grindelwald glacier as it drains into the Lütschine River. It feels a lot like a wind tunnel, with blasts of glacial air.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My dad passed away last February in the palliative care unit of his local hospital after a battle with vascular dementia, and in his last few days his fingers would tighten when I reminded him of his exploits in the Alps. It was as if he was teasing out pinch grips and holds in his mind. In a small way, I want to pay tribute to his memory.View image in fullscreenThe writer scattered some of his dad’s ashes by the north face.Photograph: Mike MacEacheranI take the lonely path from the Eiger Express top station once more, but this time hike directly east, up and over a saddle to a place where the wind drops and the sheer vertical of the north face really begins. By the end, my dad was non-verbal, his wisdom stripped away, yet on one of my last visits I could sense he was trying to reorganise his brain scaffolding amid the chaos, to grasp a word – any word – to describe the mountain that had meant so much to him. To me, there was never any logic to what he did; but now, up close, I can really sense his achievement for the first time. I am filled with admiration and pride.Out of my rucksack, I pull a biscuit tin containing some of his ashes, searching for a suitable place to scatter them. Perhaps hoping for some form of neat conclusion, I came in the hope of finding a fragment of him up here. I’ve found so much more – a reminder that even when somebody leaves us, there is always something beautiful left behind. Then, I lay his ashes on the rocks, take one last lingering look back, and head down the mountain.The trip was provided byJungfrau Region TourismandJungfrau Railways.

Not for air, I’m guessing.Often out of insecurity and boredom, Gigi Engle, a sex coach and author, toldMen’s Healthwhen the term emerged.Still, it’s nice that they returned.It’s all back on!Hmm, maybe not. “It’s pretty unlikely that it’s because this person actually cares about you,” said Engle. “It’s more likely that they want someone to talk to and make them feel good about themselves.”Sounds like submariners should be avoided.Indeed. They “often crave intimacy but are terrified of the vulnerability it requires”, Wendy Walsh, a psychology professor,told PureWow. “A submariner wants to put somebody on the back burner so they can reach out to them later when they feel lonely.”Nobody puts baby on the back burner! And thanks for the warning– that’s now a big red flag.Or, you might say, a nuclear deterrent.You might. So what is the best way to deal withsubmariners?Back to Engle, who says: “If someone is actually into you, they don’t disappear out of nowhere.”Got it.Ghost the submariners?Correct. Apart from Sean Connery in The Hunt for Red October.Do say:“Yeah, long time no speak … Tonight? No, sorry, I’m busy … for ever.”Don’t say:“Periscope up.”Explore more on these topicsDatingPass notesOnline datingRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This week, I’m wondering what my first jobs in journalism would have been like had generative AI been around. In other news: Elon Musk leaves a trail of chaos, and influencers are selling the text they fed to AI to make art.AI threatens the job you had after collegeGenerative artificial intelligence may eliminate the job you got with your diploma still in hand, say executives who offered grim assessments of the entry-level job market last week in multiple forums.Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, which makes the multifunctional AI model Claude,told Axios last weekthat he believes that AI could cut half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and send overall unemployment rocketing to 20% within the next five years. One explanation why an AI company CEO might make such a dire prediction is to hype the capabilities of his product. It’s so powerful that it could eliminate an entire rung of the corporate ladder, he might say, ergo you should buy it, the slogan might go.If your purchasing and hiring habits follow his line of thinking, then you buy Amodei’s product to stay ahead of the curve of the job-cutting scythe. It is telling that Amodei made these remarks the same week that his company unveiled a new version of Claude in which the CEO claimed that the bot could code unassisted for several hours. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has followed a similar playbook.However, others less directly involved in the creation of AI are echoing Amodei’s warning. Steve Bannon, former Trump administration official and current influential Maga podcaster, agreed with Amodei and said that automated jobs would be a major issue in the 2028 US presidential election.The Washington Postreported in March that more than a quarter of all computer programming jobs in the US vanished in the past two years, citing the inflection point of the downturn as the release of ChatGPT in late 2022.Days before Amodei’s remarks were published, an executive at LinkedIn offered similarly grim prognostications based on the social network’s data in aNew York Timesessay headlined “I see the bottom rung of the career ladder breaking”.“There are growing signs that artificial intelligence poses a real threat to a substantial number of the jobs that normally serve as the first step for each new generation of young workers,” wrote Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn.The US Federal Reserve published observations on the job market for recent college graduates in the first quarter of 2025 that do not inspire hope. The agency’sreportreads: “The labor market for recent college graduates deteriorated noticeably in the first quarter of 2025. The unemployment rate jumped to 5.8% – the highest reading since 2021 – and the underemployment rate rose sharply to 41.2%.” The Fed did not attribute the deterioration to a specific cause.The likeliest outcome of AI’s impact on entry-level jobs is that companies will reformulate them into something new. The job market may settle somewhere between Amodei’s AI Ragnarok and the antediluvian days before ChatGPT. Familiarity with AI will be required in the way that Microsoft Office has, and bosses will demand a higher standard of productivity. If a robot can do most of the coding for you, a junior software engineer, then you should be producing five times the amount of code as before, they may say.Speaking of Microsoft and software engineers, CEO Satya Nadella claimed in late April thatAI writes 30% of Microsoft’s code. That may be the future of software development. It is possible that is true; it is also possible that Nadella, head of the company that has reaped enormous gains from the AI boom, is trying to sell by example, overestimating how much of that code is usable. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg has been more pointed in his assessments, asserting that his company will no longer need mid-level coders by the end of 2025. Shortly after, Meta announced a 5% staff reduction.View image in fullscreenMark Zuckerberg, the head of Meta, last year.Photograph: Manuel Orbegozo/ReutersThe short-term readjustment, however, is the pain point. Recent classes have graduated without AI being an integral part of their school life, and employers won’t believe those interim graduates have the necessary familiarity for a new professional landscape.That is not the fault of the graduates: employers themselves don’t know what they want yet from AI. Axios followed up Amodei’s doom and gloom with a piece about howAI job cuts are jumping the gun. Companies are not replacing departing workers, betting that AI will be able to perform the same functions, if not now, then hopefully by the time it would take to hire replacements.The example of journalism may be a canary in the coalmine. Entry-level jobs in journalism often involve aggregating news items from other outlets in the style of your own employer, a task AI is well suited to if the facts are straight. I spent several years doing just that when I started out. In the same way that we see Amodei’s predictions taking shape in LinkedIn’s data, I see the entry-level diminishment beginning in my own industry. Business Insider, a digital outlet focused on financial and business news, laid off 20% of its staff late last week. CEO Barbara Peng said the newsroom would go “all-in on AI” and become “AI-first” in her note eliminating the jobs.Axios itself footnoted its Amodei interview with a disclosure about its own practices with regard to AI.“At Axios, we ask our managers to explain why AI won’t be doing a specific job before green-lighting its approval. (Axios stories are always written and edited by humans),” the disclosure reads. The parenthetical indicates that Axios editors know that AI’s involvement in writing is bad for the brand. The part said outside the parentheses indicates Axios executives may not be backfilling vacated jobs, waiting for AI to catch up and close those openings.The week in AINew AI test can predict which men will benefit from prostate cancer drug‘One day I overheard my boss saying: just put it in ChatGPT’: the workers who lost their jobs to AIUS lawyer sanctioned after being caught using ChatGPT for court briefMusk leaves behind a sticky trail like a slugView image in fullscreenMusk at the White House in April.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesElon Musk announced he would leave the White House last week, ending a contentious and generally unpopular run as a senior adviser to the president and de facto head of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). Donald Trump hosted a press conference for his departure, the same day thatthe New York Timesreported that Musk had heavily used drugs on the campaign trail.My colleague Nick Robins-Early assessed themess Musk leaves in his wake:As Musk moves on, he consigns a mess of half-realized plans and gutted agencies to his acolytes installed in key positions across the federal government. His departure throws Doge’salready chaotic impact on the governmentinto an even grayer limbo, with questions over how much power the nebulous taskforce will have without him and who, if anyone, might rebuild the programs and services it destroyed.Musk’s initial pitch for Doge was to save $2tn from the budget by rooting out rampant waste and fraud, as well as to conduct an overhaul of government software that would modernize how federal agencies operate. Doge so far has claimed to cut about $140bn from the budget – although its “wall of receipts” isnotorious for containing errorsthat overestimate its savings. Donald Trump’s new tax bill, though not part of Doge and opposed by Musk, is alsoexpected to add $2.3tn to the deficit, nullifying any savings Doge may have achieved. Its promises of a new, modernized software have frequently been limited to artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots – some of which werealready in the works underthe Biden administration.The greater impact of Doge has instead been its dismantling of government services and humanitarian aid. Doge’s cuts have targeted a swath of agencies such as the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, which handles weather and natural disaster forecasting, andplunged otherssuch as theDepartment of Veterans Affairsinto crises. Numeroussmaller agencies, such as one thatcoordinates policy on homelessness, have been in effect shut down. Doge has brought several bureaus to their knees, with no clear plan of whether the staff Musk leaves behind will try to update or maintain their services or simply shut them off.As Musk returns to Tesla and SpaceX, the agencies he laid waste to are left to pick up the pieces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Up for grabs were 10 prompts used to prod AI-powered engines into generating the videos that the account itself had posted.Voidstomper posted a video captioned: “I didn’t want to sell these. But I’m broke and these still go viral. So here: 10 raw horror prompts straight from my archive. Some got me hundreds of millions of views. Some barely make sense. All of them work. Use them in any AI video tool. Just don’t pretend you wrote them. VAULT_DUMP_1 is live. Link in bio. No refunds. You’re on your own.” The account’s administrator did not respond to a request for an interview.The account is not alone. Marketplaces exist for the sale of AI prompts. Ben Stokes, the founder of the PromptBase, says there are about 20,000 sellers on his site hawking prompts, with thousands sold monthly and, to date, seven figures paid out to their writers since 2022. He said social media influencers and other content creators selling their prompts is “still quite niche” and serves as a side hustle for graphic designers, artists and photographers.Voidstomper put prompts for sale that had been used to create specific videos. The product a user might receive when purchasing a prompt on PromptBase is likely to be closer to a generalized template than a finite sentence, Stokes said.“For example, if the prompt that creates posters of famous landmarks in a vintage style, there’d be sections within the prompt in square brackets like [LANDMARK NAME] that you could change to the landmark you’d like to create a poster for, like the local pier in your town,” he said.Why buy a string of text when you could type out your own, though?“There is a specific group of people who are looking for high-quality, robust prompts for their business applications. Specifically, they are looking to integrate AI into their product or workflow, which usually requires a prompt, and want to ensure it works well and produces great consistent outputs,” said Stokes. Though the general public thinks of ChatGPT as free, running enough generations to obtain specific and correct outputs can be quite expensive for businesses, he added. It may be more cost-effective to buy a prompt.Even within the niche of AI-generated art, some consider the sale of prompts ridiculous. The Instagram and TikToker HolyFool36, an AI art Instagram account that has beeninterviewed in this newsletter before, said he would never engage in the practice.“Frankly, I find it as an insult to my sensibilities,” he said via email. “Generative AI requires no skill – almost anyone can figure out how to reverse engineer his prompts for free.“I personally know Void Stomper and have had many interactions with him. I’ve explained that the best way to monetize this stuff is to build a brand and then sell real tangible products within that brand. He has clearly, directly, stated that he does not have the discipline to do that. I don’t judge him, everyone’s gotta pay rent somehow, I’d just never go about it that way personally,” he added.The wider TechScapeSpaceX Starship breaks up over Indian Ocean in latest bumpy testWhat to do if your laptop is lost or stolen – tips for when the worst happensNvidia beats Wall Street expectations even as Trump tamps down China salesIs every memecoin just a scam?

She suspects her partner might have overwatered it. Any advice?DiagnosisYuccas are drought-tolerant and sensitive to overwatering, and yellowing leaves, soft areas on the trunk or drooping stems are all indicators of this. Excess moisture often leads to stress or root rot. This may explain why the taller side, which perhaps has deeper roots so sits in wet soil longer, is suffering more noticeably.Houseplant clinic: My jade plant looks jadedRead morePrescriptionLift the yucca from its pot to inspect the roots (you can do this by laying it on its side if that makes it easier). Healthy roots are firm and pale, while overwatered roots will appear mushy, brown or smelly. Trim away any affected roots using sterilised scissors. Repot your yucca in fresh, well-draining compost mixed with sand or perlite. Ideally, wait until the top few inches of soil feel completely dry before watering again.PreventionEnsure adequate drainage holes and water sparingly, especially during winter or in lower-light areas.

Experts have estimated that 4,000 autobahn bridges and 12,000 other road bridges are in urgent need of repair or replacement.Such are the concerns over the impact of decades of underinvestment that they have, alongside disintegrating school buildings and the beleaguered rail network, shot to the top of the agenda asFriedrich Merz’s new governmentpromises billions to renew Germany’s creaking infrastructure.In the eastern city of Dresden last September, the 53-year-old Carola Bridge spanning the Elbe tumbled into the river in the middle of the night, 10 minutes after a tram had passed over it. City authorities said it was a miracle no one had been killed.View image in fullscreenThe Carola Bridge in Dresden collapsed suddenly last year.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesStreets in the picturesque town of Lüdenscheid in westernGermanyare clogged with 25,000 HGVs a day, diverted there after the nearby Rahmede viaduct, a vital transport artery, was closed in 2021 owing to structural concerns and subsequently demolished. Locals complain of intense noise and emissions pollution, while businesses say their turnover has been hit and skilled workers are departing in droves. A partial new-build is under way, expected to be finished next year.Germany, for decades Europe’s economic powerhouse, also has a reputation for being a land of skilful engineers and efficiency. What has gone wrong?Oliver Holtemöller, the head of macroeconomics at the Halle Institute for Economic Research, says the problems lie not in a lack of public financing, but elsewhere: “The burden of bureaucracy, highly complex planning procedures and the lack of skilled people to carry out the work.”This, he said, was compounded by “politicians who want to be re-elected, who prioritise projects with a very short-term return”. Even before he was sworn in as chancellor last month, run-down infrastructure was high up on the list of Merz’s domestic concerns.In March, he pushed a €500bn (£422bn) fund through parliament to inject money intoinfrastrukturstau(infrastructure congestion) over the next 12 years, to be financed through borrowing.Bridges have earned an even more prominent place in the debate amid the recognition that the costs of their renovation can be included in Germany’s military spending commitments. Bridges, after all, have to be capable of carrying military tanks; they must bekriegstauglich(fit for war). Many, in their current state, are not.For the Greens and other opposition parties, this is going too far. But, as the government signals a willingness to raise its defence spending gradually from 2% to the 5% that Donald Trump has called on Nato members to commit to, it is also widening the definition of what counts as defence spending. The foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, has said he plans to include not only pure military spending but also investments in infrastructure the military needs to use – such as roads, rail and bridges.Either way, fixing the bridges is seen as a key test for Merz: can he get a grip on the myriad challenges facing Europe’s largest economy, which has had three years of negative growth? And could that help him claw back support from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD)?“Let the diggers roll,” his finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, of the Social Democrats, said last month, in an attempt to drum up some excitement.According to a report by the German Chamber of Industry and Trade, which represents millions of businesses, the state of Germany’s bridges is “symbolic of the desolate state of the entire infrastructure in [the country]”.Friedrich Merz arrives as a humbled new German chancellor – but that may not be the worst way to start | Jörg LauRead moreIn comments to the broadcaster RBB, Helmut Schmeitzner, a professor of structural engineering at Berlin’s School of Economics and Law, warned: “In general, our infrastructure is in such a state that we have to expect that such incidents as bridge and road closures will occur more frequently in the future.”So embedded has the idea of Germany’s creaking infrastructure become that the heute-show, a popular satirical TV programme, recently dedicated a whole episode to “Crumbling Germany”. “Rust in peace” would be the appropriate slogan for the state of the nation if things did not improve, it joked.For many, however, it is no laughing matter; they warn that if Merz fails to make improvements – and quickly – the political fallout could be toxic. The AfD has already sought to profit from the controversy, calling the multiple closures and the collapse in Dresden “not isolated cases but symbols of creeping state failure”.Holtemöller urged the government not to rush into fixing Germany, “because that would fuel inflation but not produce real value or better bridges”. It should “analyse where the investment is needed, which bridges are nearing the end of their lifespans” and “bring actions and words together and not promise more than it’s possible to deliver”, he said.“Most of all they should focus on long-term strategic planning.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeFriedrich MerzAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)InfrastructureThe far rightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the first world war, Canada lost around 61,000 people out of a population of 8 million. US combat deaths were 53,000 from 100 million. In the second world war, both nations lost similar proportions of their populations.Canada supplied quality and technical skills for the frontline, from the tunnellers of Vimy Ridge, portrayed in the Canadian parliament chamber, to the strategic bomber crews (40% Commonwealth) and the corvettes that protected American ships in the Battle of the Atlantic.In Britain, we benefited from Canadian generosity. The US charged interest for decades on its postwar loan to the UK, while Canada donated $1bn.Prof Nick BosanquetYorkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Also letters fromPeter WestandAdam HartTue 3 Jun 2025 12.48 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 16.08 EDTShareSir Mark Rowley is completely justified in his fears for public safety (UK’s most senior police officer criticises early prison release scheme, 28 May). We confuse the lines between punishment, prison sentencing, deterrence and the desire to prevent reoffending.We can readily identify those who are less likely to reoffend – those who are over 25 and no longer testosterone-fuelled, those who do not have a drug habit, have a home and family to go to, and a means of earning an income.We know, too, that if prison works as a deterrence, its greatest impact is in the first few days of being there. Thereafter, life becomes institutionalised.Releasing those from prison who qualify as above, and allowing them to satisfy their sentences with meaningful community employment, may not be the fairest way of reducing the number of people currently in prison, but it is likely to be the safest and most effective way forward for the convicted individual, the taxpayer and society as a whole.Andrew LeslauHenley on Thames, OxfordshirePolice chiefs complain that violent criminals released early will affect public safety. This is misleading. First, only 5.7% of crimes lead to an arrest, and some are acquitted.It follows that at any time, the great majority of perpetrators of violent crime are on the streets. Early releases will make a relatively small difference.Second, a violent criminal will currently be released after half their sentence. Say they are 30 years old. This gives them decades to commit further crimes. Adding one or two years to this will not have much impact on total crime.Third, some of those released early will be convicted of a further crime sooner and return to prison for longer, reducing the impact of early release.A complex issue is being highly oversimplified by the police chiefs.Peter WestLondonAs you rightly point out in your editorial (The Guardian view on sentencing reform: a landmark chance for change, 25 May): “The review rightly says that relationships between probation staff and offenders should get priority.”What is not mentioned are the enormous cost savings in moving from prison to community service sentences (estimated to be as much 40 times less). These huge cost savings would pay for all the additional probation staff, as well for much improved training and professionalisation for supervisors, upon which the long-term success of this scheme crucially depends.Adam HartCommunityservicesupervisor, East Northamptonshire, 1977-80Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus, a letter fromAndrew KeeleyTue 3 Jun 2025 12.48 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 16.08 EDTShareCliodhna Dempsey’s letter (Bridal bucket is the best wedding gift, 26 May) brought back the happiest of memories. In July 1968 I was 21 years old, on the last day of my first year of teaching in Hampshire, and due to be married eight days later. My lovely class of first-year juniors, at final assembly, presented me with a huge laundry basket. Then each of the 42 children came up to put something in it: dusters, dishcloths, pegs, tin opener, washing-up brush, dustpan, tea strainer, teaspoons, slotted spoon, wooden spoons – an abundance of very thoughtful and useful gifts.The long pink ribbon to tie everything inside the basket proved invaluable: that evening, driving 110 miles to visit Tim, my fiance, the bonnet of my Austin A35 van flew up and I used the ribbon to tie the bonnet catch to the radiator grille to safely finish the journey. Nearly 57 years later, and after racking up 74 years of teaching between us, we remain happily married and still use some of the surviving items.Vivienne SeakinsRugby, WarwickshireMy sister’s 1981 wedding present list included a toilet roll holder, a “lavatory cleaning set – green”, 13-amp plugs and pan scrubs. She is still happily married, with the cleaning set and holder still in use.Andrew KeeleyWarrington, CheshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Its reward, during the rule of the dictator Siad Barre, was death and destruction in the “hidden war”, a period when many were resettled to Britain (particularly Cardiff, where the first Somalis had arrived in the 1850s) from refugee camps, mainly in Ethiopia.It is now 34 years since Somalilanders pushed back Barre’s army and reasserted its independence. Since then, we have seen several peaceful transitions from one president and party to another following elections.In 2007, I led a UK parliamentary delegation, supported by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, to Somaliland and we also visited the African Union in Addis Ababa to ask why it had not yet recognised Somaliland. The answer was that an internal report recommending recognition was gathering dust because some of its members feared that recognition might encourage breakaway provinces in other countries. But Somaliland is not a breakaway province – it’s a nation that reasserted its independence and has shown a capacity for building its own democratic institutions, pursuing peace and security, and fostering economic growth.In the same period that Somaliland has been a successful democracy,Somalia(the residual south) has been a failed state. Why should those who currently run Somalia not be told to focus on imitating the peace, democracy, cohesion and economic success of Somaliland, instead of being encouraged in a land grab?Understandably perhaps, Foreign Office officials are reluctant to recognise Somaliland before any nation in the region does so, but Britain should stand ready to come second with recognition. Or have we forgotten the enormous contribution made by soldiers from British Somaliland during the second world war and that of Somaliland’s seamen since the middle of the 19th century, as well as the contribution that Somalilanders make nowadays in the UK?Alun MichaelMP for Cardiff South and Penarth (1987–2012); former chair, all-party parliamentary group for Somaliland and SomaliaExplore more on these topicsSomalilandForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeForeign policySomaliaAfricalettersShareReuse this content"

And so you can see, you know, I’m extremely lucky. My wealth has gotten to a very high level here. And now, by accelerating my giving, I will have the Gates Foundation take all of those resources.”He went on to add: “The goals here are pretty basic. They really speak to our values. Mothers should survive delivery. Babies should survive past their fifth birthday – kids should be well nourished. Many of these infectious diseases should go away, and the rest within 20 years should be at a very low level.”Citing his endorsement for artificial intelligence, Gates also said: “I am a technologist at heart. I love backing scientists with great new ideas. And the latest technology that we’re all hearing about is artificial intelligence. And I can say to you that this will be deeply important. It’s an incredible opportunity. It brings challenges with it, but as we drive it forward, it will make a huge difference in health, education and agriculture.”Without naming Donald Trump’s presidential administration, Gates alluded to the slew of federal cuts that have been made across foreign aid programs, saying: “Now, we’re sitting here at a time, actually, of a significant crisis in part of the system where there’s been partnership between countries … Some of those cuts are being made so abruptly that there are complete interruptions in trials, or medicines are still sitting in warehouses and are not available. And these cuts are something that I think are a huge mistake.”Gates’s speech came just weeks after he publicly condemned the budget cuts to USAID by the Trump administration’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), which was run for about four months beginning in January by tech billionaire Elon Musk, the world’s richest man.Speaking to the Financial Times, Gates said the cuts have led to the expiration of vital food and medicines across aid warehouses, which could precipitate deadly diseases’ spread.“The picture of the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one,” Gates, who has previouslycriticizedMusk,toldthe outlet.In a separate press release, the Gates Foundationannouncedthat it and its partners would address three main goals associated with the Microsoft founder’s pledge: end preventable deaths of moms and babies; ensure the next generation grows up without having to suffer from deadly infectious diseases; and lift millions of people out of poverty.The foundation said that it will “sunset its operations” after 20 years.Explore more on these topicsBill GatesAfricaPhilanthropynewsShareReuse this content"

Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militias who follow the former warlordGen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti.The RSF was initially founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia called theJanjaweed, which quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into the RSF, deploying them to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur.The conflict has plunged Sudan into“one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history”, according to UN officials. It has created theworld’s worst displacement crisis, scattering more than 10 million people internally and 4 million who have fled into neighbouring countries, putting mounting pressure on Chad and South Sudan.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As details of the incident emerged, theUN’s refugee agencyconfirmed the number of people who had fled the country since Sudan’s civil war began had surpassed 4 million, and warned that the scale of displacement was “putting regional and global stability at stake”.The attack on the aid convoy occurred about 45 miles (75km) from El Fasher, in Al Koma, a stronghold of the RSF.1:09Footage shows UN aid truck on fire following deadly attack in Sudan – videoA spokesperson for the UN children’s agency,Unicef, said: “We have received information about a convoy withWFP[World Food Programme] and Unicef trucks being attacked last night while positioned in Al Koma, waiting for approval to proceed to El Fasher.”A joint statement from both UN agencies called for an urgent investigation into the deadly attack.So far, the attackers have not yet been officially identified. Both sides in the country’s conflict – the Sudanese army and the RSF – blamed each other.The Al-Koma Emergency Room, a group of local volunteers,posted a videoof a burned out truck, loaded with supplies, and blamed the attack on “Sudanese army drones”.Al Koma was the location of another atrocity at the weekend, when an airstrike on a civilian market by the Sudanese army reportedly killed at least 89 people.The area is firmly under the control of the RSF, with aid trucks forced to navigate a series of the paramilitary group’s checkpoints to reach El Fasher.Last week the WFP expressed “shock” after its premises in El Fasher were repeatedly shelled by the RSF.Women and girls ‘not safe anywhere’ as Darfur suffers surge in sexual violenceRead moreEl Fasher is home to about 2 million people, including about 800,000 internally displaced persons who fled to the city from across Darfur and it remains the only one of five state capitals in the Darfur region not to fall under RSF control.In recent months, it has endured daily shelling amid an ever-tightening siege. Within the city itself, food supplies are running so low that the UN has warned of famine.Activists trapped within El Fasher have said thousands of people face starvation as essential foods and medicines disappear from markets because of the RSF’s siege.Speaking to the activist networkAvaazseveral days ago, a volunteer called Adam said community kitchens in the city no longer had access to maize or wheat. “We used to have goods coming in regularly through vehicles, but now the only goods that enter the city come on donkeys,” he said.“For the entire city of El Fasher, we have no more than 10 donkeys that enter the city carrying goods per day. Even these people carrying limited supplies on their donkeys get questioned and interrogated at RSF [checkpoints].”The civil war, now in its third year, has caused theworld’s biggest humanitarian crisis.In addition to the 4 million people who have now fled Sudan, a record 11.6 million people have also been displaced within the country, about half of whom are in the Darfur region.Both the Sudanese army and the RSF have been accused of myriad war crimes and using starvation as a weapon of war.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaUnited NationsAidMiddle East and north AfricaFaminenewsShareReuse this content"

Click below to send your objection,” she said. She was arrested at her home in Nairobi on Friday, and police confiscated her electronic devices.Her arrest sparked outrage in the country, with politicians, civil society members and Kenyans at large condemning it and calling for her release.Activists and family members protested outside the police station where she was being held on Sunday. “Imagine having to tell her children that she’s in jail for developing a website that eases public participation for Kenyans who want to submit their proposals on the 2025 budget,” activist Boniface Mwangisaid.The executive director of Amnesty International Kenya, Irũngũ Houghton, said ina statementon Tuesday: “It is clear to us that Rose Njeri’s rights have been severally violated, and any contemplated fair trial is in jeopardy.”Njeri’s tool related to a finance bill that proposes a wide range of tax changes to increase government revenue. Expertssayit may increase tax burdens and reduce Kenyans’ disposable income.A similar proposed law last year causedunprecedented proteststhat led to the killing of dozens of protesters and thedisappearanceand abduction of many more. Demonstrations reduced over time, but killings and disappearances continued with the targettending to shift towards online critics.Njeri’s arrest is in line with what observers say is a wave of repression by east African governments cracking down on dissent.The former Kenyan chief justice Willy Mutunga and activistsHanifa Adanand Hussein Khalid were deported from Tanzania two weeks ago. They had travelled to the country to attend a hearing in a treason case against the opposition politicianTundu Lissu.Two other people who had also gone there for the case – Mwangi and the Ugandan lawyer Agather Atuhaire – said on Monday that Tanzanian security officers had sexually assaulted them.View image in fullscreenBoniface Mwangi (right) and Agather Atuhaire give a press conference in Nairobi on Monday.Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Police Reforms Working Group – Kenya, a coalition of rights organisations, called on the east African and international community to put pressure on the Tanzanian government to hold the officers “responsible for the torture … and sexual assault committed against Boniface Mwangi and Agather Atuhaire” accountable.The group spoke alongside the Law Society of Kenya at a press conference in Nairobi.“Torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment are serious crimes under multiple treaties and international law,” they said.InUganda, where the opposition politician Kizza Besigye has been in jail for six months over alleged treason charges, lawmakers passed a bill last month to allow civilians to be tried in military court.Explore more on these topicsKenyaAfricaFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

One such manifestation is the Casablanca Finance City (CFC) district, whose high-rise buildings stand as a symbol of the city’s dream of being a main gateway for international investment into Africa.Since the district launched in December 2010, its attractive tax regime has brought in entities from across the globe. There was a slowdown in sign-ups to the hub during the Covid-19 pandemic but it now hosts 240 companies, including Huawei and Schneider Electric, accounting for more than 7,000 jobs.“We welcome companies from multiple sectors … [and] we also support them in their development into the continent,” said Lamia Merzouki, its chief operating officer.Over the past decade, Moroccan investment across Africa has sharply risen: from $100m in 2014 to $2.8bn in 2024. As of March 2025, it was ranked fourth in the Middle East and Africa region and 56th out of 119 overall on the Global Financial Centres Index.Brigitte Labou, the head of customs practice for Francophone Africa at KPMG Avocats, based in Paris, says hubs such as the CFC are “important levers for accelerating the industrialisation of Africa.“The financial hub that the CFC represents, as well as the related tax advantages, are assets that can attract the relocation of production chains to Morocco and Africa,” she added.Representing a key entry point for business into Africa, the CFC is seen by the Moroccan government as a valuable component of theAfrican Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a trade agreement with the promise of a unified African market of 1.4 billion people and a combined GDP of $3.4tn. It was approved by the African Union in 2012 and launched seven years later, but implementation has been slow.But in a time of global tariff wars, African economists are hoping agreements such as AfCFTA can help.In May, as hundreds of African business executives in various shades of suits converged in Abidjan inIvory Coastfor the Africa CEO Forum, intracontinental trade during tariff disruption topped the agenda.The South African president,Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking during an all-presidential panel in Abidjan, proposed more collaboration on the continent as a solution. “We would like the private sector to follow in tandem with the public sector, and to embrace the AfCFTA and also be active participants … [AfCFTA] is going to be the pathfinder”, he told more than 2,800 delegates.Merzouki agrees. “In this context of trade wars, the African free trade area is really a must,” she said after the session. “We need to accelerate the momentum. Regional integration is a must for us, and this is something that we have been nourishing since the beginning.”There is criticism that the CFC’s focus on attracting foreign capital has done little to address deep-seated inequalities within Morocco. Recent trade data for 2024 also shows that the EU – rather than Africa – is still a destination for at least two-thirds of Moroccan exports.In response to this discrepancy, Merzouki said the data “should not overshadow the dynamic cooperation between Morocco and the rest of Africa”.There is also regular criticism of Morocco’s constitutional monarchy system, but supporters say this has projected an image of calm that seems to have benefited Casablanca, compared with other African hubs.“Even if there are lots of different trade wars and economic upheavals and so on, Morocco remains a stable platform,” said Merzouki. “There is political stability, macroeconomic stability. We have a lot of international players that give us this feedback. They want to come to Casablanca because it remains stable.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since Donald Trump resumed his second term as US president, he has upended trade deals and hiked tariffs, including for all of Africa.The new ‘scramble for Africa’: how a UAE sheikh quietly made carbon deals for forests bigger than UKRead moreThe CFC is also cooperating with two dozen African investment promotion agencies, including those of Nigeria and Ivory Coast, seeking new opportunities to increase infrastructural development. It also hosts the Africa50 fund, a vehicle launched in 2015 by theAfrican Development Bank, with initial capital of $700m from 20 member states, to spur infrastructure development across the continent.The district is also pivoting to accommodate its interest in artificial intelligence – having launched an Africa Innovation Lab to support fintechs – and sustainable financing.Currently, Africa generates only 2% of its potential in carbon credits, which are permits countries or companies can exchange to fund initiatives that reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Merzouki, a co-chair of the UN Development Programme’s Financial Centres for Sustainability Network, thinks the continent can become an energy powerhouse with the right conditions: technology transfer, capacity building, financing.Last September, the CFC signed an agreement with another Moroccan institution to launch a voluntary carbon market for private entities as part of a push to start a carbon-efficient ecosystem.Still, there are limits to African financial hubs such as the CFC: doing business is notoriously difficult in many African countries and red tape and archaic policies continue to stymie the flow of cash and workers across borders.Bright Simons, the vice-president of the Imani Centre for Policy and Education in Accra, Ghana, says the hubs are merely short-term solutions that cloud the big picture.“The unique selling point for the hubs is to try and concentrate resources in a manner that tries to circumvent some of those [logistical and infrastructural] barriers,” he said. “African governments, rather than go the long route of trying to actually fix these problems, are trying to look for shortcuts, and perhaps hubs have become the cleverest but most visible way.”Explore more on these topicsMoroccoMiddle East and north AfricaAfricaInternational tradeGlobal economyTrump tariffsIvory CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They thrive in different ways depending on sunlight, nutrients and water temperature, factors that scientists are currently studying, Barnes said.Experts have also said that agricultural runoff, warming waters and changes in wind, current and rain could have an effect.While large clumps of algae in the open ocean are what Barnes called a “healthy, happy ecosystem” for creatures ranging from tiny shrimp to endangered sea turtles, sargassum near or on the shore can wreak havoc.It can block sunlight that coral reefs need to survive, and if the algae sinks, it can smother reefs and sea grasses. Once it reaches the shore, the creatures living in the algae die or are picked off by birds, Barnes said.Huge piles of stinky seaweed also are a headache for the Caribbean, where tourism often generates big money for small islands.In the popular tourist spot of Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, officials have invested in barriers to prevent sargassum from reaching the shore.In the Dutch Caribbean territory of Sint Maarten, crews with backhoes were dispatched in late May as part of an emergency cleanup after residents complained of strong smells of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which can affect a person’s respiratory system.“The smell is quite terrible,” Barnes said.Meanwhile, in the French Caribbean, officials expect to soon use storage barges and an upgraded special vessel that can collect several tonnes of seaweed a day.The sargassum “disfigures our coasts, prevents swimming and makes life impossible for local residents”, the French prime minister, François Bayrou, recently told reporters.But Frank Comito, special adviser to the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association, said such vessels were “massively expensive” and not a popular option, noting that another method – using heavy equipment – is labor-intensive.“You have to be careful because there could be sea turtle eggs affected,” he said. “It’s not like you can go in there and massively rake and scrape the whole thing.”Some Caribbean islands struggle financially, so most of the cleanup is done by hotels, with some offering guests refunds or a free shuttle to unaffected beaches.Every year, the amount of sargassum expands in late spring, peaks around summer and starts to decline in the late fall or early winter, Barnes said.The new record is likely to be broken – experts said they expect even more sargassum for June.Explore more on these topicsCaribbeanMarine lifeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

After a swift transfer of power that see him take office on Wednesday, Lee will inherit a deeply scarred country.He faces the task of restoring stability after his predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol’s disastrousattempt to impose martial lawin December, in what he said was an attempt to eliminate “anti-state forces”.Lee Jae-myung elected as South Korean president, exit polls sayRead moreAnd Lee will be expected to move quickly to address domestic issues that have been largely sidelined whileSouth Koreaconfronted its biggest political crisis in decades: income inequality, the soaring cost of living and – a hardy perennial for South Korean leaders – how to resurrect dialogue with an increasingly erratic North Korea.Lee, 61, a former factory worker who became a human rights lawyer before entering politics, is no stranger to adversity – or controversy.He campaigned behind protective screens, wearing a bulletproof vest and surrounded by armed guards – an unprecedented precaution in democratic South Korea prompted by reported threats to his life and, in January last year,a knife attackin which he sustained neck injuries that required emergency surgery.The threats to Lee are not only physical. He begins his single five-year term creaking beneath the weight of continuing legal cases that could plunge his presidency into crisis before it has barely begun.Lee faces several charges – which he has denied – the most serious that he made false statement during a televised debate during his last presidential campaign, in 2022.He brings experience of the rough and tumble of South Korean politics, having served as the former leader of the main opposition Democratic party, as well as stints as a governor and mayor.South Korean media have described Lee as stubborn and determined, qualities they trace to his early years as one of seven children growing up in a poor family in Andong, North Gyeongsang province.2:26Liberal Lee Jae-myung elected South Korea's new president – videoHis education was hardly an ideal preparation for a career in law and politics. He frequently skipped classes at primary school – a 5km walk from home – and quit school as a teenager to work in factories to help his mother and sister, both toilet cleaners, pay the bills after they moved to Seongnam, near Seoul.At 13 he was left with a permanent disability after his wrist was crushed by an industrial press. The injury meant he was later exempted from mandatory military service.Lee eventually passed his school exams before studying law on a scholarship, passing the bar exam in 1986 before becoming a human rights lawyer and activist.His transition to politics mirrored the struggling start to his education: he failed to get elected as mayor of Seongnam at his first attempt in 2006, succeeding four years later.‘Democracy isn’t supposed to work like this’: disbelief in Seoul in wake of martial law upheavalRead moreHaving lost his party’s nomination for president to Moon Jae-in in 2017,Lee was defeated in the 2022 electionby Yoon by the slimmest margin – less than one percentage point – in South Korea’s history, after an acrimonious campaign that offered a foretaste of the division that would characterise Yoon’s time in office.Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Lee had benefited from public anger directed towards Yoon and his People Power party [PPP]. “Lee’s victory is not thanks to any particular policy proposals, but rather a result of Yoon’s spectacular collapse,” Easley said.As polling day approached, Lee appeared to agree that Yoon was his greatest electoral asset. In a speech on Monday, he promised to revitalise the economy, reduce inequality and heal a divided country, cautioning that a vote for his PPP opponent, Kim, could reopen the door to Yoon’s “rebellion forces”.He said: “If they somehow win, that will mean … the destruction of democracy, the deprival of people’s human rights, the normalisation of martial law and our country’s downfall into a backward, third-world nation.”Lee was given temporary relief from his legal headaches after courts approved his request to postpone further hearings until after Tuesday’s election.But any guilty verdict now that he is president would spark a debate over constitutional provisions that shield South Korean leaders from criminal prosecution, except against allegations of insurrection or treason. Observers wonder if presidential immunity would halt the prosecutions, or simply prevent any new charges from being brought.Lee called Tuesday’s election “judgment day” for South Korea. He was referring to the opportunity it gave voters to move on from the Yoon era – but his own moment of reckoning may not be far behind.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificYoon Suk YeolLee Jae-myungnewsShareReuse this content"

He said he would not forget the duty of a president to unite the people.Lee, a 61-year-old former human rights lawyer who had made two failed attempts to become president, rode a wave of public anger that followed Yoon’s declaration of martial law in early December.The order, which was overturned in a matter of hours, sparked South Korea’sbiggest political crisis in decades. The country is also battling an economic downturn, income inequality and doubts over the US’s commitment to its security under Donald Trump.Kim, however, struggled to win over moderate swing voters while his People Power party feuded over how to view Yoon’s legacy.As South Korea heads to the polls, can Lee Jae-myung bring the country back from the brink?Read moreTurnout was high, at 77.8% an hour before the polls closed, surpassing the figure recorded in the previous presidential election in 2022, according to the national election commission. More than a third of the 44.39 million eligible voters had cast their ballots in early voting last Thursday and Friday.Some South Koreans view the election, called after the constitutional courtupheld Yoon’s impeachmentin early April, as evidence that their democracy is in good health. In a Facebook message on Tuesday, Lee had cast the election as voters’ opportunity to “save South Korea, which is in crisis due to the greed of the establishment”.But the division unleashed by Yoon is expected to follow Lee into his single five-year term, which begins on Wednesday without the traditional two-month transition period.Large crowds have taken to the streets in recent months todenounceor support Yoon, whose suspension, and then removal, left a leadership vacuum that shook the country’s diplomatic activities and financial markets.“The economy has gotten so much worse since December … Not just for me but I hear that from everybody,” said Kim Kwang-ma, an 81-year-old voter. “And we as a people have become so polarised … I wish we could come together so that Korea can develop again.”Lee Jae-myung: from child labourer to leader of deeply scarred South KoreaRead moreLee, a frontrunner since the start of the campaign, will face several major challenges, including a slowing economy, Trump’s trade war and the nuclear threat posed by North Korea.View image in fullscreenLee Jae-myung on the campaign trail.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn his final campaign speeches on Monday, Lee promised to revitalise the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions.Kim, a former labour minister under Yoon, warned that a victorious Lee would abuse his powers to retaliate against his political opponents and use his party’s majority in the national assembly to protect him in several court cases that will resume after the election.Lee “is now trying to seize all power inSouth Koreaand establish a Hitler-like dictatorship”, Kim told a rally in the south-eastern city of Busan.Lee, who headed the opposition-led campaign to oust Yoon, is a highly divisive figure in South Korean politics. He faces criminal trials including charges of bribery and alleged involvement in a property development scandal.Courts agreed to postpone further hearings of continuing trials until after the election, allowing him to contest the presidency while the cases remained unresolved. Lee denies all charges, describing them as politically motivated persecution.Lee, who grew up in a poor household and worked in factories as a child, has shown a more cautious side in recent speeches, despite his reputation as a radical reformer determined to take on the country’s conservative establishment.He has promised to be pragmatic in foreign affairs, committing himself to South Korea’s alliance with the US and vowing to continue Seoul’s partnership with Washington and Tokyo, mirroring the policies of his conservative predecessor.But he wants to move away from Yoon’s confrontational approach towards North Korea and re-engage with the South’s nuclear-armed neighbour. He has conceded, though, that it will be “very difficult” to quickly resume summits with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificYoon Suk YeolLee Jae-myungnewsShareReuse this content"

While there, she said Australia had been “a very emissions-intensive economy” and that “[we] have to turn that around”.Regenvanu called this “double speak from Australia” and feared the same would take place during Cop.“It’s bewildering for those of us in the Pacific to hear one message and then to see the actions completely contradict what the government is saying to us,” Regenvanu told the Guardian.Despite his concerns around Australia’s support for the fossil fuel industry, Regenvanu said he continued to back the Australian government on the Cop31 bid.“We continue to stand with Australia, but we feel very disappointed in what’s happened,” Regenvanu said.“It raises, obviously, questions about whether Australia really is a partner of choice and whether it really is a friend of the Pacific.”Cop, or the “Conference of parties on climate change”, includes meetings where governments negotiate how to respond to climate change while developing pacts like the Paris agreement to curtail rising global temperatures.The UN climate talkshave been criticisedin the past for being held in major fossil fuel producing countries, with some experts calling for hosts to first prove their climate credentials.Pacific leaders have supported Australia’s bid to host a Pacific Cop in 2026, saying the conference would help highlight the crisis Pacific nations face as a result of a warming climate and help them advocate for more ambitious global action. But regional leaders have also criticised Australia’s continued reliance on fossil fuels.Palau’s president, Surangel Whipps Jr, has saidthe “merit and credibility” of Australia’s bid relies in part on its commitment to shift away from new gas and coal developments. Tuvalu’s minister for home affairs, climate change and environment, Maina Talia, said Australia’s decision to extend the North West Gas shelf project was “threatening our survival and violating the spirit of the Pacific-Australia climate partnership”.Explore more on these topicsPacific islandsVanuatuWoodsideAsia PacificClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

A member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, she is listed as a voting member on thewebsiteof the Golden Globes.In recent months, Kurier has published Sereda-bylined interviews with several high-profile actors including Pamela Anderson, Sarah Jessica Parker and Jude Law.Sources close to Law said no interview between the British actor and the Austrian journalist had taken place and that the only time Kurier could have obtained direct quotes would have been at a press conference at the Toronto international film festival last year where Law spoke to promote his survival thriller Eden.Sereda has been approached by the Guardian for comment.Intended to mark Eastwood’s 95th birthday, the quotes featured in the Kurier piece attracted worldwide attention.“I long for the good old days when screenwriters wrote films like Casablanca in small bungalows on the studio lot. When everyone had a new idea,” the actor was quoted as saying. “My philosophy is: do something new or stay at home.”In his statement to the trade publication Deadline, Eastwood said: “I thought I would set the record straight. I can confirm I’ve turned 95. I can also confirm that I never gave an interview to an Austrian publication called Kurier, or any other writer in recent weeks, and that the interview is entirely phoney.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaNewspapers & magazinesClint EastwoodEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Three bridges over the Rhine have been closed and rail traffic has been halted or diverted.Numerous schools, kindergartens, museums and the tram network, as well as the home of the city’s philharmonic orchestra, have had to close after the entire old town was brought to a halt.The broadcaster RTL had to shift its news programmes to studios in Berlin as its Cologne building sits inside the evacuation area of about 1,000 metres in radius. Several programmes that were due to be transmitted live had to be recorded instead, the broadcaster said.The bombs are due to be defused on Wednesday morning. They are US-produced bombs, two of 1,000kg and one of 500kg. They were discovered on Monday on the right bank of the Rhine during building works near the Deutz shipworks. All three are equipped with impact fuzes intended to cause detonation on contact with a hard surface.Volunteers, police and other city authorities will carry out a round of checks ringing on doorbells, calling through letter boxes and gathering information from residents about their neighbours on Wednesday morning before attempts to defuse the bombs can start. Police have said they have the authority to use force to remove anyone who refuses to leave voluntarily. Locals can call a hotline or refer to awebsitefor advice.Tents and other facilities such as sport halls and churches outside the evacuated area will be open to provide people with food, refreshments and support, city authorities said.Eighty years after the end of the second world war, such finds are stillnot unusual in Cologne, which was among Germany’s most heavily bombed cities during the conflict. It was hit in 262 air raids carried out by the RAF, sometimes using US-produced bombs, especially towards the end of the conflict. About 20,000 people were killed in the bombing raids.On the night of 30 May 1942, the city was the target of the RAF’s first “thousand-bomber raid” on a German city. More than 1,000 aircraft were dispatched, flying in a narrow “bomber stream” formation, the density of which had the effect of overwhelming German radar and defences. On this single night, 868 bombers attacked the city with 1,455 tons of bombs in what was known as Operation Millennium.It is not yet known exactly when the bombs currently awaiting defusing were dropped.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

This city has gotten worse in recent years – now it takes 30 minutes to go two kilometres.”Fellow tax driver, Alessandro, referred to Wolff’s comments as “a banal cliche”.“We are the ones who are first in not having accidents, otherwise we would lose our working day,” he said. “I would like to seeFormula Onedrivers manoeuvring around construction sites, scooters and golf carts the way we do.

The group did not give more information on the improvements it intended to make. Operations would resume on Thursday, the group claimed.The organisation said it was in discussion with the Israeli military to boost security measures beyond the immediate perimeter of GHF sites.Gaza Humanitarian Foundation names US evangelical leader as new chairRead moreGaza’s health ministry said27 people were killed early on Tuesdayas they gathered to received food at one of the GHF’s food distribution hubs. It was the third such incident in three days, with Israel admitting on Tuesday for the first time that its forces shot at Palestinians who were moving towards them.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing “a number of suspects moving towards them”.“The forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces.“The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,” the military said, without specifying who the suspects were.A spokesperson for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza and is backed by Israel, told the Associated Press the group ‘‘was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”.The incident ocurred as the same site where on Sunday more than30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli firewhile they were heading to the distribution hub.The United Nations’ human rights chief, Volker Türk, described the “deadly attacks” on civilians around food distribution as a war crime.“Deadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid inGazaare unconscionable,” Türk said. “Attacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.”Witnesses told the Guardian the shooting started in the city’s Flag Roundabout area, about 1km (0.6 miles) away from the food distribution hub.Fadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the aid site.‘‘When gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,’’ he said. ‘‘He was supposed to get married next month.’’‘‘Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren’t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger,’’ said Fadi.Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, claiming Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters. The group denies this and aid officials in Gazahave said there was no evidenceof any widespread diversion of aid at any stage of the conflict. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.The GHF took over the handling of aid despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, who criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.On Tuesday, an evangelical leader and adviser to Donald Trump on interfaith issues wasappointed the new head of the GHF. Johnnie Moore, a member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and founder of the boutique advisory firm Kairos Company, was appointed the new head of the GHF after Jake Wood, a former marine, resigned,saying that he could not guarantee the GHF’s independencefrom Israeli interests.Moore has been a vocal defender of the GHF who has bristled at public criticism of the rollout, telling the UN chief, António Guterres, on X that reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid inGazawas “a lie … spread by terrorists”.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a US consulting firm, said it had cancelled its contract with the GHF on Tuesday amid growing media scrutiny into the group’s work and sources of funding.In a post on its social media, the GHF announced that its distribution points would be closed on Wednesday for “update, organization and efficiency improvement work”. The group did not give more information on the improvements it intended to make. Operations would resume on Thursday, the group claimed.In a statement, Moore lauded the GHF’s reported delivery of more than 7m meals in the last week, numbers that haven’t been independently verified, and also took aim at media reports about murky finances and chaotic rollouts of the aid distribution centres in Gaza.Local health officials said thatat least one person was killed and more than 50 people injuredon 27 May when Israeli troops opened fire on the second day of operations at a GHF distribution centre.“GHF believes that serving the people of Gaza with dignity and compassion must be the top priority,” Moore said in a statement. “We welcome others to join us and urge extreme caution against sharing unverified information from sources that have repeatedly issue demonstrably false reports.“False reporting of violence at our sites has a chilling effect on the local population and we can think of no greater disservice to a community in dire need,” he said.A biography on the Kairos website calls Moore a “noted evangelical friend of the State of Israel” and says that he has played an important role in US outreach to Middle Eastern governments, including in the conclusion of the Abraham accords to normalise relations between Israel and Arab states. John Acree, the acting director of the GHF, said that Moore has a “proven record of principled leadership and hands-on humanitarian work”.But Moore’s paucity of experience working with major charitable organisations will make it difficult for him to refute criticisms about the GHF’s lack of independence and experience dealing with a major humanitarian crisis.BCG, which was reported to be handling key logistics planning, abandoned the project late last week and a representative told CNN that “unapproved follow-on work relating to Gaza lacked buy-in from multilateral stakeholders and was stopped on May 30”.“BCG has not and will not be paid for any of this work,” the organisation said.BCG also told reporters that they had placed the employee responsible for overseeing the project on administrative leave pending an internal review. The Washington Post, which first reported on BCG cutting ties with the GHF, said that the consulting group was instrumental in planning GHF’s operations.Three people closely connected to both theGHF and BCG told the Washington Post that it would be difficult for the foundation to continue to function without the consultants who helped create it.“In addition to helping develop the initiative in close coordination with Israel, BCG set the prices for paying and equipping the array of contractors who built four distribution hubs in southern Gaza to deliver the aid,” the newspaper reported.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelTrump administrationUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In a video taken at the scene andposted by Abraham, an IDF major gives the journalists “a reasonable time of 10 minutes” to leave.The two film-makers can be seen remonstrating with the officer, pointing out that Adra had invited the journalists to his own home. “They are coming to see the destruction in Masafer Yatta, the way that you are destroying the community, the settler violence,” Abraham says.The major responds by saying that the journalists were being prevented from visiting “to keep order in this area”, claiming they were causing a “public disturbance”.Adra replies: “You didn’t prevent the settlers when they came to burn the homes inside, the cars, and attack people. I have so many videos of settlers coming to attack us and shoot people here. You do nothing. Why?

Eight more later died from their wounds.A video circulating on social media documented the arrival of injured people at the Red Cross hospital from a food distribution point in Gaza’s Rafah governorate.

Bullets were raining down on us from everywhere: from the sea, from the air, from the hills, from all directions. I was a victim, along with many others around me; some were injured, others were killed.“I raised my shoulder while trying to lie on my stomach, and that’s when the first bullet struck my shoulder,” he said. “Anyone who tried to help the wounded was also shot at.

The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound to re-establish control as thousands of Palestinians rushed to the site.More than30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire on Sundayas they went to receive food at a GHF distribution point, according to witnesses. A hospital run by the Red Cross confirmed it treated many wounded.The Israeli forces denied “firing at civilians” in Sunday’s incident. However, an IDF official admitted that Israeli soldiers fired “warning shots toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops”, near the food distribution site, without specifying who the suspects were.Gaza’s Government Media Office said Israel had killed more than 102 civilians since the opening of the of aid centres run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.The GHF took over the handling of aid despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, who criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaHamasIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Given the tens of billions at stake, and the dangers on site to both the environment and human life, this is simply not good enough.”He added: “As with the fight against climate change, the sheer scale of the hundred-year timeframe of the decommissioning project makes it hard to grasp the immediacy of safety hazards and cost overruns that delays can have.“Every day at Sellafield is a race against time to complete works before buildings reach the end of their life. Our report contains too many signs that this is a race that Sellafield risks losing.”MPs noted that one project, a now-paused replacement of an on-site lab, had resulted in “£127m wasted”.The cost of cleaning up Sellafield has causedtensions with the Treasuryas the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, attempts to tighten public spending and spur growth. Sellafield, which is home to the world’s largest store of plutonium, said in February that nearly £3bn in new funding was“not enough”.Last year, Sellafield apologised and wasfined £332,500after it pleaded guilty to criminal charges over years of cybersecurity failings.The PAC noted that the timeline for a government project to create a long-term deep underground store for nuclear waste, including that held at Sellafield, had slipped from 2040 to the late 2050s. The government is considering sites in Cumbria and Lincolnshire, although Lincolnshire county council is expected to withdraw the latter from the process aftervocal local opposition.The MPs said they had found “indications of a suboptimal culture” at Sellafield, and noted that theNDA paid £377,200in 2023-24 to settle employment-related claims. Alison McDermott, a former HR consultant whoraised concerns over bullying and a “toxic culture”at the site, said she felt “vindicated” by the report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said Sellafield should report annually on progress against targets and explain how it is addressing the deteriorating condition of its assets. The NDA should publish data on the prevalence of bullying and harassment at nuclear sites, it said.Clifton-Brown said there were “early indications of some improvements in Sellafield’s delivery” but said the government needed to do “far more” to ensure bosses safeguard the public and taxpayer funds.The NDA’s chief executive, David Peattie, responding on behalf of Sellafield, said: “We welcome the scrutiny of the committee and their report. We will now look in more detail at the recommendations and consider how best to address them.“We take the findings seriously, and the safety of the site and the wellbeing of our people will always be our highest priorities.”A spokesperson for the Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero said: “We expect the highest standards of safety and security as former nuclear sites are dismantled, and the regulator is clear that public safety is not compromised at Sellafield.“We continue to support the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in its oversight of Sellafield, while driving value for money. This is underpinned by monthly performance reviews and increased responsibility for overseeing major project performance, enabling more direct scrutiny and intervention.“We have zero-tolerance of bullying, harassment and offensive behaviour in the workplace – we expect Sellafield and the NDA to operate on this basis, investigate allegations and take robust action when needed.”Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerNuclear LeaksEnergyEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But meanwhile, fare evasion remains a significant problem, and rigorous action should be taken against those who intentionally seek to defraud the railway.”Peter Hendy, the rail minister, said privatisation had “created a mess of deep-rooted issues across our railway”, and the creation of Great British Railways would “establish oversight and … end inconsistent prosecutions and making sure passengers are treated fairly”.He added: “Deliberate fare-dodging costs the taxpayer up to £400m annually and must be dealt with, but ham-fisted prosecutions that punish people who have made an innocent mistake is not the way to do this.”A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, said it welcomed the ORR’s “sensible recommendations”.They said: “We need to strike the right balance addressing genuine, honest mistakes made by customers and taking firm action against those who deliberately and persistently seek to exploit the system.”The watchdog Transport Focuscalled for a “yellow card” systemfor passengers who travel without the correct ticket on a national database.Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail faresRail transportTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022 she was elected president of the Royal Society of Literature, becoming the first writer of colour and only the second woman to hold the position.Throughout her career, Evaristo has launched several successful writing schemes designed to support female writers and under-represented writers of colour, most recently launching theRSL Scriptorium awards, which give 10 writers a year the opportunity to use her Kent cottage for a writing retreat.“I am completely overwhelmed and overjoyed to receive this unique award,” Evaristo said. “Over the last three decades, I have witnessed with great admiration and respect how the Women’s prize for fiction has so bravely and brilliantly championed and developed women’s writing, always from an inclusive stance.”She said the prize money was “an unexpected blessing in my life” and “it seems fitting that I spend this substantial sum supporting other women writers”. Details on how she will do that will follow, she said.Funded by Bukhman Philanthropies, the prize is designed to reflect the founding principles of the Women’s prize for fiction, “to celebrate and amplify women’s voices; to open the pathways into writing as a viable career choice for women from all backgrounds; and to shine a spotlight on exceptional, original books for readers to discover and enjoy.”As well as the prize money, Evaristo will receive a sculpture named Thoughtful by the artist Caroline Russell, to be awarded on 12 June when the winners of the Women’s prizes for fiction and nonfiction will also be revealed.The judging panel was chaired by the author and Women’s prize founder Kate Mosse, who was joined by a selection of former Women’s prize for fiction judges: the academic and writer Gillian Beer; the writer and activist Scarlett Curtis; the playwright and author Bonnie Greer; and the broadcaster Vick Hope. To be eligible for the prize, authors had to have published at least five books and been previously longlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Tweaks and tinkering won’t do | Polly ToynbeeRead moreWith ministers looking for ways to combat the electoral threat of Reform UK,Labourofficials are attempting to refocus anxious backbenchers away from expected cuts in day-to-day spending, and on to capital budgets. “We’re investing to rebuild,” one said.The spending review will be a difficult one for the government, however, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies saying the chancellor faces “unavoidably tough decisions” as the demands of funding for the NHS and defence raise the prospect of deep cuts elsewhere.“We have a big battle with how to frame this,” one minister told the Guardian. “The big risk is that people get the [spending] review, turn to the back of the book and see the minus numbers and the story is big cuts.“But the difference is what it would have been without massive extra investment that came from the budget, or the capital spending which is huge. It will be a job to set that out. I think a lot of cabinet ministers – perhaps all apart from Ed and Yvette – do get that.”Reeves’s allies argue that departments will receive £300bn more than the Conservatives had planned as a result of the decisions she took in the autumn budget, such as loosening the fiscal rules on capital spending. This includes £190bn more on day-to-day spending over the parliament.Much of the extra £113bn in capital spending will be inareas outside the south-east of England, and Reeves has confirmed Treasury investment rules will be rewritten to give extra weight to schemes that increase productivity in the Midlands and the north.In a speech in GreaterManchesteron Wednesday morning, she is expected to say this represents a “step change in how government approaches and evaluates the case for investing in our regions … to make sure that this government gives every region a fair hearing when it comes to investments”.She will add: “A Britain that is better off cannot rely on a handful of places forging ahead of the rest of the country. [The] result of such thinking has been growth created in too few places, felt by too few people and wide gaps between regions, and between our cities and towns.”Government sources said that some departments that settled with the Treasury the earliest had some of the harshest settlements and thus faced the biggest cuts, including the Foreign Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.Some departments, including Defra and education, settled early this week. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, is said to have sealed his own settlement with capital cash for flood defences.One cabinet source who had settled in recent days said they felt there was a greater recognition in the Treasury of the pressure departments were under and that most negotiations with Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, had been cordial.The Ministry of Justice, under Shabana Mahmood, one of the first to settle so that Mahmood could announce the prison funding, is being held up to ministers as an example of a department that had a clear realistic ask and got much of the substantial funding it had asked for.However, both Miliband and Cooper are said to have had fiery meetings with Jones, asking to deal with Reeves directly. Of those still to settle, Cooper has been fighting the hardest against what she sees as an impossible settlement particularly on policing – with the pressure to both increase police numbers, halve knife crime and violence against women and girls, and deal with early releases.Six police chiefs publicly warned last week that the funding gap meant that Labour could miss its manifesto promises.On Tuesday night it emerged Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan police, and other senior police officers had written to the prime minister warning him that they would face “stark choices” about which crimes to investigate if the Treasury pushed ahead withcuts.The Times reported that in a letter sent on Friday – and signed by Rowley, Gavin Stephens, the head of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, and Graeme Biggar, the head of the National Crime Agency (NCA) – they wrote: “We are deeply concerned that the settlement for policing and the [NCA], without additional investment, risks a retrenchment to what we saw under austerity. This would have far-reaching consequences.”Miliband has also been locked in a struggle with the Treasury, including over funding for a “warm homes” insulation plan that insiders believe is set to be cut. One cabinet minister pointed to other areas that had received investment including nuclear and carbon capture. “You can’t get everything,” they added.The main fight for Rayner is over the affordable homes budget, given that both she and Reeves had promised a generational shift in social housing when £2bn for the programme was announced before the spring statement – then described as “down payment” on further funding to be announced at the spending review – which now does not look to be forthcoming.Among the regional transport projects set to receive government backing next week are some that were promised by the Conservatives, but for which the money was never allocated, potentially including a new railway between Manchester and Liverpool.The £15.6bn package announced on Wednesday is expected to include £2.4bn for theWest Midlandsto fund an extension of the region’s metro from Birmingham city centre to the new sports quarter, and £2.1bn to start building West Yorkshire Mass Transit by 2028.Greater Manchester will receive £2.5bn for projects including new tram stops in Bury, Manchester and Oldham and an extension of the tram network to Stockport.A £1.5bn investment inSouth Yorkshirewill include £530m to renew the region’s trams, while the East Midlands will receive £2bn to design a new mass transit system between Derby and Nottingham.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesEconomic growth (GDP)Transport policyEconomicsLabourTransportWest MidlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Treasury hopes next week’s spending review will be remembered for the chancellor’s largesse.Her team have consistently been frustrated that despite announcing tax increases worth £40bn a year by the end of the parliament, and radically rewriting the fiscal rules, Reeves has failed to win much political credit for unlocking additional investment.The Treasury argues that its plans amount to more than£100bn in additional capital investmentover the next five years, compared with what her predecessor Jeremy Hunt expected to spend.Reeves believes under-investment is a long-term bugbear of the UK economy. She made space for this additional infrastructure spending by changing the fiscal rules to allow her to borrow to invest – and shifting the definition of government debt, to take into account financial assets owned by the taxpayer.The chancellor will be in Manchester on Wednesday to announce aslate of transport investmentsoutside London, as part of this uplift in investment, with more to come next week.She has been inviting groups of Labour MPs into No 11 this week to tell them the good news about high-profile projects in their constituencies – though some fret that they are unlikely to materialise rapidly enough to bring much electoral benefit.After fraught cabinet negotiations, the spending review will parcel out among Whitehall departments the spending for the next three years which was announced at the spring statement – the “envelope”, as the Treasury calls it.Alongside infrastructure projects, the chancellor is expected to prioritise health, defence and economic growth, with the latter including the government’s long-awaited industrial strategy.Reeves and her cabinet colleagues will be keen to point to the potential benefits of this additional spending, not least a less dysfunctional NHS.Outside these key areas, some departmental settlements are expected to be painfully tight, particularly towards the later end of the three-year period the spending review covers: a point that will inevitably be made by thinktanks such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Reeves’s enforcer, Darren Jones – the chief secretary to the Treasury – insists departments should be looking for ways to make resources go further over time, through innovation and cracking down on waste.And the chancellor is expected to offer a robust defence ofher fiscal rules, which despitemounting disquietinside her own party, her team contend are necessary to maintain the stability of the public finances.Under the rules, day-to-day spending must be covered by taxation. Reeves’s allies believe this tough constraint is necessary, to maintain the market confidence the Treasury needs, to ratchet up borrowing to fund investment.But critics argue that it distorts decision-making, forcing the government into choices like the £5bn in welfare cuts made in the spring statement, in order to ensure the rules were on course to be met.Another controversial choice Reeves made to balance the books, the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance, is also likely to come under intense scrutiny , with the chancellor unable to say as yet how the partial U-turn on the policy will be funded (or indeed exactly who will receive the payment this winter).She is also likely to be challenged about whether she will find the resources for other Labour priorities, including tackling child poverty – a full strategy on which is now not expected until the autumn.After thebruising reversal of the winter fuel allowancedecision, with which she was so closely associated, Reeves will be hoping next week will be more about spending than cuts. But it is also likely to underline, yet again, the difficulties of achieving some of Labour’s central aims within the fiscal constraints the Treasury has set.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsEconomic policyEconomicsTax and spendingRachel ReevesSpring statement 2025BenefitsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Four decades after the blockbuster film debuted, the guitar’s creator has launched a search for the cherry red Gibson ES-345.Gibson, which is based in Nashville, is asking the public for help tracking it down as the movie turns 40 and as the company produces a new documentary about the search and the film, Lost to the Future.In a video by Gibson, with the movie’s theme song playing in the background, Back to the Future stars such as Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Harry Waters Jr make a cinematic plea.There’s also a surprise appearance by Huey Lewis, whose band Huey Lewis and the News performed the soundtrack’s headliner song, The Power of Love.Lloyd, in the cadence of Doc Brown, says in the video that the guitar has been “lost to the future”.“It’s somewhere lost in the space-time continuum,” says Fox, who played McFly. “Or it’s in some Teamster’s garage.”In the film, McFly steps in for an injured band member at the 1955 school dance with the theme Enchantment under the Sea, playing the guitar as students slow dance to Earth Angel. He then leads Marvin Berry and the Starlighters in a rendition of Johnny B Goode, calling it an oldie where he comes from even though the 1958 song doesn’t exist yet for his audience.Fox said he wanted McFly to riff through his favorite guitarists’ signature styles – Jimi Hendrix behind the head, Pete Townshend’s windmill and the Eddie Van Halen hammer.After digging and dancing to Johnny B Goode, the students at the dance fall into an awkward silence as McFly’s riffs turn increasingly wild.“I guess you guys aren’t ready for that yet,” McFly says. “But your kids are gonna love it.”Explore more on these topicsBack To The FuturenewsShareReuse this content"

He ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide them with hormone therapy and accommodations such as clothing and hair-removal devices while the lawsuit plays out.The ruling does not require the bureau to provide surgical care related to gender transitions.Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said theTrump administrationexpects to ultimately prevail in the legal dispute.“The district court’s decision allowing transgender women, aka MEN, in women’s prisons fundamentally makes women less safe and ignores the biological truth that there are only two genders,” Fields said in an email.The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the prisoners, said the ruling was “a critical reminder to the Trump administration that trans people, like all people, have constitutional rights that don’t simply disappear because the president has decided to wage an ideological battle”.About 2,230 transgender inmates are housed in federal custodial facilities and halfway houses, according to the Department of Justice. About two-thirds of them, 1,506, are transgender women, most of whom are housed in men’s prisons.The named plaintiffs, two transgender men and one transgender woman, sued the Trump administration in March to challenge Trump’s 20 January executive order aimed at combating what the administration called “gender ideology extremism”.The executive order directed the federal government to only recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; and house transgender women in men’s prisons. It also ordered the bureau to stop spending any money on “any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex”.Lamberth, appointed by the Republican president Ronald Reagan, said in Tuesday’s ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their lawsuit because the bureau did not perform any analysis before cutting off treatment that its own medical staff had previously deemed to be medically appropriate for the inmates.Even if it had extensively studied the issue before deciding to stop gender-affirming care, the decision might still violate the US constitution’s eighth amendment’s protections against “cruel and unusual” punishment, Lamberth wrote.The Department of Justice had argued that the judge should defer to the policy decision of a democratically elected president, but Lamberth said a functioning democracy requires respect for “all duly enacted laws”, including those that blocked the executive branch from acting in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner.Democratic self-governance “does not mean blind submission to the whims of the most recent election-victor”, Lamberth wrote.The executive order said it was meant to promote the “dignity, safety, and wellbeing of women, and to stop the spread of ‘gender ideology’” which denies “the immutable biological reality of sex”.But the inmates receiving hormone treatments had little interest in promoting any ideology, and were instead taking “measures to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria”, Lamberth wrote.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS prisonsLGBTQ+ rightsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Not about everything, but about a small slice – just enough to turn their regret, their buyer’s remorse, into criminality,” Aidala said. “Mr Weinstein sits here an innocent man.

The only ones who can take that away are the 12 of you … ”He concluded: “If this guy wasn’tHarvey Weinstein, would we even be here?”Florida sandwich shop staffer helps free kidnapped domestic violence victimRead moreDistrict attorney Nicole Blumberg followed with a summation that Weinstein had used his power in the entertainment industry to “physically and emotionally overpower” his accusers.“He didn’t have an interest in their careers,” Blumberg said. “He had an interest in their bodies. He didn’t care what they wanted. He cared what he wanted.”Addressing Aidala’s claim that Weinstein was “the one getting abused here”, Blumberg said: “The defense is no victim in this case – and to suggest otherwise is offensive.” The prosecution is scheduled to continue its closing on Wednesday before the case is handed to the jury for deliberations.Six weeks after prosecutors began laying out their case against him (largely a re-airing of a 2020 criminal prosecution, with one additional accuser, that was later overturned on appeal), the matter will be deliberated again by jurors, without Weinstein testifying.He is charged with assaulting three women in Manhattan between 2006 and 2013 – Mimi Haley, Jessica Mann and Kaja Sokola – and has been appearing in court each day in a wheelchair from Manhattan’s Bellevue hospital, where he is being treated for a number of ailments, including chronic myeloid leukemia.Manhattan’s district attorney, Alvin Bragg, who is facing re-election this year, opted to retry Weinstein soon after his first conviction on third-degree rape and a criminal sexual charge was vacated because prosecutors were found to have prejudiced the jury by calling witnesses whose testimony was unrelated to the charges.The decision to bring a second prosecution inNew Yorkrequired the 73-year-old Weinstein to travel from California, where he was serving a 16-year sentence for sexual assault. The second New York trial avoided the most serious sexual assault charges that he was cleared of in 2020 to avoid double jeopardy.At trial, prosecutors have sought to establish that Weinstein used his power in the film industry to sexually assault and “exert enormous control” over the three women, each of whom were seeking to gain a footing in the business.In opening statements, assistant DA Shannon Lucey said Weinstein had offered his accusers film scripts and promises of fame, and he “used those dream opportunities as weapons”.Prosecutors avoided introducing so-called prior bad acts testimony – but brought an additional sex crimes charge related to Sokola, who accused Weinstein of performing oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel on one occasion in early 2006.Weinstein’s defense team pushed back on that claim, offering jurors the testimony of Helga Samuelsen, a friend of Sokola’s, who said Weinstein had visited Sokola months earlier in their shared apartment and spent about a half hour in a bedroom with her. Sokola earlier testified that the alleged encounter had not happened.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All three said they believed Weinstein could help them with their professional goals and maintained relationships with him, and, in some instances, he had helped them find work.Aidala told jurors that the three women had “fooled around with him consensually”, adding “they were flirtatious, they were friendly, they wanted him, they needed him, he could change the trajectories of their lives”.But a clinical psychologist, testifying for the prosecution, said that for a variety of reasons, it is not unusual for sexual assault victims to remain on good terms with their assailants after an assault.In total, prosecutors introduced evidence from 24 witnesses during Weinstein’s retrial. They included former assistants, friends of his accusers and workers at the hotels where the alleged assaults took place.Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty, elected not to testify in his defense – repeating the same decision he made in the earlier trials.Aidala said his client very much wanted to take the stand – and had been prepped to do so – before Weinstein decided against it as a matter of courtroom strategy.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

Nor does any evidence exist that unauthorized immigrants fraudulently receive benefits in large numbers,” wrote Geoffrey Sanzenbacher, an economics professor at Boston College, in ablogpost.Lee Thacker moved to south-west Minnesota last summer with his now wife, a native of the US. After getting married, he applied for a work authorization card while his permanent residency application was being processed.When the 52-year-old from Pontypridd in Wales received his work authorization card at the end of April 2025, he began applying for jobs and received a job offer. After he failed to receive his social security number,“I lost the job,” said Thacker.“I needed a background check and the company doing the check required a social security number, and the company itself has a policy of not employing people without social security numbers. So I am legally entitled to work, but in practice I can’t because no one will employ me without a social security number.”He noted the work authorization form, I-765, still has acheckboxon it to fill out to receive a social security number card, which he did. He paid $260 for the employment authorization card application and was expecting to receive a social security number within two weeks of receiving his work authorization card.Thacker was not informed why until he visited a Social Security Administration field office about half an hour away, where he was informed about the change.In 2022, undocumented immigrants paid$25.7bnin taxes to social security, despite not being eligible to receive the benefits.“It’s definitely affected a lot of individuals. We’ve tried to warn all of our clients,” said Jennifer Bade, an immigration lawyer based in Boston, Massachusetts.Bade explained the issues and difficulties immigrants face in visiting a Social Security Administration field office, including having to take time off work, language barriers, and issues and delays for immigrants who need a social security number to start a job, open a bank account, or receive a loan.“The pausing of this program makes no sense,” added Bade. “It’s all just meant to attack immigrants, and it has no actual benefits. Pausing this program literally has no benefits.”Democrats on the House committee on oversight and government reformurgedthe Social Security Administration to reverse its decision to freeze the program.According to the then ranking member of the committee, the late congressman Gerald Connolly, the acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration personally approved the pause despite legal concerns and warnings over the effects of pausing the program.Hope Rudasill of North Carolina said her husband, whose name is being kept anonymous for fear of retaliation, recently filed for a work authorization card, but did not expect the delay in receiving a social security number, as he was told it would be issued automatically when he filed his application.“My husband hasn’t been able to start his job search because most employers require a valid social security number before even considering applications. It’s also prevented him from applying for a driver’s license which limits his ability to get around independently,” Rudasill told the Guardian.“We haven’t been able to open a joint bank account, which is not only inconvenient for managing finances, but also creates challenges when we go to ouradjustment of statusinterview [an essential part of applying for lawful permanent residency] as a shared bank account is a key piece of evidence to prove we’re building a life together and not having that documentation makes the process more stressful.”The rule change came as billionaire Musk pushed misinformation about immigrants and social security benefits, includingtouting datafrom the Enumeration Beyond Entry program, falselyclaimingit was evidence of fraud.In fiscal year 2024, 3.24m initial employment authorization documents were approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services.The costs of issuing a social security number through this program in the same year, according to a Social Security Administrationmemo, was $8 per issuance, compared with $55.80 in a field office.Those field offices are also operating with reduced staff, as the Social Security Administration sought to cut staff by at least12%, and Doge hasterminatedleases for at least 47 offices at the agency. The freeze is likely to add even more pressure to staff at the agency, in addition to new phone restrictions implemented by the Trump administration, which will require individuals to make1.93m additional tripsto social security field offices annually.“I was hoping I would be able to work within a few months of applying for permanent residency, once I got the employment authorization card,” Lee Thacker added. “If I had known social security cards were no longer being sent out automatically, I would have made an in-person visit shortly after getting my employment authorization card. There must be many people waiting patiently expecting to receive their social security cards. If this is a permanent change local SSA offices will be receiving more in-person visits at a time when staffing numbers are being reduced.”The US Citizenship and Immigration Services did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The Social Security Administration said in an email: “The Enumeration Beyond Entry (EBE) process is currently paused for noncitizens granted work authorization (I-765) and newly naturalized US citizens (N-400) for 90 days, while the agency is evaluating its enumeration policies and procedures. SSA will continue to process EBE applications for those granted legal permanent resident status (I-485) along with all EBE applications that were filed prior to March 18, 2025.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS social securityUS immigrationUS work & careersUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Other large tech companies are looking to secure electricity as US power demand rises significantly in part due to the needs ofartificial intelligenceand datacenters.Google has reached agreementsto supply its datacenters with nuclear power via a half-dozen small reactors built by aCaliforniautility company. Microsoft’s similar contract will restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, the site of the most serious nuclear accident and radiation leak in US history.Illinois helps subsidize Constellation Energy’s nuclear plant, the Clinton CleanEnergyCenter, with a ratepayer-funded zero-emissions credit program that awards benefits for the generation of power virtually free of carbon emissions. That expires in 2027, when Meta’s power purchase agreement will support the plant with an unspecified amount of money to help with relicensing and operations.Three Mile Island nuclear reactor to restart to power Microsoft AI operationsRead moreThe deal allows Constellation to expand Clinton, which has a capacity of 1,121 megawatts, by 30MW. The plant powers the equivalent of about 800,000 US homes. Clinton began operating in 1987 and last year Constellation applied with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to renew its license through 2047.The deal could serve as a model for other big tech companies to support existing nuclear while they also plan to power datacenters with new nuclear and other energy sources.Urvi Parekh, head of global energy atMeta, said: “One of the things that we hear very acutely from utilities is they want to have certainty that power plants operating today will continue to operate.”Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation, said, “We’re definitely having conversations with other clients, not just in Illinois, but really across the country, to step in and do what Meta has done, which is essentially give us a backstop so that we could make the investments needed to relicense these assets and keep them operating.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not if this lot have anything to do with itEmine SanerTue 3 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareThe novelist Ewan Morrison was alarmed, though amused, to discover he had written a book called Nine Inches Pleases a Lady. Intrigued by the limits of generative artificial intelligence (AI), he had askedChatGPTto give him the names of the 12 novels he had written. “I’ve only written nine,” he says. “Always eager to please, it decided to invent three.” The “nine inches” from the fake title it hallucinated was stolen from a filthyRobert Burns poem. “I just distrust these systems when it comes to truth,” says Morrison. He is yet to write Nine Inches – “or its sequel, Eighteen Inches”, he laughs. His actual latest book,For Emma, imagining AI brain-implant chips, is about the human costs of technology.Morrison keeps an eye on the machines, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and their capabilities, but he refuses to use them in his own life and work. He is one of a growing number of people who are actively resisting: people who are terrified of the power of generative AI and its potential for harm and don’t want to feed the beast; those who have just decided that it’s a bit rubbish, and more trouble than it’s worth; and those who simply prefer humans to robots.Go online, and it’s easy to find AI proponents who dismiss refuseniks as ignorant luddites – or worse, smug hipsters. I possibly fall into both camps, given that I have decidedly Amish interests (board games, gardening,animal husbandry) and write for the Guardian. Friends swear by ChatGPT for parenting advice, and I know someone who uses it all day for work in her consultancy business, but I haven’t used it since playing around after it launched in 2022. Admittedly ChatGPT might have done a better job, but this piece was handcrafted using organic words from my artisanal writing studio. (OK, I meanbed.) I could have assumed my interviewees’ thoughts from plundering their social media posts and research papers, as ChatGPT would have done, but it was far more enjoyable to pick up the phone and talk, human to human. Two of my interviewees were interrupted by their pets, and each made me laugh in some way (full disclosure: AI then transcribed the noise).View image in fullscreenEwan Morrison: ‘It’s a product of venture capital gone nuts’Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty ImagesOn X, where Morrison sometimes clashes with AI enthusiasts, a common insult is“decel”(decelerationist), but it makes him laugh when people think he’s the one who isn’t keeping up. “There’s nothing [that stops] accelerationism more than failure to deliver on what you promised. Hitting a brick wall is a good way to decelerate,” he says. Onerecent studyfound that AI answered more than 60% of queries inaccurately.Morrison was drawn into the argument by what he would now call “alarmist fears about the potential for superintelligence and runaway AI. The more I’ve got into it, the more I realise that’s a fiction that’s been dangled before the investors of the world, so they’ll invest billions – in fact,half a trillion– into this quest for artificial superintelligence. It’s a fantasy, a product of venture capital gone nuts.”There are also copyright violations – generative AI is trained on existing material – that threaten him as a writer, and his wife, screenwriter Emily Ballou. In the entertainment industry, he says, people are using “AI algorithms to determine what projects get the go-ahead, and that means we’re stuck remaking the past. The algorithms say ‘More of the same’, because it’s all they can do.”I read because I want to understand how somebody sees the world. There’s no ‘somebody’ in the synthetic text-extruding machinesMorrison says he has a long list of complaints. “They’ve been stacking up over the past few years.” He is concerned about the job losses (Bill Gates recently predicted AI would lead to a two-day work week). Then there are “tech addiction, the ecological impact, the damage to the education system –92% of studentsare now using AI”. He worries about the way tech companies spy on us to make AI personalised, and is horrified at AI-enabled weapons being used in Ukraine. “I find that ethically revolting.”Others cite similar reasons for not using AI. April Doty, an audiobook narrator, is appalled at the environmental cost – the computational power required to perform an AI search and answer is huge. “I’m infuriated that you can’t turn off the AI overviews in Google search,” she says. “Whenever you look anything up now you’re basically torching the planet.” She has started to use other search engines. “But, more and more, we’re surrounded by it, and there’s no off switch. That makes me angry.” Where she still can, she says, “I’m opting out of using AI.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Kaan Illustration/The GuardianIn her own field, she is concerned about the number of books that are being “read” by machines. Audible, the Amazon-owned audiobook provider, has just announced it will allow publishersto create audiobooksusing its AI technology. “I don’t know anybody who wants a robot to read them a story, but I am concerned that it is going to ruin the experience to the point where people don’t want to subscribe to audiobook platforms any more,” says Doty. She hasn’t lost jobs to AI yet but other colleagues have, and chances are, it will happen. AI models can’t “narrate”, she says. “Narrators don’t just read words; they sense and express the feelings beneath the words. AI can never do this job because it requires decades of experience in being a human being.”Emily M Bender, professor of linguistics at the University of Washington and co-author of a new book,The AI Con, has many reasons why she doesn’t want to use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. “But maybe the first one is that I’m not interested in reading something that nobody wrote,” she says. “I read because I want to understand how somebody sees something, and there’s no ‘somebody’ inside the synthetic text-extruding machines.” It’s just a collage made from lots of different people’s words, she says.Does she feel she is being “left behind”, as AI enthusiasts would say? “No, not at all. My reaction to that is, ‘Where’s everybody going?’” She laughs as if to say: nowhere good.“When we turn to synthetic media rather than authentic media, we are losing out on human connection,” says Bender. “That’s both at a personal level – what we get out of connecting to other people – and in terms of strength of community.” She cites Chris Gilliard, the surveillance and privacy researcher. “He made the very important point that you can see this as a technological move by the companies to isolate us from each other, and to set things up so that all of our interactions are mediated through their products. We don’t need that, for us or our communities.”Despite Bender’s well-publicised position – she has long been a high-profile critic of LLMs – incredibly, she has seen students turn in AI-generated work. “That’s very sad.” She doesn’t want to be policing, or even blaming, students. “My job is to make sure students understand why it is that turning to a large language model is depriving themselves of a learning opportunity, in terms of what they would get out of doing the work.”Does she think people should boycott generative AI? “Boycott suggests organised political action, and sure, why not?” she says. “I also think that people are individually better off if they don’t use them.”I almost feel I have no choice but to use AI at this point. I might have to put morals asideSome people have so far held out, but are reluctantly realising they may end up using it. Tom, who works in IT for the government, doesn’t use AI in his tech work, but found colleagues were using it in other ways. Promotion is partly decided on annual appraisals they have to write, and he had asked a manager whose appraisal had impressed him how he’d done it, thinking he’d spent days on it. “He said, ‘I just spent 10 minutes – I used ChatGPT,’” Tom recalls. “He suggested I should do the same, which I don’t agree with. I made that point, and he said, ‘Well, you’re probably not going to get anywhere unless you do.’” Using AI would feel like cheating, but Tom worries refusing to do so now puts him at a disadvantage. “I almost feel like I have no choicebutto use it at this point. I might have to put morals aside.”Others, despite their misgivings, limit how they use it, and only for specific tasks. Steve Royle, professor of cell biology at the University of Warwick, uses ChatGPT for the “grunt work” of writing computer code to analyse data. “But that’s really the limit. I don’t want it to generate code from scratch. When you let it do that, you spend way more time debugging it afterwards. My view is, it’s a waste of time if you let it try and do too much for you.” Accurate or not, he also worries that if he becomes too reliant on AI, his coding skills will atrophy. “The AI enthusiasts say, ‘Don’t worry, eventually nobody will need to know anything.’ I don’t subscribe to that.”View image in fullscreenJustine Bateman: ‘It’s one of the worst ideas society has ever come up with’Photograph: NBC/Nathan Congleton/Getty ImagesPart of his job is to write research papers and grant proposals. “I absolutely will not use it for generating any text,” says Royle. “For me, in the process of writing, you formulate your ideas, and by rewriting and editing, it really crystallises what you want to say. Having a machine do that is not what it’s about.”Generative AI, says film-maker and writer Justine Bateman, “is one of the worst ideas society has ever come up with”. She says she despises how it incapacitates us. “They’re trying to convince people they can’t do the things they’ve been doing easily for years – to write emails, to write a presentation. Your daughter wants you to make up a bedtime story about puppies – to write that for you.” We will get to the point, she says with a grim laugh, “that you will essentially become just a skin bag of organs and bones, nothing else. You won’t know anything and you will be told repeatedly that you can’t do it, which is the opposite of what life has to offer. Capitulating all kinds of decisions like where to go on vacation, what to wear today, who to date, what to eat. People are already doing this. You won’t have to process grief, because you’ll have uploaded photos and voice messages from your mother who just died, and then she can talk to you via AI video call every day. One of the ways it’s going to destroy humans, long before there’s a nuclear disaster, is going to be the emotional hollowing-out of people.”We keep moving like zombies towards a world that nobody really wants to live inShe is not interested. “It is the complete opposite direction of where I’m going as a film-maker and author. Generative AI is like a blender – you put in millions of examples of the type of thing you want and it will give you a Frankenstein spoonful of it.” It’s theft, she says, and regurgitation. “Nothing original will come out of it, by the nature of what it is. Anyone who uses generative AI, who thinks they’re an artist, is stopping their creativity.”Some studios, such as the animation company Studio Ghibli, have sworn off using AI, but others appear to be salivating at the prospect. In 2023, Dreamworks founderJeffrey Katzenberg said AI would cut the costs of its animated filmsby 90%. Bateman thinks audiences will tire of AI-created content. “Human beings will react to this in the way they react to junk food,” she says. Deliciously artificial to some, if not nourishing – but many of us will turn off. Last year she set up an organisation, Credo 23, anda film festival, to showcase films made without AI. She likens it to an “organic stamp for films, that tells the audience no AI was used.” People, she says, will “hunger for something raw, real and human”.‘One day I overheard my boss saying: just put it in ChatGPT’: the workers who lost their jobs to AIRead moreIn everyday life, Bateman is trying “to be in a parallel universe, where I’m trying to avoid [AI] as much as possible.” It’s not that she is anti-tech, she stresses. “I have a computer science degree, I love tech. I love salt, too, but I don’t put it on everything.”In fact, everyone I speak to is a technophile in some way. Doty describes herself as “very tech-forward”, but she adds that she values human connection, which AI is threatening. “We keep moving like zombies towards a world that nobody really wants to live in.” Royle codes and runs servers, but also describes himself as a “conscientious AI objector”. Bender specialises in computational linguistics and was named by Time as one of the top 100 people in AI in 2023. “I am a technologist,” she says, “but I believe that technology should be built by communities for their own purposes, rather than by large corporations for theirs.” She also adds, with a laugh: “The Luddites were awesome! I would wear that badge with pride.” Morrison, too, says: “I quite like the Luddites – people standing up to protect the jobs that keep their families and their communities alive.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingWork & careersHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One such manifestation is the Casablanca Finance City (CFC) district, whose high-rise buildings stand as a symbol of the city’s dream of being a main gateway for international investment into Africa.Since the district launched in December 2010, its attractive tax regime has brought in entities from across the globe. There was a slowdown in sign-ups to the hub during the Covid-19 pandemic but it now hosts 240 companies, including Huawei and Schneider Electric, accounting for more than 7,000 jobs.“We welcome companies from multiple sectors … [and] we also support them in their development into the continent,” said Lamia Merzouki, its chief operating officer.Over the past decade, Moroccan investment across Africa has sharply risen: from $100m in 2014 to $2.8bn in 2024. As of March 2025, it was ranked fourth in the Middle East and Africa region and 56th out of 119 overall on the Global Financial Centres Index.Brigitte Labou, the head of customs practice for Francophone Africa at KPMG Avocats, based in Paris, says hubs such as the CFC are “important levers for accelerating the industrialisation of Africa.“The financial hub that the CFC represents, as well as the related tax advantages, are assets that can attract the relocation of production chains to Morocco and Africa,” she added.Representing a key entry point for business into Africa, the CFC is seen by the Moroccan government as a valuable component of theAfrican Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a trade agreement with the promise of a unified African market of 1.4 billion people and a combined GDP of $3.4tn. It was approved by the African Union in 2012 and launched seven years later, but implementation has been slow.But in a time of global tariff wars, African economists are hoping agreements such as AfCFTA can help.In May, as hundreds of African business executives in various shades of suits converged in Abidjan inIvory Coastfor the Africa CEO Forum, intracontinental trade during tariff disruption topped the agenda.The South African president,Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking during an all-presidential panel in Abidjan, proposed more collaboration on the continent as a solution. “We would like the private sector to follow in tandem with the public sector, and to embrace the AfCFTA and also be active participants … [AfCFTA] is going to be the pathfinder”, he told more than 2,800 delegates.Merzouki agrees. “In this context of trade wars, the African free trade area is really a must,” she said after the session. “We need to accelerate the momentum. Regional integration is a must for us, and this is something that we have been nourishing since the beginning.”There is criticism that the CFC’s focus on attracting foreign capital has done little to address deep-seated inequalities within Morocco. Recent trade data for 2024 also shows that the EU – rather than Africa – is still a destination for at least two-thirds of Moroccan exports.In response to this discrepancy, Merzouki said the data “should not overshadow the dynamic cooperation between Morocco and the rest of Africa”.There is also regular criticism of Morocco’s constitutional monarchy system, but supporters say this has projected an image of calm that seems to have benefited Casablanca, compared with other African hubs.“Even if there are lots of different trade wars and economic upheavals and so on, Morocco remains a stable platform,” said Merzouki. “There is political stability, macroeconomic stability. We have a lot of international players that give us this feedback. They want to come to Casablanca because it remains stable.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since Donald Trump resumed his second term as US president, he has upended trade deals and hiked tariffs, including for all of Africa.The new ‘scramble for Africa’: how a UAE sheikh quietly made carbon deals for forests bigger than UKRead moreThe CFC is also cooperating with two dozen African investment promotion agencies, including those of Nigeria and Ivory Coast, seeking new opportunities to increase infrastructural development. It also hosts the Africa50 fund, a vehicle launched in 2015 by theAfrican Development Bank, with initial capital of $700m from 20 member states, to spur infrastructure development across the continent.The district is also pivoting to accommodate its interest in artificial intelligence – having launched an Africa Innovation Lab to support fintechs – and sustainable financing.Currently, Africa generates only 2% of its potential in carbon credits, which are permits countries or companies can exchange to fund initiatives that reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Merzouki, a co-chair of the UN Development Programme’s Financial Centres for Sustainability Network, thinks the continent can become an energy powerhouse with the right conditions: technology transfer, capacity building, financing.Last September, the CFC signed an agreement with another Moroccan institution to launch a voluntary carbon market for private entities as part of a push to start a carbon-efficient ecosystem.Still, there are limits to African financial hubs such as the CFC: doing business is notoriously difficult in many African countries and red tape and archaic policies continue to stymie the flow of cash and workers across borders.Bright Simons, the vice-president of the Imani Centre for Policy and Education in Accra, Ghana, says the hubs are merely short-term solutions that cloud the big picture.“The unique selling point for the hubs is to try and concentrate resources in a manner that tries to circumvent some of those [logistical and infrastructural] barriers,” he said. “African governments, rather than go the long route of trying to actually fix these problems, are trying to look for shortcuts, and perhaps hubs have become the cleverest but most visible way.”Explore more on these topicsMoroccoMiddle East and north AfricaAfricaInternational tradeGlobal economyTrump tariffsIvory CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Knicks’ last title came in 1973. “This pursuit led us to the difficult decision to inform Tom Thibodeau that we’ve decided to move in another direction.“We can’t thank Tom enough for pouring his heart and soul into each and every day of being theNew York Knickshead coach. He led us not only with class and professionalism for the past five seasons, but also to tremendous success on the court with four playoff berths and four playoff series victories. Ultimately, we made the decision we feel is best for our organization moving forward. Tom will always be a part of our Knicks family and we truly wish him nothing but the best in the future.”The Knicks beat the defending champions, the Boston Celtics, during their run to the Conference finals but fell short of theNBAfinals after a 4-2 series loss to the Indiana Pacers. Thibodeau’s in-game decisions were questioned by some during the series, but the conference finals run was the team’s first since 2000.The New York Knicks’ season is over, but a divisive inquest has only just begunRead moreThe 67-year-old had previously been head coach of the Chicago Bulls and Minnesota Timberwolves. He had been Knicks coach since 2020, and had led them to the postseason in four of his five seasons in New York.Many may see it as a strange decision by the Knicks, who had been one of the league’s worst franchises for most of the 2000s until Thibodeau was hired. He promptly led the Knicks to the playoffs in his first season, winning his second NBA Coach of the Year award, and they have been a solid contender in the East in recent seasons.After they were eliminated on Saturday, captain Jalen Brunson expressed his support for Thibodeau, bristling at a question about whether he believed the coach was right for the team.“Is that a real question right now?” Brunson said. “You just asked me if I believe that he’s the right guy. Yes. Come on.”Three days later, Thibodeau was gone with a 226-174 record in New York. He has the fourth-most wins by a Knicks coach.Thibodeau faced criticisms that his hard-driving style and overreliance on his starters wore down his players, the same ones that have followed him since the beginning of his head coaching career in Chicago. But his ways seemed to be working in New York.The Knicks hadn’t won a playoff series since 2013 but now have done so in three straight seasons. They went 50-32 in 2023-24 and followed that with a 51-31 record this season.Explore more on these topicsNew York KnicksNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The match, however, included a moment of jeopardy after he kicked a ball towards the back fence. It rebounded against the shoulder of an unflinching line judge. Musetti received a code violation warning for unsportsmanlike conduct.Swiatek sweeps past Svitolina to set up Sabalenka showdown at French OpenRead more“Honestly it was really unlucky coincidence,” said Musetti. “I was a little bit, honestly, scared, because I really didn’t want to harm nobody, of course. So I immediately went to the line umpire, and I of course said sorry. I apologise to everyone. It was right to have a warning, but I think the umpire saw that there was no intention about that, and that’s why he probably just let me continue my game.”Afterwards, Tiafoe described the ruling as “comical” and suggested that there are inconsistencies within the rules. There have been numerous examples of players being defaulted over the years for unintentionally hitting people with a tennis ball. Two years ago in Paris, the Japanese player Miyu Kato was disqualified from the women’s doubles tournament, along with her partner Aldila Sutjiadi, after unintentionally hitting a ballgirl.“Obviously he did that and nothing happened,” said Tiafoe. “I think that’s comical, but it is what it is. Nothing happened, so there’s nothing really to talk about. Obviously it’s not consistent, so it is what it is.”On the court, Musetti continues to enjoy a breakout run this year. After a career best 2024 season in which he reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon and won a singles bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, the 23-year-old Italian has taken another massive leap forward during this clay court season. He followed up his first Masters 1000 final in Monte Carlo by reaching the semi-finals in the Madrid Open, Italian Open and now at the French Open. He is just the fifth player since the ATP was formed in 1990 to reach the semi-finals or better at all three clay Masters 1000 events and the French Open in one year.Having accrued so many points in recent weeks, Musetti will rise from No 16 at the beginning of the clay court season to at least No 7 in the ATP rankings and he sits at No 5 in the live rankings. He could leapfrog Jack Draper to No 4 in the live rankings with a win.Musetti will rekindle his rivalry withCarlos Alcaraz, the defending champion, in the semi-finals after the Spaniard found his best level at last during his 6-0, 6-1, 6-4 demolition of Tommy Paul. Alcaraz has now reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros for the last three years.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz enjoyed a comfortable win over Tommy Paul.Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty ImagesAlcaraz had endured a complicated path to the quarter-finals, dropping a set in three of his four matches as his patience occasionally waned. Considering his wavering level, a quarter-final meeting with Paul was potentially dangerous. Paul is one of the best athletes on tour, behind Alcaraz himself, and he has made life hell for the Spaniard in the past with his own ability to seamlessly straddle defence and attack, as Alcaraz can.But Alcaraz appeared to have the ball on a string in the early stages of the match. He tore through the first set with a demonstration of spectacular, varied shotmaking and kept on going: “I could close my eyes and everything went in,” said Alcaraz. “My feelings today were unbelievable. I was starting to give every shot at my 100%.”While Alcaraz performed at an incredible level throughout, Paul understandably looked weary from early on. The American had been struggling with an abdominal issue from early in the tournament but he came through consecutive five set matches in the second and third rounds en route to the quarter-finals. Even in perfect health, however, he may not have had any response against a special, singular talent in full flow.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenTennisCarlos AlcaraznewsShareReuse this content"

He was the only one carrying his own bag.Homa didn’t have a caddie and didn’t feel like talking about it, regardless of how much attention it was getting on social media.Charlie Woods, son of Tiger, fires 66 to clinch first career AJGA titleRead moreHe and his caddie of two months, Bill Harke, are no longer together, according to a person informed of the split who said only that Harke “lost his job.” Homa himself didn’t offer much insight.“I’m much rather talk about the golf instead of all the questions about the caddie,” Homa said. “I’m good. Just hoofed it 36.”As for the golf?“It’s going to probably be heartbreaking, but it’s all right,” Homa said. “I haven’t carried my bag 36 holes in a while so I’m a little tired.”He ended up carrying it for 38 holes. Homa’s three-putt for par on his 36th hole at Kinsale put him in a five-man playoff for the final spot to get to theUS Open. Cameron Young won it with a 12ft birdie. Homa then lost a playoff for an alternate spot on the next hole.When asked about his approach to golf, Homa dropped one clue about the split with his caddie.“It seems to be better than when someone is standing next to me for some reason,” he said. “I might need to walk by myself more. Maybe I just looked at it as a nice, peaceful walk. Probably got to battle some demons and have no one to lean on. Maybe that helps a little bit. There’s no one ... everything is me. The battle helped that a little bit.”The qualifier at Kinsale offered six spots to the US Open at Oakmont next week. Homa was around the bubble most of the day. He left a chip in the rough on his ninth hole of the second round and made double bogey, followed that with a bogey and then responded with two straight birdies.He looked to be safe with a second shot into 25ft on the par-5 ninth hole, his last one. But he three-putted for par to finish at five-under.Homa didn’t imagine being in this position a year ago when he was No 10 in the world. But he has changed equipment and changed coaches. He split with his caddie of six years just before the Masters. And then he had no caddie at all. His highest ranking was No 5;he is now 90th.Homa said he had not felt tired on Monday because he was around the cutoff line all day, pushing himself forward. After he three-putted his final hole was when fatigue started to hit him. He said not having anyone to consult over a shot led him to be a little more conservative, not a bad tactic on a course he doesn’t know all too well.Asked one last time about the caddie situation, Homa whispered, “I wanted to carry for 36 holes. Everyone is going to ask me that.”Homa is not entirely out of the US Open. He is playing the Canadian Open this week, though he likely would have to win to get into the top 60 and qualify.Explore more on these topicsGolfUS OpenPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Athletes will not be drug-tested and may follow personalized pharmaceutical regimens, provided they disclose their use to organizers.World Aquatics said anyone who “supports, endorses, or participates in sporting events that embrace the use of scientific advancements or other practices that may include prohibited substances and/or prohibited methods” will be ineligible for the organization’s events. This includes athletes, coaches, administrators, and medical personnel.Pro-doping Enhanced Games to debut in Las Vegas with Trump Jr backingRead more“Those who enable doped sport are not welcome at World Aquatics or our events,” said Husain al-Musallam, the organization’s president.The Enhanced Games, slated for 21–24 May 2026 in Las Vegas, will feature sprinting, swimming and weightlifting. Organizers have promised prize money of up to $500,000 per event, including $1m bonuses for breaking world records in the 100m sprint or 50m freestyle. Australian swimmer and three-time Olympic medalist James Magnussen is among a small group of athletes who have publicly signed on.The event’s founder, Australian entrepreneur Aron D’Souza, has pitched the Games as a revolutionary platform embracing what he calls “superhumanity”, a future where pharmaceutical and technological enhancement is normalized. Athletes may compete naturally, follow enhancement protocols, or participate in clinical trials using FDA-designated “Investigational Medicinal Products”.“We are creating a new category of human excellence,” promotional materials say. “A world where performance-enhancing drugs are used safely, openly, and under medical supervision.”D’Souza has called anti-doping policy “outdated and hypocritical”, claiming the Enhanced Games offers a safer, more transparent alternative.The plan has drawn sharp criticism from anti-doping bodies and sports federations. “It’s a dangerous clown show, not real sport,” said Travis Tygart, head of the US Anti-Doping Agency. The World Anti-Doping Agency warned the project “jeopardizes athletes’ health and well-being” by promoting “the abuse of powerful substances and methods that should only be prescribed, if at all, for specific therapeutic needs”.Athletes are expected to undergo medical screening and be monitored by independent health and ethics boards. But enforcement appears largely voluntary, a feature organizers describe as part of their “partnership-first” model.In February, Greek-Bulgarian swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev reportedly swam faster than the world record in the 50m freestyle while on an enhancement protocol. Though organizers touted the result, it came with caveats: Gkolomeev wore a full-body polyurethane suit not approved by World Aquatics, and the swim is not recognized as official.Financial backing for the Games includes support from figures aligned with former U.S. president Donald Trump. A recent investment round was led by 1789 Capital, a firm co-founded byDonald Trump Jr. Other backers include Peter Thiel’s Apeiron Investment Group and the hedge fund Karatage.D’Souza has welcomed the association with Trump-linked donors, calling it “more important than any investment” to have political and cultural backing from prominent American conservatives.World Aquatics’ announcement comes amid efforts to clamp down on the Enhanced Games before they gain further traction. No major broadcasters or sponsors have been confirmed, and the pool of committed athletes remains small. Still, organizers say they are pressing forward with plans for a year-round training base and a broader business venture selling personalized enhancement programs to consumers.While the Enhanced Games bills itself as a parallel to the Olympics, critics say it risks undermining global sport entirely.“The greater risk,” reads an internal Enhanced FAQ, “is pretending those risks don’t exist.”Whether the public embraces or rejects that philosophy may determine if the Enhanced Games are a one-off experiment or a disruptive force in the future of elite competition.Explore more on these topicsSwimmingDrugs in sportDonald Trump JrPeter ThielAustralia sportUS sportsShareReuse this content"

We are more patient and expert than the average driver. This city has gotten worse in recent years – now it takes 30 minutes to go two kilometres.”Fellow tax driver, Alessandro, referred to Wolff’s comments as “a banal cliche”.“We are the ones who are first in not having accidents, otherwise we would lose our working day,” he said. “I would like to seeFormula Onedrivers manoeuvring around construction sites, scooters and golf carts the way we do.

Stanway was withdrawn at half-time but Wiegman clarified that the 26-year-old had not suffered a setback, saying: On Stanway: “No [she does not have an injury], she’s in a very good place.“But she hasn’t played for such a long time – Friday’s were her first minutes after she’d been training, of course. She could play [only for] 45 minutes.

As I’ve always said, I would be willing to do it if United thought it was best to move on.“I spoke with Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it. I spoke to the club, who said they weren’t willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave. From my side, it was a very ambitious proposal, the president was a fantastic person. I never talked about the money, it ended up coming up later, with my agent.“I had to make the decision as a family and understand what I wanted for my future. That was the question my wife asked, what my professional goals would be. At no point did she say yes or no, she always supported me and put my professional side first. It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Rúben Neves, João Cancelo. My children are used to playing with theirs.“But I simply want to stay at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, because I still feel capable of that.

Wilkinson endured the largest defeat of her 15-month reign as Italy scored four times in the first half of a Nations League finale in Swansea – the Wales manager calling it a “little bit of capitulation”.First-half goals from Cristiana Girelli, who struck twice with excellent headers, Elena Linari and Sofia Cantore punished poor Wales defending and secured Italy second place in the group. Jess Fishlock produced some late cheer with a stunning consolation, eight minutes from time, scoring off the underside of the crossbar from 35 yards for her 47th Wales goal.Clàudia Pina’s double for Spain means England miss out on Nations League finalsRead more“The first half felt like a punch in the face,” Wilkinson said after Wales’ final fixture before their opener against the Netherlands in Lucerne on 5 July. “Let’s be clear, that was not a performance that I expect from this team.“Obviously this is a painful lesson and this is the first time that we’ve really been exposed. There’s no psychological damage, there really isn’t. This team punished us for every mistake, and that’s something that we talk about as a team.”There was more bad news for Wales as the goalkeeper Olivia Clark, already sporting a black eye suffered in the Denmark game, was forced off before half-time with a head injury. Clark had required treatment for a head injury 15 minutes earlier after being caught by her own defender Hayley Ladd, but continued before conceding a third goal. Wilkinson said: “Two head hits in a week is not good, so we decided to pull her. We weren’t messing with this and took her out, but I’m not concerned there’s any lasting damage.”TheScotlandmanager, Melissa Andreatta, thought her side were unlucky not to win after they picked up their first point in the Nations League with a 1-1 draw away to theNetherlands. Already-relegated Scotland fell behind when midfielder Jill Roord put the hosts in front – and they were in position for a sixth defeat from a possible six – but Andreatta’s side got themselves on level terms courtesy of Kathleen McGovern’s 27th-minute equaliser. Scotland were not happy with just the point and pushed for a winning goal after the break, but Netherlands had goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar to thank for their point after she made a string of saves in the second period.View image in fullscreenScotland goalscorer Kathleen McGovern and Caitlin Dijkstra contest a header.Photograph: Marcel van Dorst/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockAndreatta was happy with her side’s performance, telling BBC Scotland: “With that performance. We earned that result. Especially when you think about the last 24 hours that we had, I think that showed what this team is about. That was established long before me but they put in a great performance tonight. I was really pleased. I think we did start well then the Netherlands started to dominate. We did a tactical change, got a foothold back in the game and we were unlucky to concede that chance but I think we dominated the second half and were unlucky not to win.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reaching thePremier Leagueis the ultimate ambition for clubs in the second tier, but staying there is becoming increasingly difficult. The gap between the top flight and Championship is widening with each passing season. When the three promoted clubs – Luton, Burnley and Sheffield United – went straight back down last year it seemed like a quirk, something that had only happened once before in the history of English football, in the 1997-98 season. But now it feels like a trend.Southampton, Leicester and Ipswich have gone down without putting up much of a fight; they picked up just 59 points between them, down on the already paltry total of 66 points that Luton, Burnley and Sheffield United won the season before as they slipped back to theChampionship. To put that in some context, the promoted teams won 100 points a decade ago and 151 two decades ago. The “battle” to avoid relegation this season was settled with four games to play – the earliest in Premier League history – and the best of the promoted teams, Leicester, finished 13 points adrift of the team in 17th, the biggest gap between relegation and safety in the history of the league.The challenge for Leeds, Burnley andSunderlandis a big one – and the stakes are high. Luton, relegated from the top flight just a year ago, are now preparing to play in League One. The message is clear: the Premier League is only the promised land if you stay there. So how do the three teams coming up avoid suffering the same fate?Southampton were doomed from the beginning as Russell Martin refused to budge on his principles. The manager had guided Saints to the Premier League by playing dominant, attacking football. They secured promotion while having more possession (65.6%) than any other team in the Championship. However, the Premier League is a whole different level. When you’re conceding goal after goal by trying to pass the ball out from the back, it’s worth admitting that pragmatism, not idealism, is what keeps teams afloat.View image in fullscreenSouthampton fans give their view on Russell Martin.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersMartin’s refusal to adapt his tactics ended in tears. His record in the Premier League was awful: one win and 13 defeats in his 16 games in charge, with the team conceding 36 goals and scoring just 11. The decision to pull the trigger on Martin came too late to give them a real chance of consolidating a Premier League spot.By appointing Ivan Juric, a manager whose approach is the polar opposite of Martin’s, the club was essentially admitting defeat in their bid to outplay opponents. But changing a team’s whole style midway through the campaign is easier said than done. Juric took over a side that had been coached to play a completely different way for the previous 18 months, and it showed. The former Roma manager (who had been sacked by them after just 12 games earlier in the season) picked up 0.29 points per game at Southampton, one of the worst records in Premier League history.By contrast, Leicester chose to sack Steve Cooper far earlier than many expected. Cooper wasn’t a popular appointment in the first place given his Nottingham Forest roots, but he was sacked with the club in 16th and having claimed commendable results against Tottenham, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth. They brought in Ruud van Nistelrooy, quickly dropped into the relegation zone and went on to set a new record English football for losing eight home games in a row without scoring a goal. The grass isn’t always greener.Premier League 2024-25 season review: our predictions versus realityRead moreTiming, then, is vital if clubs are looking to change their manager. Getting it wrong can prove costly. The same can be said of recruitment. The Premier League is a far more physically and technically demanding league than the Championship. The temptation can be to assemble a bigger squad to cope with the demands of playing tougher opponents but the signings need to be of the right profile.Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester all suffered due to a lack of experience in their squads, especially in defence. Indeed, Southampton’s biggest signing last summer was the centre-back Taylor Harwood-Bellis. He may have a great future ahead of him but, at 22 years of age with no Premier League experience, he wasn’t the experienced head they needed in their backline.Ipswich invested in centre-backs Jacob Greaves and Dara O’Shea, two standout performers in the Championship, but they did not have the calibre to keep the club afloat in the top flight. Factor in the questionable decision to sign Arijanet Muric, a goalkeeper whose limitations had been exposed the previous campaign atBurnley, and it was always going to be an uphill struggle. If you are going to revamp the most important part of your team – the centre of your defence – find experienced players who can cope at Premier League level.View image in fullscreenIpswich goalkeeper Arijanet Muric concedes against Southampton.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersLeicester also failed to sort out their defence before the season. They only signed two defenders this season. Caleb Okoli was restricted to just 12 league starts due to injury, which was unfortunate, but their other signing, Woyo Coulibaly, did not arrive at the club until January. They needed to act decisively last summer. The promoted clubs have smaller budgets but it’s no wonder they conceded so many goals – 248 between them.So here are three key pieces of advice for Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland: their managers need to adapt their principles to beat the drop; the clubs should make early and realistic decisions about sacking their managers; and they have to ensure that they recruit to a Premier League standard, focusing on quality over quantity.Daniel Farke and Scott Parker should have learned a lot from their previous experiences in the top flight but Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland need to get their acts together quickly if we are to avoid seeing the three promoted sides succumb to relegation for the third year running.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsFootballGuardian Sport NetworkPremier LeagueSouthamptonLeicester CityIpswich TownLeeds UnitedSunderlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Within a week of her death her family had submitted a written complaint to Sheffield United outlining issues allegedly stemming from her relationship with the club’s manager at the time, Jonathan Morgan.Dean Armstrong KC, representing the family, told a pre-inquest review hearing on Tuesday that this was a case that should be heard by a jury. He said there was a “clear” public interest in examining the particular position of “young, vulnerable people” and their relationship with those holding senior positions in a sporting context.“There continue to be significant differences between the men’s game and the women’s game in terms of resource and how people are dealt with,” he said. “There is a significant public interest in examining how people conduct themselves within the women’s game towards what we say are vulnerable females such as Maddy.”Jury inquests are often required when a death occurs in protective custody, and Armstrong said: “I would draw the analogy of young, vulnerable women in football clubs in a climate of concern and fear. This is one of the first occasions in professional women’s football where these issues are being addressed. I would suggest there is a fundamental need to examine what was in place to protect those vulnerable women, where the impact felt of words and deeds is potentially much greater.”Cusack’s legal team also referenced findings from an as yet unpublished Football Associationreport commissioned in January 2024into the circumstances surrounding Cusack’s death. They said the report found the investigation had “shed light on the resourcing issues particularly acute in the women’s game and the related welfare and safeguarding issues that might arise”.Armstrong said: “[The] inability to report to the club contributed to Maddy’s deterioration. “There was no one to talk to, no adequate support system in place. That should be at the centre of these proceedings.”The Cusack family’s lawyers also made a request for a number of additional witnesses to be called to appear at the inquest. Maria Mulla, from Maitland Chambers, said witnesses who had provided testimony in earlier investigations concerning Morgan’s alleged conduct towards Cusack and other players were all “highly relevant” and “would enable the family to feel these matters are being explored fully, as they need to be”.Morgan, who continues to represent himself in the case, said there had been “a lot of manipulation of information” and said some individuals had not been spoken to or had been “cast aside” because their views “didn’t meet the narrative of what’s been put out over the last 18 months”.Coroner Sophie Cartwright called for Sheffield United, the FA and Morgan to provide written submissions in response to calls from the family’s representatives for a jury, a widening of the inquest scope and for additional witnesses by 17 June. The family’s representatives will then have a further seven days to make observations on those submissions, with the coroner saying she would make a determination on those matters by 1 July.No date has been set for the inquest itself.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Chelsea have been exploring the conditions of a deal and are believed to be preparing an opening bid. Enzo Maresca, the club’s head coach, is a big fan of Maignan and believes his distribution will suit his side’s style.Signing a player of Maignan’s experience would represent a notable diversion from Chelsea’s policy of targeting the best young players in the world. But there is a sense they would be foolish not to look into buying a player of the his class. Maignan, who turns 30 next month, would be the oldest player in Chelsea’s squad.Manchester United to pursue Bryan Mbeumo and get Bruno Fernandes boostRead moreIt is anticipated that his arrival would prompt Chelsea to sell at least one of their goalkeepers. They are open to offers for Robert Sánchez, who was Enzo Maresca’s No 1 last season, and Djordje Petrovic after the Serbian’s loan at Strasbourg.

Kepa Arrizabalaga, who spent last season on loan at Bournemouth, is still on Chelsea’s books and is expected to move on again.Chelsea have also made an inquiry for the Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford.

Chelsea think Sancho is talented and have been impressed with his attitude but fear he is not consistent enough. They could not strike an agreement for the former Dortmund to sign on a lower salary in line with the club’s wage policy.Returning to United leaves Sancho, who has a year on his contract, in an awkward position. He cut an unhappy figure after moving to Old Trafford four years ago and joined Dortmund on loan after clashing with Erik ten Hag. Sancho had joined Chelsea by the time United fired Ten Hag and hired Ruben Amorim last November. It remains to be seen whether Amorim would want to look at Sancho in pre-season.

With a barrage of boundaries from Jamie Smith and Ben Duckett the home side took control of a match that was delayed after the players got stuck in traffic, and then abbreviated by rain, before with an explosive cameo from Jos Buttler they sped to victory by seven wickets, with 62 balls to spare.The series thus ended as it started, with a one-sided victory. The match in between was much more competitive but this was a very different display from England, whose fielding was as sharp as it had been sloppy on Sunday, and in particular from their openers who in Cardiff had scored a combined total of nothing but here each reached rapid half-centuries.England cricketers forced into emergency travel plans before third West Indies ODIRead moreSmith might have travelled in by train, but as soon as he had a bat in his hand he was motoring, hammering 64 runs off just 28 balls, 46% of which went for boundaries. The first of them, it is true, came off the inside edge, but from there his bat seemed to be made entirely of middle. England rushed to 50 off just 28 legal deliveries – at this point Smith was on 41 and Duckett on three – and by the end of an abbreviated, eight‑over powerplay they had already scored 100.Harry Brook of Smith: “He’s gone out and played extremely well, but he’s not a slogger, is he? He’s playing proper shots, and he’s putting them under immense pressure. We want batters that can put their best bowlers under pressure, manipulate the field, and score big runs. He did that today.”There was just a little bit of luck along the way, and Smith was dropped at midwicket by Jayden Greaves off the first ball of Gudakesh Motie’s opening over, Motie having himself dropped Duckett moments earlier. The bowler gained revenge by dismissing Smith with the final ball of the same over, though the four in between had disappeared for 20.By this point England, having come in needing 6.15 an over, had whittled the required run rate down to something only marginally less pedestrian than some players’ journeys to the ground, and when Duckett ended an excellent over from Roston Chase by spearing to cover having by then scored a 46‑ball 58 they were most of the way there. Brook was also dropped in what, but for the efforts of a couple of batters, was a dismal West Indies performance, before Buttler’s firecracker 41 – 32 of those from boundaries – took England over the line.View image in fullscreenSherfane Rutherford hit an explosive 70 for West Indies.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockGiven their late arrival at the ground it was perhaps understandable that some of West Indies’ batters looked underprepared as the game got under way, and both Shai Hope and Chase lasted only one ball – the latter falling to his first delivery for the second time in three days.They were not helped by England’s excellence in the field, and this time the only catch that did not stick was by Brydon Carse, sprinting to his left on the square‑leg boundary, though even if he had somehow clung on to Sherfane Rutherford’s mighty blow his momentum would have carried him beyond the rope.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Coming in with the West Indies innings almost as troubled as their journey to the ground, he took only two balls to get his eye in, before hitting his next two for four to slide smoothly into gear.The 26-year-old ended with 70 off 71, very slightly reducing his average in a format in which he has scored six fifties and a century in just 11 innings to 70.87. “He’s like a video game player,” Hope said. “He’s been scoring runs for fun.”With Motie contributing 63 off 54 and Alzarri Joseph adding a handy 41, West Indies recovered from 28 for three and 154 for seven to post 251, adjusted under the DLS method to leave England with a target of 246 and 40 overs to do it. It felt just about defendable, until England’s openers got to work.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

It is planned to hold 22,000 spectators.The 62-acre vacant plot of land that will be used to construct “The 78” is a former landfill and railyard along the banks of the Chicago river that has sat vacant and in development limbo for decades. The site is set to be developed by Related Midwest, which acquired the land in 2016. The Chicago White Sox of MLB have also sought to build a new stadium there, even constructing a temporary field at the site. The MLB team and Related Midwest have sought more than $1bn in public financing for the baseball stadium project.View image in fullscreenThe future site of “The 78,” and a new Chicago Fire stadiumPhotograph: Related Midwest & Black Creative“This project is more than just a stadium,” Mansueto said in a statement released by the team. “It’s a space for fans of all ages, backgrounds and neighborhoods to come together and celebrate the beautiful game – right in the heart of our city. It’s about investing in Chicago, not just on match days, but every day as a committed community partner.”The Fire have played at a number of venues since their founding in 1998 as one of MLS’s first expansion clubs. The team began their life at Soldier Field, home of the NFL’s Chicago Bears, where they built a considerable home-field advantage and enjoyed some of the most vocal support inMLSat the time. Extensive renovations to Soldier Field forced the team to decamp to suburban Naperville, Illinois in 2002, before the club built its own home venue, SeatGeek Stadium, which opened in suburban Bridgeview in 2006. The stadium’s location and the team’s own struggles led to a decline in fan interest in the club, causing Mansueto to move the Fire back to Soldier Field after purchasing sole ownership of the team in 2019.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not if this lot have anything to do with itEmine SanerTue 3 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareThe novelist Ewan Morrison was alarmed, though amused, to discover he had written a book called Nine Inches Pleases a Lady. Intrigued by the limits of generative artificial intelligence (AI), he had askedChatGPTto give him the names of the 12 novels he had written. “I’ve only written nine,” he says. “Always eager to please, it decided to invent three.” The “nine inches” from the fake title it hallucinated was stolen from a filthyRobert Burns poem. “I just distrust these systems when it comes to truth,” says Morrison. He is yet to write Nine Inches – “or its sequel, Eighteen Inches”, he laughs. His actual latest book,For Emma, imagining AI brain-implant chips, is about the human costs of technology.Morrison keeps an eye on the machines, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and their capabilities, but he refuses to use them in his own life and work. He is one of a growing number of people who are actively resisting: people who are terrified of the power of generative AI and its potential for harm and don’t want to feed the beast; those who have just decided that it’s a bit rubbish, and more trouble than it’s worth; and those who simply prefer humans to robots.Go online, and it’s easy to find AI proponents who dismiss refuseniks as ignorant luddites – or worse, smug hipsters. I possibly fall into both camps, given that I have decidedly Amish interests (board games, gardening,animal husbandry) and write for the Guardian. Friends swear by ChatGPT for parenting advice, and I know someone who uses it all day for work in her consultancy business, but I haven’t used it since playing around after it launched in 2022. Admittedly ChatGPT might have done a better job, but this piece was handcrafted using organic words from my artisanal writing studio. (OK, I meanbed.) I could have assumed my interviewees’ thoughts from plundering their social media posts and research papers, as ChatGPT would have done, but it was far more enjoyable to pick up the phone and talk, human to human. Two of my interviewees were interrupted by their pets, and each made me laugh in some way (full disclosure: AI then transcribed the noise).View image in fullscreenEwan Morrison: ‘It’s a product of venture capital gone nuts’Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty ImagesOn X, where Morrison sometimes clashes with AI enthusiasts, a common insult is“decel”(decelerationist), but it makes him laugh when people think he’s the one who isn’t keeping up. “There’s nothing [that stops] accelerationism more than failure to deliver on what you promised. Hitting a brick wall is a good way to decelerate,” he says. Onerecent studyfound that AI answered more than 60% of queries inaccurately.Morrison was drawn into the argument by what he would now call “alarmist fears about the potential for superintelligence and runaway AI. The more I’ve got into it, the more I realise that’s a fiction that’s been dangled before the investors of the world, so they’ll invest billions – in fact,half a trillion– into this quest for artificial superintelligence. It’s a fantasy, a product of venture capital gone nuts.”There are also copyright violations – generative AI is trained on existing material – that threaten him as a writer, and his wife, screenwriter Emily Ballou. In the entertainment industry, he says, people are using “AI algorithms to determine what projects get the go-ahead, and that means we’re stuck remaking the past. The algorithms say ‘More of the same’, because it’s all they can do.”I read because I want to understand how somebody sees the world. There’s no ‘somebody’ in the synthetic text-extruding machinesMorrison says he has a long list of complaints. “They’ve been stacking up over the past few years.” He is concerned about the job losses (Bill Gates recently predicted AI would lead to a two-day work week). Then there are “tech addiction, the ecological impact, the damage to the education system –92% of studentsare now using AI”. He worries about the way tech companies spy on us to make AI personalised, and is horrified at AI-enabled weapons being used in Ukraine. “I find that ethically revolting.”Others cite similar reasons for not using AI. April Doty, an audiobook narrator, is appalled at the environmental cost – the computational power required to perform an AI search and answer is huge. “I’m infuriated that you can’t turn off the AI overviews in Google search,” she says. “Whenever you look anything up now you’re basically torching the planet.” She has started to use other search engines. “But, more and more, we’re surrounded by it, and there’s no off switch. That makes me angry.” Where she still can, she says, “I’m opting out of using AI.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Kaan Illustration/The GuardianIn her own field, she is concerned about the number of books that are being “read” by machines. Audible, the Amazon-owned audiobook provider, has just announced it will allow publishersto create audiobooksusing its AI technology. “I don’t know anybody who wants a robot to read them a story, but I am concerned that it is going to ruin the experience to the point where people don’t want to subscribe to audiobook platforms any more,” says Doty. She hasn’t lost jobs to AI yet but other colleagues have, and chances are, it will happen. AI models can’t “narrate”, she says. “Narrators don’t just read words; they sense and express the feelings beneath the words. AI can never do this job because it requires decades of experience in being a human being.”Emily M Bender, professor of linguistics at the University of Washington and co-author of a new book,The AI Con, has many reasons why she doesn’t want to use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. “But maybe the first one is that I’m not interested in reading something that nobody wrote,” she says. “I read because I want to understand how somebody sees something, and there’s no ‘somebody’ inside the synthetic text-extruding machines.” It’s just a collage made from lots of different people’s words, she says.Does she feel she is being “left behind”, as AI enthusiasts would say? “No, not at all. My reaction to that is, ‘Where’s everybody going?’” She laughs as if to say: nowhere good.“When we turn to synthetic media rather than authentic media, we are losing out on human connection,” says Bender. “That’s both at a personal level – what we get out of connecting to other people – and in terms of strength of community.” She cites Chris Gilliard, the surveillance and privacy researcher. “He made the very important point that you can see this as a technological move by the companies to isolate us from each other, and to set things up so that all of our interactions are mediated through their products. We don’t need that, for us or our communities.”Despite Bender’s well-publicised position – she has long been a high-profile critic of LLMs – incredibly, she has seen students turn in AI-generated work. “That’s very sad.” She doesn’t want to be policing, or even blaming, students. “My job is to make sure students understand why it is that turning to a large language model is depriving themselves of a learning opportunity, in terms of what they would get out of doing the work.”Does she think people should boycott generative AI? “Boycott suggests organised political action, and sure, why not?” she says. “I also think that people are individually better off if they don’t use them.”I almost feel I have no choice but to use AI at this point. I might have to put morals asideSome people have so far held out, but are reluctantly realising they may end up using it. Tom, who works in IT for the government, doesn’t use AI in his tech work, but found colleagues were using it in other ways. Promotion is partly decided on annual appraisals they have to write, and he had asked a manager whose appraisal had impressed him how he’d done it, thinking he’d spent days on it. “He said, ‘I just spent 10 minutes – I used ChatGPT,’” Tom recalls. “He suggested I should do the same, which I don’t agree with. I made that point, and he said, ‘Well, you’re probably not going to get anywhere unless you do.’” Using AI would feel like cheating, but Tom worries refusing to do so now puts him at a disadvantage. “I almost feel like I have no choicebutto use it at this point. I might have to put morals aside.”Others, despite their misgivings, limit how they use it, and only for specific tasks. Steve Royle, professor of cell biology at the University of Warwick, uses ChatGPT for the “grunt work” of writing computer code to analyse data. “But that’s really the limit. I don’t want it to generate code from scratch. When you let it do that, you spend way more time debugging it afterwards. My view is, it’s a waste of time if you let it try and do too much for you.” Accurate or not, he also worries that if he becomes too reliant on AI, his coding skills will atrophy. “The AI enthusiasts say, ‘Don’t worry, eventually nobody will need to know anything.’ I don’t subscribe to that.”View image in fullscreenJustine Bateman: ‘It’s one of the worst ideas society has ever come up with’Photograph: NBC/Nathan Congleton/Getty ImagesPart of his job is to write research papers and grant proposals. “I absolutely will not use it for generating any text,” says Royle. “For me, in the process of writing, you formulate your ideas, and by rewriting and editing, it really crystallises what you want to say. Having a machine do that is not what it’s about.”Generative AI, says film-maker and writer Justine Bateman, “is one of the worst ideas society has ever come up with”. She says she despises how it incapacitates us. “They’re trying to convince people they can’t do the things they’ve been doing easily for years – to write emails, to write a presentation. Your daughter wants you to make up a bedtime story about puppies – to write that for you.” We will get to the point, she says with a grim laugh, “that you will essentially become just a skin bag of organs and bones, nothing else. You won’t know anything and you will be told repeatedly that you can’t do it, which is the opposite of what life has to offer. Capitulating all kinds of decisions like where to go on vacation, what to wear today, who to date, what to eat. People are already doing this. You won’t have to process grief, because you’ll have uploaded photos and voice messages from your mother who just died, and then she can talk to you via AI video call every day. One of the ways it’s going to destroy humans, long before there’s a nuclear disaster, is going to be the emotional hollowing-out of people.”We keep moving like zombies towards a world that nobody really wants to live inShe is not interested. “It is the complete opposite direction of where I’m going as a film-maker and author. Generative AI is like a blender – you put in millions of examples of the type of thing you want and it will give you a Frankenstein spoonful of it.” It’s theft, she says, and regurgitation. “Nothing original will come out of it, by the nature of what it is. Anyone who uses generative AI, who thinks they’re an artist, is stopping their creativity.”Some studios, such as the animation company Studio Ghibli, have sworn off using AI, but others appear to be salivating at the prospect. In 2023, Dreamworks founderJeffrey Katzenberg said AI would cut the costs of its animated filmsby 90%. Bateman thinks audiences will tire of AI-created content. “Human beings will react to this in the way they react to junk food,” she says. Deliciously artificial to some, if not nourishing – but many of us will turn off. Last year she set up an organisation, Credo 23, anda film festival, to showcase films made without AI.

I love salt, too, but I don’t put it on everything.”In fact, everyone I speak to is a technophile in some way. Doty describes herself as “very tech-forward”, but she adds that she values human connection, which AI is threatening. “We keep moving like zombies towards a world that nobody really wants to live in.” Royle codes and runs servers, but also describes himself as a “conscientious AI objector”. Bender specialises in computational linguistics and was named by Time as one of the top 100 people in AI in 2023. “I am a technologist,” she says, “but I believe that technology should be built by communities for their own purposes, rather than by large corporations for theirs.” She also adds, with a laugh: “The Luddites were awesome! I would wear that badge with pride.” Morrison, too, says: “I quite like the Luddites – people standing up to protect the jobs that keep their families and their communities alive.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingWork & careersHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The devices had a street value of about £20m, and iPhones made up the majority.In evidence to the House of Commons science and technology committee on Tuesday, theMetropolitan policesaid they wanted smartphone companies to start preventing stolen devices from accessing their cloud services so that they were no longer “smart”, therefore dramatically reducing their resale value.But so far they have not agreed, despite calls to do so since 2023, said Darren Scates, the Met’s chief digital data and technology officer.Martin Wrigley, a Liberal Democrat member of the committee, said: “Apple and Google continue to make profit and continue to sell more phones because these phones are not removed from the system. You [the companies] owe it to the customers around the world to implement this immediately. No ifs, no buts, just do it.”Asked why they had not done so, representatives of the firms pointed to other security features, particularly those that protect customer data.Simon Wingrove, a software engineering manager at Google, said its system was “robust and works very well”.Gary Davis, a senior director in regulatory and legal at Apple, said it was concerned about disconnections being used for fraud, with bad actors wanting to get data and the power to delete accounts for blackmail.Kit Malthouse, the Conservative former policing minister, said it felt as if Apple was “dragging your feet and sitting behind this is a very strong commercial incentive”.He said: “The fact that £50m of phones are stolen in London every year – if that stopped that would be £50m in sales that would be depressed.”He also suggested Apple was benefiting from selling services to the users of millions of stolen phones around the world.Davis responded: “I don’t believe we are profiting. It is necessary to refute the suggestion that we benefit from our users somehow suffering the traumatic event of having their phone stolen and being disconnected from their lives. We have invested many hundreds of millions in designing in these protections.”The Met said all types of thefts were down 15% in April and May and about two-thirds of thefts related to mobile phones. Commander James Conway cautioned that it was a “tentative reduction” and said it was likely to be a result of increased police prioritisation and phone users showing more caution. Scotland Yard recently bought a fleet of high-speed ebikes to chase snatchers.Conway said theft and robbery were “easy crimes to commit” in London, and he described “teenagers on [high-powered ebikes] riding down the A10 committing 10, 20 thefts or robberies on the go, packaging those phones swiftly into silver foil or Faraday bags to make it more difficult for us to identify location, and then swiftly passing them on to a middle-market handler and ultimately out of the UK.”Most of the phones being stolen are the most expensive Apple versions, which police believe are specifically targeted and sell on the street for between £300 and £400. Part of the trade is driven by the relative high cost of phones in lower-income countries. It is estimated that more than 90% of stolen phones are reused while the rest are stripped for parts, with the screens particularly valuable.The hearing began with Malthouse saying he had witnessed an attempted phone theft by two young masked men on bikes on Tuesday morning while he was heading to parliament.Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonMetropolitan policePoliceAppleGoogleSmartphonesnewsShareReuse this content"

This week, I’m wondering what my first jobs in journalism would have been like had generative AI been around. In other news: Elon Musk leaves a trail of chaos, and influencers are selling the text they fed to AI to make art.AI threatens the job you had after collegeGenerative artificial intelligence may eliminate the job you got with your diploma still in hand, say executives who offered grim assessments of the entry-level job market last week in multiple forums.Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, which makes the multifunctional AI model Claude,told Axios last weekthat he believes that AI could cut half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and send overall unemployment rocketing to 20% within the next five years. One explanation why an AI company CEO might make such a dire prediction is to hype the capabilities of his product. It’s so powerful that it could eliminate an entire rung of the corporate ladder, he might say, ergo you should buy it, the slogan might go.If your purchasing and hiring habits follow his line of thinking, then you buy Amodei’s product to stay ahead of the curve of the job-cutting scythe. It is telling that Amodei made these remarks the same week that his company unveiled a new version of Claude in which the CEO claimed that the bot could code unassisted for several hours. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has followed a similar playbook.However, others less directly involved in the creation of AI are echoing Amodei’s warning. Steve Bannon, former Trump administration official and current influential Maga podcaster, agreed with Amodei and said that automated jobs would be a major issue in the 2028 US presidential election.The Washington Postreported in March that more than a quarter of all computer programming jobs in the US vanished in the past two years, citing the inflection point of the downturn as the release of ChatGPT in late 2022.Days before Amodei’s remarks were published, an executive at LinkedIn offered similarly grim prognostications based on the social network’s data in aNew York Timesessay headlined “I see the bottom rung of the career ladder breaking”.“There are growing signs that artificial intelligence poses a real threat to a substantial number of the jobs that normally serve as the first step for each new generation of young workers,” wrote Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn.The US Federal Reserve published observations on the job market for recent college graduates in the first quarter of 2025 that do not inspire hope. The agency’sreportreads: “The labor market for recent college graduates deteriorated noticeably in the first quarter of 2025. The unemployment rate jumped to 5.8% – the highest reading since 2021 – and the underemployment rate rose sharply to 41.2%.” The Fed did not attribute the deterioration to a specific cause.The likeliest outcome of AI’s impact on entry-level jobs is that companies will reformulate them into something new. The job market may settle somewhere between Amodei’s AI Ragnarok and the antediluvian days before ChatGPT. Familiarity with AI will be required in the way that Microsoft Office has, and bosses will demand a higher standard of productivity. If a robot can do most of the coding for you, a junior software engineer, then you should be producing five times the amount of code as before, they may say.Speaking of Microsoft and software engineers, CEO Satya Nadella claimed in late April thatAI writes 30% of Microsoft’s code. That may be the future of software development. It is possible that is true; it is also possible that Nadella, head of the company that has reaped enormous gains from the AI boom, is trying to sell by example, overestimating how much of that code is usable. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg has been more pointed in his assessments, asserting that his company will no longer need mid-level coders by the end of 2025. Shortly after, Meta announced a 5% staff reduction.View image in fullscreenMark Zuckerberg, the head of Meta, last year.Photograph: Manuel Orbegozo/ReutersThe short-term readjustment, however, is the pain point. Recent classes have graduated without AI being an integral part of their school life, and employers won’t believe those interim graduates have the necessary familiarity for a new professional landscape.That is not the fault of the graduates: employers themselves don’t know what they want yet from AI. Axios followed up Amodei’s doom and gloom with a piece about howAI job cuts are jumping the gun. Companies are not replacing departing workers, betting that AI will be able to perform the same functions, if not now, then hopefully by the time it would take to hire replacements.The example of journalism may be a canary in the coalmine. Entry-level jobs in journalism often involve aggregating news items from other outlets in the style of your own employer, a task AI is well suited to if the facts are straight. I spent several years doing just that when I started out. In the same way that we see Amodei’s predictions taking shape in LinkedIn’s data, I see the entry-level diminishment beginning in my own industry. Business Insider, a digital outlet focused on financial and business news, laid off 20% of its staff late last week. CEO Barbara Peng said the newsroom would go “all-in on AI” and become “AI-first” in her note eliminating the jobs.Axios itself footnoted its Amodei interview with a disclosure about its own practices with regard to AI.“At Axios, we ask our managers to explain why AI won’t be doing a specific job before green-lighting its approval. (Axios stories are always written and edited by humans),” the disclosure reads. The parenthetical indicates that Axios editors know that AI’s involvement in writing is bad for the brand. The part said outside the parentheses indicates Axios executives may not be backfilling vacated jobs, waiting for AI to catch up and close those openings.The week in AINew AI test can predict which men will benefit from prostate cancer drug‘One day I overheard my boss saying: just put it in ChatGPT’: the workers who lost their jobs to AIUS lawyer sanctioned after being caught using ChatGPT for court briefMusk leaves behind a sticky trail like a slugView image in fullscreenMusk at the White House in April.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesElon Musk announced he would leave the White House last week, ending a contentious and generally unpopular run as a senior adviser to the president and de facto head of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). Donald Trump hosted a press conference for his departure, the same day thatthe New York Timesreported that Musk had heavily used drugs on the campaign trail.My colleague Nick Robins-Early assessed themess Musk leaves in his wake:As Musk moves on, he consigns a mess of half-realized plans and gutted agencies to his acolytes installed in key positions across the federal government. His departure throws Doge’salready chaotic impact on the governmentinto an even grayer limbo, with questions over how much power the nebulous taskforce will have without him and who, if anyone, might rebuild the programs and services it destroyed.Musk’s initial pitch for Doge was to save $2tn from the budget by rooting out rampant waste and fraud, as well as to conduct an overhaul of government software that would modernize how federal agencies operate. Doge so far has claimed to cut about $140bn from the budget – although its “wall of receipts” isnotorious for containing errorsthat overestimate its savings. Donald Trump’s new tax bill, though not part of Doge and opposed by Musk, is alsoexpected to add $2.3tn to the deficit, nullifying any savings Doge may have achieved. Its promises of a new, modernized software have frequently been limited to artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots – some of which werealready in the works underthe Biden administration.The greater impact of Doge has instead been its dismantling of government services and humanitarian aid. Doge’s cuts have targeted a swath of agencies such as the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, which handles weather and natural disaster forecasting, andplunged otherssuch as theDepartment of Veterans Affairsinto crises. Numeroussmaller agencies, such as one thatcoordinates policy on homelessness, have been in effect shut down. Doge has brought several bureaus to their knees, with no clear plan of whether the staff Musk leaves behind will try to update or maintain their services or simply shut them off.As Musk returns to Tesla and SpaceX, the agencies he laid waste to are left to pick up the pieces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Up for grabs were 10 prompts used to prod AI-powered engines into generating the videos that the account itself had posted.Voidstomper posted a video captioned: “I didn’t want to sell these. But I’m broke and these still go viral. So here: 10 raw horror prompts straight from my archive. Some got me hundreds of millions of views. Some barely make sense. All of them work. Use them in any AI video tool. Just don’t pretend you wrote them. VAULT_DUMP_1 is live. Link in bio. No refunds. You’re on your own.” The account’s administrator did not respond to a request for an interview.The account is not alone. Marketplaces exist for the sale of AI prompts. Ben Stokes, the founder of the PromptBase, says there are about 20,000 sellers on his site hawking prompts, with thousands sold monthly and, to date, seven figures paid out to their writers since 2022. He said social media influencers and other content creators selling their prompts is “still quite niche” and serves as a side hustle for graphic designers, artists and photographers.Voidstomper put prompts for sale that had been used to create specific videos. The product a user might receive when purchasing a prompt on PromptBase is likely to be closer to a generalized template than a finite sentence, Stokes said.“For example, if the prompt that creates posters of famous landmarks in a vintage style, there’d be sections within the prompt in square brackets like [LANDMARK NAME] that you could change to the landmark you’d like to create a poster for, like the local pier in your town,” he said.Why buy a string of text when you could type out your own, though?“There is a specific group of people who are looking for high-quality, robust prompts for their business applications. Specifically, they are looking to integrate AI into their product or workflow, which usually requires a prompt, and want to ensure it works well and produces great consistent outputs,” said Stokes. Though the general public thinks of ChatGPT as free, running enough generations to obtain specific and correct outputs can be quite expensive for businesses, he added. It may be more cost-effective to buy a prompt.Even within the niche of AI-generated art, some consider the sale of prompts ridiculous. The Instagram and TikToker HolyFool36, an AI art Instagram account that has beeninterviewed in this newsletter before, said he would never engage in the practice.“Frankly, I find it as an insult to my sensibilities,” he said via email. “Generative AI requires no skill – almost anyone can figure out how to reverse engineer his prompts for free.“I personally know Void Stomper and have had many interactions with him. I’ve explained that the best way to monetize this stuff is to build a brand and then sell real tangible products within that brand. He has clearly, directly, stated that he does not have the discipline to do that. I don’t judge him, everyone’s gotta pay rent somehow, I’d just never go about it that way personally,” he added.The wider TechScapeSpaceX Starship breaks up over Indian Ocean in latest bumpy testWhat to do if your laptop is lost or stolen – tips for when the worst happensNvidia beats Wall Street expectations even as Trump tamps down China salesIs every memecoin just a scam?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There isn’t much I miss from my pre-Invisalign “gappy teeth” days, but it was far more difficult for food and plaque to get stuck in the gaps – something I took for granted at the time. Using floss between my pre-braces teeth was easy, but ultimately pointless, like using a pipe cleaner to buff the Dartford Tunnel.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.With all the gaps closed, that’s no longer the case, and my water flosser has become a welcome part of my dental routine. A water flosser fires an intense jet of water between the teeth to dislodge debris and leave your mouth feeling fresher.“Most people know they should be flossing, but in reality, it’s one of the most skipped steps in daily oral care,” says Dr Johannes Jacobs, the founder ofJacobs & Associates Dental Office. “Patients who struggle with traditional flossing routines often do far better with water flossers, and their gum health improves noticeably.”Most of the dentists I spoke to favour floss or interdental brushes (such as TePe) – more on that in the what you need to know section below – but water flossers definitely offer convenience.“The water flosser doesn’t provide the scraping action that traditional string floss does, but what it offers in return is accessibility and comfort,” says Jacobs. “For a lot of patients, that’s the deciding factor. If flossing is painful, frustrating or impossible – due to dexterity issues or appliances such as braces – it usually just doesn’t happen.“A water flosser is easy to use, even for kids and older adults. That’s why I often recommend it – not as a replacement for floss across the board, but as a realistic alternative for those who aren’t flossing at all.”For the past few months, I’ve been putting water flossers through their paces. Here are my findings.At a glanceBest water flosser overall:Waterpik Ultra Professional£84.15 at AmazonBest budget water flosser:Operan Cordless Oral Irrigator£21.99 at AmazonBest cordless water flosser:Philips Sonicare Cordless 3000£69.99 at John LewisWhy you should trust meFirst off, because I have 32 teeth, as most adult humans do. A weird flex, granted, but a useful qualifier for anyone wanting to be taken seriously when it comes to assessing the merits of water flossers. Thanks to the aforementioned course of Invisalign, said teeth are also now close together, making them more of a sporting challenge for the water flossing contenders.Perhaps more importantly, I’ve been professionally testing consumer technology for more than a decade now, and have previously trialled thebest electric toothbrushesfor the Filter. You canread more about the ins and outs of that here.How I testedView image in fullscreenOur writer attempts to test the water flossers’ power by measuring how far a jet can be fired across a room.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianFor the most part, the testing process is what you’d expect: using one water flosser after another, and lavishing the kind of attention on my teeth that they usually get only in the panicked hours before a dental checkup to avoid a tongue-lashing (by which I mean a dressing down, not some kind of novel oral treatment).Each flosser was used multiple times, testing the various heads and settings, while making notes on features such as usability, controls and the slightly grim-sounding “mouth feel”. But there were also more off-the-wall tests to check the manufacturer’s specs – such as emptying a full water tank into a measuring cup to verify capacities, and testing power by measuring how far a jet could be fired across a room on a full battery.I wouldn’t recommend repeating the latter test – it’s not scientific, with each flosser’s different heights and jet angles – but if you do insist on following my bad example, don’t do it in a carpeted area and ensure pets are safely locked away.Samples were requested directly from manufacturers and retailers, with nine being provided from brands including Oral-B, Panasonic, Ordo, Waterpik and Philips.The best water flossers in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianBest water flosser overall:Waterpik Ultra ProfessionalView image in fullscreen£99 at AO£84.15 at AmazonCountertop water flossers seem to be going out of style, and I could get hold of only one for our roundup. The Ultra Professional is a reminder of why this isn’t necessarily a good thing, providing not only the largest tank around but also the kind of flexibility its cordless brethren could only dream of.Why we love itUnlike cordless models, the water reservoir remains on your countertop at all times. That makes it easier to move the nozzle around your mouth and ensures the easy-to-fill tank’s 650ml of water is accessible at all times, no matter the angle from which you’re attacking your teeth. Too often with cordless models, I found a half-full tank turned to a dribble when spraying the backs of my lower teeth – that was never a problem here.On top of that, it has 10 pressure settings increasing from 10PSI to 100PSI (pounds per square inch, a common measure of pressure), so you can choose what works for you. A generous number of heads (seven) are included, with three standard jet tips, one plaque seeker, another for orthodontics, a Pik Pocket and a toothbrush.There are drawbacks to the countertop design. Obviously, it’s not travel-friendly (11.9 x 9.7 x 26.3cm WDH), and giants like me will have to stoop to use it. However, if you have the space, it’s an easy recommendation.It’s a shame that …it’s a permanent resident on your countertop.Tank size: 650mlHeads: seven: jet (x3), plaque seeker, orthodontic, Pik Pocket, toothbrushPressure: 10-100PSIWaterproof: not statedCharging: not applicableBest budget water flosser:Operan Cordless Oral IrrigatorView image in fullscreen£21.99 at AmazonWhile most cordless water flossers sit in the £60 to £120 range, Operan comes in at a fraction of that, while still achieving excellent results.Why we love itFrom the suspiciously low pricing, I was sure there would be something to complain about with the Cordless Oral Irrigator. But mouthful of a name aside, there really isn’t.It’s easy to hold and has four noticeably different power settings, with a pleasant pulsing stream. It’s also quite effective when turned upside down, thanks to the generous 300ml tank and floating ball on the end of the reservoir tube (it’s not perfect, though, so it’s worth tackling the back of your teeth first, while the tank is full).There are four tips in the box, including one for orthodontics and another for tongue scraping. The cherry on the cake? It has a water resistance rating of IPX7, so you can use it in the shower, if you like.It’s a shame that …some customers report reliability problems, although I had no issues.Tank size: 300mlHeads: four: jet, periodontal, orthodontic, tongue scraperPressure: 40-120PSIWaterproof: IPX7Charging: USB-CBest cordless water flosser:Philips Sonicare Cordless 3000View image in fullscreen£69.99 at John Lewis£119.99 at BootsThe best of the cordless bunch is the Philips Sonicare Cordless 3000. It offers a great combination of design, power and capacity, although it’s not ideal for those with orthodontics or periodontal pockets as it comes with just two tips.Why we love itThe main thing that sets the Sonicare Cordless 3000 apart is its special Quad Stream tip, which fires water in four directions at once. While that might be bad news if you accidentally turn it on outside your mouth, it provides good, powerful coverage across multiple teeth and gum areas at the same time as a result.It also comes with a standard jet tip for a more intense stream, and both provide a decent amount of power. While Philips doesn’t list a PSI figure, in my unscientific laminate-soaking distance test, it landed in the top half, and it feels like it provides a good level of pressure in the mouth, too. More importantly, it comes with a “deep clean” setting with a more thorough pulsing jet of water.The water tank holds a decent 250ml, and is transparent so you can easily keep an eye on how much is left. One thing to note, however, is the charging method: my unit came with a bespoke power cable, but other versions pack USB-C. Philips’s PR confirmed that they’re otherwise identical, but USB-C is undoubtedly more handy if you lose the original cable.It’s a shame that …it comes with only two tips.Tank size: 250mlHeads: two: Quad Stream, jetPressure: not statedWaterproof: not statedCharging: USB-C/figure 8The best of the restView image in fullscreen‘The bulbous water tank means you can use it over multiple sessions’: the Spotlight water flosser.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianOral-B Aquacare Pro Expert Series 6View image in fullscreen£45.50 at Pharmacy2U£49.99 at DebenhamsBest for:sensitive gumsThe Aquacare Pro Expert Series 6 is far from perfect. For one thing, if you find it at its RRP of £150, it’s pricey – although you’re unlikely to pay that in practice. Even more importantly, it has the smallest tank of the lot at 150ml. It also feels underpowered, with even the “intense” setting feeling nowhere near as powerful as its rivals.For sensitive gums and teeth, though, that possible weak spot becomes a virtue. It certainly offers a comfortable experience with the Oxyjet heads, which claim to add microbubbles for a deeper clean. These provide two types of stream via a manual switch: the rotational option gently massages the gums, while the more traditional targeted stream fires in one direction. There’s also a standard jet tip for more power – but again, if you’re after power, you’ve come to the wrong place.It didn’t make the final cut because …the tank is the smallest of the lot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Unlike other cordless models, it means you can use it over multiple sessions – and there’s a built-in UV light setting to sterilise the water, if you don’t like the idea of nasties swimming in it.That’s something of a gimmick, but it’s a nice extra to have in an all-around great water flosser. It is pretty powerful, comes with four different heads, offers three operating modes, and is pretty good at working upside down, thanks to the Hydro Gravity Ball at the end of the reservoir tube.There are two downsides: it charges with a bundled figure-8 charger rather than USB-C, and the water tank has to be unscrewed every time you need to fill it. Given I managed to incorrectly align it a couple of times, that may get messy – but that should at least let you test the IPX7 waterproof rating.It didn’t make the final cut because …the tank is a pain to fill, and it uses a figure-8 charger rather than USB-C.Tank size: 400mlHeads: four: jet, orthodontic, periodontal pocket sprinkler, tongue scraperPressure: 60-120PSIWaterproof: IPX7Charging: figure-8Icy Bear water flosserView image in fullscreen£59.99 at Icy Bear Dental CareBest for:travelPlenty of water flossers include travel cases in the box, but from the selection I tested, only the Icy Bear flosser gets physically smaller when not in use. The body of the flosser slips down into the tank, reducing its size by about a third: clever!This design does come with some drawbacks, however. It’s slower to fill than other models, and it can sometimes leak a little – something countered by its IPX7 waterproof rating. The design also requires a long press to turn on and off, which is great to avoid accidental leaks in your bag, but less good when your mouth is rapidly filling with water and you need to breathe without soaking the mirror.It didn’t make the final cut because …the pull-out design is not without its problems.Tank size: 200mlHeads: four: jet, orthodontic, periodontal, tongue scraperPressure: not statedWaterproof: IPX7Charging: USB-CWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenWater flossers aren’t a replacement for mechanical flossing, but they have their place.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianHow to use a water flosserPart of the appeal of water flossers is how simple they are to use: just fill the tank, and then work the flosser along the gumline, spraying between the teeth. You may find your flosser comes with different attachments that require an adjusted technique, but that’s the basic operation.Dr Flavio Pisani, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Lancashire’s School of Medicine and Dentistry, recommends intermittent spraying, and some flossers have this pulsing action as a built-in setting.“It should be an alternate flowing and oozing that makes the power efficient,” he says. Otherwise, you could “just get your mouth full of water without any effect”.Some people like to add a little mouthwash to the water, but Pisani says the evidence doesn’t support this as being any more effective.“I think it’s really only going to make people feel fresher,” says Dr Sam Jethwa, president of the British Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry. “It’s more just a freshness of the mouth thing rather than any other benefit.”Water flossers vs regular flossingFrom speaking to several dentists, the consensus is that water flossers aren’t a replacement for mechanical flossing, but they have their place. They are, as Caitlin Miller, head of dental hygiene and therapy at Bupa Dental Care UK,told me while I was testing toothbrushes, “better than nothing” for patients who won’t use floss or interdental brushes.Jethwa agrees. “The example I give patients is a boat sitting in a dock for a long time – it’s got algae on the bottom. Get a hose pipe to try to get it off, it’s not going to do anything. You need the water, but you need the mechanical movement there,” he says.“So I wouldn’t say that they’re a replacement for floss. It may be better to use a water flosser if you’re not using anything.”Pisani is open to water flossers’ potential, but says there is “not strong evidence” of their efficacy compared with traditional interdental cleaning.“There’srecent evidence from a studyover four weeks of using water flossers compared to TePe brushes, and the [results] are quite similar,” he says. But there’s a catch: “The problem is that this study was not giving the group using interdental brushes the size that fit their teeth.”Hopefully, further study will reveal more, but don’t expect anything overnight. “We have reached a consensus aboutelectric toothbrushes, but bear in mind they’ve been available since the 1980s,” Pisani continues. “We found the evidence about the better use of electric toothbrushes about 10 years ago.”For now, Pisani doesn’t recommend seeing water flossers as an outright replacement, but insists that interdental cleaning is crucial. “I tell my students and patients that if I were sent to a desert island with only one tool, I would definitely bring myTePe [interdental brushes]with me, rather than a toothbrush, because gum disease starts in between teeth or in between implants.”“If a water flosser encourages people who are doing very little in addition to brushing to do something, then it’s a good thing,” says Jethwa. “But what I wouldn’t encourage is for people who are flossing well, using interdental brushes and achieving good oral hygiene to think that this is an easier way of achieving the same thing.”Key features to look forSince most water flossers do the same thing, it’s worth focusing on the differences.For example, tank size is important. If you’re doing a thorough clean, then some of the smaller capacities won’t be enough. Yet this directly plays off against usability and portability, so it’s a balancing act.Power sometimes turns up in the specifications under PSI – or pounds per square inch. While a higher pressure may be more effective at pushing out debris, it can prove uncomfortable, especially on sensitive mouths, so the flexibility of power is arguably more important than the raw PSI figure.If you’re looking at a cordless model, as most of the ones in this guide are, it’s also worth considering how they’re charged. Some power up using USB-C, which is undoubtedly more convenient than a proprietary lead, as most folk have several cables lying around. Finally, some people like to floss while in the shower. If that’s you, then look for one that has IPX7 protection.Alan Martin is awriter who has been putting products, including phones, gaming devices and wearables, through their paces for more than a decade.

Might they be better off without Spotify et al?Eamonn FordeTue 3 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 10.02 EDTShareThere is a battle gripping the music business today around the manipulation of streaming services – and innocent indie artists are the collateral damage.Fraudsters are flooding Spotify, Apple Music and the rest with AI-generated tracks, to try and hoover up the royalties generated by people listening to them. These tracks are cheap, quick and easy to make, with Deezer estimating in April that over20,000 fully AI-created tracks– that’s 18% of new tracks – were being ingested into its platform daily, almost double the number in January. The fraudsters often then use bots, AI or humans to endlessly listen to these fake songs and generate revenue, while others are exploiting upload services to get fake songs put on real artists’ pages and siphon off royalties that way.Spotify fines the worst offenders and says it puts “significant engineering resources and research into detecting, mitigating, and removing artificial streaming activity”, whileApple Musicclaims “less than 1% of all streams are manipulated” on its service. That may sound encouraging, but in a streaming business worth$20.4bn globally(according to the IFPI), it’s likely that hundreds of millions of dollars are being skimmed off annually by rogue operators.Part of the problem is that while the barriers of entry for musicians have been dramatically lowered – uploading songs to streaming services is much easier than manufacturing CDs or vinyl – the barriers of entry for fraudsters are lower too. So the industry has declared war, but hair-trigger automated detection systems mean that artists are seeing their music taken offline even when they’ve done nothing wrong.View image in fullscreenSpotify’s New York headquarters.Photograph: John Nacion Imaging/ShutterstockDarren Owen, chief operating officer of music distribution company Fuga, suggests streaming fraud “started to blow up across the industry” around 2021. Grappling with it now makes up 50% of his workload.Using AI and machine learning, Fuga gives streaming patterns a “severity score”, separating out “non-human listening patterns” to spot fraud. “You’re not going to listen to the same song at the same time across multiple devices,” Owen says, noting that countries like India, Vietnam, Thailand and parts of eastern Europe are hotbeds of click-farm activity, using low-paid workers. “It’s become clear that organised criminals are involved in it as well.”It is not just services like pimpyourfollower.de in Germany – which was taken offline after a court injunction – and others in Canada and Brazil who are being targeted by record industry trade bodies for offering artificially inflated streams. Universal Music Group (UMG), the biggest record company in the world, has been accused by Drake of conspiring to increase the play count of Kendrick Lamar’s diss track Not Like Us, an allegation UMG denies.The Guardian has spoken to multiple artists who found themselves at the sharp end of this war on manipulation, where unexpected spikes in streams get taken as proof of guilt.Darren Hemmings is managing director of music marketing company Motive Unknown and a musician himself. His distributor recently informed him that a track on one EP, having jumped from “a few plays a day” to more than 1,000, was guilty of manipulation. “I wouldn’t blame them for drawing that conclusion,” he says, but “it’s very judge, jury, executioner”. He did not manipulate the streams, but could not identify the root cause – other than it simply becoming popular with actual listeners.Northern Irish rock band Final Thirteen had some of their music taken off streaming services due to a spike in the tens of thousands. They suspect this came after a play on Radio 1, but their distributor automatically concluded they were manipulated. “It’s really hard for any artist to prove that they didn’t [manipulate streams], but it’s even harder forSpotifyto prove that they did,” says their drummer, Doobes. “[They] take it down and that’s it.”View image in fullscreenMatthew Whiteside of The Night With …Photograph: Julie HowdenAdam J Morgan, who makes music as indie act Naked & Baked, had a track get over 10,000 streams in a week, possibly from use in a TikTok video, but it was zapped by his distributor RouteNote as suspicious. “I hadn’t done anything wrong and they didn’t provide any evidence,” he says, believing it was down to an overly anxious RouteNote. “I spent that weekend trying to work out what was going on, but Spotify said my music hadn’t been flagged at all.” RouteNote did not respond to a request for an interview.Takedowns can cause musicians inconvenience, derail marketing and cost them money. Matthew Whiteside, artistic director of experimental classical event The Night With… (and head of the TNW Music label) had three different albums taken down amid claims of artificial streaming. He tracked it back: TNW Music tracks were being added to manipulated playlists. “It made no sense [why they were added] based on the genre.” His distributor said he could resubmit the album again, at $40 per album, but with no guarantee it would not be removed again.“Streaming in general is geared against the smaller and the niche,” he says. “If we get 1,000 streams a month on an album, I’d be very happy.” As such, paying to resubmit an album is beyond their release budget.Deezer claims it was the first streaming service to implement fraud detection systems. “We look at a lot of indicators that help our algorithm decide if a user is fraudulent or not,” says Thibault Roucou, the company’s royalties and reporting director. “When we ask for a takedown, we look manually at what’s happening and we’re very confident that it is extreme manipulation.”Unfortunately, systems elsewhere for taking down tracks often presume guilt and the appeals system is so arduous that small acts, already struggling, just give up. Pop singer Levina, who represented Germany at Eurovision in 2017, saw her music taken off streaming services without warning – it was flagged because she unintentionally had the same name as another artist. “With streaming services, it’s almost impossible to [appeal] through them,” she sighs. “You fill out a form but it leaves you quite powerless.”View image in fullscreenLevina, chair of the artist council within the Featured Artists Coalition.Photograph: Sam RockmanShe is also chair of the artist council within trade body Featured Artists Coalition, and they are finalising “minimum standards for what distributors should be doing”. She proposes a traffic light warning system that allows acts time to present their defence or take action to address the problems.Streaming services and distributors now accept this battle is about containment rather than total elimination. Owen, however, says the latest iteration is not fraudsters manipulating the streams of a few tracks by large amounts, but rather boosting multiple tracks a small amount to fly under detection radars.For Hemmings, this could result in a two-tier streaming economy, with smaller acts abandoning the main streaming platforms, where earnings are derisory anyway, to focus on a service such as Bandcamp. “This could provoke a conclusion among large swathes of the independent music community that they’re just better off focusing on other ways to make money.”Explore more on these topicsMusic streamingMusic industrySpotifyApple MusicIndieDigital music and audioArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

In his own words, his VJ debut, Rambo III, “lacked a bit of skill”, but he went on to master his craft by studying the works of pioneers like KK the Best and VJ Jingo.VJ Junior’s breakthrough came in 2009 when he translated The Promise, a Filipino soap, for the local station Bukedde TV. “It was a big hit and it made a big brand for me,” the 40-year-old said. “People started believing in my work.”Ronnie’s Entertainment, a video store in Katwe neighbourhood, was a beehive of activity: shoppers perused shelves stacked with thousands of VJ DVDs while employees sat in front of computers copying movies to waiting customers’ flash disks. DVDs sell for 2,000 Ugandan shillings (£0.41), and titles copied to flash disks go for 1,000 shillings.The shop’s proprietor, Ronald Ssentongo, said he sold hundreds of films and TV shows every day, and that some of the most popular titles included Marvel movies and the TV shows Prison Break and 24. “These titles are already available in their original English versions, but people don’t watch them,” he said. “They’re waiting for VJ Junior’s translation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As foreign movies on VHS became more available in the 1980s, video halls started popping up. To overcome the language barrier, video hall proprietors hired VJs to translate them to local languages in real time.As technology advanced, VJs moved to distributing their work on VHS tapes, VCDs, and now DVDs and flash disks. Many have created websites for viewers to stream and download their material upon subscription.The industry is growing in other ways too. Some VJs are increasingly dubbing Ugandan movies and TV shows, and new VJs have emerged to translate to languages other than Luganda, the most widely spoken in the country.View image in fullscreenDVDs on display for sale at Ronnie’s Entertainment.Photograph: Carlos Mureithi/The GuardianBy localising foreign films and TV shows and helping Ugandans make sense of them, VJs make audiences feel valued, said John-Baptist Imokola, a lecturer at Makerere University whohas researchedthe work of VJs. “They feel appreciated, they feel recognised and they feel known,” he said, though he also warned of the risk of oversimplified translations that deny audiences an understanding of the themes and messages the original films intended to convey.VJs and their distributors occasionally have run-ins with authorities over copyright infringement, with police sometimes raiding video stores and confiscating DVDs and equipment used to copy films. VJ Junior said the copyright issue was a big challenge for his business and that it was “very difficult” to get the rights to dub foreign films.VJ Junior, who described the role of a VJ in Ugandan society as “helping people understand movies, entertaining them, and inspiring them”, said he dubbed an average of 10 films or TV episodes every week.“You have to do research, you have to be informed and you have to be educated,” he said of the skills required to do his job. “The industry has grown and so has demand.”Explore more on these topicsUgandaAfricaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But are MrBeast’s videos simply very savvy clickbait – or acts of avant garde genius?ByMark O’ConnellTue 3 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 05.05 EDTShareJimmy Donaldson, the 27-year-old online content creator and entrepreneur known as MrBeast, is by any reasonable metric one of the most popular entertainers on the planet. HisYouTubechannel, to which he posts his increasingly elaborate and expensively produced videos, has 400 million subscribers – more than the population of the United States of America and equivalent to the total number of native English speakers currently alive. It’s close to twice as many subscribers as Elon Musk has X followers, and over 100 million more than Taylor Swift has Instagram followers. And that number, 400 million, does not account for the people who watch MrBeast’s videos in passing, or who are aware of his cultural presence because of their children, or who just sort of know who he is but don’t have any intricate awareness as to why he is famous.That number is the number of people who have made the volitional move of clicking that subscribe button, to ensure that they will a) not miss his latest videos and b) can be literally counted by potential advertisers as a more-or-less guaranteed audience. One last fact, before we move away from numbers and into more nebulous modes of consideration: his 2024 Amazon Prime reality competition show, Beast Games, in which 1,000 contestants competed for $5m (£3.7m), the largest cash prize in television history, reportedly cost $100m to produce, making it the most expensive unscripted show in history. Jimmy Donaldson, at the risk of belabouring the obvious, is an incredibly big deal.And that’s without even getting into his various subsidiary business interests – the mobile gaming company, the Feastables confectionery brand, the widely derided Lunchly range of ready-made kids’ lunches, the MrBeast Burger fast food delivery concern, the cryptocurrency schemes, the financial services, the accredited university courses on YouTube content creation, the streaming TV network, and the various philanthropic operations that bear his imprimatur.A couple of weeks ago, I had a drink with a friend who’d just got back from Alexandria, where he’d gone to get a complicated root canal situation seen to, at presumably a fraction of what it would have cost him at home. I mentioned I was writing about MrBeast, and my friend – whose dental status has since improved – told me he’d heard from a number of Egyptians that the country’s tourist trade was currently experiencing a significant upswing, and that that upswing could be accounted for by the release, a few months back, of I Spent 100 Hours Inside the Pyramids! (194m views thus far), in which Donaldson and his boys were granted unprecedented access to the deep interiors of the pyramids of Giza.One obvious question to ask about all of this is why is MrBeast so successful? Another, less obvious, question is: what does his success say about the culture that gave rise to it? The first question is, in a sense, a fairly straightforward one to answer. MrBeast is successful because his videos are highly entertaining. I can personally vouch for this. I don’t imagine, being in my mid-40s (among other limiting demographic and cultural factors), that I’m anywhere close to the MrBeast target viewership, and yet I have consumed more than my fair share of his content, and have been steadily and straightforwardly entertained. Troubled by the general tenor and implications of that state of being entertained, yes, but entertained nonetheless.Donaldson is not by any means one of God’s chosen entertainment-industry stars. He’s not especially handsome, and neither is he particularly funny-looking. At 6ft 5in, and with the sparse reddish beard he nowadays sports, he has the charmingly awkward aspect of a teen who has recently put on a growth spurt and hasn’t quite settled into himself. He’s likable, and is possessed of a goofy and anarchic sense of humour, but more in a guy-you-went-to-school-with sense than, say, the Eric André or the Jack Black sense. You definitely wouldn’t call him cool, either, and he’s certainly not edgy, but neither is he staid or offensively corny. My wife – who has, in passing, taken in a fair measure of MrBeast content over the time I have been working on this essay, consuming them in a manner roughly analogous to passive smoking – described Donaldson and his crew of sidekicks thus: “They just seem like good kids.”A good deal of his success stems from his ability to balance this quality with the obsessive grandeur of his schemes. He is, simultaneously, a gifted algorithm-charmer, possessed of arcane knowledge as to attention and engagement, and a guy who is just hanging out, amusing himself and his friends (and his hundreds of millions of viewers). His most effective videos exhibit a fanatical clarity of purpose, as though he had taken the form of the YouTube video and squeezed it for its essential oil of entertainment, discarding as so much useless husk everything that cannot immediately be rendered down into pure content.Take, for instance, a recent video called I Survived the 5 Deadliest Places on Earth, in which Donaldson visits – and, self-evidently, survives – the five so-called deadliest places on Earth. (I say so-called here because Donaldson does not visit, say, the Palestinian city of Khan Younis, or the Darfur region of Sudan; it’s more that he performs really dangerous actions in an attention-grabbing manner and setting.) Over the course of the video’s 13 minutes, we see Donaldson and his team of sidekicks 1) walking around Snake Island, off the coast of Brazil, which is infamous for its teeming population of venomous snakes; 2) scaling a sheer cliff wall of ice; 3) driving a terrifying Bolivian mountain pass known as “the Death Road”; 4) swimming with sharks; and 5) spending the night in the middle of an African savannah in a cage surrounded by fresh meat for the specific purpose of attracting hungry predators.It’s probably worth restating here that this video’s duration is 13 minutes. Now, that may seem like a near-eternity in the era of TikTok and YouTube shorts, but we’re talking about a video with five distinct narratives, across four different continents. Five different situations the viewer has to understand and get invested in; five different scenarios to start getting entertained by and, crucially, stay entertained by. Needless to say, this does not leave a lot of time for old-timey narrative conventions such as establishing a context, or making the viewer understand or care about why any of this is happening in the first place. It just is happening. That’s the thing with MrBeast: everything that happens is always just happening, and if you want a reason for it, it’s no more or less than the fact that you yourself are watching. And this is the case with pretty much everything Donaldson does. To watch his videos is to feel your prefrontal cortex practically vibrate, like a fulfilment hub under the extreme pressure of market demand. He is, and always has been, monomaniacally committed to a lethally pure conception of algorithmically determined entertainment.I don’t intend to make a case here that you should start appreciatively watching Donaldson’s videos. I don’t intend to make a case for MrBeast as art – although I reserve the right to talk about it as though it were. I’m not even going to try to convince you that these videos are even necessarily good, whatever that might mean. But I do feel quite strongly that Donaldson is some type of genius – a prodigy of a form that, as degraded as it is, deserves to be taken seriously as one of the signature artefacts of our time.Who is he, then, this figure of bottomless frivolity and maximal impact, this Mozart of the attention economy? Where did he come from, and how was he made? There are biographical particulars that might be brought to bear here, certainly. Child of divorce. Both parents in the military. Money problems. Single mom. There was much moving around after the divorce, owing to his mother’s military career, and the family eventually settled in Greenville, North Carolina, where he went to a strict evangelical Christian private school. Between one thing and another – introverted child, Crohn’s disease – he spent a lot of time off school, watching YouTube in his room. He was, and I mean this with no disrespect to Sue Parisher, who obviously had a lot going on, raised by the YouTube algorithm.Donaldson’s earliest videos are still online, on his channel. His first ever upload, from February 2012, is basically just him playing Minecraft and chattering happily into a mic about the game. His voice hasn’t broken, because he’s only 13, and he has yet to develop his geeky carnival-barker approach to narration, but it’s recognisably Donaldson. It’s basically all Minecraft for the first two years or so, though there are a handful of videos – How Much Money Does PewDiePie Make?????, How Much Money Does Captain Sparkles Make????? – that indicate a precocious interest in the monetizability of YouTube content. In a 2013 video, entitled How Much Money Do I Make?????, he revealed that the figure was at that point about $30 a month. Well before he himself was making any money, and well before he established money as both a presiding subject and a central medium of his work, it was already a preoccupation.In 2017, after five years of YouTube obscurity, he had his first viral hit, a video which now seems, weirdly, both completely at odds with the thrust of his subsequent career, and to contain many of its core themes. It’s called I Counted to 100,000!, and it’s exactly that: a livestreamed ordeal, lasting about 40 hours, in which the young Donaldson sits in his gaming chair, stares into his crappy webcam, and counts from 1 to 100,000. It clearly struck a chord with viewers, even if very few of them made it more than a few minutes in. Its stupidity and pointlessness was – and this, I would argue, is a hallmark of the Beast oeuvre – of such a scale, and pursued with such obsessive doggedness, that you couldn’t help but be impressed.It is, of course, very little fun to watch, even in small doses. Literally nothing happens, apart from Donaldson counting to 100,000. In this sense, it is nothing like his later videos, defined as they are by a near-demented commitment to maximum viewer-stimulation. But it centres around a punishing endurance challenge undertaken for the purpose of amassing clicks – a central idea he has pushed to further extremes, and pumped with increasingly massive amounts of cash, throughout his career. Within a couple of days, the video was racking up tens of thousands of views.View image in fullscreenJimmy Donaldson in his 2017 video I Counted to 100,000, which gave him his first viral hitPhotograph: YouTubeHis channel began to grow pretty steeply from that point, building on the counting video’s success. He did one where he watched the video for fellow YouTuber Jake Paul’s truly execrable rap song It’s Everyday Bro for 10 straight hours. One where he spent 24 hours immersed up to his armpits in slime. One where he put a bunch of people in a circle and awarded $10,000 to the last person to leave. One where he bought every item in a supermarket.As Donaldson’s content grew more popular, he began to attract more and more lucrative sponsorship deals. Early sponsors included Quidd – a now defunct app for collecting “digital brand stickers” – Electronic Arts and Xbox. His content began to visibly improve around 2019; the videos had higher production values, and multi-camera setups – clearly the result of an expanding operation, and a creator who was acquiring skills and resources. His stunts got notably more costly, though by no means less stupid (see, for instance, the awe-inspiringly dumb I Filled My Brother’s House With Slime & Bought Him a New One, in which Donaldson fills his brother’s house with slime and buys him a new one), and he began to give away ever larger sums of money. By 2021, according to Forbes, he was YouTube’s highest earner, bringing in an estimated $54m that year.Some of MrBeast’s most successful videos feature Donaldson himself – presumably because they involve situations that would invite legal and/or moral catastrophe if the video involved anyone else. There’s one where he spends 50 hours in solitary confinement. (It’s called, as you might well have guessed, I Spent 50 Hours in Solitary Confinement.) There’s one where he is buried alive, also for 50 hours. (I’m not even checking here, and I can basically guarantee you that it’s called I Spent 50 Hours Buried Alive.)Then there’s a whole other category of endurance challenge videos that involve other people, and in almost all cases these involve the awarding of truly prodigious amounts of money. There’s one where contestants compete to win a year, rent free, in a luxury home, by seeing who can keep their hand on the luxury home for the longest, enduring ever more fiendish mental and physical challenges in order to do so.And then there’s $10,000 Every Day You Survive in a Grocery Store. If you want to get a sense of what MrBeast is all about – of the sheer scale, and the joyful stupidity, of his whole project – this is a good one to watch. The setup is basically as follows: Donaldson buys an entire Safeway supermarket, one of those grandly comprehensive US establishments that sells everything from inflatable swimming pools to home entertainment systems. He then gives a young man named Alex – introduced as “this random guy” – 10 grand for every day he spends living in the store, wheeling in a grocery cart full of cash and presenting it to him as long as he doesn’t set foot outside the door.The video, like a surprising amount of MrBeast’s work, amounts to a kind of postmodernist recreation of Robinson Crusoe. Alex, this random-guy subject of terminal-stage US capitalism, is stranded in a supermarket where all of his basic needs, and no small number of less basic ones, are catered for by the contents of the shelves. His one obligation is that, every day, he must gather $10,000 worth of items from the store – stuff he doesn’t need: electronics, nappies, pet food and so forth – and exchange them for the cash. This is both an acute pain in the ass, and the one thing that prevents him from going insane with boredom. He builds a sort of ad hoc dwelling for himself in a corner of the store dedicated to camping supplies, using shelving units as walls, and packages of kitchen roll as a mattress. He finds a large inflatable garden pool in storage, rigs up a hose, fills it with water over a couple of days.But there are deepening extremes of experience to be contended with: boredom, isolation, sadness and guilt about being away from his family. The real turning point comes when Alex accidentally lances the inflatable garden pool with a forklift he’s using to gather his daily $10k-worth of exchange items, and floods the entire supermarket with water, which he must then spend his days splashing about in.Eventually, he seems to barely care about the money at all; he seems, by the end, almost to resent it. The video’s most interesting moment is one that’s given barely any space to breathe. (Nothing, in MrBeast, is ever given space to breathe, because breathing is boring.) It’s Alex, 44 days in, half-mad with loneliness and surrounded by the drenched detritus of consumerism, greeting the arrival of his daily 10 grand in a shopping cart – this time piloted into the store not by Donaldson or one of his sidemen, but by a remote-controlled robot – with a dejected “thanks for the money”.Thanks for the money. A person with a different, less algorithmically determined sensibility might have made of that moment something more central. I kept having some version of this thought, watching MrBeast videos: that their animating ideas, and the content generated by them, could easily provide the material for works of conceptual art.There’s a moment, for instance, in the competition show Beast Games that struck me as something close to avant garde. Donaldson lays out a million dollars in cash in a big pile, and instructs each of the 10 remaining contestants to come out of their little houses one by one, and to choose how much money they want to take from the pile. If every player takes $100,000, they all get an equal amount of the money. The first player does exactly this. The second player deviates (though not dramatically) by taking $223,000.The third player, a middle-aged guy named JC, is a whole other story. Despite having established himself as a pretty standup fellow, just seeing that much money piled up in front of him and there for the literal taking makes JC realise that he could pay off all his debt, and significantly improve his children’s lives. He decides to take precisely $650,000 – basically the entire pile, aside from the $27,000 pittance he elects to leave for the next contestant. He’s not a straightforward villain, though, and the apparent contradiction of his total resolution and his convulsed conscience makes for compelling, and in fact powerfully weird, viewing. The moment I’m primarily thinking of here is the image of JC, sitting on his prison-like bed in his house (really just a bare cell) surrounded by bags of cash cartoonishly bursting with bills, and looking like a man whose life has been destroyed by some unseen demonic force – as perhaps, in a manner of speaking, it has.View image in fullscreenGiving away a car on a promotional tour for his Feastables confectionery brand in Sydney, Australia, June 2024.Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAPAnd that’s a thing that is rarely said about Donaldson’s whole project. This is a guy who grew up immersed in both evangelical protestantism and the YouTube clickbait economy, and whose earthly works have about them some strange, and I am guessing unconscious, quality of the theological. A man weeping in moral torment over bags of money; another so bored, depressed and isolated that he can barely raise his eyes to yet another shopping cart full of cash. These are the products of what I have come to think of as Donaldson in full Mephistopheles mode. “Look what these creatures of flesh and blood will do for cash,” he seems constantly on the verge of intoning, as he observes his subjects like so many mazed rats.In the opening episode of Beast Games, Donaldson stands on a tower overlooking the purpose-built Beast City, and watches hundreds of contestants below as they stream into the little world of his creation. They look “literally like ants”, he observes with a kind of childlike glee. And what are we, his viewers, if not ants ourselves, our swarming densities governed by unseen algorithms?That childlike aspect of Donaldson’s whole operation turns out to be central. It is simultaneously the thing that makes him most unsettling, and the thing that makes him sort of impossible to dislike. When I say that I think he is some kind of genius, I’m partly talking about this quality of childishness to his work. I’m thinking, that is, of something Baudelaire once wrote: that “genius is nothing more nor less than childhood recovered at will – a childhood now equipped for self-expression with manhood’s capacities and a power of analysis which enables it to order the mass of raw material which it has involuntarily accumulated”.Donaldson – who is still, let’s remember, only 27 years old – has become upsettingly rich and successful by doing this one particular thing that he started doing at the age of 13. He started making YouTube videos as a little boy, and he never wanted to do anything else. “When I was 11,” as he put itduring a recent interview, “I just said, ‘I’m going to be a YouTuber or I’m going to die trying.’” In the years since, he has done nothing but pursue that 11-year-old’s dream, with insanely lucrative results. His entire career – by which I mean not just the YouTube videos and TV shows, but also the chocolate bars and the energy drinks and the hamburgers and the ready-made kids’ lunches and even the philanthropic endeavours – amounts to an integrated multi-platform work of content, a kind of WagnerianGesamtkunstwerkas conceived by a preteen boy.Just as to count to 100,000 is to pursue a supremely childish impulse with a demented determination, the more elaborately and expensively produced content Donaldson has made in recent years arises out of a similarly childish curiosity. What would it be like to be buried alive? How weird would it be to eat the world’s largest pizza slice? What would happen if you put a Lamborghini in a gigantic hydraulic press? Would you sit in a bathtub full of snakes if I gave your mom $10,000? What if I filled my brother’s house with slime? What if I got a cereal bowl the size of a Jacuzzi and filled it with Fruit Loops and milk? Would you rather be trapped in the world’s coldest room or the world’s hottest room? If you have ever spent any time in the company of an 11-year-old boy, you will recognise the cast of mind that continually throws up such questions.View image in fullscreenA still ffrom MrBeast’s 2021 video I Spent 50 Hours Buried Alive.Photograph: YouTubeAt the level of form, he is no great innovator: he simply understands what works, and repeats it more and more successfully and expensively. Beast Games, for instance, is a revisiting of, and expansion of, his wildly successful video $456,000 Squid Game in Real Life!, which is itself so thoroughly “inspired” by the wildly successful Korean Netflix show of that title as to flirt with copyright infringement. Squid Game itself is hardly original, drawing heavily as it does on Battle Royale and The Hunger Games. And all of the above, of course, are outcroppings of reality TV, perhaps the most significant mass-entertainment form of the last 30 years, a form that birthed not just YouTubers like MrBeast, but also the US president and therefore, arguably, the present global political order.Last year, a 36-page onboarding document entitled How to Succeed at MrBeast Production was leaked by one of the company’s employees, who now number in the hundreds, and who are mostly based in its 63,000 sq ft HQ in Greenville, NC. The document is written in the sloppily demotic mode of the videos’ narration, and is clearly the work of Donaldson himself. He is keen to get across that virality is not some freak occurrence, but a craft that can be mastered, and taught. “I spent five years of my life locked in a room studying virality on YouTube,” he writes. “And the result of those probably 20,000 to 30,000 hours of studying is I’d say I have a good grasp on what makes YouTube videos do well.”Which is not to say that the MrBeast formula is easy to replicate. There are numerous off-brand MrBeasts out there on YouTube. You’ve got the Dangie Bros, Matthew Beem, the Stokes Twins, Eric “Airrack” Decker, and Morgan “Morgs” Hudson, along with countless purveyors of the sort of elaborate and expensive stunts – turning houses into fish tanks, building theme parks inside houses, and so on and so forth – known in the biz as “junklord” content. But they all conspicuously lack both Donaldson’s peculiar charm and his intricate mastery of form.When you watch a MrBeast video, you are watching the result of a deep and meticulous engagement with YouTube’s audience-retention data. “The cool thing about YouTube,” as Donaldson writes in the memo, “is they give us super-detailed graphs for every video that show the exact second we lose a viewer.” The first minute is typically where the majority of viewer loss happens, and this is why, in the opening seconds of a MrBeast video, you feel as though someone has filled your skull with popping candy and is beating you about the head and face with a foam bat.View image in fullscreenJimmy Donaldson hosts his $10,000 Every Day You Survive in a Grocery Store challenge in 2023.Photograph: Business Wire/APThe first minute, in other words, is all about hype, the point of which is to ensure that the viewer makes it through that statistically perilous stretch of the clip. There are no slow builds. Everything you see in a MrBeast video is about preventing you from clicking away. His work reflects and intensifies what the internet has done to culture more generally, and to our brains. If boredom, as Walter Benjamin wrote, is “the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience” – if boredom is a crucial spur to activity, to the capacity to surprise oneself with one’s thoughts and impulses – then one consequence of the last decade or so of technological and cultural change has been the total destruction of that dream bird’s natural habitat, cleared for the strip-mining of the dopamine that drives the attention economy.Donaldson’s forays into philanthropy – or philanthropy-themed YouTube content – have, in recent years, caused sporadic outbreaks of public controversy. The earliest of these was called Giving a Random Homeless Man $10,000: a simple video, featuring none of the hallmark hyperactive editing or blaring narration. Donaldson just walks up to a homeless man in Greenville, and gives him an envelope containing $10,000. The video was not a massive success by MrBeast standards, but it got a strong enough positive reaction to suggest that using the channel’s earnings to give away large sums of money was a way of both doing something positive and producing more – and more lucrative – content.There followed a series of videos in which Donaldson enacted vaguely absurdist forms of philanthropy – picking up an Uber customer in a brand new Lamborghini, say, and then just giving it to him. Despite the slightly troubling way in which they made a spectacle of entirely arbitrary largesse – of Donaldson himself as part gameshow host, part trickster god, indulging in a little light wealth redistribution for the folks at home – the videos were hard to dislike. They were hard to dislike for the same reason Donaldson himself is hard to dislike: they were driven by a childlike, ungainly benevolence.In 2023, this run of philanthropic content culminated in a video entitled 1,000 Blind People See for the First Time, in which Donaldson paid for 1,000 people to be given a very straightforward medical treatment curing them of severe visual impairment. The video wasn’t controversial because Donaldson paid no attention to the structural injustice of these people not having been provided with this basic procedure by their government (the video makes clear that blind people from all over the world were cured, though it focuses pretty much exclusively on Americans). The controversy centred almost entirely around the way in which the curing of 1,000 blind people was approached as raw material for light entertainment.The thing I personally find most troubling about the video is the jarring opposition of its style and content. The whole thing is characterised by a manic, attention-hustling showmanship, and a refusal to grant viewers a moment’s respite in which we might contemplate the experience of the cured or the wider social implications. As with something like I Survived the 5 Deadliest Places on Earth, it bypasses any kind of narrative setup and goes straight for the emotional payoff. We learn almost nothing about any of the people whose blindness is cured, other than that they once were blind but now they see. We can be confident that they are poor – why else would their condition have remained untreated? – but we are left to intuit this. In most cases, we are not even given their names.Of course, there are only so many formerly blind people you can watch being given the gift of sight before it starts getting a little samey. But Donaldson has, of course, anticipated this problem, and the video keeps your dopamine transmitters operating at full capacity. Moments after the bandages have been removed from one woman’s face, the first sight she is met with is Donaldson standing before her in surgical scrubs, presenting her with an open briefcase containing $10,000. Another patient, who we learn had to leave his job as a cashier because he couldn’t see the money he was handling, has his bandages removed, and is told to read an eye chart; it says “YOU JUST WON $10,000”.At the bottom of the screen, there is a counter that flips upward with the rising number of cured. It is, essentially, a score counter, as though Donaldson were keeping track of the points he’s racking up in a video game. And this seems to me to gesture towards what is troubling about the 1,000 Blind People video in particular, and Donaldson’s project more generally: the way in which his content treats people – contestants in his competitions, beneficiaries of his philanthropy – as mere elements in a larger game he is playing, the object of which is maximum viewer-stimulation, maximum attention, maximum numbers. “At their core, the premise of most MrBeast videos is that numbers with lots of zeros are impressive,” as the US writer Max Readput it in an excellent essayexploring the controversy around the blindness video. “One blind person seeing for the first time isn’t cool. You know what’s cool? One thousand blind people seeing for the first time.”‘A managerial Mephistopheles’: inside the mind of Jeff BezosRead moreDonaldson’s acts of charity are bestowed, randomly, upon people who are themselves explicitly presented as “random”; their lurid arbitrariness illuminates the arbitrariness of charity per se. (Just £1 could cure this child of this condition; but why this child, in this place, and why this condition?) As far as he’s come from posting Minecraft playthroughs, consuming his work still feels, in some sense, like watching a guy play video games. Even the videos in which he himself is not a central protagonist, where huge numbers of people compete against each other for even huger amounts of money, it’s as though Donaldson is designing and playing some kind of strategy game. He constructs a world, and a set of rules to govern it; he populates it with semi-autonomous people – mostly anonymous and interchangeable – and watches the unfolding consequences of their moral and strategic choices.Donaldson is not himself a political figure. He doesn’t tend to weigh in on party-political questions, or express much interest in them. But there is a politics to his content. It reflects a world in which people are isolated and helpless, subjects of vast and inhuman economic mechanisms. People spending months alone in supermarkets; standing in large circles for as long as they can endure it; competing for private islands, houses, deliverance from their personal financial torments. People in states of gruelling seclusion; people in vast and impersonal crowds, pitted against one another in a Hobbesian gameshow of all against all.Loneliness, survival, isolation, and the divine intervention of an unimaginably wealthy and famous man: there is a politics to all this, all right, and it is the politics of our time. In its themes and preoccupations, its insistent motifs of financial precarity and arbitrary deliverance – its Lamborghinis and its private islands and its vast pyramids of cash – the oeuvre of MrBeast is like nothing so much as the dream of an entire culture. Donaldson might not be the genius we need, or the genius we want, but he may be the genius we deserve.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readYouTubeInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Who could have foretold that the hero of the PlayStation launch would be a fireworks simulation (Fantavision), or that the most joyous title in the initial GameCube lineup would involve simians racing each other in giant transparent globes (Super Monkey Ball)?The latest example could well be Konami’s Survival Kids, the only new third-party game in the Switch 2 opening wave. It’s the latest in the publisher’s cult series of tropical island survival sims, which began on the Game Boy Color and, despite never really attracting vast global success, continued on to theNintendoDS under a new name, Lost in Blue. Now it’s back as a familyfriendly co-op survival adventure, in which groups of up to four players are shipwrecked on a mysterious archipelago, and must survive by gathering resources, crafting tools, finding food and exploring a series of lush, cartoonish environments. Four people can play online, but the game also supports Switch 2’s game sharing, which lets one person who owns the game connect wirelessly with other consoles to play together.View image in fullscreenLush, cartoonish environments … a still from Survival Kids.Photograph: Konami Digital EntertainmentAndrew Dennison, who heads the game’s developer Unity, sees this as one of the Switch 2’s key features. “With splitscreen you have one machine rendering two different versions of the game,” he says. “With GameShare, we can compress one of those views and stream it … we render everything three times and push that out to two other consoles. As much as you can deep dive into tech specs, the benefits of GameShare are delightful. Other players in the same room as you don’t have to own the game, they don’t have to download anything … they can just turn on their Switch or Switch 2, push a button and they’re playing a game.”Unlike survival titles such as Don’t Starve or Project Zomboid (or indeed Lost in Blue), there’s no mortal peril in Survival Kids. Running out of food hampers your progress, but you can’t actually starve; if you die, you just – respawn nearby. “We wanted to make sure the game was enjoyable for people at every skill level,” says Dennison. “It’s a balancing act – we don’t want to bore experienced gamers – but you can streamline gameplay challenge without simplifying to the point of making it irrelevant.” Due to the strict NDAs around the Switch 2 hardware, the developer couldn’t bring in many external testers to fine-tune the difficulty – so Dennison ended up testing the game on his nieces, and on the finance department.View image in fullscreenAll about co-operation … Survival KidsPhotograph: Konami Digital EntertainmentBuilding tools is key – combine a vine and a stick and you get a fishing rod with which to lasso useful objects. Construct an umbrella and you can glide across wide canyons. There are no cumbersome item-inventory screens: when you need to build a tool or contraption, you can take what you need and drop it all into a bucket that magically spits it out. Tools are all stored at base camp, not in a menu, so that you can easily take a path home to pick up what you need.As with Overcooked, Survival Kids is all about streamlined cooperation and carefully divvied-out tasks. Chopping wood and breaking rocks is faster with two people, so you need a physical labour team; meanwhile food provides the energy needed to climb cliff faces and carry heavy relics, so you’ll need a chef to gather plants and make dinner. “We really wanted people to go back and eat at the base camp together,” says Richard Jones, creative director for Konami Digital Entertainment. “This way, the base camp becomes a place to return to – a sort of communal kitchen.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s also possible to go back and re-try levels to get a quicker time. Despite the family look and feel, there are some interesting and quite demanding physics-based challenges with multiple solutions. There’s a nice humour and lightness to the game as well, perhaps an inevitability considering that Dennison and many of the development team at Unity’s Stratford-upon-Avon office came from Codemasters and Rare.Will Konami bring more of its classic titles to Switch 2? “We know there are other Konami teams who are interested in this platform – we’ll be able to help them,” says Jones. “So yeah, fingers-crossed we’ll see some more Switch 2 projects from Konami.” For now Survival kids feels like a great test case for the new console’s family oriented game sharing.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendoNintendo SwitchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The third time this year that Jewish people were attacked with murderous intent in a major US city under the guise of the assailant caring about the plight of the Palestinians inGaza. It’s the second time that fires were set. The first happened when an attacker – a US citizen – broke into the official residence of Pennsylvania’s governor in Harrisburg, on the evening of Passover and set fire to the residence. The only thing that saved governor Josh Shapiro and his family was a quick response from security guards, leaving only some Passover Haggadahs, the text that charts Jewish hopes for freedom and liberation from one generation to the next, to burn on the tables still set from dinner.About two weeks ago, there was the murder of two innocent Jewish Israeli embassy workers who were attending an event hosted by the The American Jewish Committee at the Jewish Museum in Washington DC on how to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza; these young people were chosen at random from a crowd apparently targeted intentionally since the murderer, again a US citizen, appeared to have wanted to hunt down and kill Jews in response to Israel – a sovereign country’s – military acts. Tellingly, the gunman had a brief association to the far-left Party of Socialism and Liberation (PSL said in astatementthat he is not a member and that his association with the group ended in 2017).And now, again with the element of fire, we wait for word on the condition ofat least 12 victimsof a torching in broad daylight in downtown Boulder, Colorado, by an assailant namedMohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national, who yelled “Free Palestine” and scorched the skin of activists ranging from their 50s to the 80s whogathered peacefully in that squareeach week demanding one thing: bring the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas home.This group of activists, part of the international movement that posts on Twitter/X as #RunForTheirLives walks and runs each week, in Boulder, in New York’s Central Park, in Mexico and around the world, in support of freeing the hostages. They also post this missive for participants, beginning by asking: “Should I be scared to participate?” Their response: “That’s a valid concern these days. Make your best judgment to decide if it’s safe. However, we encourage a couple of principles to make this safer: don’t protest! Don’t disturb your neighbors. Do it quietly and don’t block roads. Be polite and peaceful. Focus on humanity. This is about innocent children, women, the elderly, and other civilians being held by terrorists – not about the war. We encourage carrying flags of all countries from which there are hostages.”Why is a pro-Israel group asking the US to investigate Ms Rachel?Read moreThey encouraged bringing kids. “This is a family-friendly event. It is non-violent and does not focus on the traumatic events that occurred during the hostages’ captivity. Our events are meant to be quiet and peaceful.”Jews demonstrating in an open town square were burned solely because they are Jews. It’s way past time; there needs to be a real and deep understanding of how ugly some factions of the US left became, both pre and post 7 October’s attack by Hamas, with a delegitimizing ideology about “settler colonialism” the wishful erasure ofIsraelas a state by proclaiming support for a future Palestine in a region where some protesters hope to annihilate Israel, silencing of Israeli and Jewish voices even when they are voices of protest against Benjamin Netanyahu’s government or even if the assailant has no idea what the victim’s position is on Israeli policies. This desire for erasure opened the floodgates to those who think they are being one of the team by killing with a slogan as their battle cry.This is not about parsing legalisms of whether it is a legitimate protest to harm or kill civilians. It isn’t. Full stop. (And, I have said and written the same thing regarding Palestinian civilians being killed and will continue to write and protest any innocent civilians being killed. I also reject any attempts by any person or group or government to blame all Palestinians for Hamas’s actions. Also, perhaps it needs to be said here and time again: I fully support, and have spent my life fighting for, freedom and self-determination for the Palestinian people, acknowledging the rights of two people to one plot of land).One of the first things I did after 7 October was to purchase and wear a Jewish star around my neck. In my 69 years, I had never worn my religion or my identity on my person. But since 7 October, perhaps defying the odds – but more so, wearing my pride, I purchased a star which I wear proudly. In solidarity with those in Israel and around the world who are demanding that the Israeli hostages come home, I also wear a yellow ribbon affixed to my bag whenever I leave my home. It is perhaps the sort of symbol that is an “if you know, you know,” but I want the world to know two things: this is not OK, and no one will scare me off because of my Jewish identity or my support for an end to the poisonous Hamas’s incursion of 7 October.I intensely hope this is obvious: you can oppose policies without setting people on fire because they are Jewish. The majority of US Jews overwhelmingly oppose the Israeli prime minister’s policies. But subtleties get lost and truly unleashed people react. The leftwing reaction to an horrific action like this has to be swift and soul-searching. Again, while this current perpetrator apparently has no ties to the left, the rhetoric of the left – and the actions of some leftwing organizations – have to be examined. Imagine a situation where there was in fact an American left that embraced peace efforts on both sides instead of demonizing one side or the other, which is by the way, a mirror image of what the right wing does. Two sides. Two peoples.I write this as someone whose entire life has been lived on the left, as a prominent activist and one who continues to believe in my gut in the values of a humanitarian left. I won’t allow a very real fear to stop me – not to stop me from being a proud Jew or an outspoken leftist demanding my rightful place in the lexicon of what must be an inclusive movement promoting humanity for all and freedom for all. No erasures. No exceptions.Meanwhile, it’s important to also call out the sickening and cynical usage of antisemitism on the right by Donald Trump and his allies. The US president is handily and cynically already using the Boulder attack to attack all immigrants and to promote his heartless expulsion agenda with barely a mention of the victims of the crime. He has used antisemitism throughout his term in the most cynical of ways, never showing any genuine interest in eradicating it or embracing the victims. He pretty much ignored the heinous attack on Shapiro, most likely because Shapiro is a vocal and effective opponent of Trump. And, of course, Trump’s Darth Vader imitator Stephen Miller is hard at work using these crimes to promote his anti-American agenda to attack immigrants in the US as well as attack universities and legitimate protest. Trump’s destructive weaponizing of antisemitism to promote his own authoritarian agenda will not keep one Jew safe: in fact, it does the opposite.Jews don’t want to be played by the left or the right. We don’t want to be pawns tossed back and forth. We want to be safe. We want to be heard. We want to be seen in our diversity, as would any people. We don’t want our lives to be at risk. Listen to and watch what each person says. See each person as an individual. Please build a serious political program that doesn’t cancel or promote violence of any kind but rather lifts up the hopes and desires of everyone. The alternative is deadly.Jo-Ann Mort is co-author of Our Hearts Invented a Place: Can Kibbutzim Survive in Today’s Israel?

Poland’s new head of state will beKarol Nawrocki, a conservative historian endorsed byDonald Trump. Mr Nawrocki’s improbable rise – from relative obscurity to the presidency – signals the unfortunate entrenchment of nationalist grievance in Polish politics.He now stands poised to paralyse Mr Tusk’s agenda and perhaps derail Polish access toEuropeanfunds – using his presidential power of veto to block government legislation or simply relying on the influence of the conservative constitutional court. Key reforms –judicial overhaul, civil partnerships and abortion rights– are off the table. For a country that once dreamed of anchoring the EU’s eastern flank, it is a backward lurch.Mr Tusk’s government is a coalition born out of a determination to oust the nationalist-conservative Law and Justice party (PiS), which gained full control of government in 2015 and implemented sweeping changes to the judiciary, media andeducation. Clashes with Brussels overrule-of-law concernswere a feature of its time in office. However, Mr Tusk’s ideologically diverse alliance is fraying under the weight of its own contradictions. Bound more by opposition to the previous regime than a cohesive vision, the coalition hasstumbled, hindered by internal conflict between agrarian conservatives and urban progressives. It had hoped its liberalcandidatecould break the deadlock.As a historian, Mr Nawrocki will be familiar with PiS’s winning strategy. This mixes reactionary populism with a cultural reprogramming that seeks to rewrite Poland’s recent past to polarise opinion. The party aims to renarrate the country’s history with controversial interpretations of Poland’s role in theHolocaust, “decommunisation” and a left-soundingcritiqueof post-1989 economic liberalism.Mr Nawrockitriumphedby tapping conservative, rural and anti-elite sentiment, but also by posing as an outsider. A political novice and former head of a state historical institute, he carried no party baggage and could disavow past PiS failings while vowing to block Mr Tusk at every turn. His blend of historical populism andEuroscepticismstruck a chord in a Poland still wrestling with its past and wary of Brussels. Meanwhile, Mr Tusk’s popularity is eroding and his authority is weakening: the left calls him ineffective, the right accuses him of betrayal. His hope that voters would tolerate paralysis for the sake of stability has proven misplaced. With President Nawrocki in office until 2030, key reforms are blocked and a second term in 2027 looks unlikely. A resurgent PiS and rising far-rightConfederationthreaten to consolidate an illiberal majority.Mr Tusk may pursue secondary legislation to get his way. He is calling his allies’ bluff with aconfidence vote. However, unless the coalition proves it can govern, disillusionment will deepen. Poland’s economic success – rooted in EU funds, German supply chains and monetary sovereignty – has produced a paradoxical politics. AsJarosław Kuiszobserves in The New Politics of Poland, PiS took Brussels’ money while scorning its values. Mr Tusk must defend democracy not just with words but with outcomes. If pro-European governments cannot deliver tangible change, voters will fall for the empty authoritarian promises of certainty. To defeat the populist right, Europeans must prove that democracy works – not just in principle, but in people’s lives.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When will they take real action?Norman SolomonCountless Americans want the party leadership to stand up for democracy. Instead, the executive committee remains in a bubbleTue 3 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 12.56 EDTSharePeople with the power to change the direction of the Democratic party – the executive committee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) – met last Friday for the first time in five months.They took no action.The party’sbylawsmake the executive committee “responsible for the conduct of the affairs of the Democratic party” between the meetings of the full committee, which isn’t scheduled to gather until late August. But taking responsibility wasn’t on the agenda. Instead, committee members and staff kept praising each other and committee leaders. Many talked about improving the party’s infrastructure and vowed to defeat Republicans. Deliberation, proposals and debate were completely absent. So was a sense of urgency.After so many months without a meeting, you might think that the executive committee would have a lot to talk about. But it was scheduled to meet for only three hours, which turned out to be more than adequate for what anyone had to say. The committee adjourned after an hour and a half.If obscurity was a goal forthe national meeting, held in Little Rock, Arkansas, it was a success. The DNC’s website didn’t mention the meeting. Media coverage was close to nonexistent.The committee leadership remains largely within a bubble insulated from the anger and disgust – toward the party – that is widespread among countlessDemocratsand other Americans. They want the Democratic party to really put up a fight, while its leaders mainly talk about putting up a fight. The Trump regime is setting basic structures of democracy on fire, while Democratic leaders don’t seem to be doing much more than wielding squirt guns.A week ago, the new chair, Ken Martin, received apetitioncalling for an emergency meeting of the full 448-member committee. The petition, co-sponsored by Progressive Democrats of America and RootsAction (where I’m national director), includes more than 1,500 individual comments. They’re often filled with anguish and rage.The California representative Ro Khanna has joined in the call for an emergency committee meeting. “I’ve supported it, I’ve spoken directly to our chair, Ken Martin, about it,” Khannasaidlast week. “Look, what’s going on is chilling … They’re banning all international students from coming to Harvard. I mean, think about that – all foreign students banned. They could do this in other universities. They have fired, or let go of, seven of the 18 directors at the NIH, totally dismantling future medical research in our country. They have dismantled the FDA, firing people who approve new drugs. They are systematically firing people at the FAA … They’re openly talking about defying United States supreme court orders, [JD] Vance has saidjust defy the orders. They’re calling universities ‘the enemy’. This is very chilling.”Khanna then zeroed in on a crucial point that party leaders have so far refused to acknowledge, much less heed: “It’s not enough for us to have individual responses. I’m out there doing my town halls in red districts, Bernie [Sanders] is inspiring the country with his oligarchy tour, but they’re all individual efforts. We needconcertedeffort, we need a battle plan. And that’s what an emergency DNC meeting would do – it would acknowledge the stakes, and it would say ‘here is our plan’ – to make sure that they’re not degrading and chipping away at every institution of American democracy.”Democrats are failing against Trump. We need a new generation in 2026 | Alexandra RojasRead moreRefusal to call an emergency meeting is a marker of deeper problems, with Democratic party leadership remaining in a political rut – spouting mildly liberal rhetoric while serving the interests of big donors, high-paid consultants and entrenched power brokers. Along the way, such business as usual is a gift that keeps on giving power to the pseudo-populist messages of Maga Republican politicians, who don’t have to go up against genuine progressive populism at election time. No wonder the Democratic party has lost most of the working-class vote.With no Democrat in the White House, the DNC chair is powerful. To his credit, Martin talks articulately about the need to “democratize this party”. Four months into the job previously held by Jaime Harrison, who was Joe Biden’s obedient appointee, Martin is clearly an improvement. How much of an improvement is unclear.After the DNC’s executive committee adjourned, Martin provided a glimmer of hope for ending the chokehold that mega-funders,notably Aipac, have exerted on recent primary campaigns. He was interviewed by my colleague Sam Rosenthal, covering the event forProgressive Huband apparently the only journalist based outside of Arkansas to make the trek to Little Rock. In response to a question about whether he would “like to see less influence from dark money, removing the influence especially in Democratic party primaries”, Martinsaid: “Yes. In fact, I’ll be bringing forward a resolution on that, and I will be pushing hard for our party to come up with solutions on this so that we actually have our candidates and campaigns realize that we have to live our values; we can’t just say we want dark money out of politics and then have candidates and their campaigns accepting all types of support from these shadow groups. We actually need to reverse course.”That reply might indicate that Martin is now willing to move away from the position that he took while running for DNC chair in January, when hesaid: “There are a lot of good billionaires out there that have been with Democrats who share our values and we will take their money, but we’re not taking money from those bad billionaires.”With June under way, the Democratic party is no closer to operating with urgency to vigorously oppose the daily Trump attacks on basic rights, the rule of law, and the economic interests of most Americans. The party’s terribleapproval ratingsin polls – withdisdainfor its congressional leaders – make the need for drastic changes in the party all too clear.But when the DNC and allied party organizations do outreach urging people to “get involved”, routinely the only involvement urged or offered is to give money. It’s a formulaic approach that reveals just how little the national party is really seeking participatory democracy.Millions of usual (and all-too-often former) Democratic voters see party leaders as asleep at the switch, while the Trump regime is hard at work enriching the already rich and demolishing structures of democracy. As usual, if genuine change for the better is going to come, it won’t be handed down from on high. People at the grassroots will have to fight for it.Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

Is it possible that we have arrived at a moment, a mere four months into his second term, when the president’s capacity to do harm is diminishing?That is undeniably a provocative question. Like any US president,Donald Trumpremains immensely powerful. It is early days; he can still cause plenty of damage – and certainly will.But after an initial flurry of activity when the opposition often seemed deer-in-the-headlights stunned, Trump’s power to daze and paralyze may now be on a downward trajectory. Recognizing that possible shift is important to embolden resistance to his dangerous, would-be autocratic rule.Trump’s notorious flood-the-zone strategy was initially effective. Before opposition could be mobilized to one outrage, there was another. Entire government agencies wereorderedshut. Government employees weredispatchedby the tens of thousands.Healthcare,scientific and medical research,foreign aid, government-fundedindependent media, the quest for a moreequitablesociety were all stopped or stymied.Many of Trump’s actions followed the classic autocrat’splaybookas he deliberately attacked the checks and balances on his power. Republicans in Congress, prioritizing their own political future over the welfare of the nation, toed the line forfearof aprimarychallenge. Judges who ruled against him were subjected tointimidationand threats ofimpeachment. Law firms that sued him, or pursued cases he disliked, facedretaliation. Business leaderssidledup to him hoping to curry favor and avoid retaliation. Some journalists who criticized him were met withdefamationsuits orrestrictionsat White House briefings. Universities, as centers of independent thought, saw draconian funding cuts. Plansproceededto remove the tax-exempt status of some private foundations and civic groups.Trump made a mark in his first few months in part because the brazenness and velocity of his actions encouraged a save-yourself mentality among many targets. Somelaw firms,universitiesandmedia outletsstruck deals with him, hoping to protect themselves at the expense of the rule of law, academic freedom or freedom of the media.Yet over time, the resistance regrouped. More than180judges have ruled against some element of Trump’s program, from his summary dismissal of government employees to his efforts to deport immigrants without due process.The courts were undoubtedly emboldened by Trump’s tendency to overreach. His senior aides and officials, often chosen forloyaltyover competence, have shown little inclination to rein him in. The blatant unconstitutionality of Trump’s resulting actions – rejecting birthright citizenship despite its constitutional foundation, using the power of the government to retaliate against critics despite the first amendment – seem to have encouraged judges to abandon any presumptive deference to executive good faith. Manyconservative lawyersare turning on him.Because of Trump’s excesses, many of the setbacks have come even in the arena that was thought to be his strongest – immigration. The summary deportations of Venezuelan men to El Salvador’s nightmarish mega-prison, under the pretext of a nonexistent “war”, have beenstopped. The Tufts Universitystudentthreatened with deportation evidently because she co-authored an op-ed in a student newspaper that criticized Israel has been freed. So haveotherforeign students detained for similar pro-Palestinian views.The former Columbia student and green card holder who led student protests against Israel is still incustody, but his case has highlighted the Trump administration’sabsurd claim, needed to circumvent first amendment protection of non-citizens on US soil, that his actions undermined US foreign policy. About half of Americans believe his deportations have “gone too far”.Trump’s disdain for the rule of law – hisdisparagingof judges who ruled against him, hisrefusalto conscientiously abide by judicial rulings – seems to have accomplished a remarkable transformation in the US supreme court, from a presumptive 6-3 majority in Trump’s favor to one that on occasion will rule against him, such as itspronouncementthat immigrants cannot be deported without due process.Many of the lower-court rulings are preliminary rather than decisions on the merits. Most are subject to appeal, and some have been reversed. But they have stymied many Trump initiatives. He haslostmomentum.Harvard, after unsuccessfully trying toplacateTrump, responded to ensuing over-the-topdemandsbysuinghis administration. Seemingly recognizing that they had overplayed, Trump officials reportedlysoughta settlement, evidently hoping to avoid an adverse judicial precedent, as has nowoccurredin several suits brought by law firms challenging unconstitutional retaliation against them. Trump has upped the ante against Harvard with hugecutsin government funding and athreatto its tax-exempt status, but the courts have at least temporarilystoppedhis effort to bar the university from enrolling foreign students.Harvard’s belated, yet important, leadership – a stark contrast with Columbia’s unsuccessfulappeasement– has galvanized other universities toward acollective defense.Law firms also have begun toband together, although many of thebiggest onesstill seem more concerned with preserving their considerable incomes than upholding their professional obligation to defend the rule of law. Private foundations are nowconsultingabout how best to deter threats to their tax-exempt status.Although public protests have been fewer than during Trump’s first presidential term, his public approval hasplummeted. Elon Musk, once seemingly omnipresent as a Trump hatchet man, hasretreatedas people turn onTeslaand his other companies.Trump’s foreign policy, a domain where presidential latitude is broad, has done no better at forcing acquiescence. Trump’s erratic and arbitrary tariff policies have managed to shake consumerconfidenceand threateninflationwhileslowingthe economy and panicking thebond market.Trump’s instinct to trust Putin not to use a ceasefire to rearm and reinvade Ukraine has run aground on Putin’s persistentmaximalistdemands. Contrary to Trump’s real-estate instincts, Putin’s aim is not gaining a chunk of territory in eastern Ukraine but crushing its democracy so it will no longer serve as a model for Russians. That has led Trump, evidently more comfortable putting pressure on Ukrainian victims than his autocratic buddy in the Kremlin, todisengagefrom his mediating role. He hascriticizedPutin for continuing to bomb Ukrainian cities while imposing no consequences and refusing toauthorizenew US arms for Ukraine.Trump’s initial proposal for ending the war in Gaza – “solving” the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by expelling the Palestinians – was eagerlytaken upby the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, but stymied by the plan’s blatantcriminalityand therefusalof even aid-dependent Egypt and Jordan to go along. Even Trump has come torecognizethat Netanyahu is now the main obstacle to peace because of hisdeterminationto continue the war topreservehis far-right governing coalition and avoid prison on pendingcorruptioncharges.Successful resistance in places like Brazil and Poland provide Americans with certain lessons that they seem to be learning:Trump’s attacks on the restraints on his power should be viewed not in isolation, but as part of a deliberate scheme to build an autocracy. Each step matters. He is attacking not just big law or Ivy League universities but democracy.Early opposition is important because resistance becomes harder over time as checks on presidential authority weaken.The temptation to save one’s own skin should be resisted because it plays into the autocratic strategy of divide-and-conquer. A collective defense works best.Appeasement may seem like a way to calm the bully, but bullies see it as weakness, an invitation todemand more.These lessons will be important because Trump will inevitably issue new executive orders designed to advance his agenda and provoke opposition despair.Project 2025, his unacknowledged guidebook, had about 900 pages of ideas. He undoubtedly will concoct new “emergencies” tojustifyextraordinary powers, having already declaredeight. He could even spark a constitutional crisis by openly flouting a judicial order – a possibility thatJD Vancehas advanced.But the deluge of wild ideas – invading Greenland, renaming the Gulf of Mexico, making Canada the 51st state – are losing their shock value, whether as assertions of executive power or diversions from Trump’s limited actual accomplishments. And Trump’s seeming belief that he can spin reality through endless repetition of falsehoods is bumping up against significant parts of the media that continue to spotlight facts and the public’s refusal to accept imposition of a post-truth world.Trump can still cause significant damage by legislation, such as threatened limits to Medicaid and food stamps, reaffirmation of Musk’s slash-and-burn budgetary cuts, or largetaxeson university endowments, but that route is more difficult than signing an executive order. The Republicans’ razor-thin congressional majority requires either holding together virtually the entire Republican caucus despite its limited but real ideological diversity or reaching out to Democrats who so far have maintained a united front of opposition. Both will, to some extent, be moderating influences.And it won’t be long before Republican attention turns from legislation to the threat of an electoral drubbing in the 2026midtermelections, hints of which were already apparent in theelectionof a Democratic Wisconsin supreme court justice and thediminishedvotes to fill two safe Republican seats in Congress.I recognize it may be foolhardy to pronounce peak Trump. The president will never cease to amaze with his disdain for decency and democracy. But something real has happened in the time since he returned to the White House. The checks and balances of US democracy have proved remarkably resilient. The shock and awe of his early days has given way to a grinding of gears, a political program that, because of widespread resistance, is becoming more sound than fury.This is no time for despair. Resignation is wrong. Resistance is working. We must keep it up.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

Why so harsh? Because protest worksIndigo RumbelowThe judge wanted us to show remorse, but I can’t apologise for fighting the climate disasterTue 3 Jun 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 12.41 EDTShareLast week, at Minshull Street crown court in Manchester, I was sentenced to two and half years in prison for conspiring to intentionally cause a public nuisance. The prosecution’s case was that I intended to “obstruct the public or a section of the public in the exercise or enjoyment of a right that may be exercised or enjoyed by the public at large” – in other words, that I was part of Just Stop Oil’s plan to obstruct planes at Manchester airport. I did intend that – and I have a defence for my actions.The offence of public nuisance – which falls under the Criminal Law Act 1977 and the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 – was traditionally and frequently usedto prosecute significant environmental offences. It punished big corporations causing real harm to the general public by poisoning water, polluting air,emitting dust and noiseor dumping chemical waste. There is no irony lost in the fact that the same offence in statutory form is now being zealously deployed to prosecute environmental protesters.After spending nine months in prison on remand, my stomach was tied in knots but my head was held high as I climbed the steep, gloomy concrete steps from the court cells into the glass dock, which stands in the centre of the imposing Victorian gothic courtroom in Manchester. At last I was due tofind out my sentence. At the end of the long ruling our fate was made clear: Leanorah Ward, Margaret Reid, Daniel Knorr and I were given 18 months, 18 months, 24 months and 30 months respectively. I was taken back to prison, where I remain, with time left to serve.Make no mistake, this sentence was passed because nonviolent resistance has the potential to spark revolutionary change. The judge, Jason MacAdam, deemed it necessary to hand down “deterrent” sentences in order to inspire fear in others considering similar actions. There was much in the judgment that I disagree with, but I do agree withthe judge’s assertionthat I considered “the cause to trump inconvenience to others whether that be the general public at Manchester airport or other court users”.The climate crisis is notourcause; it’s a matter of life or death for everyone. We set out to disrupt the planes atManchesterairport because history shows that resistance can be a catalyst for change, and science shows that we need to change our destructive way of life now to prevent disaster. When we were arrested on the way to airport, we had a banner in our pockets that said “Oil Kills”. When we were sentenced in court we each raised signs saying, “Billions will die”. The science is clear, and the judge is right: I consider the facts to be so alarming, so stark, so utterly heartbreaking that disruption to everyday life is warranted. AndI have spent each day in custody, questioning why others equipped with the same knowledge as I have do not feel the duty to act in the same way that I do.The judge agreed that we acted on our conscience, but for sentencing he wanted to see remorse. But how can it be possible to take part in an act of conscience and then show remorse? How could I be morally compelled to take action one week, and then filled with regret for acting the next? I took action to disrupt the status quo, as I believed that carrying on as normal meant complicity in many unnecessary deaths. I pleaded not guilty and chose to defend my actions in court because I wanted to present the case that I was acting out of necessity to prevent harm. But this defence was ruled out.The judge stated that “the stance taken by you [by pleading not guilty] distinguishes you all from others who have chosen to follow the long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience on conscientious grounds, that is accepting that you have broken the law and accepting the punishment that follows”. In doing this he not only disregarded the 1670 trial of Penn and Mead (where Quakers pleaded not guilty to unlawful assembly), the Ploughshare Four trial (where peace activists defended themselves by arguing that they acted to prevent harm), and the Rivonia trial of Nelson Mandela (who defended himself against conspiracy charges brought by the apartheid South African government). They all pleaded not guilty.He also denies the very essence of the tradition of protest: its ability to evolve and adapt to different contexts in order to find the confrontational edge essential to nonviolent action. Just Stop Oil is not a re-enactment group, it is an action group, which has taken a strategic decision to continue resistance into the courtroom. By asserting the necessity for our actions, we include the legal system in the debate over our duty and responsibilities.Later in the judgment, MacAdam appeared to reveal outright contempt for those in resistance, as he mused “how wrong it is in a free and democratic society to consider that your own belief in the worthiness of a cause to be justification for breaking the law”. As if centuries of political and social struggle had never taken place, as if the current “free and democratic society” has delivered the protection and defence we need from ever-increasing heating and extreme weather events.My time incarcerated will be spent in service. I will continue to follow in the noble tradition of civil resistance, using my time to read about past campaigns and the people behind them. People who also served time in prison, in the belief that despite the reaction of the state, their actions were a necessary public service.I will consider how to hold those responsible for the greatest crime ever committed against humanity to account.Indigo Rumbelow is co-founder of Just Stop Oil.

The memory of his kindness kept me goingRanjana SrivastavaAfter a serious stroke, Mike’s friends rallied around, helping to bring some joy back into his life. His death came as a shockTue 3 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 18.55 EDTShareWe are going through the list of overnight admissions when my phone beeps. Expecting a medical request to do something or see someone, my chest cramps at the message.I must be sufficiently distracted for the trainee to ask, “All OK?”It’s a split-second decision. My instinct is to blurt out that an old friend has died and I need time out. But this would inevitably incur an explanation causing the ward round to be consumed by sympathy for me instead of care for our patients.‘Mum, my brain’: how I learned to walk, talk and even dance again after a devastating stroke at 36Read moreSo I muster the pretence to say, “Just keep going”, convincing myself this is what Mike would have wanted.Mike and I met more than 30 years ago. Medical student admissions are a multifaceted thing but I like to think that he was the administrator who “let” me in. More accurately, he was the one who told me years later that after several rounds of offers, there was just one remaining spot and many deserving students but maybe the universe had spoken and I squeezed in.Getting into medicine would turn out to be the most consequential event of my life.The next year, Mike gave me my first job, the task of settling the nerves of the medical students who were appearing for their interview like I did once.It was a decidedly plum job; paid hours, free sandwiches and real orange juice. But even better was Mike introducing me to a fellow student, G.“I think you will get along” turned out to be a singular understatement when I think about the bounties of our close friendship, which now embraces five children.Like other students, I stayed in touch with Mike because he was interested in what medical students did with their lives after the coveted degree. He attended my wedding and brought my children thoughtful gifts when he came to dinner. He was there for the celebrations and the lamentations, when they came.Fifteen years ago, driving home from a routine work day, Mike suffered a devastating stroke. I remember dashing to intensive care where he was expected to succumb. Miraculously and, in part, due to his relatively young age, he survived every complication and was discharged to the stroke unit, the place of my worst memories. Here, Mike was often insensate and when awake had no meaningful use of limb or language. The nurses were caring but the loss of his dignity was scathing. I would sit there stunned by the blow of fate, hoping he recognised me.With sophisticated modifications and dutiful caregivers, Mike’s life was again illuminated by friends, theatre and current affairsDefying predictions, Mike not only survived his hospital ordeal but also emerged largely cognitively intact. However, his physical needs necessitated admission to a nursing home.My standout memory from the nursing home was that his only window to the outside had an opaque coating. It made him miserable and even the staff couldn’t explain its existence as it was not related to privacy.Over months, Mike and I appealed to the management to allow him a glimpse of the sun, sky and trees, all in vain.After that dashed hope, I resorted to simpler ways of “helping” by asking what kind of sushi he wanted. At least, that was always under our control.But we never stopped talking about his desire to get out of the nursing home. In service of his dream, he was diligent with physiotherapy and continued to train his brain. I knew plenty of people who yearned to leave residential care but none successfully. It took the best part of two years and a mountain of paperwork and advocacy from his valiant sister to get Mike back into his own home. That was a remarkable day.With sophisticated modifications and dutiful caregivers, Mike’s life was again illuminated by friends, theatre and current affairs. When we visited him and found him content, I told my children that Mike’s transformation was also a testament to a society which had painstakingly restored dignity to an individual in circumstances where it would have been far easier to let him languish in residential care. This really was exemplary disability care in the community.I found it especially instructive to witness the loyalty of his childhood friends whose interest in him seemed unaffected by his limitations. They were a living reminder of the adage that if you have one true friend you have more than your fair share.As Mike acquired a social life, our interactions slowed. But I was always delighted when he couldn’t see me because he had other plans – there had been many intervening years of drought.Some weeks ago, I sent him an email proposing lunch, never imagining it would only be read by his sister undertaking the heartache of posthumously sifting through his affairs. Now she tells me that Mike, after enjoying a holiday, presented to hospital with sudden and fatal deterioration. There had been no time to let anyone know he was dying.For his 80th birthday, my dad asked for the gift of time. What we gave him will last generations | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreIt is difficult for me to absorb the shock all at once but Mike’s sister says something very generous – that in his years of greatest need, I was like a daughter to him. I will never know it for sure, but the thought itself is a lovely consolation.Mike was one of the people who derived personal satisfaction from my enjoyment of medicine. My friend, G, became a role model for honouring our relationships despite the demands of life.Who would understand the significance of this sudden loss? G is the first person I text.I picture Mike’s satisfaction that the two of us, brought together by him, stop to reflect on a life and legacy that couldn’t have been scripted, at least not by two doctors.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

We need a similar inquiry nowTue 3 Jun 2025 10.28 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 10.32 EDTShareHussam, 13, and Muhammad, 14, were killed by air-dropped cluster bombs. These bombs were made by the United States and were dropped in a military campaign supported by the British government. Hussam and Muhammad were born in Baghdad and died in 2003. “The bomblet ripped off their legs and ultimately killed them,” according toHuman Rights Watch. They were two of about200,000 civilianswho were killed in the Iraq war.For years after that conflict, the government tried to resist several attempts to establish an inquiry into the policymaking of British officials. However, it could not prevent the inevitable – and in 2016 we had the publication of the Chilcot inquiry. I was the leader of the Labour party when the report was published, and it found grave failings within the British government. After I had responded to the Chilcot inquiry in parliament that day, I then went over the road to Church House, where we had invited war veterans, Iraqis and the families of British soldiers who had lost their lives. Iapologisedon behalf of the party for its catastrophic decision to go to war in Iraq. Today, history is repeating itself – and a Labour government is making another grave mistake.After 20 months of Israeli bombardment, the death toll in Gaza hasexceeded 54,000. As for the survivors, the injured and the bereaved – they will face lifelong scars for generations to come.Israel has not been acting alone. It has relied on military, economic and political support from governments around the world. Britain may have had a change in government since 7 October 2023, but one thing has remained constant: the steady supply of arms to Israel. Last year, between October and December alone, Labour approved more arms exports licences to Israel than the Conservatives approvedbetween 2020 and 2023. This was in spite of the government’s announcement ofa part suspensionin September 2024.Many of us have continued to express our disgust over the continued supply of components to theF-35 jet fighter programme. I remain astounded that the government openly admits it is making an “exception” to its part suspension. Is this an exception to its legal obligations to prevent genocide? One thing is beyond doubt: this government is still allowing the supply of arms to a nation whose leader iswanted by the international criminal courtfor alleged crimes against humanity.We have also repeatedly asked for the truth regarding the role of British military bases in Cyprus, concerning thetransfer of armsto Israel and the supply of military intelligence. When Keir Starmer visited RAF Akrotiri in December 2024, he wasfilmed telling troops:“The whole world is relying on you, and everybody back at home is relying on you.”He added: “Quite a bit of what goes on here can’t necessarily be talked about all of the time … We can’t necessarily tell the world what you’re doing here.” What does the government have to hide?Our questions have been met with evasion, obstruction and silence, leaving the public in the dark over the ways in which the responsibilities of government have been discharged. Transparency and accountability are cornerstones of democracy. The British public deserves to know the full scale of the UK’s complicity in crimes against humanity.That is why I am tabling a private members’ bill tomorrow calling for a full, public, independent inquiry into the UK’s role in Israel’s military assault in Gaza. This inquiry would seek to establish the truth about Britain’s military, economic or political cooperation with Israel since October 2023. Any meaningful inquiry would require the full cooperation of government ministers – Conservative andLabour– who have been involved in the decision-making processes.This inquiry must find out: what arms have been supplied to Israel? Which of these arms have been used to kill Palestinians? What legal advice has the government received? Is RAF Akrotiri being used as a route for weapons to be deployed in Gaza? What video footage does the government have of the war zone? What intelligence has been passed to Israel?Over the past20 months, human beings have endured a level of horror and inhumanity that should haunt us for ever. Entire families wiped out. Limbs strewn across the street. Mothers screaming for their children torn to pieces. Doctors performing amputations without anaesthesia. Home by home, hospital by hospital, generation by generation. We have not been witnessing a war. We have been witnessing a genocide, livestreamed before the entire world.No one can pretend they did not know what was happening. In October 2023, we warned that we were witnessing the beginning of the total annihilation of Gaza and its people. We said Palestinians were being collectively punished for a terrible crime they did not commit. We pleaded with political leadersto call for peace.We were ignored. Today, some politicians have finally started to backtrack, perhaps frightened by the consequences of their inhumanity. If they had any integrity, they would weep for the 54,000 Palestinians buried under the rubble by their moral and political cowardice. Today, schoolchildren are taught about history’s worst crimes against humanity. In the future, our history books will shame those who had the opportunity to stop this massacre but instead chose to enable one of the greatest crimes of our time.This issue is not going away – and we are not going anywhere. The government must decide: will it support this inquiry, or will it block our efforts to establish the truth?Jeremy Corbyn is the MP for Islington North.

Now history is repeating itselfTue 3 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 07.07 EDTShareSociety is sleepwalking into a nightmare. The rate of global investment in AI is rocketing, as companies and countries invest in what has been described as a new arms race. The Californian company Nvidia, which dominates the market in the chips needed for AI, has become themost valuable in the world. The trend has been dubbed an “AI frenzy”, with the components described by analysts as the “new gold or oil”.Everyone is getting in on the act, and politicians are desperate to stake their countries’ claim as global leaders in AI development. Safeguards, equitable access and sustainability are falling by the wayside: when countries gathered forthe Paris AI summit in February 2025and produced an international agreement pledging an “open”, “inclusive” and “ethical” approach to AI, the US and the UKrefused to sign it.It is worth asking who is benefiting from this headlong rush, and at whose expense. One developer, who only goes by the name Lore in their communications with the media, described the open-source release of the large language model (LLM) Llama as creating a “gold rush-type of scenario”. He used Llama to build Chub AI, a website where users can chat with AI bots and roleplay violent and illegal acts. For as little as $5 a month, users can access a “brothel” staffed by girls below the age of 15, described on the site as a “world without feminism”. Or they can “chat” with a range of characters, including Olivia, a 13-year-old girl with pigtails wearing a hospital gown, or Reiko, “your clumsy older sister” who is described as “constantly having sexual accidents with her younger brother”.This million-dollar money generator is just one of thousands of applications of this new technology that are re-embedding misogyny deep into the foundations of our future. On other sites men can create,share and weaponise fake intimate imagestoterrorise women and girls.Sex robotsare being developed at breakneck speed. Already, you can buy a self-warming, self-lubricating or “sucking” model: some manufacturers have dreamed up a “frigid” setting that would allow their users to simulate rape. Millions of men are already usingAI “companions” – virtual girlfriends, available and subservient 24/7, whose breast size and personality they can customise and manipulate.Meanwhile, generative AI, which hasexploded in popularity, has been proven to regurgitate andamplify misogynyand racism. This becomes significantly more of a concern when you realise just how much online content will soon be created by this new tool.Women are at risk of being dragged back to the dark ages by precisely the same technology that promises to catapult men into a shiny new future. This has all happened before. Very recently, in fact. Cast your mind back to the early days of social media. It started out the same way: a new idea harnessed by privileged white men, its origins in the patriarchal objectification of women. (Mark Zuckerberg started out with a website calledFaceMash, which allowed users to rank the attractiveness of female Harvard students … a concept he now says had nothing to do with the origins of Facebook.)Women, particularly women of colour, raised their voices in concern: some of theearliest objectionsto FaceMash came from Harvard’s Fuerza Latina and Association of Harvard Black Women societies. They were ignored, Facebook was born and the rest is history.Social media was rolled out at great speed. Back then, Zuckerberg’s famous catchphrase was “Move fast and break things”. The things that got broken were societal cohesion,democracyand the mental health, in particular, of girls.By the time people started pointing out that online abuse was endemic to social platforms, those platforms were too well established and profitable for their owners to be prepared to make sweeping changes. Politicians seemed too enamoured with the powerful tech lobby to be prepared to stand up to them.The results have been devastating. Young women have taken their own lives afterexperiencing sexualised cyberbullying. An alarming number of female parliamentarians have stepped down from office after experiencing intolerable levels ofonline abuse. Millions of women have been subject to rape and death threats, doxing, online stalking and racist and misogynistic abuse.We failed to prevent this crisis when we didn’t heed the warning calls in the early days of social media. We now risk squandering a similar opportunity. Without urgent action, we will be doomed to repeat the same mistakes with AI, only this time on a far larger scale. “One of the reasons many of us do have concerns about the rollout of AI is because over the past 40 years as a society we’ve basically given up on actually regulating technology,” Peter Wang, co-founder of data science platform Anaconda, recentlytold the Guardian. “Social media was our first encounter with dumb AI and we utterly failed that encounter.”If women and marginalised communities have already learned from their frequent mistreatment on social media to self-censor, to disguise their real names and to mute their voices, these coping mechanisms and restrictive norms will follow them when they step into new technological environments.Nearly nine in ten womenpolled in a 2020 Economist study said they restricted their online activity in some way as a result of cyber-harassment, hacking, online stalking and doxing. This helps to explain the disparity between men’s and women’s use of AI;71% of men aged 18 to 24say they use AIweekly, while only 59% of women in the same age range do so. So long as men remain the main users of AI, the technology will be designed to cater to their preferences.The answer isn’t to reject new technology, or ignore the enormous potential of AI. Instead, we should ensure regulations and safeguards are implemented when AI is designed, before products are rolled out to the public, in much the same way that they are within other industries.“I thought people should be aware,” said Leyla R Bravo,then president of Fuerza Latina, when she tried to raise the alarm at Harvard over the nascent FaceMash website back in 2003. This time, might someone listen? It isn’t too late for political leaders to stand up to big tech. The harms of this technology aren’t rooted in a future dystopia where robots take over the world. AI is already devastating the lives of women and girls, right now. If people realised this, they might desire to do things differently.Laura Bates is the founder of theEveryday Sexism Projectand author of The New Age of Sexism: How the AI Revolution is Reinventing Misogyny.In the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland.

It’s made him incredibly dangerousOwen JonesOnce a pro-remain Cameronite, he’s now engaging with the far right – and he’s in pole position for the Tory leadershipTue 3 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 13.13 EDTShareThe shameless opportunism of a scandal-hit political climber could have profound consequences for our democracy. The British public still knows little about Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary who was seen off by Kemi Badenoch in last year’s race for the Tory crown. That will soon change, becausethe implosionof the hapless Conservative incumbent is safely filed under “when, not if” – and Jenrick will almost certainly succeed her.Jenrick’s political evolution reflects the trajectory across the west of the so-called centre right, which has either been eclipsed by the radical right or adopted its positions. When Jenrick won the Newark byelection in 2014, he was – in the words of then nearby Tory MP Anna Soubry – a “full-fat subscriber to David Cameron”. Having defeated Nigel Farage’s then rising party, the now virtually extinct Tory wetshailed his victoryat the time as evidence that the party must resist becoming “Ukip lite”. It was a conclusion that Jenrick – who avoided campaigning on either immigration or the EU – endorsed, declaring: “You win elections at the centre.”At the time of the referendum, Jenrick was a staunch opponent of Brexit,signing a letterthat declared that leaving the EU would “lead us into dystopia”. Even as recently as 2022, when demagogic then home secretary Suella Braverman declared that southern England faced an “invasion” of illegal migrants, Jenrick rebuked his own boss. “It’s not a phrase that I’ve used,”he saidwhen asked if she’d used the wrong term, adding: “I think in this job you do have to use your language carefully.”Well, Jenrick has managed to drastically outbid Braverman on extreme language. Britain has imported “hundreds of thousands of people from alien cultures who possess medieval attitude towards women”,he declares. Where his former mentor Cameron once dismissed Ukip as “fruitcakes, loonies or closet racists”,Jenrick declareshe would welcome Farage into Tory ranks. The once passionate remainernow demands that Britainleave the European court of human rights. And when Britain was in the grip of racist, Islamophobic riots,Jenrick calledfor anyone shouting “Allahu Akbar” to be arrested – in other words, criminalising the most common phrase used by observant Muslims.Is this all a ruse to get elected leader before shifting in a completely different direction – a Tory Keir Starmer, if you will? Braverman certainly wasn’t convinced last year,declaring that Jenrick hails“from the left of the party” and looked “horrified” when she floated leaving the European court. But Jenrick is hardly unique. Consider Liz Truss, a former monarchy-trashing Liberal Democrat activist who also campaigned for remain. She now denounces the “deep state”, shares platforms with far-right US strategist Steve Bannon ashe praisesTommy Robinson as a “hero”, and this weekend attended a rightwing conference in Hungary, a quasi-dictatorship, where she talked about the “free speech crisis in Britain”.What Jenrick truly believes is a secondary consideration: you would hardly call Donald Trump a natural ideologue, and yet he operates as a faithful executor of far-right causes. Jenrick’sallies claim he was “radicalised”by his experience at the Home Office. Alarmingly, in leaked correspondence last year with an anonymousfar-right Twitter accountthat demands “mass deportations” and banning the Qur’an, Jenrick declared himself “a great admirer” of its tweets, saying: “We agree however on what needs to happen.”Like Trump, Jenrick will undoubtedly style himself as a man of the people, despite all evidence pointing in a different direction.Among his multiple propertiesare a £2.6m central London townhouse and a stately home: in 2020 he was accused of (but never prosecuted for)breaking lockdown rulesafter driving to the latter during the pandemic. The same year, he overruled civil servants to rush through a£1bn property dealbacked by Tory donor Richard Desmond, who had lobbied him to speed up the development to save him £40m in tax. The decision was later to befound to be unlawful. But adopting rightwing populism offers cynical aspiring demagogues protection from such scrutiny, which they present as a conspiracy to silence them.It’s easy to dismiss Robert Jenrick’s fare-dodging stunt. But he understands something Keir Starmer doesn’t | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreHere’s why a Jenrick leadership will be dangerous. Across the west, there is an obvious political direction: a drift towards rightwing authoritarianism. In Hungary, democracy was destroyed by Fidesz, a supposedly centre-right party and one-time member of the Liberal International, which radicalised in power. Its leader, Viktor Orbán – like Jenrick – wasa lawyer who was presented as a moderate. The Tory faction Jenrick once hailed from is largely gone, and the prevailing Conservative wisdom is that only by lurching rightwards can the Farageist threat be dispelled.Unlike Badenoch, who seems allergic to anything resembling a cut-through message, Jenrick will ruthlessly communicate his demagoguery, asthe latest videoofhimchasing after fare dodgers underlines. And here’s the big problem. Labour under Starmer has shown it will raid the policies and rhetoric of Farageism rather than offer an alternative to a broken economic model that is the key driver of disillusionment. When Jenrick has the top job, Britain will have two high-profile rightwing agitators spraying political discourse with incendiary rhetoric. Labour will respond by echoing their bile, legitimising a rightwing lurch rather than seeing it off. If – like the US – Britain falls into an authoritarian mire, then Jenrick’s cynical political manoeuvring may well accelerate the descent.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But, in the great American tradition, he is a top hustler. In an arrogant display that would have won Trump’s approval, Hegseth blustered his way around the Shangri-La conference in Singapore’s clammy weather last week in what resembled an ugly American charm offensive. He omitted tariffs, though these were front of mind for everyone else.He told regional leaders that they bludged off America’s generosity, getting security on the cheap and leaving it to America to do the heavy lifting of containing China by maintaining the strategic balance – whatever that might be. All they needed to do wasinvest much more in defenceto help the US maintain its primacy. And behind his shrill calls for more money on bombs and their delivery systems was a growing US alarmism directed at China.Provocation is never a substitute for diplomacy, as any sharp player knows.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailHegseth spoke about the imminence of the China threat. America may well need an enemy to define its ambition and to sustain its sense of insecurity. But the question is: do we? The countries of south-east Asia have made their position pretty clear: they just do not believe it. Nor do they want to get sucked into a contest between titans. As the proverb has it, “when elephants are dancing, grasshoppers get out of the way”.Albanese again pushes back on US demand for Australia to increase defence spending to 3.5% of GDPRead moreHustlers evidently do not appreciate irony. Notwithstanding the claims of massive increases in China’s defence spending, it runs a defence budget that hovers around 1.7% of GDP, compared with America’s 3.4%. In dollar terms, China spends around USD 300bn per annum. America spends around USD 900bn, accounting for about 40% of global arms spending.These expenditures dwarf everyone else’s. In the US case, they contribute to a deficit overhang bigger than its GDP. For our part, without any additional defence spending, we are already the12th largest contributorto the global industrial-military complex.It should not have been a surprise that Australia’s defence minister,Richard Marles, like other regional defence leaders, found himself cornered at Shangri-La. Marles, whose exposure to knucklers is limited to the polite exchanges for which ALP factional leaders are renowned, might have thought that he had to accommodate Hegseth’s demand that Australia ramp up its defence spending to 3.5% of GDP forthwith – almost double our present defence budget.Inveterate verbalist that he is, Marles was not going to be badgered into submission. He did not agree to a figure, but hedid agree to Hegseth’s arguments, saying that Australia would consider the proposal.In the bracing temperatures of Hobart, however, Anthony Albanese had other ideas. In sharply defined comments that might have been channelling John Howard’s “we will decide who comes to this country” a quarter of a century ago,Albanese proclaimedthat Australia would determine its defence budget for itself and decide on what capabilities Australia needs. Albanese went further and cut to the heart of the problem: setting an arbitrary rate – a percentage of GDP – is no way to calculate budget priorities.As prime minister, Albanese presides over the cabinet that assesses the competing bids of portfolio ministers – health, education, childcare, aged care, redressing inequality, defence and the rest. He knows better than anyone that there are only three ways to increase expenditure: raise taxes; cut services; increase debt, or a bit of each.He also knows that the Australian economy is in structural deficit, as treasury secretary Steven Kennedypointed outjust last week. Pressures on the commonwealth and state budgets are climbing, with stewardship becoming an increasingly key indicator of government performance.‘We’ll determine our defence policy’: Albanese responds to US push for huge rise in spending as Hegseth stokes China fearsRead moreAlbanese understands that setting arbitrary spending targets, rather than balancing needs, priorities and resources, only encourages the fattening of sacred cows and the bloating of pork-barrels. As he pointed out, the government has provisioned an additional $10bn for defence over the forward estimates, with the eye-watering costs ofAukuslooming over future budgets for future governments.As it heads into Australia’s48th parliament, the government finds itself caught in the cleft stick of an increasingly fluid international scene and growing economic headwinds, due in no small measure to the US. Throwing money around at fears – rather than allocating it judiciously to needs – does not reward the voter confidence that the government’s massive majority would indicate.Let us all hope that Albanese can maintain his poise and resist the strident calls for military boosterism.Allan Behm is the author of No Enemies, No Friends and The Odd Couple(both by Upswell).

This spending review is a chance to fix itTue 3 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 06.41 EDTShareWho in their right mind would want to be Rachel Reeves right now? Her spending review out next week will feel like austerity all over again. Even if, in reality, it’s not a cut but more spending, as theInstitute for Fiscal Studies emphasises. After an uplift in everyday spending at the budget, here comes a much-neededcapital slab of £113bn. Yet whatever the numbers say, painful cuts to most things will be the story and the feeling.If you want to try your hand, the IFS has just put its “Be the Chancellor” gadgetup on its site. Strap yourself into Reeves’s fiscal straitjacket and attempt a Houdini-like escape, as you decide on levels of borrowing, taxing, spending and debt. One thing it illuminates is how much even mere slivers of growth improve your position immensely. How far can you go? The febrile market meltdown point is unknowable, but Liz Truss was a useful crash dummy testing squillions on tax cuts without raising revenue. Donald Trump, plunging into an unexplored fiscal wilderness, beat a retreat when his monster tariffs sent the markets charging back out at him. He seems to be having another try.One reason not to want to be chancellor is that Reeves inherited public services and the economy in their worst state in recent memory. The £22bn black hole was a fraction of the true deficit, as every minister soon revealed the bleeding stumps of their stricken department after years of cuts. How do you weigh up hungry children, inadequate home insulation, councils bankrupted by social care and special educational needs funding, meagre social housing, and stretched policing and courts? None will get enough, some will get cut.These choices are the breath of politics: no wonder Labour MPs look so drawn, Survation finding65% of them thinkthe government should change course on fiscal policy to fund public investment and spending. At the weekendCompass conference, Labour’s soft left keened over vacillations and slow progress.At the same time, Starmer’s commitment to be “battle-ready” means huge defence spending. Monday’s strategic defence review commits not just to defending Nato countries facing imminent danger from Vladimir Putin, but rebinding us to the Europe we walked out on. It means defending our own endangered undersea cables, vulnerable internet and critical facilities. It’s “a new era”,Keir Starmersaid. “The world has changed.”Yes, indeed. And so must the government on tax and spending.More revenue must be raised, and the answer is not more tweaks. The whole tax and spending ship is an unseaworthy rustbucket encrusted with barnacles, in need not of a lick of paint but of stripping down and rebuilding. Adjustments seeking small sums deliver maximum political pain, and minimal financial gain. Tempting tax loopholes turned out to be strewn with political landmines: farmers sitting on undertaxed millions in land wealth, or well-off pensioners in no need of winter fuel allowances are explosive when set off. (It turns out the cost of poor pensioners rushing to claim pension credit for the first time isoutweighing the £1.5bn savings: good news but not for the Treasury.) Assuaging the wrath of more than 100 rebellious Labour MPs will blunt the savings from disability cuts. These one-offs have not been worth the row.Helen Miller, incoming director of the IFS, suggests to me that tackling the big questions would be a better approach. She’s right.Labourmay as well grasp worthwhile reform, since the poison press and social media assaults them just as brutally over small things.Here’s atruly difficult example: Miller would end VAT reliefs for food, books and children’s clothes, which benefit the rich as they spend most. That brings in a stonking £100bn. After more than compensating those on lower incomes with universal credit and raising income tax thresholds for middle earners, that would buy a complete Sure Start programme and more.Start again on property tax: revaluing council tax so a Blackpool semi no longer pays more than Buckingham Palace, with a land value tax where there is no penalty for housebuilding and no escape from taxing ground value, no stamp duty to hinder movement.The other great question she raises is health costs. The Department of Health and Social Caretakes around 40% of day-to-day spending, the majority of that on the NHS. It’s dangerous to ask if we need every new drug and treatment. The NHS draws cash away from underfunded education, yet we never dare discuss this clash of interests. Older peopleuse the NHS most: 32% of the spend is on those aged between 65 and 84 (16% of the population) with another 10% on over-85s (3% of the population), according to Full Fact. Yet the future depends on better early years, great schools, further education colleges, skills and apprenticeships.Investing in human capital brings longer-lasting national growth than bricks and mortar, as education and skills are passed for ever down the generations. But the Treasury green book says no.Wealth tax is not as difficult as claimed: Liam Byrne’s book Inequality of Wealth shows the top 1% have multiplied their wealth by 31 times more than the other 99% since 2010. Arun Advani, director of the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation, says a tax on assets of 1% from those with more than £10m would yield £10bn, which would nicely eliminate the worst poverty: End Child Poverty this weekreports one in three childrenin the UK are living in poverty. Making all forms of income pay the same tax, earned or capital gains, rents or self-employed,pays out £12bn, says the economist Prof Richard Murphy.If ever there were a time to uproot old habits, it’s now. The defence review demands more contribution. If money isn’t raised elsewhere, defence risks eating into everything. “Change” was why Labour got elected, but voters don’t see or feel it, and nor do hang-dog Labour MPs.The fiscal straitjackethas come to be a signal to voters, indicating “no change”. Yet the Institute for Government points out the rules permit Reeves to suspend them “in the event of a ‘significant negative shock’,” while noting “it is at the Treasury’s discretion to define what constitutes such a shock”. Her own spending review will show how Trump, tariffs and emergency defence spending cause a deeply “negative shock” to everything else.Labour has suffered the biggestdip in popularitywithin its first 10 months of any newly elected UK government in 40 years. Yet look at its opportunity for change, with four full years of government ahead and a majority it may never see again (nor should, with electoral reform). In all these things, the Labour cabinet and Labour MPs have nothing to lose but their nerve.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionRachel ReevesInfrastructureLabourKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Unless Israel is held to account, we will be erasedIssa Amro is a Palestinian human rights defenderTue 3 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 03.25 EDTShareEach of the22 illegal settlementsapproved by Israel last week is another nail in the coffin of the peace process, hammered in by the complicity of western governments and corporations. Israeli settlements are not benign civilian neighbourhoods – they are primary instruments of dispossession, control and apartheid. Settlements are closed militarised zones on Palestinians’ stolen land, cutting off our access to our resources, our farms, our schools, our jobs and each other. Palestinian lands rapidly shrink, our livelihoods are devastated, our rights are systematically violated and our identity is undermined.Western lawmakers look on, expressing commitment to peace through a two-state solution but choosing to do nothing to achieve this goal. Instead, their policies and inaction enable yet further settlement activity.In the West Bank we live in an obvious two-tier system, yet most lawmakers continue to shun the word “apartheid” despite Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights organisations concurring on its accuracy and theinternational court of justice(ICJ) reaffirming it last July.The Settlers, the BBC documentary by Louis Theroux, helped expose this reality, showing me being prevented from even walking on the same streets as Israelis in the neighbourhood of Hebron, where I was born.In response to the documentary, Israeli settlers and soldiers broke into my yard, vandalised it and assaulted me. Soldiers made no arrests but instead threatened to arrestmeif I filed a complaint. Then one morning at 4am, young settlers made a bonfire on private Palestinian land outside my home and chanted that they hoped to see me killed. One individual showed up right in front of my house in army fatigues and with a semi-automatic rifle to intimidate me. Settlers then stole my pan-African flag, given to me by Black Lives Matter, and burned it among a pile of Palestinian flags.It is the same story in nearby Masafer Yatta, featured not only in The Settlers but also in the Oscar-winning filmNo Other Land. Directors Basel Adra and Yuval Abraham called for interventions last week to help stop its destruction, and co-director Hamdan Ballal wasdetained and beatenin reprisal for its production.The ICJ found Israel responsible for the crime of apartheid, yet western leaders bite their tongues. It found that not only Israel’s settlements but also its whole occupation of theWest Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip are unlawful, and that the international community is obliged to help dismantle the settlements, evacuate the settlers and end the occupation as quickly as possible. Why are western leaders inert?It seems that western governments would rather undermine the international justice system than hold Israel to account. Even when there are some stronger criticisms of Israel, it continues with its war crimes,as Nesrine Malik wrotelast week, regardless.Governments must urgently, as required by the ICJ, take steps to halt trade relations which help sustain the illegal occupation, starting with a ban on all trade with and investment in settlement businesses. Not only individual settlers but also the senior officials responsible for illegal settlements and apartheid must be sanctioned and brought to justice for these war crimes. Not just some but all arms transfers to Israel must be halted.If you were shocked by my film on Israeli settlers in the West Bank, you haven’t been paying attention | Louis TherouxRead moreAnd you, dear reader of conscience, must not only read and watch what is happening but also use your voice and take action. We are relying on you to keep highlightingGazaand the West Bank, and to hold your parliamentarians, governments and corporations to account. Change your bank or pension fund if it invests in companies involved in the illegal settlements or supplying genocidal and apartheid Israel with arms.Without concrete actions now, we will be erased across the West Bank as well as in Gaza. Forty thousand Palestinian refugees have been expelled from their West Bank homes since January. Twenty Palestinian communities have been expelled from their West Bank lands after attacks from settlers and the occupying army employing bulldozers. Last week the last remaining 30 families of Maghayir al-Deir, near Ramallah, were forced to flee after months of escalating state-backed settler violence.Despite these extraordinarily dark times, I write this with a great sense of hope in my heart inspired by the many people of conscience in the world who stand with us.This is a test for global leadership. Not just of policy, but of principle. We Palestinians need protection and justice now, before it is too late.Issa Amro is a Palestinian human rights defender and co-founder of Youth Against SettlementsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Her Serpentine pavilion – part tropical glasshouse, part 70s office block – is a chic, meditative place for an overpriced coffeeOliver WainwrightTue 3 Jun 2025 10.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 22.06 EDTSharePast pavilions have taken the form of inflatable balloons, teetering plastic pyramids and cork-lined lairs dug into the ground. We have seen afibreglass cocoon perched on boulders, a wildflower garden enclosed by tar-daubed walls, and anassortment of undulating canopies, clad in polished steel and jagged slate. Now, to celebrate 25 years of building experimental structures on its front lawn, London’s Serpentine gallery has unveiled its first pavilion that moves.“Every time you think of an idea for the project,” saysMarina Tabassum, the Bangladeshi architect behind this year’s kinetic enclosure, “you realise, ‘Oh, that’s already been done.’” This is the eternal dilemma for any designer selected for this prestigious annual commission: how to concoct a novel structure on a tight deadline that will enrapture park-goers, entertain corporate sponsors, and appeal to collectors,who are ultimately expected to acquire the thing– as well as, most importantly, provide a shelter for an overpriced coffee.She wanted to clad her structure with coarse jute – but fire safety regulations and British rain put paid to thatTo the Serpentine’s quarter century of domed, cylindrical and cocoon-shaped cafes, Tabassum has now added a pill-shaped pavilion. “A capsule in time” is how she describes her 55-metre long structure, formed of timber arches 28m high, clad in translucent brown panels, sliced open in places for entrances and views of a single gingko tree, poetically planted in line with the gallery’s roof tower. The vaulted enclosure terminates in a momentous domed apse at either end, recalling tropical glasshouses and church naves, while the zigzag cladding gives it the look of an expanding crepe-paper ornament, as if it might fold itself away at any moment.None of these things were on Tabassum’s mind. Instead, she citesshamiana, the ceremonial tents erected for festive gatherings in south Asia. Their “beautiful quality of filtered light” is what she was keen to bring here. She had originally hoped to clad her structure with coarse lengths of jute, but a combination of fire safety regulations and British rain put paid to the sackcloth. It’s a shame the fabric was ditched. The tinted brown plastic, fixed to a chunky steel frame between the big brown arches, calls less to mind a festive tent than the vaulted atrium of a 1970s office block – a chic one, nonetheless.View image in fullscreenMoving at imperceptible speed … the brown tinted roof of the pavilion.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightThe plastic does the job, though, keeping the rain out and filtering light through the variously tinted panels, but it has a corporate slickness at odds withTabassum’s work in Bangladesh. Her buildings there revel in their rough brickwork, raw concrete, and use of slender bamboo – and their ability to do a lot with minimal means. She has built emergency homes for the delta-dwellers of the Ganges that are essays in lightweight, modular elegance, using woven grass and bamboo. This five-month summer canopy feels hugely over-engineered and carbon intensive in comparison.It is a common curse of the annual commission, which often sees architects’ ideas lost in translation by the Serpentine’s speed and prefabrication-oriented engineers and builders, Aecom and Stage One. Plans forearth bricks result in blocks of wood; ideas for transparent panels bringsheets of CNC-milled plywood; dreams of handmade clay domes end up asprefab wooden cylinders. Any hope for true material experimentation is ultimately lost, which seems to undermine a central point of the commission.The dissonance this year is no more evident than in the kinetic gadgetry. As we speak, a 10-tonne chunk of Tabassum’s capsule begins to move, at imperceptible speed, closing one of the gaps. “I wanted to keep the sense of openness to the park,” she says. “So it was very important to keep these cuts in the structure. But the brief also requires a covered space for 200 people, for events, so we had to be able to close it up.” She says the solution – an underground hydraulic machine – was one of the most expensive parts of the project, and it seems like a herculean effort to move the canopy just 1.4 metres. You might struggle to spot the difference, before and after the great manoeuvre.I would like this to be a space where people can come together and forget their differencesThe surprisingly substantial nature of the pavilions is partly down to the fact that they are intended to live on, in the parks and gardens of their millionaire collectors. No future for Tabassum’s capsule has yet been announced, but she has an idea in mind. “If my wishes are of any value, I would like it to become a library,” she says. Hinting at its afterlife, she has equipped the space with shelves, and a selection of books that celebrate the richness of Bengali culture, literature and poetry, and the ecology of Bangladesh.In the meantime, she wants it to be a place for dialogue. “This has been a year marked by intolerance, wars, countless deaths, protests and suppressions,” she says. “I would like this to be a space where people can come together, forget their differences and just talk about humanity.” Could this be the first protest pavilion?View image in fullscreenDreams of a library … Marina Tabassum.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianIt is a suitably calm space for taking the heat out of discussions, and the apses should provide great natural acoustics for lectures and events. But the sense of tranquility is thrown into sharp relief by what stands next door.Like a brash uncle in a loud comedy shirt muscling his way into the wedding photos, a second pavilion has been built just a few metres away, across the entrance path, doing its best to upstage Tabassum’s restrained enclosure. It is the work of 88-year-old Sir Peter Cook, a co-founder of the radical 1960s group Archigram, former head of UCL’s Bartlett school of architecture – and more recently consultanton desert fantasies for Saudi Arabia’s regime.In an astonishingly ill-judged move, the Serpentine has commissioned Cook to conjure a“play pavilion”for its 25th anniversary, suggesting the work of a woman from the global south is not quite enough on its own. Looking like a crumpled cheeseburger, with a domed bun-like canopy hovering above a fluorescent orange cylinder, clad with what look like globular smears of ketchup and mustard, Cook’s structure is a clumsy eyeful. It is “the fool, the joker, the mischievous child,” he claims in an accompanying text, a reminder that “we should never take ourselves too seriously.” One might have hoped for a bit more seriousness than this drunken napkin sketch.View image in fullscreenA clumsy eyeful … Peter Cook’s ‘play pavilion’.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightSponsored by Lego, it contains a lumpen series of plastic brick towers, while a yellow plastic slide is bolted on to the side, as an invitation to “become part of this jolly thing”. In its dad-dancing desperation to be fun, the sorry structure merely serves as a reminder that the park’s nearby playgrounds are a good deal more inventive and playful than this washed-up sponsorship opportunity. Numerous other young architects could have conjured a more inventive play space, should the gallery have taken the idea seriously.Why choose Cook? Maybe they held a seance. The Serpentine cites the posthumous wishes of its first pavilion architect, Zaha Hadid, as the reason. Bettina Korek, chief executive, and Hans Ulrich Obrist, artistic director, said in a statement: “Zaha Hadid long envisioned a collaboration between Serpentine and Peter Cook, whose radical design philosophy perfectly aligns with her belief that ‘there should be no end to experimentation’. Now, that vision is becoming a reality.”But perhaps Cook’s squashed Lego burger makes a fitting final bookend to this 25-year jamboree of pavilions, a tradition that seems to have had its day. It could follow in the footsteps of Zaha’s angular marquee, which unexpectedlyended up in Flambards theme park in Cornwall, where it enjoyed a second life hosting children’s birthday parties, until the place was shuttered last year. We can look forward to Cook’s structure being unearthed in a McDonald’s car park in years to come, the jaunty legacy of Archigram adorned with discarded Happy Meals.Marina Tabassum’sSerpentine Pavilionis open from 6 June until 26 October; Peter Cook’s play pavilion is open from 11 June until 10 AugustExplore more on these topicsSerpentine pavilionArchitectureArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does this remind you of anyone?Hamad Butt is the Damien Hirst who got away, the Young British Artist of the 1990s who didn’t win the Turner prize, make millions or lose his youthful talent and turn into a bloated mediocrity. Now he is a cult figure precisely because he is none of those things and can instead be presented as if he was a complete unknown, whose art expresses his queer Pakistani identity rather than being part of afin-de-siecleart movement of sensation and creepy science. I couldn’t find any reference, even in the moving array of Butt’s working documents on show, to the fact he studied at Goldsmiths alongside Hirst, Collishaw, Wearing and more.If we need to detach this brilliant artist from that generation to celebrate him, it’s better than forgetting his work. But as soon as you walk into this convincing retrospective you’re back in 1992. Occupying the whole of the Whitechapel’s main ground floor gallery is Butt’s three-part installation Familiars. Like a giant executive toy, spherical glass vessels are suspended from the ceiling by thin threads in a long row. Pull the first one back, as it is weirdly tempting to do, and you’d set them going by action and reaction. Except it would surely shatter these vessels and kill you, or at least make you very ill.The coloured gas inside each sphere is mustard-coloured, as in mustard gas. This is gaseous chlorine, first used as a chemical weapon by Germany in 1915 and in these static, sealed bottles it looks lovely, golden, glowing in the gallery lights.It’s disturbing but, let’s be honest, darkly thrilling to be only a thin glass wall away from a first world war soldier’s death here in an art gallery. To put it another way it’s sublime. One of the sculptures in this installation is actually entitled Substance Sublimation Unit, a play on chemistry and aesthetics.The other two elements of this epic sculpture look equally hazardous: a ladder with rungs that light up with blazing gas like a stairway to hell, and three curving, blood-red glowing spikes.View image in fullscreenBeauty and violence in a gallery … Hamad Butt: Apprehensions, Whitechapel Gallery, London.Photograph: Damian GriffithsTo feel such beauty and violence in a gallery may strike you as shockingly new or oddly nostalgic. In the archives room there’s a 1995 Jak cartoon from the Evening Standard, depicting a dodgy geezer selling gas masks outside the Tate – a reference to a leak from this installation when it was in a show called Rites of Passage, alongside Louise Bourgeois.Hamad Butt was not alive to laugh at Jak’s cartoon. He died in September 1994, at the age of 32, from Aids-related complications. In a video interview, lying on a sofa at his family home in Ilford, he’s still talking vividly about his future projects, months before his death. What a compelling presence he is, how deeply intelligent and imaginative.His gripping art makes you aware of how quickly and suddenly you can stray from civilised normality to mortal danger. His installation Transmission glows with gorgeous, if clinical, blue light – but look for too long, or without the protective glasses you are offered, at its ultra-violet bulbs and you risk damaging your eyesight. The bulbs rest on a circle of opened books made of glass, on which the monstrous people-eating, world-conquering flora from John Wyndham’s novel The Day of the Triffids are engraved.In another classic trope of Young British Art, that of appropriation, his design of a Triffid, with its fat vegetable body, long sucker and libidinous tongue, is borrowed wholesale from the cover of the original Penguin paperback of The Day of the Triffids.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, in the video interview, he says “transmission” refers in the first place to the transmission of light. He clearly did not want his art to be understood only one way.Today figurative painting is back in fashion, so this exhibition includes Butt’s early canvases before he turned conceptual. On the sofa on screen he explains he had to stop because he was too in thrall to Picasso and Matisse. You can see Picasso’s shadow over his paintings of sensual Minotaur-like men.This exhibition risks removing him from his wider context, but it can’t go very wrong with such art. It’s right to include his paintings, drawings and archives because we possess so little of such magnificent promise. Hamad Butt died so long before his time, yet his work is a living thrill. He is the Young British Artist who is for ever young, for ever lethal.Hamad Butt: Apprehensions is atWhitechapel Art Gallery, London, from 4 June to 7 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designWhitechapel GalleryExhibitionsArtAids and HIVreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, Glastonbury hosted a similarly unheard-of band called the Churnups playing on the Pyramid stage, who ended up being Foo Fighters.Glastonbury organisers said they would not provide any further information about Patchwork. There are also “to be announced” slots on late afternoon Friday on the Pyramid stage, Friday morning on the Woodsies stage (which has previously hosted secret sets from Kasabian and the Killers) and Saturday evening on the Park stage (Pulp and Jack White have been secret guests there in the past).View image in fullscreenFour Tet, a likely addition to the Glastonbury lineup.Photograph: Sarah Ginn/Pymca/ShutterstockOver on the Tree stage, a previously announced artist listed with a seemingly random stream of glyphs is likely to be Four Tet, who curates a Spotify playlist under the same name.New artist additions to the Other stage include drum’n’bass legends Fabio & Grooverider opening on Friday, playing tracks in symphonic arrangements with the Outlook Orchestra, plus pop artists Rizzle Kicks and Good Neighbours, and singer-songwriters Nadine Shah and Louis Dunford.Glass Beams and Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso are among those added to West Holts, whileJalen Ngonda,Ichiko Aoba,Horsegirl,John GlacierandGeordie Greepjoin other new names on the Park stage.Most of the other big stages had already announced their full lineups – including a range of Hollywood names doing Q&As and talks at thePilton Palais cinema, namely Margot Robbie, Paul Mescal, Andrew Garfield, Tilda Swinton, Ncuti Gatwa, Jodie Comer, Taron Egerton, Edgar Wright and Jesse Armstrong.Actor Dominic West and TV presenter Alice Roberts will dispense wisdom at the Free University of Glastonbury, while debaters at the Speakers Forum include MPs Ellie Chowns and Clive Lewis, plus names such as Dale Vince, Asif Kapadia and Owen Jones.And there is the usual range of WTF-provoking artist names further down the bill, this year including Twat Union, Psycho-Acoustic Goat, Spambiguous Intentions, Formidable Vegetable, DJ Fart Eater doing a back-to-back set with DJ Stink Bomb, and an experience entitled Oedipussi: Choose Your Own Drag Adventure.Glastonbury organisers have also announced details for a series of events to open the festival, including a rare Wednesday night event on the Pyramid stage entitled Look to the Skies.This is the first theatre and circus show on the Pyramid since 1990, involving “a breathtaking aerial odyssey, with high wire walkers, acrobats and incredible circus performances”.It will complement the usual opening ceremony at the Green Fields, where a “flame of hope”, made up of “15 sacred flames from around the world” will be “honoured with a thousand voices who will unite in a powerful mantra for Peace to create a collective sense of unity, love, and purpose”, concluding in a firework display.Then, on Thursday afternoon at 12.30pm, “the Green Fields ask you to join them in the Sacred Space to create the Biggest Mantra for Peace ever seen at Glastonbury festival – to demonstrate compassion and solidarity with those living in conflict and create a moment of reflection and celebration of peace, hope and unity”.Ticketholders will now pore over the lineup to spot any big clashes, including two of the most talked-about names in global pop: Charli xcx and Doechii, playing on different stages at the same time on Saturday night.View image in fullscreenKneecap performing at Wide Awake festival in May.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesPlenty of eyes will be on the West Holts stage at 4pm on Saturday, for Kneecap. There have been calls in some quarters for the punkish Northern Ireland rap-rave trio to be pulled from the lineup, after footage emerged of them allegedly saying “the only good Tory is a dead Tory” and “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Commons leader and cabinet minister Lucy Powell said in parliament: “I’m sure that no-one in this House would want to see them playing at Glastonbury”.The group’s Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh was latercharged with a terrorism offence, with Met police saying he aroused “reasonable suspicion that he is a supporter of a proscribed organisation”. He is due in court on 18 June. The group have already been axed fromGlasgow’s TRNSMT festival, but an appearance atLondon’s Wide Awake festivalwent ahead.The full lineup forGlastonbury 2025is available on the festival’s website.

Visitors flock to its extraordinary garden, in the shadow of Dungeness nuclear power station, in search of solace and relaxation. Yet focusing on this artistic haven threatens to overshadow Jarman’s actual work, which was far from tranquil and domestic, and often angry, dark and disturbing.Two examples of this more challenging side of Jarman’s output are about to resurface. The first is the publication of a treatment for an unfinished film called The Assassination of Pier Paolo Pasolini in the Garden of Earthly Delights, which Jarman wrote in 1984 as he was struggling to get his film Caravaggio made. Like Jarman, Pasolini was a queer film-maker (and writer) whose work often expressed a cri de coeur against political and sexual repression. “I think Derek related to Pasolini because he carved his own path and made films in a very singular, distinctive way,” says Tony Peake, Jarman’s biographer. “He was also someone who stuck his neck out.”Pasolini was murdered aged 53 in November 1975, three weeks before the release of his final film Salò, an indictment of fascism and a gruelling depiction of its sadism. A 17-year-old rent boy called Giuseppe Pelosi confessed to killing Pasolini after the director picked him up, and it’s this interpretation that Jarman riffs on in his film treatment, a vision of decadence and gay desire leading to doom, inspired by Hieronymus Bosch’s painting, which Jarman saw in the Prado in Madrid.View image in fullscreenEmbedded meaning … This Instant, 1987.Photograph: Courtesy Keith Collin Will Trust and Amanda Wilkinson, LondonYet since Jarman’s death at 52 in 1994,new evidence has come to lightsuggesting that Pasolini, an outspoken Marxist who often wrote newspaper articles excoriating the Italian government, was killed by a far-right terrorist group working with the tacit approval of the secret services, a possibility Olivia Laing imagines in their compelling forthcoming novel, The Silver Book. Pelosi retracted his confession in 2005 and it’s hard to believe that a single teenager could be responsible for the violence that Pasolini suffered in his final moments. He was run over several times by his car and his testicles were crushed, probably with an iron bar.Though Jarman wasn’t aware of these horrors, there were plenty of others that oppressed him. On 22 December 1986, he was told that he had contracted HIV, a diagnosis that then meant certain death, and a stigma which Jarman defied by being open about his condition – kicking off the activism that coloured the final years of his life.The following year, the British government’s campaign of leaflets and TV ads to warn the public about the danger of Aids brought forth a savage backlash against gay people, cruelly whipped up by the tabloid press. In response, Margaret Thatcher’s government brought in Section 28, which banned local authorities from “promoting” homosexuality and seemed to have work like Jarman’s, with its unequivocally queer perspective, in its sights. “All those things together felt particularly difficult and hostile,” Peake says. “And he felt that very, very strongly.”Jarman’s fear and fury came out in his 1987 filmThe Last of England, which depicts the nation as a crumbling, authoritarian dystopia, culminating in a scene in which a screaming Tilda Swinton, playing a bride whose husband has been killed, tears off her wedding dress. He also started to make a series of “black paintings”, which are going on show in chronological order at Amanda Wilkinson’s gallery in London this week. Wilkinson says that Jarman’s companionKeith Collinstold her Jarman insisted on total privacy when making the paintings, “and sometimes he used to cast spells over them. I don’t know whether that’s true or not.”Thick black oil paint is smeared on to the canvases, into which Jarman has embedded objects ranging from sticks, a pebble and a circular blade in Dead Souls Whisper, to toy cars, barbed wire and broken crockery in Home Counties. Some paintings include text that draws on the formidably well-read director’s fascination with psychoanalysis, Shakespeare and alchemy; another, called Strange Meeting includes two wedding rings and a protractor, and alludes to the Wilfred Owen poem in which he descends to hell and meets the German soldier he killed in the first world war. Then, in a second tranche of black paintings, there’s Dear God, whose chalked text, laid besides nails and a pressed flower, implores the deity to “send me to hell. Yours sincerely,Derek Jarman.”View image in fullscreen‘He kept flying through the flak’ … Jarman.Photograph: Leonardo CendamoThe paintings’ darkness speaks to a current moment in which LGBTQ+ rights are once again being assaulted around the world, as fair-weather corporate “friends” take down their rainbow flags for fear of getting on the wrong side of Donald Trump and other authoritarians. It’s also apt that the black paintings are being exhibited at the same time as theUK Aids Memorial Quiltbeing displayed in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, each homemade panel commemorating a beloved friend, partner or family member whose life was prematurely claimed by the disease in the 80s and 90s.Yet for the modern viewer, there’s also something galvanising about Jarman’s resourcefulness as well as his rage, his protean creativity, and his determination to live his life and make his work regardless of the forces of repression ranged against it. “He kept flying through the flak,” Peake says. “He kept going forward and he was extremely unapologetic about who he was and what he liked to do. Shadowing his work is a great deal of distress and trauma, but you were very seldom aware of it in his company because he was immensely warm, positive and joyful.”Despite his work being unashamedly left-field, Jarman was also a prominent public figure in his later years, in a way that has few – if any – parallels now. I remember him being interviewed on Nicky Campbell’s late night show on BBC Radio 1 in the early 90s when I was a teenager, around the time he published his journals, Modern Nature, which had caused tabloid outrage due to sections in which he described cruising on Hampstead Heath (Sun journalists expected gay men with Aids to become celibate). Jarman chose the Rolling Stones’ You Can’t Always Get What You Want for the DJ to play, but stressed that the title didn’t express what he felt about his life. “I did get what I wanted,” he said. “Or most of it, anyway.”The Assassination of Pier Paolo Pasolini in the Garden of Earthly Delights ispublished by Pilot Press on 7 June, £12. The Black Paintings: A Chronology Part 1 areat Amanda Wilkinson, London, 6 June to 11 July. TheUK Aids Memorial Quilt is at Tate Modern, London, from 12 to 16 June.Explore more on these topicsArt and designPaintingArtDerek JarmanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the lyrics, she states: “You’re not radical … You’re not rad at all,” and that “using feminism to erase the rights of others and endanger them is inherently un-feminist”. It arose from Nash seeing “trans-exclusionary radical feminist” –the contentious term “terf”– as something of a misnomer. Those who espouse gender-critical views are, in her opinion, neither radical nor feminist.The song was written in response to last month’ssupreme court rulingthat the legal definition of “woman” ought to be based on biological sex (a judgement that doctors at the British Medical Association have called “scientifically illiterate”). “I have a lot of trans people in my life that I care about,” Nash tells me on the day the track is released. “This feminist-trans ‘debate’ – it’s not a debate to me. A friend of mine was the victim of a hate crime last year. I took the ruling very personally.” She says the time felt right for her to speak out. “The LGBTQIA+ community supports women so much, and they have been there for me in my life and career. That’s why I think cis women really owe it to trans people to step up at this moment. This song is for that community.”Within hours of the song going live, Nash was trending on X. On the one hand, Nash was praised by LGBTQ+ advocates and allies for showing support for trans people at a time when their rights are being eroded. “A lot of the queer community have been really grateful,” says Nash. “I’ve received some beautiful messages about what it means, when there’s so much uncertainty and fear and a loss of confidence for a lot of trans people. That’s been really moving.”On the other hand, gender-critical voices online suggested that Nash was “enabling abusers” by calling for trans women to be admitted into single-sex spaces. Nash finds the accusation “absurd”. Critiquing different ideologies is important, she says, “but there’s a difference between critical thinking and what’s happening in this debate. I’m really open to nuanced conversations. I was preparing myself for this really amazing argument that stitches me up, a big ‘gotcha’ moment’. But all the insults are calling me old, a bint, a slag, a has-been. I’m shocked at how juvenile and misogynistic the comments are.”View image in fullscreenKate Nash performing live in April.Photograph: Lorne Thomson/Redferns“Germ”, Nash is aware, is another insult now added into the mix. “I’m taking my artistic liberty there as a musician – I can be highbrow and I can be lowbrow. But I also do think it’s important for feminists to voice that transphobia is not feminist, so I stand by it.” She is ready for the inevitable backlash. “I’ve been trolled since I was 18. Bring it on. I’m OK with whatever insults people want to throw at me – I can handle it. It’s not going to be as difficult as what a trans person is having to go through at this moment.” She hopes the song encourages others to speak up despite it being such a divisive subject. “It felt like a scary thing to voice, because it’s this hot topic, but as a musician you can make something that’s quite fun and catchy and a little bit empowering.”Nash has long been an advocate for women’s rights, calling herself a feminist in interviews since she started releasing witty, acerbic songs in the mid-2000s, before Taylor Swift and Beyoncé made the term a pop cultural concern. She is worried that the label has been hijacked by a gender-critical group who are “very vocal and very organised”, and that resources would be better spent finding solutions to more pressing problems faced by women, such as sexual violence and femicide, which occuroverwhelminglyat the hands of men.View image in fullscreenSpeaking out … a still from the video for Germ.Photograph: YouTube/Kate Nash“Taking away the rights of vulnerable people who are not a threat is obviously the wrong thing to be doing,” she says. “I’m not willing to trample on people that have less autonomy over their bodies and less safety in the world than me in order to ‘protect myself’. I do not think cis women are more important or better than trans people.”Nash also made headlines earlier in the year by announcing she was selling photos on OnlyFans to help subsidise her tour. This was done in part to make a serious point about the ways the music industry is failing artists, especially those from working-class backgrounds: “Artists can’t make money from touring and they can’t make money from recorded music.” Nash explains that touring comes with a whole raft of costs, such as renting a tour bus, paying for a band and crew, food, petrol, hotels. Streaming was “built unethically from the start”, she says, with major labels and streaming services defining the terms and conditions – not artists – and not updating pre-streaming contracts to reflect the new reality. “Who you listen to isn’t where your money directly goes, and I don’t think that’s right. The way the music industry has been structured, historically, has been exploiting artists. And we’ve been exploited yet again.”Kate Nash looks back: ‘I trusted the wrong people with my money and had to move back in with my parents; 15 female wrestlers saved me ...’Read moreNash has personal experience of the shadier side of the business. Her former managermisappropriated large amountsof her money during the mid-2010s. (They reached an out-of-court settlement.) During a lengthy legal battle, Nash had to move back in with her parents. “It was a really difficult thing for me to experience,” she says. “But overall I think it’s informed me, and I feel capable of speaking on issues like this now. I feel really empathetic to artists – it’s made me aware of how toxic the environment is.”The decision to sell her pictures online drew criticism, with people accusing Nash of being a bad influence on young girls. “I’m a fantastic influence for young girls,” she counters. “I’ve fought my entire career for young women – representation is extremely important to me.” The photos were also a way of taking control of her sexuality. As an actor on Netflix series Glow, “I’ve been naked on TV,” she says. “I’ve simulated a threesome. I use my body all the time on stage to move, to sing, to connect with an audience. But if I’m completely in control of it, that’s ‘wrong’. Is it wrong? Our bodies are so politicised, and the world has an opinion about how to prevent us from being able to make choices about them.”Last weekend, Nash premiered Germ at the Mighty Hoopla festival along with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Later this month she will headline Glastonbury’s Left Field stage on the Saturday night. She is excited to play the song in front of an audience: “I think that will be quite a punk, exciting moment in the set.”Nash is undeterred by the internet noise the song has caused. “I mean, sure, attack me online, but I’m still right,” she says. “I wanted to leave a record in musical history of a feminist who is outspoken as a cis woman: this is my opinion, and I don’t want the loudest cultural voice in the room to be anti-trans. That is not what feminism has taught me.”Explore more on these topicsKate NashGenderPop and rockTransgenderFeminismLGBTQ+ rightsWomennewsShareReuse this content"

When our opponent isn’t a state, it’s easier to rationalise our failure to stop them causing us pain if there’s super-villain lore around them. That a lone Venezuelan called Ilich Ramírez Sánchez could become the scourge of top intelligence agencies would be a humiliation; rebadge him as the impressive “Carlos the Jackal” and we can cope. As the Israeli-made Storyville documentary The Jackal Speaks: Inside the Mind of a Mass Murderer profiles Sánchez and interviews him, that mystique evaporates.After growing up in Caracas in a family home that has a cook, a cleaner, a gardener and a large photograph of Stalin on the wall, the teenage Sánchez is relocated to London and then Moscow in the late 1960s, dismaying his father – and, in the Soviet Union, annoying the KGB – with his preference for partying over studying. In 1969 he enrols with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), fighting for them in the Black September conflict in Jordan and, most likely, conducting his first solo mission by attempting to assassinate the vice-president of the British Zionist Federation in London in 1973.View image in fullscreenCarlos the Jackal in an airport, in disguise, from a Stasi surveillance photo.Photograph: BBC/Bundesarchiv, Stasi-Unterlagen-Archiv/Kan/Kuma StudiosIn the film, Sánchez denies that one, but it’s definitely him firing rocket-propelled grenades at Israeli passenger jets at Orly airport in 1975. When an informant turns on him by revealing his location to Paris police, Sánchez kills his former associate and two of the officers who arrive to arrest him. Now internationally notorious, he’s nicknamed Carlos the Jackal, the moniker coming half from his South American heritage, and half froma Guardian journalist visiting the flat of an ex-girlfriend of Sánchezand noticing a copy of The Day of the Jackal by Frederick Forsyth. As if to reward the media’s interest, “Carlos the Jackal” pulls off his biggest job when he and his team take dozens of hostages at an Opec summit in Vienna in December 1975, acting on behalf of the PFLP and Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.View image in fullscreenIlich Ramírez Sánchez, AKA Carlos the Jackal.Photograph: BBC/Bundesarchiv/Stasi-Unterlagen-Archiv/Kan/Kuma StudiosAll this is recalled using the usual documentary mix of biographers, experts and retired spies, boosted by a telephone interview with the imprisoned Sánchez himself, conducted in 2021 by director Yaron Niski. When the supply of evocative archive footage runs out and there’s nothing for the star of the show to talk over, the film resorts to slightly comical images of Niski with a phone to his ear, dramatically shot in small rooms half-lit by the dim glow from a single window.Still, it must be worth it for an exclusive chat with the former most wanted man in the world? Barely. Sánchez, rambling unchallenged down an indistinct line, is hard to follow even when you can make out what he’s saying, which isn’t always. He doesn’t offer any insight into why he chose the Palestinian cause, or why he was drawn to political violence. He doesn’t sound like a criminal mastermind; instead, the overall impression is that he was narcissistic enough to believe he could get away with outrageous schemes, and psychopathic enough to do the cold-blooded killing. That, rather than any piercing strategic or political vision, was enough.Chiefly, Sánchez’s contributions are notable for their Trumpian self-aggrandisement: “I was the best shot. I shot better than anyone else,” he says of his formative months at a PFLP training camp. “The only person who could maybe direct such an operation in such a short time is … Carlos!” he claims, talking about how silly Col Gaddafi hadn’t left enough time to plan his attack on the Opec meeting, so Sánchez graciously bailed him out.The tapes also reveal Sánchez to be quite the creepy misogynist. He looks to reinforce the legend that he is a philanderer by commenting on the quality of the women in the many countries he’s lived in, an observation that usually comes with an approving reference to how “clean” these conquests were. The love of his life, Frankfurt Revolutionary Cells member Magdalena Kopp, receives the special accolade “very clean, everywhere”.It might seem trivial to worry about the icky gender politics of a mass-murdering mercenary, but this guy has been romanticised as international terrorism’s answer to James Bond – a man of mystery as suave as he is elusive. Close up, he gives off loner vibes, and the photos we see of his various guises don’t burnish his cool-villain credentials, either: he almost always looks like a beady uncle whom female guests have to avoid at a wedding disco. The picture that has become an icon, where he’s wearing wraparound shades, is the only one where he looks badass. The story was that the people employed to keep us safe were given the runaround by a unique force of evil, a ghost; it now seems they actually spent years chasing a loser.The Jackal Speaks: Inside the Mind of a Mass Murderer aired on BBC Four and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewCarlos the JackalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Might they be better off without Spotify et al?Eamonn FordeTue 3 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 10.02 EDTShareThere is a battle gripping the music business today around the manipulation of streaming services – and innocent indie artists are the collateral damage.Fraudsters are flooding Spotify, Apple Music and the rest with AI-generated tracks, to try and hoover up the royalties generated by people listening to them. These tracks are cheap, quick and easy to make, with Deezer estimating in April that over20,000 fully AI-created tracks– that’s 18% of new tracks – were being ingested into its platform daily, almost double the number in January. The fraudsters often then use bots, AI or humans to endlessly listen to these fake songs and generate revenue, while others are exploiting upload services to get fake songs put on real artists’ pages and siphon off royalties that way.Spotify fines the worst offenders and says it puts “significant engineering resources and research into detecting, mitigating, and removing artificial streaming activity”, whileApple Musicclaims “less than 1% of all streams are manipulated” on its service. That may sound encouraging, but in a streaming business worth$20.4bn globally(according to the IFPI), it’s likely that hundreds of millions of dollars are being skimmed off annually by rogue operators.Part of the problem is that while the barriers of entry for musicians have been dramatically lowered – uploading songs to streaming services is much easier than manufacturing CDs or vinyl – the barriers of entry for fraudsters are lower too. So the industry has declared war, but hair-trigger automated detection systems mean that artists are seeing their music taken offline even when they’ve done nothing wrong.View image in fullscreenSpotify’s New York headquarters.Photograph: John Nacion Imaging/ShutterstockDarren Owen, chief operating officer of music distribution company Fuga, suggests streaming fraud “started to blow up across the industry” around 2021. Grappling with it now makes up 50% of his workload.Using AI and machine learning, Fuga gives streaming patterns a “severity score”, separating out “non-human listening patterns” to spot fraud. “You’re not going to listen to the same song at the same time across multiple devices,” Owen says, noting that countries like India, Vietnam, Thailand and parts of eastern Europe are hotbeds of click-farm activity, using low-paid workers. “It’s become clear that organised criminals are involved in it as well.”It is not just services like pimpyourfollower.de in Germany – which was taken offline after a court injunction – and others in Canada and Brazil who are being targeted by record industry trade bodies for offering artificially inflated streams. Universal Music Group (UMG), the biggest record company in the world, has been accused by Drake of conspiring to increase the play count of Kendrick Lamar’s diss track Not Like Us, an allegation UMG denies.The Guardian has spoken to multiple artists who found themselves at the sharp end of this war on manipulation, where unexpected spikes in streams get taken as proof of guilt.Darren Hemmings is managing director of music marketing company Motive Unknown and a musician himself. His distributor recently informed him that a track on one EP, having jumped from “a few plays a day” to more than 1,000, was guilty of manipulation. “I wouldn’t blame them for drawing that conclusion,” he says, but “it’s very judge, jury, executioner”. He did not manipulate the streams, but could not identify the root cause – other than it simply becoming popular with actual listeners.Northern Irish rock band Final Thirteen had some of their music taken off streaming services due to a spike in the tens of thousands. They suspect this came after a play on Radio 1, but their distributor automatically concluded they were manipulated. “It’s really hard for any artist to prove that they didn’t [manipulate streams], but it’s even harder forSpotifyto prove that they did,” says their drummer, Doobes. “[They] take it down and that’s it.”View image in fullscreenMatthew Whiteside of The Night With …Photograph: Julie HowdenAdam J Morgan, who makes music as indie act Naked & Baked, had a track get over 10,000 streams in a week, possibly from use in a TikTok video, but it was zapped by his distributor RouteNote as suspicious. “I hadn’t done anything wrong and they didn’t provide any evidence,” he says, believing it was down to an overly anxious RouteNote. “I spent that weekend trying to work out what was going on, but Spotify said my music hadn’t been flagged at all.” RouteNote did not respond to a request for an interview.Takedowns can cause musicians inconvenience, derail marketing and cost them money. Matthew Whiteside, artistic director of experimental classical event The Night With… (and head of the TNW Music label) had three different albums taken down amid claims of artificial streaming. He tracked it back: TNW Music tracks were being added to manipulated playlists. “It made no sense [why they were added] based on the genre.” His distributor said he could resubmit the album again, at $40 per album, but with no guarantee it would not be removed again.“Streaming in general is geared against the smaller and the niche,” he says. “If we get 1,000 streams a month on an album, I’d be very happy.” As such, paying to resubmit an album is beyond their release budget.Deezer claims it was the first streaming service to implement fraud detection systems. “We look at a lot of indicators that help our algorithm decide if a user is fraudulent or not,” says Thibault Roucou, the company’s royalties and reporting director. “When we ask for a takedown, we look manually at what’s happening and we’re very confident that it is extreme manipulation.”Unfortunately, systems elsewhere for taking down tracks often presume guilt and the appeals system is so arduous that small acts, already struggling, just give up. Pop singer Levina, who represented Germany at Eurovision in 2017, saw her music taken off streaming services without warning – it was flagged because she unintentionally had the same name as another artist. “With streaming services, it’s almost impossible to [appeal] through them,” she sighs. “You fill out a form but it leaves you quite powerless.”View image in fullscreenLevina, chair of the artist council within the Featured Artists Coalition.Photograph: Sam RockmanShe is also chair of the artist council within trade body Featured Artists Coalition, and they are finalising “minimum standards for what distributors should be doing”. She proposes a traffic light warning system that allows acts time to present their defence or take action to address the problems.Streaming services and distributors now accept this battle is about containment rather than total elimination. Owen, however, says the latest iteration is not fraudsters manipulating the streams of a few tracks by large amounts, but rather boosting multiple tracks a small amount to fly under detection radars.For Hemmings, this could result in a two-tier streaming economy, with smaller acts abandoning the main streaming platforms, where earnings are derisory anyway, to focus on a service such as Bandcamp. “This could provoke a conclusion among large swathes of the independent music community that they’re just better off focusing on other ways to make money.”Explore more on these topicsMusic streamingMusic industrySpotifyApple MusicIndieDigital music and audioArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

Now, for the movie’s 50th, it’s doing it again … but with a Lord of the Rings Harfoot. Brace yourself for SHARK! Celebrity Infested WatersStuart HeritageTue 3 Jun 2025 09.42 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 10.08 EDTShareJaws turns 50 this year – a momentous occasion for arguably the most influential movie ever made. After all, we are talking about a piece of entertainment that – for better or worse – we are still living through. This sort of anniversary doesn’t come around very often and, now that we are witnessing the slow death of the theatrical experience, it deserves to be commemorated in the most lavish way possible. By this, I mean that ITV should gently lowerRoss Nobleinto shark-infested waters.And I am not the only one who thinks this, since ITV has just announced the lineup of its new “wildlife crossover format” SHARK! Celebrity Infested Waters, in which some famous people will swim with sharks for a bit. Or, to quote the press release, “a group of ocean-phobic celebrities confront their greatest fear – sharks. Throughout their adrenaline-fuelled, challenge-heavy journey in the Bahamas – the shark capital of the world – these A-listers will push past their limits to come nose to nose with nature’s ‘villains’.” The lineup in full isAde Adepitan,Helen George,Sir Lenny Henry, Ross Noble,Dougie Poynter,Lucy PunchandRachel Riley.Now, if this sounds at all familiar to you, it might be because you’re old enough to remember the show ITV made to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Jaws. That show was entitled Celebrity Shark Bait, and it saw Richard E Grant,Amy Nuttalland others being gently lowered into shark-infested waters. And it wasn’t very good, to the point that at times it felt like a thorough scientific experiment to make the least interesting shark-based TV programme possible. The jeopardy was minimal. The celebrity reactions were muted. The shark footage wasn’t particularly spectacular. When it was broadcast, theManchester Evening Newscalled it “the biggest waste of time of them all”.So why do it again? Well, there are two competing arguments. The first is that nobody watches linear TV any more, so ITV hasn’t really got anything to lose by remaking a 20-year-old flop. The second is that, if you parse the press release closely enough, you can just about tell that this is an attempt to improve upon what went before.Yes, the ITVness of it is the celebrity aspect – part of the show has clearly been designed to appeal to the very specific subsection of people who want to see Rachel Riley have a panic attack in a swimsuit – but there does seem to be more of a conservation focus this time too. The press release points out that, as well as almost getting eaten, the celebrities will “come to appreciate sharks’ valuable place on the food chain and in our ecosystem”.Better still, the show actively seems to want to commemorate Jaws by undoing some of the harm it has done to the reputation of sharks. That is, unless Henry gets his leg bitten off along the way, because that probably wouldn’t help a lot.So is it silly? Yes. Does it signify that ITV is running out of ideas? Yes. Does it have the very worst title you have ever seen? Yes, and quite frankly the government should step in and legislate against television shows with names that you’re expected to yelp at. But does SHARK!CelebrityInfested Waters have potential? Absolutely.In fact, so odd is the format of the show’s name that a franchise seems likely. If SHARK! Celebrity Infested Waters is a success, then maybe we can expect other shows about animals that modern culture has taught us to fear, like BEAR! Celebrity Infested Forests, or SPIDER! Celebrity Infested Attics. Look me in the eye and tell me that you wouldn’t want to see Peter Andre and Adam Woodyatt star in a series called FISH THAT SWIMS UP YOUR URINE STREAM AND GETS LODGED IN YOUR URETHRA! Celebrity Infested Rivers. I know I would.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionReality TVCelebrityWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Guardian’s Mark Lawson praised last year’s collaboration between Enoch and Harvey, who he said couldn’t“disguise the play’s peculiarities but proves its beauties to be equally deep and its political intelligence acute”.A two-part production of The Forsyte Saga, which is based on John Galsworthy’s books, comes to the Swan theatre in November 2025 after a successful run last year at the Park theatre in London.Josh Roche’s production has won plaudits already, with the Observer praising the minimalist approach. Susannah Clapp said “the family epic unfolds with intimate clarity on an almost bare stage”, adding that – although the two parts could be seen separately – it was“satisfying to see them in one gulp”. There will be 14 opportunities to see the productions in one sitting during the run, which ends on 10 January 2026.The production isn’t without its controversies: arape scenehorrified some viewers when the books were adapted for television by the BBC in 1967 andITV in 2002.View image in fullscreenAlfred Enoch will star in Tamara Harvey’s Henry V.Photograph: Anthony Ghnassia/Getty Images for DunhillThe outgoing artistic director of the Bush theatre, Lynette Linton brings a new musical adaptation of William Kamkwamba’s award-winning memoir, The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, to the Swan theatre next February.Other productions include Daniel Raggett directing Sam Heughan and Lia Williams, who will star in Macbeth; while Whitney White brings All Is But Fantasy, an ambitious production billed as “four stories staged across two gig-theatre performances set against a live soundtrack of rock, pop, indie and gospel”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s the dilemma at the heart of Hunia Chawla’s play Permission. Set across continents, on rooftops in Karachi and in university halls in London, it follows Hanna (generously performed by Anisa Butt), a young Pakistani woman with a rebellious spirit, who moves across the world in search of independence.View image in fullscreenRea Malhotra Mukhtyar in Permission.Photograph: Adam RazviChawla’s writing is knotty and crackles with conflict. Hanna feels stifled by the patriarchal structures of her home town, which prevent her from walking the streets alone or dating without fear of being stopped by the police. But life in London brings with it its own confinements. Here, she meets Anushe (a straight-talking Rea Malhotra Mukhtyar), a third-year student who encourages her to join protests against the university’s acceptance of funding from arms dealers – overlooking that speaking out carries far greater risks for someone like Hanna, who is living in the UK on a visa.Ultimately, neither Karachi nor London gives Hanna the full life of autonomy she craves. The comparisons between the cities feel nuanced and layered, showing how systems of control operate in different contexts. Behind the politics, though, is a platonic love story. While Hanna leaves for London, her best, friend Minza (also played by Mukhtyar) chooses to stay and study in Karachi, joining the Aurat Marches on the city’s streets.Despite their distance and growing differences, their friendship lives on through phone calls. The pair’s conversation bounces from teenage anxieties to bigger discussions about women’s rights. Directed by Neetu Singh, it is in these scenes of dialogue where the play lands on its quietest, most intimate flashes. But their affection is not quite enough to wipe away the play’s creative inconsistencies.It starts with Butt, as Hanna, performing one side of a conversation; immediately, Permission centres itself as a story about women’s experiences. Later, though, the voices of other male characters begin to play through speakers. What emerges is a play that feels torn between competing impulses.There are other gripes, too. Audience interaction is thrown in a little too late to feel authentic, while a scene where Hanna is found smoking weed by her father appears to have no consequences. It’s frustrating, as Permission has the beginnings of something truly unique, but too many decisions lack clear reasoning, leaving the play’s bold ideas only partially realised.Permission is atTara theatre, London, from 30 May until 7 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatrePakistanWomenreviewsShareReuse this content"

In it, his all-male company were dressed in the full frills of traditional women’s flamenco dresses, pulling at the seams of the dance form’s carefully constructed gender roles. New work Muerta de Amor may have less overt a concept, but it’s still rich in originality, with a few genius moments (and he hasn’t completely jettisoned dresses). This time it’s out with the polka dots and in with sleek black fashiony takes on flamenco costume – sheer top, kilt-style skirt, long leather jacket. In power poses behind a row of mic stands the men look like a still-handsome boyband on their multimillion-dollar reunion tour.The show’s title might talk of the death of love, but desire – physical and emotional – are very much pulsatingly alive here, alongside vulnerability, angst, passion and humour. With Liñán, his six dancers and the band, is the mighty singer Mara Rey, who can blow your socks off with husky volume and dramatic chutzpah. But in this show, everyone sings, like a series of monologues (I say it every year, but with lyrics so central, some surtitles for non-Spanish speakers would be helpful).View image in fullscreen‘The singing’s good, but the dancing is excellent’ … Manuel Liñán, right, alongside the show’s dancers/singers.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThe singing’s good, but the dancing is excellent. From the fantastic chemistry between Liñán and Miguel Heredia, mirroring each other’s moves with relish, to the balletic flourish of José Ángel Capel. Liñán sits back on a chair to be regaled by Juan Tomás de la Molia’s torrent of footwork, full of peacocking prowess, jabbing at syncopations with sharp heels, racing neck-and-neck with the music, the rhythm driving through him just like the copious testosterone. The mood is flirtatious, and exhilarating. Best of all is a duet with Alberto Sellés, less blistering, more tender, more ambiguous. Liñán is most effective when forging specific gestures, knowing when not to move, to hold back rather than splurge everything out.I’ve never known a flamenco dancer who believed in the maxim “leave them wanting more”, and by the long final section, there’s more in this show than necessary. It risks undermining itself in an eruption of pleasure, ego and neediness, but that’s basically the show’s whole theme.

In this case, it’s Poppie Jae Hughes, having the time of her life hissing and snarling, caked in makeup and rocking some evil looking prosthetic fangs. Perhaps Hughes outclasses the adults so easily because her role doesn’t require much in the way of dialogue. The rest of the cast are mostly British actors hamming it up with absurd sounding “southern” American accents that range widely across the territory below the Mason-Dixon line. Compelled to deliver way more dialogue than they can feasibly handle given their meagre performing skills, it’s not pretty.Otherwise this is a cheap as chips but not unamusing farrago that unfolds in a wee vampire community known as Bogieville, a trailer park where visitors either become lunch or never leave. The latter seems to be the fate of unlucky couple Ham (Arifin Putra) and Jody (Eloise Lovell Anderson) who stumble on Bogieville accidentally, and are chosen by the sole non-vampiric resident, caretaker Crawford (Hanathan Hansler), to look after the community after he dies someday. While the young lovers are subjected to vast wodges of verbal exposition and clunky flashbacks from Crawford, the film occasionally cuts away to the police and a doctor (Angela Dixon) who have cottoned on to the bloodsuckers’ presence in the vicinity and are out to hunt them down.Director Sean Cronin also plays Bogieville’s undead leader; every line of his dialogue is rendered in a subsonic, incomprehensible growl, which sort of goes for his directing style too. At least the makeup and the gore effects are competently executed, making the ensemble look like blood smeared meat-puppets on a rampage.Bogieville is on digital platforms from 9 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

He was a 20-year-old poet who had lived through paediatric cancer, Ewing’s sarcoma. The cancer came back and he died five years later but in that time Ruhl and Ritvo wrote letters to each other with thoughts on life, death, God, faith and nothingness. That became the basis of a book published in 2018, two years after Ritvo’s death.Now adapted for the stage, they form a kind of modern-day Aristotelian dialogue, written by Ruhl (who previously wrote the epistolary play,Dear Elizabeth). Under the direction of Blanche McIntyre, Max (Eric Sirakian) and Sarah (Sirine Saba) variously become teacher and student for each other, and of life rather than merely playwriting. They walk past or around each other, not touching but sometimes in close proximity. The intimacies are in their words.It is an aural experience above all else. You see the beauty and richness of these words and thoughts on the page. Rather than becoming emotionally devastating, it is a contained and cerebral piece. The poise has grace – but also emotional distance.Dick Bird’s set design manifests the spiritual idea of looking through a glass darkly; there is a mirrored screen in the middle of the stage and the traverse seating arrangement sets up the same division. Sometimes, you see two versions of Max – the real and the mirror reflection. It builds visual metaphors on the abstruseness of life and death, albeit rather effortfully.Saba is a compelling and solid presence on stage, deliberately holding back emotion as Max slides further into serious illness. Sirakian is initially playful and already slightly other-worldly. The programme tells us that Sirakian knew Ritvo at Yale – he was a fellow student in Ruhl’s class – which gives his performance an added layer.Stunning cello accompaniment, composed by Laura Moody, acquires its own voice amid the spoken dialogue. There is a magnificent solo recreation of Philip Glass’s Einstein on the Beach, and a thrillingly atmospheric sequence of rainfall tapped on the wood of the cello to accompany a poem about rain.While it certainly captures a sense of expressing the ineffable on stage, you do not get the mess of Ritvo’s emotions and his closest relationships (he suddenly announced that he is getting married out of the blue). There is something rather curated in this withholding. In a race against death, he is in a rush to get his poetry out, rather like John Keats in the face of TB (who also died at 25). You hear he is scared, as one strand of thought, and that he’s bitter, as another, but the play quickly returns to its intellectual topics, as if ballast against dangerously uncontained emotion. There is a singular moment of eruption, when he shouts “I DON’T HAVE TIME” and this stands out. It is startling, angry, real and felt.AtHampstead theatre, London, until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreDeath and dyingCancerreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her gravestone declares her a poet; posterity knows her as the author of 22 short, indelibly strange and subversive novels. In life, she was by turns an editor, critic, biographer, playwright, Jewish Gentile, Catholic convert, divorcee, abandoning mother, spy. As Frances Wilson observes in this canny biography, she looks in every photograph as if she is played by a different actor, so drastic are the changes in her face and style. From precocious Edinburgh schoolgirl to unhappy Rhodesian wife, spirited London bohemian to poised Roman socialite, Spark made an art of unsettling transformations. She was the queen of narrative control, not least the narrative of her own life.She was also the enemy of biographers, a pursuer of lawsuits who managed to delay the publication of her own authorised biography by seven years (“a hatchet job; full of insults”, she said, unjustly), and went to war with the former lover who wrote two accounts of her life. And yet she didn’t hide her traces, leaving for researchers not one but two vast archives, of her personal papers and her working process, neatly organised in box files that total the length of an Olympic swimming pool.It’s Wilson’s belief that Spark was playing a cat and mouse game with the future, packing her novels with clues and cryptic mementoes from her own past. Rather than the conventional cradle to grave, Wilson’s focus here is on the first 39 years of Spark’s life, culminating in the publication of her debut novel, The Comforters,in 1957: “the years of turbulence, when everything was piled on”. This doesn’t mean that later masterpieces like A Far Cry from Kensington or Loitering With Intent are ignored, but rather mined for evidence of their real-life antecedents. Time slips and shuttles, fittingly for a writer who was such a master of prolepsis, those devastating little glimpses into the future that make novels like The Driver’s Seat and The Girls of Slender Means so uncanny.A formidable student, whose first poem was anthologised at the age of 12, Camberg didn’t go to university. Her parents – ordinary class, in her estimation – were too poor, and so instead she took a precis-writing course and a position in a school, where she learned shorthand in lieu of pay. Her next job was as a secretary, this time for hard cash, which she spent on the jazz dances at which she met her future husband, Sydney Oswald Spark, known as Ossie. “I thought him interesting,” she said, and: “I didn’t know that a girl could break away and get herself a flat.”It wasn’t a happy marriage. Ossie had failed to mention that he was subject to violent paranoia, under psychiatric care, and no longer employable as a teacher in Britain due to his erratic behaviour. In 1937, the couple married in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, now Harare, Zimbabwe. By Christmas she was pregnant and trapped amid the stultifying, amoral racism of the settlers. “He was camouflaged in the colony,” Wilson writes of Ossie, “in the sense that his illness, which took the form of berserk and violent outbursts, was indistinguishable from the berserk and violent outbursts of those settlers who didn’t suffer from Ossie’s condition.” After he tried to shoot Muriel, she escaped with her two-year-old son Robin and his nanny.Brilliant, beautiful and disinclined to conceal her talent or ambition, Spark was much desired and much despised in LondonThe war meant it took her five years to get home. She left Robin in a Catholic boarding school, and fled via Cape Town. Though she eventually managed to get Robin to Edinburgh, where he was raised by her parents, she would never live with him again. This is considered one of the Great Crimes of Muriel, along with the supposed fact that she concealed her identity as a Jew. It was Robin, victim of the first, who was her accuser in the second. In adulthood he converted to Orthodoxy, and announced to the world that Spark’s mother was not a Gentile but a Jewish convert (her father was Jewish, a fact she hadn’t concealed). Nonsense, retorted Spark, salting the wound by saying of her only child: “He’s never done anything for me except for being one big bore.” But her cruelty conceals the desperate attempts she made in London to find herself a job and a new husband, so that she could get custody and provide a home for her young son. The law, in its wisdom, had granted custody to a violent man in psychiatric care rather than the woman who fled from him.Brilliant, beautiful and disinclined to conceal her talent or ambition, Spark was much desired and much despised in London. After working in black propaganda during the war, she became general secretary of the Poetry Society and soon after editor of its journal, the Poetry Review. The society was an internecine and antiquated establishment that she attempted to drag into the 20th century. This was not a success. Her close encounter with irrationality and malevolence, which later provided satirical material for Loitering With Intent, left her isolated and determined to make her own way as a writer.Before the novels began, Spark underwent one last enormous transformation. In the early 1950s, she suffered a breakdown, precipitated by her use of Dexedrine as a diet pill, and converted to Catholicism. From now on God was in charge, even if her faith was distinctly unconventional. She believed in angels and liked miracles, but was pro-choice, didn’t go to confession, and tended to skip the tedium of the sermon, arriving just in time for the eucharist.It’s interesting that Wilson describes Spark as being unable to grasp that misogyny was her real enemy, the disguised combatant behind many of her episodes of paranoia. She certainly saw it in her books. It’s hard to think of a more knowing account of male violence against women than her short story The Portobello Road, with its beyond-the-grave narrator, murdered in a haystack. I suspect the real reason Spark didn’t participate in the struggles of feminism was that she believed the earthly world would always be divided into the powerful and the powerless, and that her task was to record the struggle. Laughter was her weapon, a purifying absurdity – a “derisive undermining of what was wrong,” as she once put it. Give them enough rope and they’ll hang themselves, you feel her thinking, the pompous and the cruel, the self-serving and self-deceiving.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

To read them is to be inducted into a code, to move between the lines, to grasp both the stock phrase and the terrible unsaid that lurks behind it. Pleasurable and interesting as this biography is, it feels as if it misses the point of the impersonal in Spark’s approach. Her own life is in there, for sure, but distilled into its purest form, which is to say a human comedy, where dark forces seem to triumph, unaware that they are being skewered by a sharp and all-seeing eye.Olivia Laing’s new novel, The Silver Book, will be published in November.

The social and political turbulence of the decade provides the perfect landscape for Claire Lynch’s dual-timeline debut novel A Family Matter, which alternates between 1982 and the present day. On the surface, it is the story of a father-daughter relationship. Heron – an elderly man deeply fond of rules and routine – has recently received a terminal cancer diagnosis, but rather than share it with his grownup daughter, Maggie, who now has a family of her own, he chooses to bear the burden alone. As we learn that Heron raised Maggie by himself, it’s clear this urge to shield his only child from harm is a continuous theme. There is no mention of another parent, just that Heron was divorced many decades ago; it’s only when Lynch takes us back to 1982 that we discover the true story.When Maggie was a toddler, her 23-year-old mother, Dawn, met another woman at a jumble sale. It was a chance encounter, and they clicked. Hazel, a newly qualified primary school teacher, had recently moved to the town, and Dawn was flustered by Hazel’s obvious life experience, feeling that “her mouth was full of all the things she would say if she wasn’t too embarrassed to put herself into words”. Hazel is equally smitten, and as the intensity between the two women grows, it isn’t long before their friendship develops into a romance. A secret romance to begin with, not just because Dawn is married to Heron and her life is dedicated to their beloved Maggie, but because 1980s provincial Britain was far more attached to the idea of a nuclear family than it was to the concept of true love. “You wanted to collect the set, the wedding, the house, the baby?” Hazel asks. “I didn’t know you were allowed not to,” Dawn replies.The brutal and savage words spoken during Maggie’s custody hearing are taken from real-life court transcriptsProvincial secrets, however, have a habit of escaping, and inevitably Dawn must explain herself to Heron, because her sexuality was “something she had always known, as deep and bright as bone”. A product of his environment, Heron’s reaction is predictable. Tempers flare. Locks are changed. Solicitors are consulted. Both Dawn and Heron are swept along by a system clinging to the archaic belief that a child exposed to same-sex relationships will become damaged. In the custody court, Heron puts his trust in “the men wearing cufflinks”, while Dawn wonders “what combination of arms and eyes and mouth will keep her from looking ashamed”.Present-day Maggie, now with her own (often less than perfect) nuclear family, has no knowledge of her parents’ ancient battle. She just knows that Dawn left, and Heron stayed. However, when terminally ill Heron’s attempts atSwedish death cleaningunearth long-forgotten court documents, Maggie must reframe being abandoned by her mother in the face of this newly found truth.From Zadie Smith’sWhite Teethto Douglas Stuart’sShuggie Bain, literature is peppered with compelling tales of homophobia and prejudice in the 1980s. It is a decade slowly edging closer to being classed as historical fiction, a soothing balm perhaps. However, in this small and powerful story, Lynch forces us to stare bigotry in the eye. She does this not only with smart and often heartbreaking observations of human behaviour, but also by weaving in difficult truths. Her author’s note reveals that the brutal and savage words spoken during Maggie’s custody hearing are taken from real-life court transcripts. At the time, almost all lesbian mothers involved in divorce cases like Dawn’s lost legal custody of their children.One of the most important roles of a writer is to give a platform to those less often noticed. Not only does Lynch’s novel lend a voice to the many thousands of people who were forced to remain silent, bound by the prejudice of “different times”, it shouts that injustice from its pages.A Family Matter by Claire Lynch is published by Chatto & Windus (£16.99).

In 2024, students at New York’s Columbia University set up outdoor pro-Palestinian protest encampments, fillingEast Butler Lawnwith tents; this was in the boisterous tradition of the 1960s anti-Vietnam-war campus demonstrations and the Occupy Wall Street movement, demanding an end to Columbia’s direct and indirect investment in Israel. The protests were led by the calm and personable figure of studentMahmoud Khaliland protesters were entitled to point out that Columbia had, after all, divested from Russia over Ukraine.The protests carried on and spread to other universities in the US, and Columbia president Minouche Shafik came under immense pressure. The encampment escalated to the occupation of a university building, which gave the university authorities the pretext they needed forsending in the NYPD, and the protest was violently, acrimoniously (but not completely) halted.To my newborn son: I am absent not out of apathy, but conviction | Mahmoud KhalilRead moreAnd what did it achieve? This question is, for me, where the documentary is flawed. The protesters failed to get Columbia to divest, butShafik quitand pro-Palestinian consciousness was raised. Khalil is smilingly interviewed at the end, stating his belief that this cause is approaching success. But that interview was presumably filmed before the new brutality of the Trump administration and the outrageous arrest of Khalil, who is now held in a Louisiana jail, and was only recentlyallowed to see his infant son. Was the Trump administration reacting with typical spite and malice to the encampments? Maybe. That is now a very big part of the story which this film can’t accommodate, except with some sentences over the final credits. Perhaps the full story of the encampments has yet to be told.The Encampments is in UK and Irish cinemas from 6 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsColumbia UniversityUS campus protestsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Life is “one big fucking party” for everyone except Byron (a brilliant breakthrough for Ellis Howard), a working-class teenager desperate to escape constant homophobia and hopelessness. Sex work leads Byron to Nottingham’s underground scene and a fun-loving group called the Fallen Divas. But the party can’t last for ever … It’s a bold and captivating opening episode that doesn’t flinch from exploring the big issues (Byron is only 15 when being paid for sex) and tells the story with authenticity and humour.Hollie RichardsonStoryville: The Jackal Speaks10pm, BBC Four“I killed at least 83 people myself; under my orders there were between 1,500 and 2,000 people killed.

O’Shea does her proud here and is blessed with access to the then 93-year-old – who is as sharp as ever when talking through her experiences. But O’Brien is also tinged with melancholy – a result of a traumatic childhood, an oppressive marriage and the misogynist resentment she faced – not least back in Ireland – due to her frank opinions.Simon WardellIn the Loop (Armando Iannucci, 2009),11.45pm, BBC TwoView image in fullscreenVituperative … Peter Capaldi (left) and James Gandolfini in the 2009 film In the Loop.Photograph: BBC Films/Sportsphoto/AllstarIannucci’s comedy bridges the gap between The Thick of It and Veep by throwing together governmental fools and chancers from the UK and US.

For the son of one of those pioneers, it had a special resonanceMike MacEacheranTue 3 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 3 Jun 2025 04.35 EDTShareAfew years ago, my dad told me of a mountain where I could easily sense another world. “There is a special air and light,” he had said, vaguely. “You just have to walk close to it to feel and see it. Stand in one place and just look up.”The mountain on my dad’s mind that day was the Eiger, Switzerland’s 3,970-metre ogre of limestone and ice. Like few others, the peak exerts a gravitational pull on climbers and it remains the chief symbol of the Bernese Oberland; its most notable feature, the 1,800-metre north face, is the largest in the Alps. This gigantic slab looms over the village of Grindelwald, to the south-east of the town of Interlaken, appearing at sunrise as an immense black spectre in a valley of green.Eiger mapAs well as being a promised land for daredevil mountaineers and other adventurers (bungee jumpers dive into the void from a 90-metre-high platform), Grindelwald is a happy hunting ground for hikers, and last June a themed trail opened on an existing path at the foot of the north face – theEiger Walk of Fame. It was established by Jungfrau Region Tourism to honour the stories of many who pioneered routes up its near-vertical face. So, as Zurich pushes close to 35C (95F), the cooler air of the mountains beckons and I head to the Jungfrau Region for a few days to measure my own experience of this new hiking path against that of the pioneers of Alpinism.It’s easy for me to feel a personal resonance here. My dad, Ian, successfully tackled a hitherto untried route on the north face in August 1970, before I was born, with companionsKenny Spence and Alasdair “Bugs” McKeith. At the time, the expedition by the unemployed, hard-drinking trio from Edinburgh was dubbed reckless. After all, the German nickname for the rock face isMordwand, meaning “murder wall”, and over the decades it has claimed the lives of 72 mountaineers. Now, I’m in Grindelwald, tilting my head towards the sun. Standing in one place as he’d told me to. Just looking up.View image in fullscreenThe writer’s father Ian, centre, with Bugs McKeith, left, and Kenny Spence before they started their successful ascent of the north face in 1970.Photograph: courtesy of Mike MacEacheranOn my first afternoon, I seek out the Walk of Fame, its 1½-mile (2½km) loop leading from the Eiger Express cable car top station, at 2,328metre, to Kleine Scheidegg, meaning “small watershed” in Swiss-German, a low mountain plateau crossed by rail lines and framed by the summits of Jungfrau and Mönch.The mountains look unreal, as if AI-generated, while the stories on the trail offer new perspectives on the achievements of the pastOn the trail, I am completely – wonderfully – alone. The Walk of Fame is shot through with melancholy and romance, bookended by both gravestone-like slabs that recount the mountain’s most pivotal moments at the start of the approximately 2½-hour trail and a memorial overlooking Lake Fallboden. In a valley of many high-altitude, straggling hikes, the view from this trail is the most extraordinary, giving a closer look at 1,000-foot rock pillars, ice fields and snow-filled cracks resembling enormous spider’s webs. Some of the mountains look almost unreal, as if AI-generated, while the stories told along the trail evoke awe and offer new perspectives on the bewildering achievements of the past.I learn about the variety of challenging routes to the summit, an average steepness of 64 degrees, and the trailblazers and unsung heroes who have gone before. There are grim examples too, of those who weren’t as lucky as my dad. The north face was first conquered in July 1938 by a German–Austrian party, including Heinrich Harrer, the author of Seven Years in Tibet. But until 1957, when the first rescue was carried out, bodies were merely retrieved at the base of the face.View image in fullscreenGravestone-like slabs on the Walk of Fame recount key moments in the Eiger’s history.Photograph: Mike MacEacheranThe light beginning to fade, I descend to Lake Fallboden and to Chilchli, once a transformer station for the Jungfrau Railway, but now home to an exhibition. Inside, Eiger stories play out in a sepia photo gallery, and a hand-carved wooden replica of the north face embedded with LEDs lights up with more than 30 seemingly impossible routes. Outside, the summits are mirrored in the still, blue-green water of the lake.Long a Swiss Shangri-la, Grindelwald has hostels and hotels to suit all budgets, yet doesn’t teeter on overdevelopment like so many other Alpine realms. You can bring your own tent, as my dad did in his wilder days, or stay somewhere ritzier such as Bergwelt Grindelwald, my base for three nights. The Eiger and shoulder-to-shoulder peaks Mettenberg and Wetterhorn give a lovely geometry to the valley, particularly when seen at twilight, beer in hand, from one of the resort’s south-facing balconies.Up close to the north face, I really sense Dad’s achievement for the first time. I am filled with admiration and prideThere’s another highly recommended walk, one that involves going down from Grindelwald, not up. The Gletscherschlucht is a 250m-year-old glacier gorge reached by a half-hour amble from the town. The 1¼-mile out-and-back walk rings with the sounds of cascades rushing down the ravine’s sides and the roar of water from the lower Grindelwald glacier as it drains into the Lütschine River. It feels a lot like a wind tunnel, with blasts of glacial air.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My dad passed away last February in the palliative care unit of his local hospital after a battle with vascular dementia, and in his last few days his fingers would tighten when I reminded him of his exploits in the Alps. It was as if he was teasing out pinch grips and holds in his mind. In a small way, I want to pay tribute to his memory.View image in fullscreenThe writer scattered some of his dad’s ashes by the north face.Photograph: Mike MacEacheranI take the lonely path from the Eiger Express top station once more, but this time hike directly east, up and over a saddle to a place where the wind drops and the sheer vertical of the north face really begins. By the end, my dad was non-verbal, his wisdom stripped away, yet on one of my last visits I could sense he was trying to reorganise his brain scaffolding amid the chaos, to grasp a word – any word – to describe the mountain that had meant so much to him. To me, there was never any logic to what he did; but now, up close, I can really sense his achievement for the first time. I am filled with admiration and pride.Out of my rucksack, I pull a biscuit tin containing some of his ashes, searching for a suitable place to scatter them. Perhaps hoping for some form of neat conclusion, I came in the hope of finding a fragment of him up here. I’ve found so much more – a reminder that even when somebody leaves us, there is always something beautiful left behind. Then, I lay his ashes on the rocks, take one last lingering look back, and head down the mountain.The trip was provided byJungfrau Region TourismandJungfrau Railways.

Perhaps it’s the use of small pasta that makes me feel childlike, but either way, it is the kind of recipe that is immensely versatile: it can be an elegant, light spring meal finished with punchy extra-virgin olive oil, an extra sprinkle of pepper and a grating of pecorino, or you could label it kid-friendly and comforting. It’s not exclusively so, but I’d hazard a bet that they’ll enjoy it.Spring meatballs with pasta and peasPrep10 minCook30 minServes41 bunchspring onions, trimmed and finely sliced2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced50g breadcrumbs½ bunchflat-leaf parsley, picked and finely choppedA few mint sprigs, leaves picked and finely chopped400g pork minceJuice and finely grated zestof1 lemonSea salt andblack pepperOlive oil1litre chicken stock, or vegetable stock180g mini pasta150g peas, freshly podded or frozen40g pecorino, gratedPut half the spring onions in a food processor with half the sliced garlic, all the breadcrumbs, half the chopped herbs and all the mince. Add the lemon zest, season generously, then blitz until it all comes together (you can, of course, mix it by hand in a bowl).Roll the mince mixture into small, roughly 2½cm balls. Set a large casserole pot on a medium heat, drizzle in three tablespoons of olive oil and fry the meatballs for about 10 minutes, turning regularly, until browned and gnarly all over.Add the stock to the pan and bring to a boil. Stir in the pasta and peas, then bring back to a boil and simmer for five to seven minutes, until the pasta is tender and the meatballs are cooked through. Off the heat, stir in the lemon juice, then taste the broth and adjust the seasoning as needed. Finish by stirring in the remaining herbs and serve topped with the grated pecorino.Explore more on these topicsFoodPorkSpring food and drinkMeatVegetablesPastaCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

If there’s hummus, cacik or borani in the picture, then it’s a party. Happily, says David Carter, founder ofSmokestak,MantecaandOmain London, “you can get a lot of good stuff in stores these days”. That said, he adds, anything involving vegetables is “always going to be best when made fresh”.If your dip needs lead you to the shops, the trick is to create contrast. Much like getting dressed, you first need to consider the temperature. “Let’s say you have some shop-bought hummus,” Carter says. “If you put that in a pan with a bit of hot water and maybe some lemon juice, then whisk, the hummus will loosen, turn creamy and completely change from the usual fridge-cold stodge.”Next, you’ve then got to accessorise your tub, which means toppings: “A lot of our dips in the restaurants have some form of texture, whether that’s crisp garlic, seeds or crisps,” he says. “If you’ve got something like a silky-smooth labneh and think, how am I going to jazz this up, spiced chickpeas would be one answer.” Similarly, Carter tops hisbaba ganoushwith a “very hot” tahini sauce and some crisp artichokes: “That’s contrast exaggerated.”Sami Tamimi, author ofBoustany(out in June), meanwhile, is not a fan of dips that take a lot of time, which is why you’ll always find yoghurt or labneh in his fridge (“I don’t make my own any more”). They’re an easy win, and can be quickly turned into a dip with the addition of a squeeze of lemon, some garlic and whatever spices or herbs (fresh or dried) you have to hand: “If you’re doing a barbecue – especially if there’s a fatty piece of fish or meat involved – mix yoghurt with tahini, and add a little sun-dried tomato, some garlic, herbs anda lotof lemon juice.”If, like Tamimi, your entertaining MO is to pile a load of dishes in the middle of the table, you also have to draw the line somewhere. For Tamimi, that line is tzatziki: “I just buy it, but the thing with readymade dips is that they don’t taste fresh, so you need to add a bit of zing.” That’s not to say you need to get all fancy, mind: just a squeeze of lemon, a bit of lemon zest and/or some fresh herbs (think mint, coriander) will “bring it to life”. While we’re at it, no one is ever making their own taramasalata (no arguments, please), so head to the shops and that’s a “really nice addition to brunch with bagels and smoked salmon”, Tamimi adds.One dip that you’ll never catch him buying, however, ishummus: “That’s a big no-no. Shop-bought versions have so many stabilisers, they always taste grainy and they’re made with not enough tahini and not enough, well, everything!” Hummus, he insists, should be made fresh (“I boil more chickpeas than I need and freeze half for another day”) and eaten within two days. “There are nicer things you can buy, so, when it comes to hummus, just make it.”Got a culinary dilemma?
