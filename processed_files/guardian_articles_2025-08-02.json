It was a story that not only drew attention to hislinks to a convicted sex offender, it also risked widening a growing wedge between the president and some of his most vociferous supporters. The White House quickly concluded a full-force response was required.It was Tuesday 15 July. The Wall Street Journal had approached Trump’s team, stating it planned to publish allegations that Trump had composeda crude poem and doodleas part of a collection compiled for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday.The claim would have been damaging at any moment, but the timing was terrible for the president. The Epstein issue was developing into the biggest crisis of his presidency. Strident Maga supporters had been angered by the Trump administration’s refusal to release government files relating to the late sex offender.Trump and his loyal press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reached for the nuclear option. From Air Force One, they called the Journal’s British editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker.View image in fullscreenEmma Tucker.Photograph: Bryan Olin Dozier/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThey turned up the heat. Trump fumed that the letter was fake. Drawing wasn’t his thing.Threats were made to sue, a course of action he had previously unleashed against other perceived media enemies.Washington DC began to hum with rumours that the Journal had a hot story on its hands. When no article materialised on Wednesday, some insiders perceived a growing confidence within the White House that their rearguard action had killed the story. They were wrong.DC’s gossip mill had reached fever pitch by Thursday afternoon. The article finally emerged in the early evening. The city collectively stopped to read.In the hours that followed publication, the tension intensified. Trump revealed he had confronted Tucker, stating the story was “false, malicious, and defamatory”. By Friday, he had filed a lawsuit suing the Journal and its owners for at least $10bn (£7.6bn).Tucker was at the centre of a maelstrom of stress and political pressure. It was the greatest challenge of her two and a half years heading the Journal, but far from the first.Two months in, having been parachuted in from London, she was fronting a campaign to have the reporterEvan Gershkovichreturned from a Russian prison. She had also faced denunciations from journalists as she pushed through a modernisation drive that included brutal layoffs. Her plans focused on giving stories a sharper edge. On that metric, the Trump call suggested she was overachieving.Has the Epstein affair strained Trump’s cozy relationship with the Murdoch media empire?Read moreThroughout her rise, an enigmatic quality has surrounded Tucker. Friends, colleagues and even some critical employees describe an amiable, fun and disarmingly grounded person. Many regarded her ability to retain such qualities in the treacherous terrain of the Murdoch empire as uncanny. The puzzle is exacerbated by the assumption she does not share the rightwing, pro-Brexit views ofRupert Murdoch, News Corp’s legendary mogul.Yet Murdoch doesn’t hand the Journal to just anyone. While thepro-Maga Fox Newsis his empire’s cash cow, the Journal is his prized possession, giving him power and respectability in wider US political circles, as the Times does in the UK. So, why Tucker?The answer, according to people who have worked with her, is her possession of two qualities Murdoch rates highly: a willingness to make unpopular decisions for the sake of his businesses and a lust for a politically contentious scoop.View image in fullscreenA message calling on Donald Trump to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein is projected on to the US Chamber of Commerce opposite the White House on 18 July.Photograph: Alex Wroblewski/AFP/GettyLionel Barber, a former Financial Times editor who also worked with Tucker for the FT in Brussels, said: “She has a very sharp nose for a good news story – always did.”Tucker edited the University of Oxford’s student magazine, the Isis, and joined the FT as a graduate trainee. “She was a very convivial colleague, great company and good on a night out, but you knew when it came down to the work, she would nail it,” said a colleague. “Very hard-nosed.”After stints in Brussels and Berlin, she won a powerful ally in Robert Thomson, then the FT’s foreign editor. Thomson became a close friend to Murdoch, a fellow Australian, while working in the US for the FT. Thomson jumped ship to edit the Times of London in 2002 and in 2008 was dispatched to New York to oversee Murdoch’s freshly acquired Journal. Before he went, Thomson helped lure Tucker to the Times, where she eventually became deputy editor.It was her elevation to editor of the Sunday Times in 2020 that seems to have impressed Murdoch. She showed a willingness to make difficult staffing decisions and widened the Sunday Times’s digital ambitions, recasting the pro-Brexit paper to appeal to a wider audience.It was there she made an enemy of her first populist world leader. Just months into her tenure, the Sunday Times published a damning account of how Boris Johnson, the then UK prime minister, had handled the Covid pandemic.Downing Street erupted, taking the unusual step of issuing alengthy rebuttal, denouncing “falsehoods and errors”. The paper was called“the most hostile paper in the country”to Johnson’s government, despite having backed him at the previous year’s election. Rachel Johnson, the former prime minister’s sister, is one of Tucker’s closest friends.View image in fullscreenA New York City vendor poses with a copy of the Wall Street Journal on 29 March 2024 with a mostly blank front page to mark the one-year anniversary of the imprisonment in Russia of the reporter Evan Gershkovich.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty“I don’t think she was ever reckless,” said one Sunday Times staffer. “But I think she absolutely wanted to push the boundaries of getting as much into the public domain as she possibly could.”Many assumed Tucker’s destiny was to edit the Times, but she was catapulted to New York to run the Journal at the start of 2023, immediately embarking on a painful streamlining process.Senior editors were axed. Pulitzer prize winners ditched. The DC bureau, the most powerful, was particularly targeted with layoffs and new leadership.One reporter spoke of people crying, another of the process’s serious mental impact. It made Tucker’s editorship divisive, leading to the extraordinary spectacle of journalists plastering her unoccupied office with sticky notes denouncing the layoffs.Even some who accepted cuts questioned the methods. Several pointed to the use of “performance improvement plans”, with journalists claiming they had been handed unrealistic targets designed to push them out the door. One described it as “gratuitously cruel”.A Journal spokesperson said: “Performance improvement plans are used to set clear objectives and create a development plan that gives an employee feedback and support to meet those objectives. They are being used exactly as designed.”The Tucker enigma re-emerged at the Journal, as staff noted the same mix of personable demeanour, enthusiasm for stories and willingness to make cuts.View image in fullscreenWall Street Journal editors and reporters listen to Emma Tucker speak about the release of Evan Gershkovich in a successful prisoner exchange in Turkey between the US and Russia on 1 August  2024.Photograph: Chase Gaewski/Wall Street Journal/WSJ/Reuters“She’s very emotionally intelligent – like, the 99th percentile,” said one. They said morale had improved more recently. New hires have followed.A cultural shift on stories also arrived. What emerges is a Tucker Venn diagram. At its overlapping centre lie stories with two qualities: they cover legitimate areas of public importance and aim squarely at eye-catching topics with digital reach.Tucker gave investigative reporters the examples of Elon Musk and China as two potential areas. Some complained the topics were “clickbaity”. However, one journalist who had had reservations conceded: “Musk turned out to be a pretty good topic.” Tucker’s use of metrics around web traffic and time spent reading a story irked some reporters.Headlines were made more direct. Honorifics such as “Mr” and “Mrs” were ditched. There was a ban on stories having more than three bylines. “She loosened a lot of the strictures that we had,” said one staffer. “We’re encouraged to write more edgy stories.”Positioning the Journal as a punchy rival to the liberal New York Times juggernaut may be a good business plan, but doing so while not falling foul of Murdoch’s politics remains a delicate balance.“There’s a particular moment now where theWall Street Journalhas to prove its mettle as the pre-eminent business and financial markets media organisation,” said Paddy Harverson, a contemporary of Tucker’s at the FT, now a communications executive. “They’re up against Trump, yet they have an historically centre-right editorial view. She has guided the paper along that tightrope really well.”Allies said Tucker laid a marker of intent in terms of punchy stories when she published an article on the alleged cognitive decline of Joe Biden. It was initially described as a “hit piece” by the Biden administration. Some see the Epstein story as the latest evidence of Tucker’s shift.There are journalists, however, who blame Trump’s response for giving the story attention it simply didn’t warrant. Others disagree about the extent of Tucker’s changes, pointing to the Journal’s history of breaking contentious stories, including the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. However, the net result of the Epstein letter saga has been to draw attention to Tucker’s attempted change in tone.Trump’s lawsuit means the furore may only just be beginning. Many seasoned media figures assume Murdoch, who does not respond well to bullying, will not back down. However, neither billionaire will relish having to face depositions and disclosures. Any settlement from Murdoch could put pressure on Tucker, depending on its details.Dow Jones, which publishes the Journal,has said it has“full confidence in the rigour and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit”. The courts may yet reject Trump’s case.“I don’t think [Murdoch] will just flop over,” said Barber. “The issue here is that Trump went around boasting that he killed the story … For an editor, that’s very difficult. But I’m pretty damn confident there’s no way [Tucker] would publish without having it properly sourced.”"

What The Salt Path scandal means for the nature memoirIt wasn’t the first hit memoir to tell a story of redemption inspired by the great outdoors – but could it become one of the last? Authors and publishers assess the damageAlex ClarkSat 2 Aug 2025 04.01 EDTShareWhen The Salt Path came out in 2018, it was a publishing phenomenon, going on to sell more than 2m copies globally. As even those who haven’t read it are likely to know by now, the book charted Raynor Winn and her husband Moth’s emotionally and physically transformative long-distance walk along the South West Coast Path in the wake of utter disaster: a financial collapse that cost them their home, and Moth’s diagnosis with an incurable neurological disorder. Winn followed it with two further books in a similar vein, The Wild Silence and Landlines, also bestsellers. Earlier this year came a film of The Salt Path, starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs. That original book by a first-time writer had become what writers, editors and booksellers all dream of: a bestselling, spin-off generating brand.But it wasn’t the first nature memoir to top the charts, by any means. In 2012,Wildby Cheryl Strayed described the 26-year‑old’s hike across the west coast of America in the wake of her mother’s death and the end of her marriage, and after soaring up the book charts it was made into a film starring Reese Witherspoon two years later. That same year,H Is for Hawkby Helen Macdonald was a surprise bestseller, telling the story of a year spent training a Eurasian goshawk as a journey through grief after the death of their father. In 2016, Amy Liptrot’sThe Outrunsaw her return to the sheep farm on Orkney where she’d grown up in order to recover from addiction through contact with nature; it was also recently filmed, with Saoirse Ronan in the lead role. Meanwhile, in last year’s bestsellingRaising Hare, foreign policy adviser Chloe Dalton describes moving to the countryside, rescuing a leveret and rediscovering her relationship with the land.There is clearly a thriving market for this particular blend of nature writing, personal memoir and a specific form of self-help in which the embattled individual – or in the case of The Salt Path, a couple – finds solace, sustenance and even redemption by withdrawing from everyday society and launching themselves into the great outdoors. It’s not difficult to see why such narratives are attractive, but what do they tell us about ourselves and our relationship with the natural world? And what damage might The Salt Path affair do to this genre of nature memoir?View image in fullscreenThe Salt Path author Raynor Winn with her husband, Moth.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianIt is not given to any of us to know the definitive truth, of course, and any memoir is subject to the pitfalls of perception, memory and judgment. But the two most significant accusations levelled against Winn are that, some time before the journey described in The Salt Path, she embezzled large amounts of money from an employer, and that she exaggerated the severity of Moth’s illness. She denies both, and is particularly insistent that neither she nor Moth intended to suggest that their travels were a miracle cure for his condition.The Salt Path tapped into anxieties about the loss of home and health, and countered them with a portrait of resilienceHowever, the book tapped into a strong desire among readers for narratives of healing through nature. For Melissa Harrison, author of novels for adults and children as well as nonfiction ranging from memoir to nature guides, these kinds of nature books represent “proxies through which we can relate to the natural world in a way that most of us don’t have the time or the inclination to in real life”. Reading about someone else’s deep dive into forest, field or water furnishes us with the sense that we’re participating in an environment that, for much of the time, is at arm’s length. “That mediated experience is reassuring: it tells us that we still have the capacity for a certain depth and intensity of feeling, and that one day, when whatever the circumstances are that prevent us from doing so currently are over, we can pick up our relationship with nature where we left off – most likely in adolescence – and find meaning and belonging again.”View image in fullscreen‘We put all our deepest human meanings into nature – we sort of force them in there’ … author Helen Macdonald.Photograph: Si BarberHarrison adds a cautionary note, however, about the “healing narrative” or “quest structure” in such nature writing. Having admired Dalton’s work, for example, she observes that “for every Raising Hare there are five books in which it seems the author simply wanted to write a nature memoir and cast about for some kind of experience to structure the book. Readers deserve better – and publishers should do better than this.”Harrison is not the only writer I speak with to bring up the issue of publishers’ responsibilities. Indeed, the post-Salt Path conversation has included criticism of Winn’s publisher, Penguin Random House, and its  perceived failure to carry out due diligence on her manuscript. While the more trenchant comments seem tinged with a post-hoc lack of realism – can editors really be expected to play detective and, for example, interview a prospective writer’s wider circle to establish veracity? – there is more justification for the feeling that the industry will publish relentlessly into an area it deems likely to achieve mainstream success, even if that means green-lighting repetitive or imitative work.Mo Hafeez, a commissioning editor at Faber, agrees that there has been a certain homogenisation of writing about the natural world, especially in work coming through after the pandemic. “People were engaging in nature more, purely by virtue of being in lockdown and not being able to see each other,” he says. “There was this surge of nature writing that came through, and often, instead of it being career-long naturalists or academics or people who had been writing in this area for a long time, it was everyday people’s engagements with nature. Which in a way was very lovely, and it democratised the genre quite a lot, but it got to a point where it was quite a saturated area of the market.”View image in fullscreenNature is ‘isn’t all butterflies, sunshine and healing’ … author James Rebanks.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverThe challenge, he thinks, is to resist expectations of what a nature memoir should look like, and remain open to work from unexpected angles – he has recently been reading the poet Jason Allen-Paisant’s nonfiction exploration of rural landscapes in the UK and in Jamaica, for example.There are numerous writers who sit within the genre but are writing according to their own imperative, rather than a notional market: an incomplete list might include Noreen Masud, whose book A Flat Place observes trauma through the lens of different landscapes; poet Polly Atkin, author of a biography of Dorothy Wordsworth and a memoir, Some of Us Just Fall, in which she contemplates her own chronic illness; and Natasha Carthew, writer and founder of the Nature Writing prize for working class writers.It’s likely that none of these writers will compete with Raynor Winn in terms of sales. Bestselling books become so because idea, execution, publishing knowhow and the zeitgeist combine in precisely the right way and at the right moment to capture readers’ imagination. One can certainly see what made The Salt Path successful: a compelling piece of storytelling in its own right, it tapped into deeply held anxieties about the sudden loss of home and health, and countered them with a portrait of resilience against the odds.It is the accusation that Winn misrepresented her husband’s illness, and that the books allowed, if not encouraged, readers to believe that the couple’s walks and wild camping had led to an improvement in his condition, that has provoked the most vehement negative reactions. That strength of feeling is telling.View image in fullscreenAuthor Amy Liptrot returned to the sheep farm on Orkney where she’d grown up in order to recover from addiction.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“What I’m interested in,” says Rachel Hewitt, author of In Her Nature, “is that use of physical illness as morally unambiguous. It’s a shield, isn’t it?” She argues that the full story – whatever the truth of it – would have made a more interesting narrative. But it is easier to market the more crafted tale, which is “actually very simple: a walk from illness to recovery, a walk from homelessness to finding a new concept of home. You know, all those things are quite simple, and there’s clearly something within publishing houses or within readers that really responds to that.”Writing about illness is an intensely personal and immensely delicate undertaking, both in terms of the challenges it holds for the writer and the impact it can have on the reader. Susan Sontag famously outlined the dangers in Illness As Metaphor; Hilary Mantel counselled that “illness strips you back to an authentic self, but not one you need to meet. Too much is claimed for authenticity. Painfully we learn to live in the world, and to be false.”Hewitt suggests that there might be an inherent smoothing over of complication in the stories that publishers find it easiest to present to the public; and that a woman in her 50s, with a necessarily involved past, constitutes a challenge to that narrative simplicity. Hewitt is currently contemplating writing about grief from the perspective of her own widowhood, and has become increasingly aware of “these sort of neat, linear narratives that have become such a staple of nature writing, but don’t represent human experience”.In terms of writing about the natural world, author Nic Wilson believes this approach is symptomatic of “much wider societal attitudes towards nature and the transactional way that quite a lot of our society goes into the relationship with nature”. Her debut book, Land Beneath the Waves, has been published recently, and she explains how she initially resisted the idea of writing about her family history and her own chronic illness in relation to nature, deterred partly by an awareness of the limitations of memory, and partly by a belief that her story was too “ordinary”.“I think perhaps even some of the books that are billed as healing narratives are more complex than that. It’s just that this becomes sort of a trope that’s talked about. And I think it simplifies things, and sets a precedent that other books are expected to follow, which is not helpful to [having] a diversity of voices within memoir, particularly within nature memoir, because the greater diversity of voices we have, the more people’s individual experiences are validated and spoken to.”Through all these conversations, there’s a clear insistence that we need to see “nature” not as a resource, but as a multifaceted and interdependent series of contexts and environments. “Let’s be honest, it’s full of death, isn’t it?” says James Rebanks, whose accounts of his life as a farmer in The Shepherd’s Life and English Pastoral have recently been joined by The Place of Tides, a memoir about time spent with a wild duck farmer on a Norwegian island. As he points out, nature is “full of death and disease and failure and decline. It isn’t all butterflies, sunshine and healing, is it? In my last book, I was trying to make it more complicated: nature can be lonely. Nature can be too quiet. It can be too isolated. It can lead to you not being in the right place. And nature itself is broken, so it can make you depressed. It’s falling apart around you. I find it more interesting when it’s less about personal redemption and more of a mirror on the big things that I care about: the politics, the economics, what’s actually really happening in the world.”View image in fullscreen‘We can’t write ourselves out of the narratives; we’re the ones telling the story’ … Jessica Lee.Rebanks, who loves Tolstoy and the American writer Wendell Berry and thinks of himself in the tradition of the agrarian radical, is an engaging presence, both off and on the page and, like the best writers on nature, is alive to the frequent contradictions in portraying it in either fiction or nonfiction. Helen Macdonald, too, whose prize-winning H Is for Hawk has been made into a film with Claire Foy and Brendan Gleeson, is acutely aware of the expectations we bring to the genre.“Nature is considered to be the one place free of human artifice, the place where deep universal truths can be uncovered that are not to do with us,” Macdonald says, “which, of course, is bullshit. That’s not the case. We put all our deepest human meanings into nature. We sort of force them in there, and then we use them to prove the veracity of our own concepts back at us, which is what nature writing does all the time.”Macdonald highlights a literary-critical tradition that is useful in understanding both the success of The Salt Path and the reaction to its alleged departures from fact. “Tramp” or “vagabonding” literature, which flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, was by its nature highly individualistic and accepted to contain fabrications; it encompassed writing by those who were marginalised from society, and those, like George Orwell, who put themselves in that position in order to analyse societal structures. It’s a world away from contemporary memoir and the idea that nature can be instrumental in making us feel better.So is the genre now facing an existential crisis? Is there still room in the market for stories of journeys into the wilderness, complete with a healing narrative? For Jessica Lee, author of books for both adults and children and the founder of The Willowherb Review, which ran from 2018 to 2022 and aimed to provide a platform for writers of colour, the issues raised by The Salt Path furore present us with an opportunity to explore innovative ways of writing about nature.“If we’re talking about wanting to write about the natural world,” Lee says, “we can’t get rid of ourselves. We can’t write ourselves out of the narratives; we’re the ones telling the story. But what we can do is allow the world to inform the shape that we take.” That means resisting the idea of linear progression, or redemptive arcs, in favour of the cyclical and the messy. “The personal, with us at the centre, can be the door that opens the story. But then we really need to be very proactively seeking to undo that the second we’ve opened that door.”Meanwhile, the fallout from such microscopic attention to a huge bestseller offers us a window into the realities of nature publishing, where experimentation and complexity persist, but often do so without the resources afforded to more commercially appealing narratives. A salutary lesson, perhaps, but not one likely to deter the most adventurous and committed of those attempting to survey our threatened environment and to capture both its wonders and its fragility.Explore more on these topicsPublishingAutobiography and memoirScience and nature booksBiography booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What happened when the expert became the patient?An experienced clinician in prosthetics, Jim Ashworth-Beaumont found himself the perfect guinea pig for a radical new option for amputeesSimon UsborneSat 2 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 08.05 EDTShareWhen the air ambulance brought Jim Ashworth-Beaumont to King’s College hospital in south-east London, nobody thought he had a hope. He had been cycling home when a lorry driver failed to spot him alongside his trailer while turning left after a set of traffic lights. The vehicle’s wheels opened his torso like a sardine tin, puncturing his lungs and splitting his liver in two. They also tore off his right arm. Weeks after the accident, in July 2020, Ashworth-Beaumont would see a photo of the severed limbtaken by a doctor while it lay beside him in hospital. He had asked to see the picture and says it helped him come to terms with his loss. “My hand didn’t look too bad,” he says. “It was as if it was waving goodbye to me.”Ashworth-Beaumont, a super-fit and sunny former Royal Marine from Edinburgh, would go on to spend six weeks in an induced coma as surgeons raced to repair his crushed body. But as he lay on the road, waiting for the paramedics, his only thoughts were that he was dying. He did not have the wherewithal to consider the irony of his predicament.In the late 1990s, after he had left the marines, Ashworth-Beaumont, now 59, studied for a degree in prosthetics and orthotics at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. Clinicians in these disciplines help patients with pain, function and mobility by making and fitting devices such as prosthetic limbs and orthotic braces. He had written research papers and trained prosthetists while specialising as an orthotist at the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital (RNOH) in north-west London. “Now I was the patient,” he says.I meet Ashworth-Beaumont for the first time in Greenwich Park, near the south London home he shares with his wife, Keri, a solicitor he met on a night out in 2002. It’s early summer 2024, almost four years after the accident in nearby Catford. He speaks softly through a smile that cracks only when he considers how far he has come and the support he has had: “Without Keri, I think I would have sat in a corner and wasted away.”At first, his missing arm was a low priority for Edmund Fitzgerald O’Connor, the plastic surgeon who attended to his horrific abdominal injuries. But, by another twist of fate, the ambitious surgeon, who is 47, had a particular interest in limb loss. For years, he had been searching for the perfect candidate for a radical procedure he wanted to begin offering to amputees.View image in fullscreenAshworth-Beaumont with plastic surgeon Edmund Fitzgerald O’Connor (left) and implant co-creator Rickard BrånemarkView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Mark Chilvers/The GuardianOsseointegration (OI), or direct skeletal fixation, is a relatively new way to attach prosthetic limbs. Rather than rely on a socket moulded to fit over a residual limb or stump – a method that dates back centuries – arms or legs are attached to a titanium implant inserted into the surviving bone (“osseo” means bone). Fixing a prosthesis to the implant, which emerges from the stump like a little tusk, is as easy as changing a camera lens.OI patients need no longer tolerate irritation or infection where the socket rubs against skin and flesh. They gain a fuller range of motion and improved control and proprioception – the innate sense of where we and our extremities are in space. A prosthesis becomes part of the body rather than an awkward appendage. “It feels like I’ve got my own leg back,” Hanneke Mooij, a Dutch secretary, tells me three years after receiving an implant following decades of torment from ill-fitting sockets.At the same time, rapid advances in electronic limbs mean surgeons can now effectively wire them into the brain. Taken together, OI and the latest prosthetics appear to bring a bionic future within reach. But the technique’s evolution has also been fraught, limiting its adoption. In a small number of cases, implants or bones have cracked. Painful infections have taken hold in the fleshy hole that surgeons must create around the implant. OI is also very expensive at a time when amputees struggle to access basic prosthetics care.You couldn’t have made up a better candidate, but I wasn’t going to tell him until I knew he would surviveFitzgerald O’Connor is convinced more of the 25,000 patients seen by the NHS prosthetics service each year could benefit from OI. When we first meet, the National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence (Nice), the body that issues guidance on NHS treatment and funding, is reviewing OI. “When you’re doing 15 to 20 amputations a year and you have patients coming back with recurrent problems with their stump, it’s saddening to know there’s a viable alternative they can’t access,” he says.The surgeon had been building a team to start offering OI, in the private sector at first, when he got the call from King’s. He had been searching for a patient who was resilient and in good health, who could help drive wider acceptance of the technique. If Ashworth-Beaumont could fund his treatment, his professional knowledge of what it takes to come back from a traumatic amputation would be a bonus. “You couldn’t have made up a better candidate,” Fitzgerald O’Connor says. “The conversation started in my mind the day he came in, but I wasn’t going to bring it to him until I knew he would survive.”Osseointegration relies on a process that was discovered by accident. In the 1950s, Per-Ingvar Brånemark, a Swedish scientist based in Gothenburg, put optical devices housed in titanium into the legs of rabbits to observe the way bones heal. Once the study was over, the metal had fused to the bone and couldn’t be removed, defying conventional wisdom about the body’s tendency to reject foreign objects.The discovery inspired Brånemark, who died in 2014, to invent dental implants, first used in the 1980s, that fuse to the jaw with titanium screws, removing the need for dentures. Wondering if the bond could hold larger devices, Brånemark and his son, Rickard, an engineer training as an orthopaedic surgeon, designed a larger implant. In 1990, they screwed two into the above-knee stumps of a woman who had been run over by a tram.The procedure was eye-catching, evoking scenes from science fiction –Star WarsorThe Six Million Dollar Man. It was also divisive. “I remember lecturing in the US in the late 90s when this senior professor stood up and said, ‘Only an idiot can believe this will ever work,’” says Rickard Brånemark, 65, who founded Integrum, the first OI company, in 1998. But a handful of enterprising surgeons saw an irresistible logic in bone-anchored prosthetics. Integrum soon had competition.In Sydney, Australia, Munjed Al Muderis, an Iraqi-born orthopaedic surgeon who had fled Saddam Hussein’s regime after refusing to cut off the ears of draft dodgers, developed his own device, which he first implanted in 2008. He says patients have received more than 2,000 of his implants, which are hammered rather than screwed into bone. (Brånemark says surgeons have installed more than 700 Integrum devices.)View image in fullscreen‘I see it almost as a duty to explore the possibilities.’Photograph: Sophia Spring/The GuardianAl Muderis, 52, is the technique’s most bullish advocate. He is now offering it to victims of vascular conditions including diabetes, the biggest cause of leg amputations. (Other surgeons typically turn down such candidates, fearing their rehabilitation could be hampered by lifestyle factors.) “There is a big opportunity for this technology to take over from the traditional socket-mounted prosthesis,” Al Muderis insists via Zoom as he changes out of his scrubs.The surgeon tells me about a current case he says demonstrates OI’s potential – a seven-year-old Iraqi orphan who lost an arm in a roadside dog attack while he slept. He was later adopted by a wealthy Chinese family. In the coming months, Al Muderis plans to fit the boy with an implant, which will need to be replaced as he grows. Unlike other OI surgeons, he argues that children can be suitable candidates despite the need for further operations. In the case of leg amputees, he says, OI gets children walking again sooner. “It’s all a balance,” he adds, pointing out that sockets in children need changing a lot more often than OI implants.The boy will also undergo a procedure called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), which involves rerouting amputated nerves. This can help relieve pain in the stump, where the severed nerves can thicken into tumour-like neuromas. Remarkably, it can also help amputees control prosthetic limbs with their minds.I knew these things professionally, but it really brings it home when you first try to move your shoulder and nothing happensTo achieve this, Al Muderis will surgically attach the severed nerves, which had travelled to muscles in the boy’s arm and hand, to small, inessential sections of muscle in his chest instead. Tiny electrodes implanted under the skin will connect these muscle sites to the prosthetic arm via eight cables wired through the body and the titanium implant. When the boy moves to grab a water bottle, his brain will activate the chest muscles, which will forward the signal to the corresponding motors in his arm and hand. “It’s amazing because the transmission is instant,” Al Muderis says of TMR, which he adds is not yet widely available.Integrum has also adapted its implants to allow amputees to upgrade to TMR and other advanced control systems in the future. Yet Al Muderis – who, like Brånemark, has been to Ukraine to offer OI to injured soldiers – says scepticism holds back the technique, including in the UK. He partly blames regulations and resistance to the idea of an implant that perforates the skin: “This is a completely revolutionary technology which violates many of the principles of orthopaedics.”Brånemark is more conservative but also thinks far more amputees could benefit than the few thousand globally who have implants. When Fitzgerald O’Connor told him about his plans and the unlikely case of the one-armed prosthetist, the Swedish surgeon agreed to back his British OI team and oversee its first operation. “A lot of people still don’t know about OI, even in Sweden,” Brånemark says. “As someone who also works in the field, Ashworth-Beaumont can be a really good advocate.”For weeks, HIs life hung in the balance. He had lost almost all liver and kidney function. Sepsis set in as he lay in a coma. His first wife and their two grown-up children came down from Scotland to say goodbye. “The first thing I remember, coming out of the coma, was my daughter’s face; it’s still a really strong image in my mind,” Ashworth-Beaumont says. He thinks he inherited his fighting spirit from his father, a docker’s son from Liverpool, who worked as a bellboy before becoming a successful restaurateur. His mother still runs a gift shop in her 80s. He also has childhood memories of a cousin who lost his legs in a car crash. “I guess amputation was always on my radar,” he says.After struggling to focus at school, at 16 he joined the marines, where he excelled. Fitness was a passion, and he became skilled in mechanical and electronic engineering, which led to his prosthetics career. In the final year of his degree, begun in 1996, he worked at Steeper, a British prosthetics firm that would one day supply his motorised elbow. He joined the RNOH in 2005 while racing in triathlons and moonlighting as a personal trainer. He was at peak fitness when the lorry hit him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He would need a highly functional prosthesis; his job is physical, requiring the manipulation of limbs, as well as the making and fitting of devices. He was all ears when Fitzgerald O’Connor shared his plans. He also knew it would take time, and that the advice in prosthetics care is to try standard devices first.It was almost a year after his accident, when he was about to return to work, that Ashworth-Beaumont received a body-powered arm on the NHS. These mechanical devices are a step up from static prostheses, which can incorporate hooks or skin-coloured hands. By rounding his shoulders, he could open a metal claw attached by a cable to a back harness: “It works, but the technology has been around for hundreds of years.”Socket attachments date back to the 16th century or earlier. Designs and materials have changed, but the principle is the same: a socket must grip the stump for good function but not so tightly as to cause discomfort. Suction helps keep a socket on, but Ashworth-Beaumont needed strapping to pull his against his short stump, which further limited comfort and mobility. He ended up wearing the arm for just a few hours a day at work, and describes a circular problem for arm amputees. The motivation to use a prosthetic leg is high, to avoid relying on crutches or a wheelchair: “But there’s so much we can still do with one arm.” Patients tend to get frustrated with prosthetic arms, often stashing them away and making do. Ashworth-Beaumont says this partly explains a reluctance in the NHS to offer advanced devices, particularly early on. “But the problem is they’re also not giving people the opportunity to try these components when so many of us would benefit.”View image in fullscreenAshworth-Beaumont’s previous arm …View image in fullscreen… and his latest model. Photographs: Sophia Spring/The Guardian. Styling: Hope LawrieHe went private to get a better arm sooner, using money raised from a legal settlement with the lorry company and a family crowdfunder. Working with Alan McDougall, a prosthetist at Proactive, a private clinic in Surrey, he upgraded to a stealthy black electric device with motors in the elbow, wrist and hand. He learned to flex his residual biceps and triceps independently to activate the motors, via sensors built into the socket. Subtle hand movements allowed him to adopt different grips. It’s a step below TMR, but it works: I see it in action when we next meet and Ashworth-Beaumont gives me one of the firmest handshakes I’ve had.The electric arm, which is worth more than £100,000, meant he could do more, but it further exposed his socket’s shortcomings. It was heavier than the NHS device, requiring a tighter, less comfortable fit. He could pick up a mug, say, but the flesh interface also made it hard to position the hand precisely, creating a lag between brain and hand. OI increasingly felt like the solution. Ashworth-Beaumont considered himself an overqualified guinea pig with an opportunity to highlight his profession and widen access to the latest tech. “I see it almost as a duty to explore the possibilities,” he told me in 2021, when I first got in touch.Ashworth-Beaumont would not be the first British amputee to receive an Integrum implant. Starting in the late 90s, Brånemark’s new devices were used in a trial involving 18 patients at Queen Mary’s hospital in Roehampton, south-west London, where the modern British prosthetics industry emerged after the first world war. While the trial had some success and provided valuable data, the experience of its least fortunate participants still reverberates around the field and the debate about NHS provision.Gemma Trotter, a fitness instructor from south London, was 16 when she had a leg amputated above the knee after a car crash. Held back for years by uncomfortable sockets, she set aside her reservations about OI, which she had viewed as “crackers”, and joined the trial in 2003, aged 21. It was transformative. “Suddenly I could feel the floor through my leg again. If I wore jeans, a lot of people didn’t even know I was an amputee,” she says. “I got married, had a baby … they were the best nine years of my life.”Then the implant broke and became infected. By then the trial team had disbanded, limiting follow-up care. Trotter, now 42, has endured more than a decade of pain and attempted fixes by surgeons including Brånemark. She is waiting to have her third implant removed after more problems, and won’t risk having another. (Brånemark tells me that, while there is a risk of failure with any implant, Integrum’s success rate has significantly improved since the Roehampton trial.)Trotter remains one of only a few dozen patients in the UK who have had OI, which is more widely available in countries with insurance-based health systems. Hanneke Mooij, the Dutch patient, is surprised to hear OI is hard to access in the UK. She received an Integrum device in 2022, 36 years after losing her leg in a motorbike crash. She is part of a Dutch group of 20 one-legged female friends who call themselves “the flamingos”, half of whom have had OI surgery in the past few years. “I’m convinced this is the future,” she says.Most British OI recipients are patients at Relimb, a private clinic founded at the Royal Free hospital in north-west London in 2018. Its directors, Norbert Kang and Alex Woollard, use Al Muderis’s implants and have about 60 patients on their books, almost all funded by legal settlements after traumatic accidents. Partly with the Roehampton trial in mind, they do not think the NHS has the resources to offer the skilled and long-term care required to make OI successful. “No matter how beneficial it is and how well we can do it now, we’re not going to change health economics,” Woollard says.I went out for​ dinner for my birthday and used a knife and fork​ properly. I feel​ more competentHe and Kang are not alone in having doubts. Nicky Eddison, chair of the British Association of Prosthetists and Orthotists, says the professions are already facing a staffing and recruitment crisis, and some NHS trusts are making do with just two specialists. “Whatever technical advances you make, we can’t deliver them without skilled clinicians,” she says.Yet proponents of OI make a case for long-term cost savings. Stephen Cruse, founder of the Amputation Foundation, a charity in Merseyside, had OI surgery with Al Muderis in 2016, eight years after losing his legs in a car crash while in Australia. After returning to the UK, he convinced an Australian government compensation scheme to fund his surgery after calculating it would save money in five years. “They were paying about £30,000 a year on sockets, liners and maintenance,” says Cruse, who had a “nightmare” with sockets but now rarely needs to see his prosthetist.Last December, Nice published new guidelines. It now recommends that OI can be used in the NHS but only by multidisciplinary teams with specific training, and the NHS tells me its policy – not to offer it widely – isn’t changing, based on the risks and its funding priorities. Fitzgerald O’Connor says there may be ways to secure funds in exceptional cases, and he will continue to push for wider access as evidence of OI’s efficacy grows. “To leave it in a silo, where it’s only accessible with vast amounts of money, does a disservice to patients who are suffering,” he says.After long delays caused by Covid and post-Brexit paperwork, Ashworth-Beaumont finally gets a date for his private surgery: a Saturday in October 2024. “I tend to take things in my stride, but it feels like jumping out of a plane,” he tells me a few weeks before the operation. “You know the systems are there to protect you, but there’s always that 1% chance things could go awry.”The day before the surgery, which will take place at St Thomas’s hospital in central London, I join Ashworth-Beaumont at a private clinic farther up the Thames at Battersea power station. Fitzgerald O’Connor and Aaron Saini, an orthopaedic surgeon who is also part of the new OI team, have gathered amputees and professionals to discuss this case and prosthetics technology more widely. The subject of NHS care keeps cropping up.Craig Mackinlay, a former Conservative MP from Kent, lost all four limbs to sepsis in 2023. Five months later, he received a standing ovation when he strode into the House of Commons wearing prostheses. Fitzgerald O’Connor, who performed the amputations, looked on from the public gallery. It was a triumphant comeback, but Mackinlay has since highlighted NHS shortcomings, including long waits and early black rubber prostheses that resembled “clubs … I couldn’t see what they’d be good for apart from breaking windows or pub fights.”Mackinlay, now a life peer, has since gone private, with support from device firms and his own money. In a debate in the Lords this May, he said he would still be in a wheelchair had he not accessed better legs sooner. “The technology is out there and the NHS will give some of it to you, but it takes years,” he says. “Why are we holding people back?” In response, Baroness Merron, a health minister, announced a review of the provision of advanced prostheses. In a statement, an NHS spokesperson insists that it “provides a comprehensive package of care and support for people who have lost limbs, including a range of prosthetics”.View image in fullscreenAshworth-Beaumont ahead of his operation, with Fitzgerald O’Connor (left), Brånemark (right) and orthopaedic surgeon Aaron SainiView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Mark Chilvers/The GuardianWhen I ask Ashworth-Beaumont if everything is starting to feel a bit real, he takes a deep breath. “This is all positive,” he says, his voice cracking. “Sorry, I’m just thinking about the last four years.” Fitzgerald O’Connor places a hand on his shoulder. “It was tough, but you made it,” he says. The next morning, Brånemark, Fitzgerald O’Connor and Saini screw the Integrum implant into Ashworth-Beaumont’s humerus, carefully rebuilding his soft tissue around it. “I’ve been walking around like I’m made of crystal,” he tells me two days later via Zoom as he waits for bone and metal to bond.Not long after Christmas, he is ready for an arm. McDougall has adapted Ashworth-Beaumont’s body-powered device so he can attach it to his implant. Even with the encumbrance of the cable and harness needed to move the hand, he is struck by the enhanced control of a firmly anchored limb. “I went out for dinner with Keri for my birthday and used a knife and fork properly,” he says. “I feel more competent as an individual.”By early March he is ready to go full bionic, connecting his heavier electric arm. At Proactive, plaster casts of stumps stand like sculptures in the workshop. As well as adapting the more advanced arm, McDougall has added a small cuff to house the muscle sensors that used to sit inside Ashworth-Beaumont’s socket. The arm would look at home in a sci-fi props department, with its carbon fibre-effect shell and translucent glove, which reveals some of the hand’s moving parts. Then there’s the gap in the upper arm, where only the titanium implant links flesh to hardware. Yet when the prosthesis hangs from Ashworth-Beaumont’s shoulder, it somehow looks like part of him. Without the socket and straps, his silhouette is symmetrical: he is whole again.Soon motors whirr as he tests his bionic joints, raising his arm above his head in a way he hasn’t been able to do since the accident. McDougall adjusts it using a Bluetooth-connected iPad app. “This is really good,” Ashworth-Beaumont says as he picks up a stray screw from a workbench. Within days, he’s performing tasks previously beyond him. Hoovering feels like a privilege.Five years after his old arm appeared to wave goodbye, Ashworth-Beaumont is as aware as anyone of the limitations of the health service. “I’ve spent, what, five hours with Alan today, there’s no way you’d get that time in the NHS,” he says. While he watches the OI debate continue, returning to his own NHS job has felt like his biggest achievement. As well as being able to meet the physical demands of his work, his ordeal has changed his relationship with patients. “I was quite emotional about it after my first few appointments,” he says. “I really did know how they felt.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleMedical researchMedicineHealthDisabilityHealthcare industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That said, good news: every single one had its cheerleaders, so there were no real duds in this sample.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To outline what I’m looking for from a salted crisp, it should be crisp, obviously. To this end, all the bags were opened at the same time, just before the blind tasting. Salt levels are a matter of personal preference, though it should be upfront rather than a mere seasoning, while, in an ideal world, the potatoes themselves would be the primary flavour, rather than a mere texture. They should be cooked long enough that they crunch, rather than melt between the teeth, but it’s a delicate balance: too long in the oil and they’ll be bitter. And that oil – if you can taste it at all – should be pleasant: too strong a flavour, even of the best fat, will overpower the spuds. Last, crisps should be dangerously moreish: if you can eat one and stop, they’re not good crisps.The best salted crispsBest overall:San Nicasio Himalayan pink salt potato chipsView image in fullscreen£3.25 for 150g at Waitrose (£2.17/100g)£74.36 for 14 x 150g at Amazon (£3.54/100g)★★★★☆The most divisive crisps of the day, with marks ranging from one (Rose, seven, and representing the youth vote) to five (me). Noticeably yellow, thanks to the extra-virgin olive oil they’re cooked in (which, unlike the Himalayan pinkness of the salt, comes through in the flavour, hence, perhaps, the loss of the kid vote), they prompt the demand: “Serve me these with an aperitivo immediately: crunch, salt, good oil – YES.” Sadly, these Andalusian crisps have a far higher fat content than any of the others tested. One for picking at elegantly over a chilled glass of sherry.Best bargain:Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference lightly sea salted hand-cooked crispsView image in fullscreen£1.25 for 150g at Sainsbury’s (83p/100g)★★★★☆Though some find them a little undersalted, these chunky crisps’ “classic flavour” finds favour, with several testers noting with excitement that they “actually taste of potato!” While the comments section attracts several variations on “mid-range” (Rose judges them merely “OK”), the decent flavour and excellent crunch make this a great value choice.And the rest …M&S hand-cooked lightly sea salted crispsView image in fullscreen£1.80 for 150g at Ocado (£1.20/100g)★★★☆☆Rose finds these too crunchy, but that very quality appeals to the person who says they’d be perfect for a hangover. “Nice enough,” someone else says, “but surprised not to find one I like more.” That sums these up – a decent, aggressively crunchy crisp with a high salt content, but missing that elusive potatoey flavour.Waitrose sea salt hand-cooked crispsView image in fullscreen£1.50 for 150g at Waitrose (£1/100g)★★★☆☆“Perfectly fine,” one tester finds, before admitting: “Actually quite moreish.” Someone else judges them “generic”. Thin and crisp, which divides opinion, from “nothing to them” to “better – lighter!”, Rose judges them “too spicy”, but I rather like their saltiness and the fact that – hurrah! – they taste of baked potato. I’d buy these again.Co-op Irresistible hand-cooked lightly sea salted crispsView image in fullscreen£1.70 for 150g at Co-op (£1.13/100g)★★★☆☆Cooked skin on, which gives them a decent potatoey flavour. There are a few slightly sweet, caramelised ones in here, suggesting an older potato, but in general these are crunchy, well-balanced crisps that would perform well in most situations, from festival pre-drinks to family picnics. “Middle of the road,” as Rob observes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

They’re not my favourite, though, even when cooked by the pros – I find these a bit greasy, while other testers judge them “blah” and “cardboardy … does not break when you bite in”. Several testers say they “need more salt”, but I’ll let them off, given they’re described only as lightly salted (always a red flag for me).Tyrrell’s lightly sea salted crispsView image in fullscreen£2 for 150g at Ocado (£1.33/100g)£2.50 for 150g at Tesco (£1.67/100g)★★☆☆☆“Bang average” sums up the response to these. “Wouldn’t put out for guests.” Rose finds them “too bitey” (they are, it must be said,verycrisp), someone else finds them “bland”, and several tasters say they feel “cheap” and “basic”, which is not reflected in the price. Disappointing.Morrisons The Best hand-cooked skin-on sea salt crispsView image in fullscreen£1.30 for 125g at Morrisons (£1.04/100g)★★☆☆☆These apparently taste as if “they were opened last night”. “A bit stale,” someone else agrees. “Wrong texture, dense.” Personally, I like a thicker crisp, but these are a little too chewy and even I find them a touch salty, though, checking the labels afterwards, they contain less salt than some of the others, so maybe it’s just that the flavour is more intense. Might be better served with a creamy dip to balance this out.Aldi Specially Selected lightly salted hand-cooked crispsView image in fullscreen£1.09 for 150g at Aldi (73p/100g)★★☆☆☆“Too thick, like eating greasy batter out of the bottom of the chip paper, and not in a good way,” one tester says, and although I love a thicker crisp, I’m inclined to agree – these are a bit tough, rather than snappy, and taste, as Rose notes, “too oily”.Walkers ready salted crispsView image in fullscreen£1.50 for 150g at Sainsbury’s (£1/100g)£1.48 for 150g at Asda (99p/100g)★★☆☆☆Rose, who confides in me that these are the only crisps she knows, picks them out from the lineup in seconds – they’re far paler and more uniform than the others – but even she’s not that enthusiastic. “Not crunchy enough” is a common complaint, while someone else thinks they’re so light, they’re almost “a health snack”. The final damning verdict comes from Claire: “An anaemic pub crisp. Fine with a cold pint, otherwise lacking.”Explore more on these topicsSnacksThe FilterFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lessons he has drawn are often striking: people are fundamentally egalitarian but are led to collapses by enriched, status-obsessed elites, while past collapses often improved the lives of ordinary citizens.Today’s global civilisation, however, is deeply interconnected and unequal and could lead to the worst societal collapse yet, he says. The threat is from leaders who are “walking versions of the dark triad” – narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism – in a world menaced by the climate crisis, nuclear weapons, artificial intelligence and killer robots.View image in fullscreenThe sun sets behind destroyed buildings in the Gaza Strip.Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty ImagesThe work is scholarly, but the straight-talking Australian can also be direct, such as when setting out how a global collapse could be avoided. “Don’t be a dick” is one of the solutions proposed, along with a move towards genuinely democratic societies and an end to inequality.His first step was to ditch the word civilisation, a term he argues is really propaganda by rulers. “When you look at the near east, China, Mesoamerica or the Andes, where the first kingdoms and empires arose, you don’t see civilised conduct, you see war, patriarchy and human sacrifice,” he says. This was a form of evolutionary backsliding from the egalitarian and mobile hunter-gatherer societies which shared tools and culture widely and survived for hundreds of thousands of years. “Instead, we started to resemble the hierarchies of chimpanzees and the harems of gorillas.”Instead Kemp uses the term Goliaths to describe kingdoms and empires, meaning a society built on domination, such as the Roman empire: state over citizen, rich over poor, master over slave and men over women. He says that, like the biblical warrior slain by David’s slingshot, Goliaths began in the bronze age, were steeped in violence and often surprisingly fragile.Goliath states do not simply emerge as dominant cliques that loot surplus food and resources, he argues, but need three specific types of “Goliath fuel”. The first is a particular type of surplus food: grain. That can be “seen, stolen and stored”, Kemp says, unlike perishable foods.View image in fullscreenA rubbish collector looks for recyclable waste at a dump in Liaoning province, China.Photograph: Sheng Li/ReutersInCahokia, for example, a society in North America that peaked around the 11th century, the advent of maize and bean farming led to a society dominated by an elite of priests and human sacrifice, he says.The second Goliath fuel is weaponry monopolised by one group. Bronze swords and axes were far superior to stone and wooden axes, and the first Goliaths in Mesopotamia followed their development, he says. Kemp calls the final Goliath fuel “caged land”, meaning places where oceans, rivers, deserts and mountains meant people could not simply migrate away from rising tyrants. Early Egyptians, trapped between the Red Sea and the Nile, fell prey to the pharaohs, for example.“History is best told as a story of organised crime,” Kemp says. “It is one group creating a monopoly on resources through the use of violence over a certain territory and population.”View image in fullscreenLuke Kemp, author of Goliath’s Curse.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianAll Goliaths, however, contain the seeds of their own demise, he says: “They are cursed and this is because of inequality.”Inequalitydoes not arise because all people are greedy. They are not, he says. The Khoisan peoples in southern Africa, for example, shared and preserved common lands for thousands of years despite the temptation to grab more.Instead, it is the few people high in the dark triad who fall into races for resources, arms and status, he says. “Then as elites extract more wealth from the people and the land, they make societies more fragile, leading to infighting, corruption, immiseration of the masses, less healthy people, overexpansion, environmental degradation and poor decision making by a small oligarchy. The hollowed-out shell of a society is eventually cracked asunder by shocks such as disease, war or climate change.”History shows that increasing wealth inequality consistently precedes collapse, says Kemp, from the Classical Lowland Maya to the Han dynasty in China and the Western Roman empire. He also points out that for the citizens of early rapacious regimes, collapse often improved their lives because they were freed from domination and taxation and returned to farming. “After the fall of Rome, people actually got taller and healthier,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe ancient town of Taiyuan in Shanxi province, China, an exceptionally well-preserved example of a traditional Han city founded in the 14th century.Photograph: Eric Yang/Getty ImagesCollapses in the past were at a regional level and often beneficial for most people, but collapse today would be global and disastrous for all. “Today, we don’t have regional empires so much as we have one single, interconnected global Goliath. All our societies act within one single global economic system – capitalism,” Kemp says.He cites three reasons why the collapse of the global Goliath would be far worse than previous events. First is that collapses are accompanied by surges in violence as elites try to reassert their dominance. “In the past, those battles were waged with swords or muskets. Today we have nuclear weapons,” he says.Second, people in the past were not heavily reliant on empires or states for services and, unlike today, could easily go back to farming or hunting and gathering. “Today, most of us are specialised, and we’re dependent upon global infrastructure. If that falls away, we too will fall,” he says.“Last but not least is that, unfortunately, all the threats we face today are far worse than in the past,” he says. Past climatic changes that precipitated collapses, for example, usually involved a temperature change of 1C at a regional level. Today, we face 3C globally. There are also about 10,000 nuclear weapons, technologies such as artificial intelligence and killer robots and engineered pandemics, all sources of catastrophic global risk.Kemp says his argument that Goliaths require rulers who are strong in the triad of dark traits is borne out today. “The three most powerful men in the world are a walking version of the dark triad: Trump is a textbook narcissist, Putin is a cold psychopath, and Xi Jinping came to rule [China] by being a master Machiavellian manipulator.”View image in fullscreenXi Jinping takes part in a 2015 military parade in Beijing to the 70th anniversary of the end of second world war.Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images“Our corporations and, increasingly, our algorithms, also resemble these kinds of people,” he says. “They’re basically amplifying the worst of us.”Kemp points to these “agents of doom” as the source of the current trajectory towards societal collapse. “These are the large, psychopathic corporations and groups which produce global catastrophic risk,” he says. “Nuclear weapons, climate change, AI, are only produced by a very small number of secretive, highly wealthy, powerful groups, like the military-industrial complex, big tech and the fossil fuel industry.“The key thing is this is not about all of humanity creating these threats. It is not about human nature. It is about small groups who bring out the worst in us, competing for profit and power and covering all [the risks] up.”‘We need dramatic social and technological changes’: is societal collapse inevitable?Read moreThe global Goliath is the endgame for humanity, Kemp says, like the final moves in a chess match that determine the result. He sees two outcomes: self-destruction or a fundamental transformation of society.He believes the first outcome is the most likely, but says escaping global collapse could be achieved. “First and foremost, you need to create genuine democratic societies to level all the forms of power that lead to Goliaths,” he says. That means running societies through citizen assemblies and juries, aided by digital technologies to enable direct democracy at large scales. History shows that more democratic societies tend to be more resilient, he says.“If you’d had a citizens’ jury sitting over the [fossil fuel companies] when they discovered how much damage and death their products would cause, do you think they would have said: ‘Yes, go ahead, bury the information and run disinformation campaigns’? Of course not,” Kemp says.Escaping collapse also requires taxing wealth, he says, otherwise the rich find ways to rig the democratic system. “I’d cap wealth at $10 million. That’s far more than anyone needs. A famous oil tycoon once saidmoney is just a way for the rich to keep score. Why should we allow these people to keep score at the risk of destroying the entire planet?”View image in fullscreenActivists take part in a protest in Amsterdam against Dutch companies’ ‘investment in climate destruction’.Photograph: Eva Plevier/ANP/AFP/Getty ImagesIf citizens’ juries and wealth caps seem wildly optimistic, Kemp says we have been long brainwashed by rulers justifying their dominance, from the self-declared god-pharaohs of Egypt and priests claiming to control the weather to autocrats claiming to defend people from foreign threats and tech titans selling us their techno-utopias. “It’s always been easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of Goliaths. That’s because these are stories that have been hammered into us over the space of 5,000 years,” he says.“Today, people find it easier to imagine that we can build intelligence on silicon than we can do democracy at scale, or that we can escape arms races. It’s complete bullshit. Of course we can do democracy at scale. We’re a naturally social, altruistic, democratic species and we all have an anti-dominance intuition. This is what we’re built for.”Kemp rejects the suggestion that he is simply presenting a politically leftwing take on history. “There is nothing inherently left wing about democracy,” he says. “Nor does the left have a monopoly on fighting corruption, holding power accountable and making sure companies pay for the social and environmental damages they cause. That’s just making our economy more honest.”He also has a message for individuals: “Collapse isn’t just caused by structures, but also people. If you want to save the world then the first step is to stop destroying it. In other words: don’t be a dick. Don’t work for big tech, arms manufacturers or the fossil fuel industry. Don’t accept relationships based on domination and share power whenever you can.”Despite the possibility of avoiding collapse, Kemp remains pessimistic about our prospects. “I think it’s unlikely,” he says. “We’re dealing with a 5,000-year process that is going to be incredibly difficult to reverse, as we have increasing levels of inequality and of elite capture of our politics.“But even if you don’t have hope, it doesn’t really matter. This is about defiance. It’s about doing the right thing, fighting for democracy and for people to not be exploited. And even if we fail, at the very least, we didn’t contribute to the problem.”Goliath’s Curse by Luke Kemp waspublished in the UK on 31 July by Viking PenguinExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentClimate crisisAnthropologyInequalityEvolutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bundee Aki is keeping warm on the exercise bike. Tom Curry is on his phone, Finn Russell is scrolling too before giving a cheeky grin but the British & Lions’ performance manager, David Nucifora, decides enough is enough and puts a towel over the camera inside the dressing room, spoiling the fun. These Lions can be hard to love sometimes.They may one day come to realise that giving spectators at home a glimpse of how players spend a 38-minute break in play could just encourage them to stick with this match. Given the pictures coming from the Australia dressing room portrayed a side taking things a touch more seriously, perhaps the Lions did not want the public to see what they were up to. The stoppage was perfectly in keeping with this chaotic finale to the Test series, enthralling and farcical in equal measure, but the shutters were pulled down. Another example of this sport failing to help itself.This side have made clear they targeted becoming the “best Lions ever”, but how they have put up barriers has ensured they will not be the most popular. After thisthoroughly deserved Wallabies victory, the Lions’ very public declaration that they have been targeting a Test series whitewash now look like hubris.Lions’ clean sweep hopes washed away by Wallabies in stormy Sydney finaleRead moreThe mind spools back to Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii’s answer when it was put to him before the first Test. “Yeah, I heard about it,” was the response, but the way he uttered it said so much more.Should Andy Farrell have rested more of his exhausted players? Freshened things up, injected a bit more energy into proceedings? Certainly Ben Earl brought some late dynamism while Ellis Genge’s introduction, after the break in play, could have come a bit sooner. These are questions the Lions hoped not to deal with.Where does this side rank up against their forefathers now? They performed breathtakingly well for 40 minutes in the first half of the first Test, catching an evidently undercooked Australia cold, and demonstrated remarkable character in the second half of the second. They were consistently average for 80 minutes here on Saturday, unable to match the Wallabies’ carrying power and superior handling skills in such abysmal conditions.The series was already wrapped up – and that was the No 1 objective after 12 years without a victory – but this defeat recasts the legacy they will leave. The lasting question will probably be: what if Australia’s Will Skelton had been fit for the opener in Brisbane?Oh, the brutality of it all. Inside the first 43 minutes, Maro Itoje, Tommy Freeman, Tom Lynagh – to a pretty rank shot by Dan Sheehan, who was lucky to escape punishment – and James Ryan were all withdrawn with head injuries. Skelton and Taniela Tupou had ridden roughshod over the record-chasing Lions – trust the Tongan Thor to perform like this in a tempest. We had seen the thunder from Down Under, then came the lightning, calling a halt to proceedings for 38 minutes.View image in fullscreenTempers flare as Nic White and Jamison Gibson-Park get into a confrontation during the third Test.Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPSydney has been a squall all week. It has felt like endless rain, punctuated by torrential downpours. The kind where it feels like golf balls are falling out of the sky. So it was at the Olympic Park. On the way, a generous Lions supporter could be heard offering free ponchos to anyone who had failed to read the forecast. An hour before kick-off and spectators were dashing for cover. Neither side looked particularly interested in beginning their warm-ups while the lines on the pitch had to be repainted, by order of the match officials.All things considered then, not the ideal conditions for the Lions to set about wrapping up the whitewash. It has been a long old season for a lot of these players. It began 11 months ago for many and plenty have exceeded the 30-match threshold.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tourists’ lineout wobbled, as it did all match, they lost their talisman Itoje to a head injury inside the opening half-hour, and Freeman followed before the half was up. He was struggling with a back injury and is among those players whose game-time this season cannot help but lead to fatigue.View image in fullscreenThe Lions captain, Maro Itoje, lifts the series trophy.Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/PAAustralia, meanwhile, showcased some stunning handling that has always been their trademark, even in these horrible conditions. The Lions simply could not match them, reduced to relying on Finn Russell kicking for territory. It was effective at first, but pretty wayward thereafter. The press box here is situated right next to that of the coaches. As Farrell trudged down to the changing room shortly before half-time, amid the storm, he wore a face like thunder.The second half was less than three minutes old before the stoppage and the Lions were arguably more error-strewn after the restart. Farrell complained that “rigor mortis” had set in and clearly the Lions were thrown by the break. Australia, for their part, were rigorous – Joe Schmidt even revealing that the Wallabies were aware that lightning was in the area and had come up with a plan should it materialise.That Australia were on the pitch, warming up far earlier than the Lions, only served to highlight that they were more prepared. They were sharper and proceeded to take the game away from their visitors. Perhaps there were better ways to spend the break in play than worrying about the cameras.Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025British & Irish LionsAustralia rugby union teamAustralia sportRugby unionanalysisShareReuse this content"

Shortly after, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) saidthe reports were “false”but the IDF told the Guardian that the incident was “still under review”.Iain Overton and Lucas Tsantzouris, the team at AOAV, said the statistics suggested Israel was seeking to create a “pattern of impunity” by failing to conclude or find no fault in the vast majority of cases involving “the most severe or public accusations of wrongdoing by their forces”.The IDF said it “conducts examination and investigation processes regarding exceptional incidents that occurred during operational activity, in which there is a suspicion of a violation of the law” in accordance with its obligations under Israeli and international law.It operates internal systems to conduct examinations and allegations of war crimes, including criminal investigations by the military advocate general’s police department and fact-finding assessments (FFA) by a separate team in the general staff.The relatively short passage of time, in investigatory and legal terms, means other unresolved cases may also result in prosecutions, though the two researchers said IDF inquiries had become “more opaque and slow-moving” as the number of civilian casualties in Gaza has mounted.AOAV said it had found reports of 52 cases in English-language media where the Israeli military said it had conducted or would conduct an investigation after allegations of civilian harm or wrongdoing by its forces in Gaza or theWest Bankbetween October 2023 and the end of June 2025. They involve the deaths of 1,303 Palestinians and the wounding of 1,880.One case resulted in a prison sentence for an Israeli soldier. An IDF reservist receiveda seven-month jail term in Februaryafter he was convicted by a military court of the aggravated abuse of Palestinian security detainees. He had repeatedly attacked bound and blindfolded prisoners with his fists, a baton and his assault rifle at the Sde Teiman detention centre.Five other cases ended with violations found. In one,an IDF colonel and a major were sacked in April 2024and three other commanders reprimanded a few days after seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen were killed in an airstrike. The IDF said it was a “grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification”, though the charity said the rapid investigation lacked credibility.The remaining 46 cases, representing 88% of the total, seven were closed without any finding of fault, AOAV said. A further 39 remain under review or with no outcome reported, including four deadly incidents over the course of last month when Palestinians were killed near or at various food distribution points on the Gaza Strip.According to the IDF: “Any report … complaint or allegation that suggests misconduct by IDF forces undergoes an initial examination process, irrespective of its source.” In some instances the evidence is such that a criminal investigation by military police is ordered, while in others an initial investigation takes place.These are referred to the IDF general staff’s FFA mechanism to determine “whether there is a reasonable suspicion of criminal misconduct”. Critics of the system, such as the Yesh Din human rights group, say FFA investigations can take years and have led toone known prosecutionafter 664 inquiries relating to previous IDF military operations in Gaza, in 2014, 2018-19 and 2021.In August 2024, the IDF said the FFA had collected information on “hundreds of incidents” relating to the war in Gaza alone, while the military advocate general’s office had launched 74 criminal investigations.Of these, 52 related to the deaths and mistreatment of detainees and 13 to the stealing of enemy ammunition, while a minority related to allegations of war crimes in combat situations. Three related to the “destruction of civilian property without military necessity” and six concerning “alleged illegal use of force”.The IDF statistics differ from the investigations tracked by AOAV because the research group used a different methodology. AOAV reviewed episodes where there were reports of an investigation being or having been conducted and also took in incidents on the West Bank as well as Gaza.The IDF said that “dozens of military police investigations have been opened” and that “most of these investigations are still ongoing”. The FFA mechanism, meanwhile, had “completed its review in dozens of cases” and these had transferred to the military advocate general for possible criminal investigation.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaWar crimesPalestinian territoriesInternational lawWest BanknewsShareReuse this content"

That attempt was ultimately rejected.“I thought it was pretty unprecedented and pretty disgraceful,” said Dean, who sits on an influential parliamentary committee that scrutinises City firms, regulators and the Treasury.The chancellor had also beenconsidering overruling the supreme court’s decisionwith retrospective legislation to help save lenders billions of pounds, in the event that it upheld the entirety of October’s court of appeal ruling, the Guardian revealed last week.“What message does it send to consumers that the industry can do wrong, the courts can support the claim that they’ve done something wrong, but the government is ready to intervene and defend the industry that’s done wrong, instead of defending the consumer? I think that’s a really bad message to put out,” Dean said.“I feel like this government sometimes is too keen to demonstrate it is on the side of business, and is sometimes not understanding the rights of consumer,” he added.Reeves’s intervention efforts followed intensive lobbying by the car loan industry, which feared the supreme court would upholdlast October’s shock ruling by the appeal court.That October ruling suggested commission payments paid by lenders to car dealers were unlawful, unless explicitly disclosed to borrowers. It could have opened the door to billions of pounds of compensation claims against companies including Lloyds Banking Group, Santander UK, Barclays and Close Brothers, and result in a redress scheme that rivalled the £50bn payment protection insurancesaga.Lobby group the Financing and Leasing Association (FLA) – which represents car lenders – had warned the government that a big compensation bill could push some lenders into failure, while others would offer fewer or more expensive loans to claw back their losses. That could restrict options for people who relied on credit.City bosses were also warning the Treasury that the continuing uncertainty over the scandal was deterring international investment in the finance industry, and was therefore putting the UK’s economic growth at riskThe FLA’s head of motor finance, Adrian Dally, said that the lobby group was pleased with the supreme court’s ruling, and felt its concerns had been heard by Treasury and regulators. He confirmed the FLA had been speaking with the Treasury nearly every week since the court of appeal ruling in October, including about its concerns on the car finance case.However, he rejected suggestions the Treasury had prioritised the industry over consumers. “We absolutely disagree with that because, ultimately, this [car finance] industry is a vital part of the nation’s infrastructure, and enables millions of people to get to work, to get to school, and that was put at risk by these court cases. And ultimately, we believe the industry’s interests and the consumers’ interests are aligned on this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are determined to do everything we can to stop them – wherever they operate.”The change will also make it a crime to post online content that encourages someone to break UK immigration law in exchange for money.Cooper will also introduce a new fast-track scheme in the autumn in an attempt to address the asylum backlog.The aim is for decisions to be made in weeks rather than years and comes after protests in Epping, London, Manchester and Newcastle over people staying in hotels while awaiting asylum decisionsShe will also tighten the rules around the interpretation of “exceptional circumstances” in immigration cases and the use of article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which protects the right to family and private life.Rob Jones, the director general for operations at the NationalCrimeAgency (NCA), said: “We know many of the people-smuggling networks risking lives transporting people to the UK promote their services to migrants using social media.“The majority of migrants arriving in the UK will have engaged with smugglers in this way.”The NCA has taken action against organised crime groups using social media to promote crossings, including a south Wales-based gang convicted in November 2024 after smuggling thousands of people across Europe.The gang used social media videos posted by people who had made successful crossings to promote the service.Another networkoperated bythe Preston-based smuggler Amanj Hasan Zada, who was later jailed for 17 years, also posted videos of people thanking Zada for helping them.There have been cases of Albanian people smugglers who have used social media to promote £12,000 “package deals” to get to the UK including accommodation and employment, which will also fall under the scope of the new law.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCrimeImmigration and asylumMigrationSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

The club want land used as a rail freight terminal to complete the Old Trafford Regeneration Project, which they claim will bring £7.3bn a year to the UK economy.United have held talks with Freightliner, the haulage company that owns and operates the terminal, about buying the land, but negotiations are deadlocked due to a disagreement over the price.View image in fullscreenFreightliner owns the land next to the existing Old Trafford, where United want to create this new stadium.Photograph: Foster + Partners/PAWhile Freightliner is understood to have expressed a willingness to relocate from Trafford Park to nearby St Helens, the company is seeking around £400m for the land, with United valuing it at between £40m and £50m. Ratcliffe has made it clear United are unwilling to accept the asking price set by Freightliner’s parent company, Brookfield, and initial discussions are believed to have reached an impasse.A source said Freightliner “have United over a barrel”. The company is willing to relocate to a proposed new site that would offer increased capacity for trains, but it is in no rush to move. The club’s view is that Freightliner will only receive what would be a significant windfall if they are willing to drop the asking price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Manchester United unveil 100,000-seat new stadium projectRead moreWhenunveiling designs for the Old Trafford master plan, produced by Foster + Partners, in March, Ratcliffe set an ambitious target of completing what he described as a five-year build by 2030. United had been hoping to begin preparatory building work by the end of this year, but failing to secure the Freightliner site will delay the start date.United’s options at this stage would be to increase their offer, wait for Freightliner to lower its demands, or scale back the project so that the freight terminal land is not required. It is also possible the newOld Trafford Mayoral Development Corporation, chaired by SebastianCoe, could issue a compulsory purchase order, although that would be subject to legal challenges and would lead to further delays.Completion by 2030 was always seen as an ambitious target outside the senior leadership team at Old Trafford, given United have yet to obtain planning permission, secure ownership of all the land required or formally appoint architects. While Foster + Partners produced the artist impressions and videos of the proposed new stadium, the club plan to run a formal tender process to appoint architects.‘Zippos circus is in town!’ Can Man Utd really raise £2bn for a throbbing big top?Read moreAt a Fans Forum event on 30 June, United conceded that securing the land required could prove an obstacle to beginning work this year. United were asked by supporters whether building would commence in 2025 or 2026 and responded: “Planning work is continuing, including the consultations with fans discussed during today’s meeting.“Discussions are also ongoing with local authorities, land owners and potential funding partners with a view to securing the land and the finance we need to proceed with the project. It remains our ambition to proceed with the project as quickly as possible, but we can only do this once the necessary land and funding is in place.”View image in fullscreenHow Manchester United’s new home could look on match days.Photograph: ReutersUnited have estimated the cost of the project at £4.2bn, but claim it will bring huge social and economic benefits to the local community and wider region, including 92,000 jobs, more than 17,000 new homes as well as attracting an extra 1.8 million visitors annually.The cost for the stadium has been projected by United to be around £2bn, although given the tented roof alone is likely to cost £300m, industry sources say £3bn is a more realistic budget. Freightliner’s demands for £400m could result in the redevelopment being significantly over budget from the start.United are not seeking any public money to build the stadium itself. The club declined to comment on a private commercial negotiation.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedManchesterGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Why is it my job to provide mental health support for whatever reason it is that you ended up in that [situation]?’“Do you know what it is? Free labour of women is where it comes from.“It comes from a fundamentally sexist place in that women didn’t have these services, so a load of women across the country got together and made these services and offered them to other women for free, and they didn’t get paid for their labour.“So they put down a mattress and made a refuge. They set up counselling services and got people who were trained to be therapists and got their voluntary hours and set it up for free.”Phillips said people do not recognise how heavily the UK has relied on women providing support that previously did not existShe added: “Nobody offered diabetes medicine for free. Pharmaceutical companies didn’t go, ‘Wow, this is really important. People will die without this. We’ll just give it away for free.’“That is what the women in our country did in the 1960s and 1970s and 1980s and we got fat on that expectation that that service will be provided for free.“And we also belittled it as an issue that wasn’t absolutely, fundamentally mainstream to the safety and security of our nation.“Undoing that is really hard and it’s going to take a long time.”Explore more on these topicsJess PhillipsWomenViolence against women and girlsCharitiesVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Organisers said more than 800,000 young pilgrims from 146 countries around the world had assembled as part of a Jubilee of Youth – and perhaps as many as 1 million.Smiling from his popemobile, the first US pope waved to throngs of screaming young people lining his route, many running for a better vantage point.Pope condemns Gaza war’s ‘barbarity’ as 93 reported killed by Israeli fire while waiting for foodRead moreThey had already spent the day in the hot sun listening to music, praying and talking with fellow Catholics. “The pope is here” announced an excited voice over the public address to thunderous applause from the crowd.But the tenor of the event became more solemn and contemplative as the pope took to the stage, carrying a large wood cross. “Dear young people, after walking, praying and sharing these days of grace of the Jubilee dedicated to you, we now gather together in the light of the advancing evening to keep vigil together,” Leo, 69, told them.In the crowd was French pilgrim Julie Mortier, 18, whose voice was hoarse from singing and screaming for hours. “We’re too happy to be here. Seeing the pope, that’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she said.Event organisers said people had continued to arrive during the vigil and that it was possible that attendance numbers had reached 1 million.View image in fullscreenPope Leo XIV arrived on a helicopter to the Jubilee of Youth prayer vigil.Photograph: Vatican Pool/Getty ImagesMost pilgrims said they would camp overnight for a Sunday morning mass at the site led by Leo. That will mark the culmination of the week-long youth pilgrimage, a key event in the Catholic church’s Jubilee holy year.Some in the crowd were so far away they could not see the massive stage with a golden arch and towering cross that dominated the open area – which at more than 500,000 sq m was the size of about 70 football fields.“I’m so happy to be here, even if I’m a bit far from the pope. I knew what to expect,” British student Andy Hewellyn said.“The main thing is that we’re all together,” he said ahead of the pope’s appearance, as other young people nearby played guitars, sang or snoozed in the sun.Italian broadcaster Rai called the event a Catholic “Woodstock”, as throughout the day nearly two dozen musical and dance groups, many of them religious, entertained the crowds.In a video message, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, welcomed pilgrims to the capital, who were “praying, singing, joking among themselves, celebrating in an extraordinary party”.The Jubilee of Youth, which began on Monday, comes nearly three months after the start of Leo’s papacy, and 25 years after the last such massive youth gathering in Rome under Poland’s pope, John Paul II.Early on Saturday, groups of young people set off from central Rome for the venue in Tor Vergata. They were ready to spend the next 24 hours surrounded by a crowd of people and sleep under the stars.Victoria Perez, who carried a Spanish flag, could not contain her excitement at seeing “the pope up close”. “It’s the first time I’m going to see him, and I can’t wait,” the 21-year-old said, looking forward to a “night of prayers under the stars”.French pilgrim Quentin Remaury, 26, said he had been inspired by the late Pope Francis’s rousing message to youth during a 2016 visit to Krakow, Poland. “Pope Francis told us to ‘get off your couches’, and that really gave me a boost,” he said.Throughout the week, attenders participated in church-planned events, such as confession at Circus Maximus, one of Rome’s top tourist spots.On Friday, about 1,000 priests were on hand, with 200 white gazebos serving as makeshift confessionals lining the hippodrome where chariot races were once held in Ancient Rome.The pilgrimage unfolds as under-30s navigate economic uncertainty, the climate crisis and international conflict, with some pilgrims travelling from war-torn areas such as Syria and Ukraine.Samarei Semos, 29, who said she had travelled three days from her native Belize to get to Rome, said she hoped Leo would have a strong say about “third world countries”.The Vatican said that before the vigil the pope had met and prayed with travellers accompanying an 18-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who died on Friday night.Rai News reported that the young woman had died of a heart attack on a bus while returning to her lodging from an event in Rome.Security at the venue was tight, and organisers said at least 4,300 volunteers and more than 1,000 police were watching over the vigil.Explore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVThe papacyCatholicismChristianityReligionItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Without evidence to back his claims, the president wrote onsocial mediathat were numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad” and the US economy was, in fact, “BOOMING” on his watch.Trump fires labor statistics chief hours after data showed jobs growth slowedRead moreBut the firing of McEntarfer, who had been confirmed to her role in January 2024 during Joe Biden’s presidency, has alarmed members of Trump’s own party.“If the president is firing the statistician because he doesn’t like the numbers but they are accurate, then that’s a problem,” said Wyoming Republican senator Cynthia Lummis. “It’s not the statistician’s fault if the numbers are accurate and that they’re not what the president had hoped for.”Lummis added that if the numbers are unreliable, the public should be told – but firing McEntarfer was “kind of impetuous”.North Carolina senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, said: “If she was just fired because the president or whoever decided to fire the director just … because they didn’t like the numbers, they ought to grow up.”Kentucky senator Rand Paul, another Republican, questioned whether McEntarfer’s firing was an effective way of improving the numbers.“We have to look somewhere for objective statistics,” he said. “When the people providing the statistics are fired, it makes it much harder to make judgments that you know, the statistics won’t be politicized.”According to NBC News, Paul said his “first impression” was that “you can’t really make the numbers different or better by firing the people doing the counting”.Tillis and Paul were both opponents of Trump’s recent economic legislative package, which the president dubbed the “big, beautiful bill”.But Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who supported the legislation after winning substantial economic support for her state, remarked that the jobs numbers could not be trusted – and “that’s the problem”.“And when you fire people, then it makes people trust them even less,” she said.William Beach, a former BLS commissioner appointed by Trump in his first presidency,posted on Xthat McEntarfer’s firing was “totally groundless”.

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders described it as “the sign of an authoritarian type”, and he said the decision would make it harder for the American people “to believe the information that comes out of the government”.Paul Schroeder, executive director of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics, described the president’s allegation against McEntarfer as “very damaging and outrageous”.He said: “Not only does it undermine the integrity of federal economic statistics, but it also politicizes data which need to remain independent and trustworthy.

An ocean chase ending with two boats crunching aground on the sand, a stumbling attempt by three men to escape into the dunes, dramatic arrests and the discovery of millions of pounds of cocaine.For the investigators it was the start of a painstaking investigation that has shone a unique light into a tactic used by South American drug gangs and British organised crime groups known as at-sea drop-offs or Asdos, in which bales of cocaine fitted with GPS trackers are dumped at sea from a transatlantic “mother” ships to be picked up by small vessels and smuggled into the UK via quiet coves and harbours.What made Operation Libellary particularly satisfying for the investigators is that they caught people involved in a number of different aspects of the crime – including a Hampshire fisher fallen on hard times who was recruited for his seafaring ability, a Colombian enforcer there to make sure the pickup went smoothly, and members of an “Essex crime group” believed to be part of the gang that had bought the consignment and would have sold it on the streets of south-east England.Barry Vinall of the NationalCrimeAgency (NCA), who was the senior investigating officer, said the seven men caught and convicted of conspiracy to import class A drugs were pivotal figures. “You’ve got organisers, logistics, security, customers,” he said.View image in fullscreenPackages of cocaine in the dinghy that took part in the at-sea drop-off. The image was found on the phone of Edwin Yahir Tabora Baca, believed to have been the Colombian enforcer.Composite: National Crime AgencyIt began with a lucky break for the law enforcement agencies. The UK Border Force cutter HMC Valiant was patrolling off the coast ofCornwallon 13 September last year when officers noticed a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) on the horizon. They knew there was a “mother ship” in the area so went to take a look and the RHIB sped off.For 28 miles the three men in the RHIB stayed ahead of the Border Force boat, tipping overboard packages of what turned out to be cocaine.The chase ended onGwynver beachnear Land’s End, when the three – Peter Williams, 44, Scott Johnston, 38, and Edwin Yahir Tabora Baca, 33 – were arrested. A Garmin chart plotter and knives were found. The men had ditched 11 bales of cocaine into the water. Border Force officials recovered six of them, worth about £18m.A team of NCA officers was dispatched from London to Cornwall. “We deployed fast time,” said Vinall. “It was all hands to the pump. We needed to gather as much information of what they’d been up to and who they were.”They found out that Williams was a fisher by trade. He is a familiar figure at Emsworth harbour in Hampshire, where he ran a fishing outfit and fishmonger’s called Fresh from the Boat. It supplied hotels, pubs and hotels and sold fish from its own shop, winning a number of small business awards.But Williams had endured a torrid few years. In February 2022,his boat, Tia Maria, was wreckedinStorm Eunice. “We are feeling pretty broken and it’s hard to keep it all together,” Fresh from the Boat wrote on its website.View image in fullscreenThe RHIB used in the failed smuggling operation on Gwynver Beach.Photograph: National Crime AgencyLocal people rallied andorganised a crowd-funder to help Williams buy a new boat, Brenda C, but he also had to put his own money into the business and the financial pressure was taking a toll.NCA officers examined CCTV from the harbour showing that over the months there had been a number of suspicious-looking meetings between Williams and others. “That started us looking at a wider network that was involved,” said Vinall.Tabora Baca is from Barcelona and initially came up with an unlikely story, saying he was a tourist who had accepted an invitation from two strangers to go fishing.His phone told a different tale. Officers found messages from his boss telling him he would be going to sea with Williams and Johnston, another Hampshire man, to scoop up packages of cocaine dropped by a ship.Vinall said: “These ships come through and dump a load and then multiple organised crime groups come out a bit like the seagulls following the fishing trawlers, to collect the drugs.” Tabora Baca was believed to be acting as security, perhaps for a cartel, to make sure each customer took the share they were due.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The NCA believes these men were there to take the cocaine back to the east of England to be sold on the streets of Essex and London.View image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: Alex Fowlie, Terry Willis, Scott Johnston, Michael May, Bobbie Pearce and Peter Williams.Photograph: National Crime AgencyAfter the RHIB was spotted and the chase began, Johnston phoned Willis from the boat, presumably telling him it had all gone wrong, before dumping his phone in the sea. The three Essex men immediately left the area in a white van and a BMW.Another vital clue was a sticker on the RHIB from a marine company in north Wales. The NCA contacted the company and found it had been bought by Alex Fowlie, 35, from West Sussex, for £70,000 a few months earlier. He is the seventh man involved and seen as a key facilitator.Fowlie was so confident that he would not be found that while the Asdo was in progress, he was enjoying a mini-break with his partner close by – in the north Cornwall surfing town of Newquay. “It was a strange place to go when there’s a drug importation coming in,” said Vinall. “But he was there posting pictures all over Facebook.”Losing some product and some smugglers is an occupational hazard. Three days after the Gwynver Beach chase – at which point he thought he was in the clear – Fowlie was arranging another Asdo pickup.“We’re good to get a team ready,” he told an accomplice in a message the NCA found. “We just need the fisherman and one of us go out with him and they send one of their lads to keep an eye on things.“You’ve got your radars. If you see anything coming towards you, just drop it back in. It’s got its GPS and then we come out with the RHIBs and grab it after. It’s zero fucking risk.”Not quite. Tabora Baca, Johnston, Willis and May were given hefty sentences for conspiracy to import class A drugs on Friday 1 August. The rest are being sentenced for the same offence on Thursday 21 August.Explore more on these topicsDrugs tradeCornwallCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The erstwhile adviser to John Major has “close personal friendships with many senior Conservative party politicians”,he has said, and as president of the Witney constituency association in the Cotswolds is “close friends” with its most notable MP: David Cameron.When the pandemic reached Britain early in 2020, Chadlington was a director and shareholder of a company registered in Jersey, majority-owned and run by David Sumner, a serial entrepreneur then based in Dubai.During the first lockdown, Chadlington embarked on an effort to introduce a Sumner company to supply PPE. He contacted Cameron first,texting himat 7.13am on 19 April 2020. Cameron texted back that his own close friendAndrew Feldman, whom he had appointed to the House of Lords when he was prime minister, was working for the government on PPE procurement.Chadlington then texted Feldman, who said to get in touch on his new Department of Health and Social Care email address. By 8.04am, less than an hour after his initial text to Cameron, Chadlington was emailing Feldman, copying in Sumner, to make a direct introduction.“David,” Chadlington wrote, addressing Sumner. “This is my friend Andrew Feldman. He can help you with PPE we discussed this morning. Drop me off chain. Peter.”View image in fullscreenLord Chadlington is close friends with many senior Conservatives, including the former prime minister David Cameron.Photograph: Nick Harvey/Getty Images for CartierSumner then sent Feldman an offer to supply PPE. Feldman forwarded it to civil servants operating the VIP lane, telling them: “An interesting offer from David Sumner who was introduced to me by Lord Chadlington.”A week later, the DHSC awarded Sumner’s UK company – a small, loss-making healthcare staff agency, SG Recruitment – a £24m contract to supply coveralls. A month later the government gave the company a second contract, worth £26m, to supply hand sanitiser.The full story of how this £50m example of the government’s VIP lane commissioning turned out is only becoming clearer now. It was far from a success. Despite the government contracts, SG Recruitment, later renamed, went into liquidation in December 2023. The liquidators have just issued their official report. It confirmed for the first time that the DHSC entirely rejected as “unusable” the PPE supplied under the first contract, and has put in a claim for the full £24m.However, all the money has gone from the company. It went bust owing £1.1m in taxes to HMRC. The liquidators found that payments were made out of the company to connected businesses and “unknown third parties”, some apparently overseas. The main bank account was closed in December 2021. Sumner transferred ownership of the company in March 2023 to a woman the liquidators said they believed to be a Philippine national, whom they were unable to contact. The sum total of money found was in an overseas transfers account: £5.The parent company, Sumner Group Holdings (SGH), of which Chadlington was a director then chair, went into liquidation earlier, in 2022. Chadlington’s lawyers told the Guardian in June 2023 that when he put the Sumner companies forward for PPE contracts, he was unaware they had financial difficulties.“He had no information which gave rise to financial concerns regarding SGH and/or SGR in April 2020,” they said.But the Guardian has seen evidence that indicates Chadlington was made aware in January 2020 that some SGH creditors were pushing the company, and Sumner personally, to repay at least $18m, claiming that they were owed in total approximately $30m at that time.There is also publicly revealed evidence that the Sumner companies were under financial pressure before Chadlington made his introduction. SGH was put into liquidation by a consultant, Douglas Geertz, whose fees were never paid. A2022 court judgmentnoted that SGH’s chief operating officer told him in the summer of 2018: “I regret that SGH finds itself in very challenging financial circumstances.”In December 2019 other creditors had sued another Sumner group company in the British Virgin Islands for £2m. A published court judgment noted that: “Relations [with these creditors] deteriorated in late 2018 and collapsed completely in September 2019.” The £2m appears never to have been paid.View image in fullscreenThe lawyer for the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice group, which represents relatives of 7,500 people who died of Covid, has been very critical of the VIP lane.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersSG Recruitment, the UK company, hadmade losses of £700,000, and was financially reliant on SGH, in the year before it was awarded the PPE contracts.Despite all this, Chadlington used his connections to contact senior Conservative figures from April 2020, including Matt Hancock, then the health secretary, promoting Sumner as a supplier of PPE. Chadlington encouraged Sumner to secure contracts, messaging him after the approach to Feldman with “Brilliant. Keep going” and “Excellent. Looks like you have an inside track.”Chadlington has twice been investigated by theHouse of Lordscommissioner for standards for his approach to Feldman, under a section of the conduct code that says peers “must not seek to profit from membership of the House”. Chadlington did not tell either investigation that he sent the email introducing Sumner to Feldman. He told the commissioner’s second inquiry in August 2023: “I did not facilitate an introduction.” He was cleared of any misconduct both times.Chadlington has now disclosed that email introduction and the text messages he exchanged with Cameron, Feldman, Hancock and Sumner, after he was asked to provide evidence to the Covid-19 public inquiry. It published the messages and his witness statement in May this year.Chaired by Heather Hallett, the inquiry is considering the VIP lane as part of its examination into how the government handled the pandemic. TheCovid Bereaved Families for Justice(CBFFJ) group, which represents relatives of 7,500 people who died of Covid, is an inquiry core participant. The CBFFJ’s lead lawyer, Pete Weatherby KC, has been very critical of the VIP lane andhighlighted SG Recruitmentas a key example. The inquiry is looking at how Chadlington’s introduction affected the contracts being awarded, but not at whether the PPE was ultimately delivered.Johnson’s government’s operation of the VIP lane has been widely criticised for prioritising politically connected companies ever sinceits existence was leakedin October 2020. As the government frantically scrambled to fill depleted stockpiles, it spent £12bn on PPE in 2020-21, of whichalmost £9bn had to be written offbecause it was substandard, defective, past its use-by date or overpriced. The UK Anti-Corruption Coalitionhas pointed to evidencethat VIP lane contracts cost £3.8bn, almost 30% of the total, and delivered more expensive and more unusable PPE than non-VIP contracts. Hancock and other ministershave defended the VIP lane, arguing that it enabled the government to prioritise credible offers.Chadlington was a director of SGH from 2018, then was appointed chair in April 2020, starting the role in June 2020, his lawyers said. In hisstatement to the Covid inquiry, Chadlington said that it was later, “within a few months” of becoming chair, that he and his fellow SGH directors did become “increasingly concerned” about the way the business was being run.“We were concerned about unpaid wages and fees, contracts falling through, and increasingly vague and confusing responses from Mr Sumner and the management team to questions from the SGH board, as well as Mr Sumner’s apparent overoptimism about the state of the business.”Despite this, as late as April 2021, Chadlington was enthusiastically supporting Sumner to bid for a further government PPE contract, telling a fellow director that Sumner was being asked to quote “on a huge (and I mean huge!) contract” to supply gloves. That showed that the government “have no doubts about our legitimacy”, he wrote to the director. The same day he messaged Sumner, encouraging him to publicly market the company as a government supplier. Ultimately the company was accepted as a possible supplier of gloves, but no contracts were awarded.Chadlington has repeatedly said he did not personally benefit from the PPE contracts, telling the Lords commissioner’s first inquiry in 2022: “I received no commission, bonus or direct financial benefit from the two contracts awarded to SG Recruitment Limited.”The Guardian has seen SGH filings in Jersey showing that in the year after the award of the contracts, Chadlington was issued with 27.5m new shares in the company, which he appears not to have paid for. Chadlington’s lawyers said the shares were not a bonus, they were “growth shares” issued to him and the other non-executive directors after he became chair and reorganised the board.Three months after supporting Sumner to bid for the PPE gloves deal, in July 2021 Chadlington resigned from SGH. All the non-executive directors were owed fees, he has said, and they resigned at the same time. Chadlington was owed $100,000 director’s fees when SGH went into liquidation, almost $350,000 in consultancy fees, and a $180,000 loan.Sumner, who is believed to be in the Philippines, replied to the Guardian’s questions by email. He said the DHSC reduced the amount of hand sanitiser bought under the second contract, paying £16.6m rather than £26m, so £40.6m for the two contracts. Sumner said the company had the required commercial and regulatory experience to supply PPE and delivered in accordance with the contracts, and that profit margins were “circa 15%”, although he did not provide evidence for this. He did not answer questions about the payments made out of SG Recruitment, or the closing of its bank accounts in 2021, but said that all money was “accounted for properly”.In relation to its liquidation, he said the company “was sold to a third party” almost a year before, “so it is very disappointing that the new owners had not made a success of the company”. He said he did not accept Chadlington’s criticisms of his management. Of the SGH liquidation and questions about the $30m debts creditors were claiming, Sumner said: “SGH Jersey was not a contracting party and so not relevant.”After Chadlington provided his messages to the Covid inquiry, the Lords standards commissioner has sinceopened a third inquiry. The possible conduct breaches are the same as previously, but also this time whether he failed to act on his “personal honour”. That appears to be a question of whether he was not fully transparent with the two previous inquiries.Chadlington’s lawyers responded to the Guardian’s questions by saying that he did not act in any way improperly “in connecting Mr Sumner with Lord Feldman”. They said it was up to the government, not Chadlington, to carry out due diligence on SG Recruitment.In relation to questions about his knowledge of SGH’s financial position, and the $30m debts, when he introduced Sumner for government PPE contracts, the lawyers said: “Our client understood that while the company had faced some cashflow issues, these were common to most startup businesses.” He only became concerned about SGH’s viability later after he became chair, in particular by the beginning of 2021, they said.In his witness statement to theCovid inquiry, Chadlington said: “While I was not involved in the awarding of contracts for PPE, I was proud that, by making the necessary introductions, I had played a very small role in helping the country during a national emergency.”A DHSC spokesperson said after Labour was elected to government, it has sought to recover money from PPE contracts that did not deliver. He did not answer questions about SG Recruitment, saying the DHSC cannot currently discuss specific companies.A spokesperson for the CBFFJ said: “While our loved ones were dying, often without the PPE that could have protected them, the system enabled political insiders to use their connections to secure public contracts. It is devastating to learn that the PPE from one of SG Recruitment’s contracts was rejected as unusable. This is exactly the kind of evidence the Covid inquiry should be examining. Bereaved families deserve answers. The public deserves answers. Justice means getting to the bottom of how this happened, who benefited, and who should be held accountable.”Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsLobbyingCovid inquiryConservativesHealth policyPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

In some sections of the famed street market the restrictions cover the whole week, while in others only three days. To enforce the new rules, large grey concrete slabs and garish red barriers have been placed along the street.Amid the bustle of Portobello Road market on Friday afternoon, tourists were lining up outside Will Thacker’s famed blue door to have their picture taken. “It feels like I’m watching the movie again,” said Ella, 14, a fan of the hit romantic comedy. Metres away from the door, which was replaced after being sold at auction for £5,750 in 1999, sat the concrete blocks and imposing barriers.If Notting Hill were filmed today, the visible restrictions “would take away” from the movie, said Ella’s mother, Katie Alasky. The barriers and travel restrictions were put in place on the advice of counter-terror police who have warned of the potential threat of vehicle attacks.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Preval-Reed: “If Notting Hill was filmed here today, I think it would look a bit sad.”Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThe 44-year-old lawyer, who was visitingLondonfrom New Orleans, said: “We love it here, it’s a great atmosphere with all of the stands and the unique things, minus the barriers. It’s so unfortunate – seeing them is a sign of how we live now.”James Darcy, 33, who works in construction, has seen Notting Hill about “20 times”. He was visiting the blue door from Melbourne, Australia. “If filmed today, it probably wouldn’t be the same, that’s for sure.” While he acknowledged the new restrictions had been imposed for everybody’s safety, he said they detracted “from the historic and vintage vibe”.While some regard the roadblocks as an eyesore, there have been practical and financial consequences for market traders. Some have struggled to restock their stalls as vehicles are not allowed behind the barriers before 4pm.Charlotte Preval-Reed, 47, sells prints that promote “positive thoughts”. “If Notting Hill was filmed here today, I think it would look a bit sad,” she said.View image in fullscreenHugh Grant in the 1999 film Notting Hill.Photograph: Polygram Filmed Entertainment/AllstarPreval-Reed said business had been significantly affected by the measures and that footfall had plummeted since they had been erected. She said it had been “100% the worst” period of trading since Covid.“If it carries on, I could potentially not be able to run my business at all because it just wouldn’t be worth it in terms of how much of an income loss I’ve suffered,” she said.Local residents have also been affected. “I’m not a designer but I’m sure I could design something better than that,” said Patrick Somers, 65, a former lawyer who lives in a side-road behind the market.Somers said people had only found out about the restrictions a few days before they had been implemented on 1 July. He is now leading a legal challenge, with the help of the law firm Broadfield, on behalf of residents and traders against Kensington and Chelsea council, who enacted the changes.“They have not thought this through. We’ve got all sorts of unintended consequences here,” said Somers. He feared the curtailed access could pose a danger in an emergency situation.View image in fullscreenPatrick Somers: ‘I’m sure I could design something better than that.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“My wife’s mother was very ill and unfortunately died in April. We had a call that she was getting to that end-of-life stage in the middle of the afternoon.” If the barriers had been in place at the time, they would not have been able to drive out of his road, Somers said.Recently, an ambulance had been unable to get past barriers to attend to a child who was having respiratory problems, Somers said. “The ambulance arrived but couldn’t get in.” They parked farther away and had to carry “huge backpacks” with them, but “didn’t have the right equipment so had to go all the way back again”.Somers said the child was fine in the end but “might not have been”.He said: “We can’t be having a situation where there’s not easy access for an emergency vehicle.” The council said emergency services had been consulted about the scheme and maintained they were able to access the road.Somers conceded that the area did need anti-terror measures, as long as they were introduced in the right way. “There should be bollards but they’ve done it in the wrong way. We’ve seen them being implemented and managed really effectively in other parts of London.”View image in fullscreenAnna Twigg, right, with her mother, Dolina, thought the slabs were great for sitting on.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianWhile the concrete slabs are meant to be a security deterrent, many tourists are using them for something else. “They’re great for sitting,” said Anna Twigg, 39, an artist who was visiting London from Oban, Scotland, with her mother, Dolina, 65, a former social worker.The two women agreed there should be some form of barrier to act as an anti-terror measure, but thought there was room for improvement. “They could be a wee bit more attractive,” said Dolina.A Kensington and Chelsea council spokesperson said: “Our top priority remains the safety and wellbeing of everyone in the community and we believe the current measures strike a reasonable balance between protecting the public and supporting the needs of individuals.“We continue to speak with residents and businesses, addressing concerns case by case to help inform proposals for a permanent scheme.”Explore more on these topicsLondonNotting HillLocal governmentLocal politicsTransportRoad safetyUK security and counter-terrorismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s full of howlers, wooden acting and terrible dialogue, but at points it’s so bad it’s funLucy ManganSat 2 Aug 2025 17.10 EDTShareAre you ready for some bad, fun TV made from a bad, fun book? Of course you are! It’s high summer and the air is heavy with promise, so come inside, get comfy on the sofa and prepare to binge an eight-episode adaptation of Alexandre Dumas’ ludicrous potboiler The Count of Monte Cristo.This series from Greg Latter and Sandro Petraglia stars Sam Claflin (last seen on the small screen being very good as the main man of the sextet inDaisy Jones and the Six) as one of the most wronged men in history, Edmond Dantès. Gosh, he goes through the mill.As do we. The two episodes available for review (there was a third, but the site kept crashing – possibly for my own protection) are extraordinary. The plot is simple enough. Wild, of course – that is what keeps you turning the 1,300 or so pages of the book – but straightforward once you realise thatla credibilitéis not an overarching concern.We are in France in 1815, just as Napoleon is escaping Elba and looking forward to his brief return to power. Meanwhile, our man Dantès annoys a fellow sailor, Danglars (Blake Ritson), by being promoted to captain over him. I suspect a lifetime of jokes about his name have rendered Danglars overly touchy, but it proves to be very bad luck for our hero. Because Dantès also narks a man called Fernand Mondego (Harry Taurasi) by sweeping his cousin Mercédès (Ana Girardot) off her feet when Fernand was quite looking forward to doing so himself. Danglars and Fernand duly get together to frame Dantès for treason. Thanks to the self-interest and corruption of Marseille’s deputy prosecutor, Gérard de Villefort (Mikkel Boe Følsgaard), they succeed.Before you can say: “What a trio of dirty dogs!” Dantès is chucked into a carriage and then into a cell on an island fortress, where he moulders away for 10 years with nothing but the maggots in his gruel for company. The crushing despair a man would feel, pushing him to the brink of madness and beyond is conveyed by putting Claflin in a terrible long wig.But then! He hears a tapping from the other side of his cell wall. It is the sound of Abbé Faria, played byJeremy Irons, breaking through. The abbot shares his education and escape plan with his new best mate and they spend the next five years chipping away at the stones and mortar lying between them and freedom. Faria also works out just what dirty doggery has taken place and gives Dantès a raging thirst for vengeance, albeit one that he cannot slake until he is out of Chateau Maggotes.Alas, just as they are about to flee, the abbot has a stroke, leaving him with the strength only to give a 40-minute monologue about the origins and meaning of a scrap of parchment in his ragged pocket. It shows the location of treasure buried on the island of Monte Cristo; he bequeaths it to Dantès before carking it. Dantès puts the corpse in his own bed, sews himself into Faria’s body bag and gets himself thrown off the battlements and into the sea. Liberté!There are two problems. Un, we are but a quarter of the way through this and we still have so much to cover – finding the treasure, becoming the count, fooling Parisian high society, some murders, some currency manipulations, at least one duel, some poisoning, blackmail, embezzlement and assorted other shenanigans. I fear that either the story must have been slashed to ribbons or that we will have to hurtle through at such a speed that it becomes incomprehensible.Incoherence already threatens, because of problème deux: the script. The Count of Monte Cristo requires you to pause it every 45 seconds or so to shake your head at needless utterances such as: “If we can’t get through this storm, we’ll perish.” Some of it is truly unbelievable. Did Dantès really just say: ‘I’d like to add two hours a day to my digging,’ to his abbot friend? Did the abbot honestly ask, in wonderment at the sight of a watch Mercédès had given Dantès: “And you’ve kept it all this time?” Yes, of course! What was he going to do? Lose it somewhere in his teeny tiny cell? Give it to a mouse? Chuck it out the window in a sudden passion for minimalism? (A high proportion of the performances are terrible, too, but let’s be kind and blame most of that on the instructions the actors have been given.)There are enough of these howling absurdities to hobble the pacing, which needs to be fast and furious to cover Dumas’ own, and to prevent the viewer from making any investment in the characters. But their stupidity brings a joy of its own. When the tech gremlins decide I am ready, I look forward to many more episodes.The Count of Monte Cristo aired on U&DramaExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJeremy IronsSam ClaflinDramaAlexandre Dumas, perereviewsShareReuse this content"

A friend was getting married in Australia and I had originally booked the trip with my ex, but when he dropped out after our breakup I decided to go ahead. I was considering quitting my job and moving back to the Netherlands so, even though I didn’t know what my future would look like, I was ready for a holiday. I planned a week with friends in Sydney and Newcastle, a week with a friend travelling up the east coast and a final week on my own.On New Year’s Eve I’d been at an all-day boat party on Sydney Harbour when a friend said she was off to meet an old flame of hers at a fireworks event in Bondi. I remember her telling me he had a nice single brother called Ben and showing me a photo: he had a moustache, was wearing a tank top and didn’t look like my type at all. I told her I wasn’t interested. I just wanted to stay with friends.View image in fullscreenAnne and Ben at Gerringong wine festival on their first road tip togetherPhotograph: Anne WijdeveldWhen my friend’s taxi arrived she pulled me in with her – and thank goodness she did because, when I met Ben in person, he looked completely different to the guy in the photos – tall and handsome with a big smile. He immediately made me laugh. We kissed within 10 minutes of saying hello, which was about half an hour before midnight.The moment I knew: he arranged a stay at a motel. In 1969 this was very risque, but I had zero hesitationRead moreBen had been ill with food poisoning and hadn’t been in particularly high spirits until we arrived but said he immediately forgot about all of that. There was just this instant connection and we both felt as though we had nothing to lose. We lived too far apart to ever see each other again.The following day Ben and his brother invited my friend and me to a music festival. We worried it would be awkward at first but Ben and I picked up where we’d left off. We were like little kids running between stages. The next morning I had to leave for the wedding in Newcastle. I remember kissing Ben goodbye at the ferry terminal in Manly, wondering if I’d ever see this man again but knowing I definitely wanted to. We started texting straight away and I was so distracted I ended up missing my connecting train.Later in the trip I got an ear infection just before a five-day scuba diving expedition on the Great Barrier Reef. I cancelled – and something inside me was happy to, knowing that it would give me five days without a plan. Ben was competing in a triathlon in Nelson Bay and he asked if I wanted to come watch him drown, which felt like a fun way to hang out. It turned out to be an indirect invitation to stay with his aunt and uncle for the weekend. I booked a flight immediately.View image in fullscreenThe couple on a seaplane above Sydney HarbourAt this point I saw the whole thing as a bit of fun – a holiday romance, nothing serious. Being so far from home gave me a kind of “why not” mentality. We both knew long-distance between London and Sydney would never work so we just decided to enjoy each other’s company for as long as we had it.View image in fullscreenBen and Anne at the Australian Open in MelbourneOver the next couple of days we spent time with his aunt and uncle, slept in a tent on the beach and competed in a mini-triathlon together. I remember travelling back to Sydney with Ben holding my hand the whole way back. He didn’t want to let me go and I felt the same way. He booked flights to Melbourne with me for the Australian Open that week, and I ended up delaying my return flight so we could have an extra day together.Leaving each other at Melbourne airport was when we decided to see if maybe we could make long-distance work after all. We agreed to meet in Scotland six weeks later, calling each other every day in the meantime. I met all of Ben’s family and friends on that trip to Scotland and, after four days, he asked me to be his girlfriend. This time when we went our separate ways it wasn’t just goodbye until the next trip; it was goodbye until we moved in together. It wasn’t in my character to do things like this but it just felt right and my friends and family could see that. They told me to take a leap of faith and see what happened.Ben and I reunited eight weeks later at Sydney airport and this time I was holding more than just a holiday bag.It turns out that my first impressions of Ben were right; we talked non-stop that New Year’s Eve and, to be honest, we’ve never really stopped. He is still that fun and charismatic guy who makes me feel comfortable.For now Australia is our home but we plan to move back to Europe together in the longer term. Whether that’s England, Scotland or the Netherlands remains to be seen – that’s for figuring out later down the line. All I know is that we will find our home together.Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Someone in my family does poos in the toilet and doesn’t flush them. They’ve all been blaming each other.[Palmer has four children and a stepson.]It got to the point where I really thought it was my husband, because it was in our toilet. So I actually set up a situation where I pretended the other toilet was blocked and they couldn’t use it, and I stalked my children after each poo. One time I didn’t hear a flush and they ran out to play so I figured out who the phantom pooer was. I won’t out which one of my children it was, but it’s one of them. I keep saying, “It’s not that hard! You do a poo, you press the flush!”What’s the weirdest thing in your fridge right now?Let me go have a look. I have garlic chives. I’ve got tarragon. I have got peaches in juice. Oh my God, what is this?What is this?I think it’s slime. Oh my gosh, it’s my son’s slime. I thought it was some sort of compote – it is dark red and has chunks in it. There is slime in my fridge.Dr Karl Kruszelnicki: ‘I took my hands off the artery – blood squirted up and hit the ceiling’Read moreAs a teenager, you worked at the Hungry Jack’s in Rundle Mall in Adelaide.Have you ever filmed anything more scary than working at the Hungry Jack’s in Rundle Mall?[laughs]I used to sub at Hungry Jack’s in Rundle Mall. I mainly was at Hawthorn. There were some pretty dodgy characters hanging around Rundle Mall back then … I have filmed many, many scary things over my career, but nothing quite compares to the experience of working at Hungry Jack’s as a 15-year-old. I’d still go to Rundle Mall to hang out with my little homies in the city. That was the highlight of my weekend. “Let’s go to Rundle Mall! Maybe head to Dazzleland?”What is the strangest skill you’ve learned for a role?Bizarrely, I learned to row forA Discovery of Witches. I learned how to flip my boat and come up the other way, which was really horrifyingas someone who is deathly afraid of being underwater. But I became really efficient at it and I broke through my fear.I had another weird experience when I filmed Point Break in Tahiti – again, underwater. I was strapped to the bottom of the ocean with four sandbags and they take your oxygen out so you can clear your air bubbles. And then you have to act! I had to act in love with someone under the water. When my air would cut out, I would signal with these wide, crazy, panicky eyes. You just have to trust that someone will swim over and give you your regulator back.I recently turned down a job because they were like “It’ll be three months in the water swimming with whales!” I was like “Pass! Keep me on dry land.”Which movie scarred you for life as a kid?Candyman. It was at my brother’s 13th sleepover. I had a big crush on one of his friends, Jesse, so I snuck in to sit with all the boys and sleeping bags and pretend I was a super-cool 11-year-old. I saw the bit with the bees killing people, and I did not sleep without my touch lamp on for about four years. It was terrifying. And I never got to hook up with Jesse.Who’s the most famous person in your phone?I’ll check. You’ll have to pick. Paris Hilton. Russell Crowe. Emma Stone. Eva Mendes. Sia?What’s the best lesson you’ve learned from someoneyou’ve worked with?It’s OK to get Uber Eats if you don’t like the food at work. I am vegan and it’s annoying for people to have to cater to me. This is the people pleaser inside of me. So I always order a vegan garlic bread and a bubble tea. I have that, no joke, every lunchtime when I film. It has got to the point where people will come and give me a heads up on when I should put the order in. When a recent job wrapped, I ordered like 200 garlic breads for everyone on the cast and crew. They were like, “What have we been snoozing on? This is amazing.” I am the picture of wellness – garlic bread and bubble tea.What are you secretly really good at?I’m an encyclopedia for true crime. I know every true crime case. People come to me for recommendations for podcasts, documentaries, TV shows. I can sit and have an in-depth conversation about various cases and theories with anyone. We can get deep real quick – you can just say the first name of someone in a case and I’ll know immediately who we’re talking about. That’s how I find my people.What book, album or film do you always return to, and why?Labyrinth. When I used to go to my dad’s place as a kid, he didn’t quite know how to entertain a little girl so he bought me three VHS tapes and every Sunday I would watch one of the three. The movies were Grease, Labyrinth and A Little Princess.It was funny to watch Labyrinth again with my children. They’re so used to watching Pixar and things with amazing special effects, but the magic was still there. We play the album in the car all day. It still holds firm as my favourite movie.What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity?This happened about a year ago. I was doing an acting workshop in Byron Bay. We’re in the middle of it and this guy pops his head in with his dog, and says “Oh, what is this?” I told him and he said “Cool, I’ve always thought about looking into this.” So I asked what he did and he said he makes music. I was thinking “That’s cute. Are you in a band? Do you perform in the pub?” And someone says “Holy shit! That’s Pete Murray.”I went to all his concerts. I used to follow him around Australia, watching all these gigs. And I completely didn’t recognise him – I thought he was a cute dad who was in a band at the local pub. It was really mortifying. But we had a laugh. I said “I am so embarrassed – I’m a huge fan of yours.” He invited me and my friends to his gig two months later, so he’s not upset I didn’t recognise him. He was just so out of context. He is a Byron Bay dad, who knew!Teresa Palmer stars in The Family Next Door, which premieres Sunday 10 August at 8pm on ABC TV, with all episodes available to stream on ABC iView.Explore more on these topicsTelevision10 Chaotic QuestionsAustralian televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This means I’ve never walked into a cafe, fresh-faced and sober at 9am, with the intention of raving.But this is 2025, not the late 1990s, and people are possiblymore questioning of the cost of partyingon their bodies than they once were. So, coffee raves have become a thing.They’re all over the world and come in many shapes and sizes, tending towards the bijou. Inevitably, they’re big in Los Angeles and on social media, and are often the territory of young people, athleisurewear and brand collaborations.The rise of booze-free backpacking: why gen Z are choosing to travel soberRead moreThey’re so popular, they’ve also become fair game. In a TikTok rant last week, musician Keli Holiday said what I might have been thinking: “Call me old, call me jaded, but enough is enough, no more coffee raves … If you want to get your rave on … go to a rave or go to a club.”But on a rainy Saturday morning in central Sydney, I try one out – dubbed Maple Social Club – approaching with caution. I’m not a leisurewear wearer or an Instagrammer or indeed a coffee drinker.My young adult life was, rightly or wrongly, given to maximum nights out and minimum responsibility – and my weekends now are generally about children and sleep. If there’s a cafe involved, it’s usually peaceful.View image in fullscreenMaple Social Club is less than a year old. The morning rave suits a city such as Sydney, where residents are among the world’s earliest to bed and earliest risers.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/The GuardianOrganiser Taylor Gwyther, 25, tells me morning raves are an add-on to the night-time variety, not instead of. “But, there’s definitely a trend away from alcohol that I think encourages events like this to be popular,” she says as the first arrivals begin to enter the warehouse space behind Wilson cafe in Surry Hills.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningMaple Social Club, which Gwyther founded with Connor Cameron, 23, is less than a year old and was inspired by run clubs and LA’s AM radio morning DJ sets. Their free events provide an alibi, Gwyther says, in the same way a run club is a little bit about running and a lot about meeting people.“Covid shut down a lot of social life and created lonely adjacent habits, and people are looking to revitalise how they spend their time,” she says. “We spend so much time online for work and now play, I think people are looking for places and spaces to spend offline. We’re trying to make it easier to find those things.”Morning raves also make sense on another, more local, level. Sydney residents are among the world’s earliest to bed and earliest risers. In a city whose nightlife sits well below its beaches, wealth and wellness reputations, mornings are sacrosanct.The music’s not quite loud enough, or bassy enough, to lose myself – but, by about 10.30am, I think I might be dancing.Daisy DumasPlus, it’s expensive to party the normal way in a city with a famously stratospheric cost of living. A beer is about $12 in the pubs nearby. Here, a coffee is about $5 – and there’s no need to buy a drink at all. Because, as Bronte, a 30-year-old nurse tells me later on the dancefloor, “Who’s got money these days, really?”Michael Pung, 39, a property valuer from Sydney, saw the event advertised on Instagram.“I thought I’d check it out. I’ve been single for a while and I thought I might as well just come out and meet people,” he says, queueing in the long and slow-moving coffee line – which, handily for him, doubles as another opportunity to meet people.Like me, he’s not normally a coffee drinker but, given he was out late last night Latin dancing, he says “probably today’s the day”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s already busy and I feel too exposed, too daylit, too close to too many raised phones. But, everyone – and I really mean everyone – is smiling.View image in fullscreenDaisy Dumas (left) talks to Maple Social Club co-founder Taylor Gwyther.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/The GuardianBy 10am, the dancefloor is heaving with what feels like a roughly 50/50 mix of men and women. There are some older people, but generally the crowd is aged 20 to 35 – and as Gwyther predicted, “super diverse”. Some have made a morning of it and are wearing what I would consider proper going-out attire with high heels; others are grungy, and most are in baggy jeans.Bronte, who lives locally, is here with friends. She says her evening and night shifts as a nurse mean she is often socially “removed from the night”. She’s sweaty and happy and hard to hear above the music. “I’ve done all my walking for the day,” she says, referring to another thing that didn’t used to be a thing:step count.Like Pung, she also goes out at night-time, but having the option to dance her working week away come Saturday morning is, as she puts it, “very nice”.My petty gripe: I don’t begrudge your coffee addiction – but do you have to be such a bore about it?Read moreThe music’s not quite loud enough, or bassy enough, to lose myself – but, by about 10.30am, I think I might be dancing. People near me are drinking iced matcha lattes, which I’ll never condone, but as the DJ drops a relative banger, I admit to my colleague, who is photographing this road test, that I’m having quite an uplifting start to my weekend. The day is still young and there’s an afterparty at a pub nearby and yet another planned for the afternoon.Before I leave (it’s approaching 11am after all) I turn to talk to a man who is watching on from close to the DJ area. Liam, 25, is almost-but-not-quite dancing, and it turns out he works for Red Bull events. He’s here professionally: might Maple’s coffee raves be worth bringing into the energy drink’s gargantuan sponsorship embrace?“We see just as much relevance for Red Bull in an occasion like this [as] a music festival or the F1,” he says with no small amount of enthusiasm.Stepping around some spilt milk, it strikes me there is no alcohol-edged aggro, argy bargy at the bar or intimidating bouncers. Just music and broad daylight – plus caffeine, in hot, cold and increasingly corporatised modes.View image in fullscreenThis is 2025, not the late-1990s.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsCoffeeAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s lunchtime in the foreign secretary’s office, a vast room of gilt edges, damask drapery and waxed oak. “Because Israel bombed Iran, and your trip was cancelled,” I say. “Oh, yes.” He scrapes the bottom of the pot, perhaps remembering the snap Cobra session on 13 June, the world holding its breath, the shared feeling we were on the brink of global war. It’s three weeks on and the heat of imminent conflict has lessened, if not the actual temperature, shining in the faces of staff. Lammyapologises for squeezing me into his lunch break. His schedule, running down a whiteboard in the ante office, is precision-timed. After our chat, he will be whisked off to Cyprus to see British troops, then to Beirut overnight, then a car ride through the mountains into Syria, where he’ll meet the new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly the head of the Islamist group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Lammy will be the first British minister to set foot in the country in 14 years.He lifts his chin to prevent yellow soup dropping on his “sombre” green tie. You can sense his mood, he’ll tell me later, by his tie choice. Ordinarily he brings miso from home in a flask, but sometimes he’s left too early, or sped from an overnight flight, and then it’s the laksa, 296 calories. He’s on a diet, an intermittent fasting, “little bit no carby” regime. Plus he hasn’t drunk alcohol since taking the job: “I can’t drink and fly. It interrupts my sleep.” His last was a teeny half-pint watching England v Switzerland in the Euros on his first official trip last year. He’s taken 90 flights and visited 62 countries since, mostly on the UK government Airbus that gives him a stiff back – he is 53. Sleeping pills are an essential part of the job, he says. “There’s always a trip to the CVS pharmacy in Washington DC to buy thebestmelatonin gummies.”This interview was originally set up to mark Lammy’s first year as foreign secretary. It’s also 26 years since the young lawyer, brought up by a Guyanese single mother, was elected asLabourMP for Tottenham, London. What it becomes is a snapshot of a foreign secretary in international crisis.Not that Lammy seems to break a sweat. I tail him for five weeks on foot, in cars, on trains. Even when the heatwave melts train tracks, he doesn’t loosen the Tyrwhitt tie or shed his TM Lewin jacket.Mostly he’s cheery, slipping between bursts of uproarious laughter, which involves table banging, and thunderous rhetoric, which involves table banging. In a foreign affairs select committee hearing, his foot beats the seconds as he’s grilled on Israel, Iran and Ukraine. During a French state visit, he shows his counterpart an original Enigma machine and spells out how it works. In a constituency community centre, he lets West Indian aunties pinch his cheeks and cry into his lapel. Only once do I see him nettled, prodding a cross finger in my direction because I inadvertently hit a nerve.We finish in the week he signs a joint statement with 28 other foreign ministers demanding an immediate stop to the bombing of Gaza. On Radio 4’s Today, he energetically rebutts the suggestion that he hasn’t blocked all arms exports to Israel. On LBC, Nick Ferrari reminds him it’s the sixth time he’s called for a ceasefire: “Why would they be listening now?” Lammy sounds downcast: “I regret hugely that I’ve not been able to bring the horrendous war to an end.”JD Vance completely relates to me. We are not just working-class politicians, but people with dysfunctional childhoodsBut Gaza is the wound that will not heal. I wonder if it will be Lammy’s diplomatic apotheosis or his undoing. It’s the issue that impels protesters to put fake baby body bags in his front garden, that brings them to a sleepy village church with loudhailers to amplify the death toll, now surpassing 59,000, according to the Gaza health ministry. It’s the issue that focuses outrage directly on to him, that right now he’s under most pressure to solve. The last time we speak, against dire warnings of impending famine, he has hardened his line. He calls shooting civilians waiting for aid “grotesque”, “sick”; demands “accountability” from the Israeli side. He says things are “desperate for people on the ground, desperate for the hostages in Gaza”, that the world is “desperate for a ceasefire, for the suffering to come to an end”. He tells me he wants to go to Gaza “as soon as I can get in”. In person, on the ground? “Absolutely. One hundred per cent.”So what is Lammy’s mission as foreign secretary? He has described it as “progressive realism” – using pragmatic methods to achieve progressive outcomes as Britain’s stature dwindles. So far this has meant reassembling our relationship with the EU, reimagining how we use our influence on the world stageand – crucially – managingthe relationship with Donald Trump. As a cocksure backbencher, Lammy had described the American president as “deluded, dishonest, xenophobic, narcissistic”, a “neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath” and a “tyrant in a toupee”. One can only imagine whether his collar felt tight as the lift doors clamped shut and he rose to the penthouse of Trump Tower in autumn last year. It was the run-up to the US election; Trump had invited both Britain’s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, and his foreign secretary to dinner at home.View image in fullscreenWith UK prime minister Keir Starmer, US president Donald Trump and vice-president JD Vance in the Oval Office at the White House in February this year.Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesLammy says Trump was a “very gracious host”, giving them a guided tour of his Louis XIV-inspired triplex and art collection. Floor-to-ceiling windows insulated them from the blaring midtown horns 58 storeys below. Lammy was awe-struck by the gold, he says, how ornate it was, “how expensive”. And later, Trump extinguished the lights and they stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the dark, admiring the glittering Manhattan skyline. “It was pretty incredible.”Overall, his impression was that Trump wanted them to feel at ease, wanted them to like the roast chicken he served; joshing when Lammy had a second helping. It was not long after Trump had been shot in Pennsylvania. He was really shaken, Lammy thought, obsessed by it, “as you would imagine”, but at the same time going out of his way to make sure his guests were OK. “The thing running through my mind was post-traumatic stress disorder,” Lammy says. “The years it takes to recover from shocking events like that. How would I be feeling weeks later, if someone had tried to shoot me?” He thought of constituents who had experienced knife crime and gun violence, and felt, “that whilst [Trump] was shaken, he didn’t want to dwell on it. He could have said, ‘I’m going to do the very minimum now because I’m not feeling great.’”Lammy clocked Trump’s two chefs staring at him. “I couldn’t work out why I was of such import in the context of Donald Trump and Keir Starmer.” Finally, they approached. “‘Please, please, can we have a photograph? We know your family is from Guyana, we want to send it home.’” Did Trump see that, I ask? “Yeah,” Lammy says. “They were also pleased that I had eaten more than everybody else.”I ask him to conjure what I would have observed had his trip to Washington DC gone ahead in June. He moves forward in his chair. “The whole world was on the edge of its seat,” he says, “so you would’ve seen foreign policy at its most heightened.” All agreed Iran should not have nuclear weapons: the question was how to stop that. Lammy says that his bridge-building role would have been to enter detailed discussions with secretary of state Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, before shuttling to Geneva to inform the other E3 members, France and Germany. “I remember as a young student doing history, reading about the Cuban missile crisis in 1962,” he says. “There are these moments when the world is on edge, worried. This year, that was one of those moments. You’d have had a sense of that.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve got a pretty cool head. I’ve experienced a lot of things in my 53 years on the planet’: at the Foreign Office in London last month.Photograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianLammy says the threat from Iran is real. “Its leaders cannot explain to me – and I’ve had many conversations with them – why they need 60% enriched uranium. If I went to Sellafield or Urenco in Cheshire, they haven’t got anything more than 6%. The Iranians claim it’s for academic use, but I don’t accept that. It was Gordon Brown who accused Iran of deceit when they established Fordow [the underground enrichment site] and revealed that to the world back in 2009.”As a rule, Lammy prefers diplomacy to military intervention, but is “clear eyed” about “parts of the Iranian system that have a certain objective”. And it’s not just nuclear war between Iran and Israel that troubles him. “Many of your readers will have watched Oppenheimer and seen the fallout of [the US building an atomic bomb]. So it’s what [a nuclear Iran] might mean in terms of other countries in the neighbourhood who would desire one, too. And we would be very suddenly handing over to our children and grandchildren a world that had many more nuclear weapons in it than it has today.”Each night, Lammy knows his sleep may be disrupted (his wife doesn’t mind; “She seems to be able to survive on far less sleep than I”) and he’d already gone to bed on 21 June when his mobile started buzzing. It was Marco Rubio telling him the US was about to strike Iran. How much warning did they give? He demurs, saying the PM had been told, and military channels, simultaneously. Was it minutes? “I was also asleep when President Trump was shot,” he continues, ignoring the question. “In those initial moments the extent of his injuries wasn’t clear. I remember waking up, thinking, oh my God!”He insists the US decision to bomb was not in order to topple Iran’s government, though he has “been exposed to” Israeli arguments in favour of regime change. “Let’s face it, there are lots of people in Iran who would like regime change. But there are no guarantees that what would replace the current Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps would not be as bad or worse.” He pats the table. “So, that is for the Iranian people to determine. I’m focused on what the UK can do to stop Iran becoming a nuclear power.”For much of his political career, Lammy emphasised his friendship with Barack Obama. They met in 2005 at a gathering of Harvard Law School’s black alumni. In interviews he’s produced evidence of their familiarity, including a written note from the Democrat former president urging him to “keep up the good fight”. Today, Lammy is keen to stress his ties with Republicans. He has “a really good relationship” with Rubio, for instance, and they speak every week. “We joke about the fact that my heritage is Guyanese, his is Cuban; faith matters to him, faith matters to me. He’s journeyed a long way to where he is today, as have I. He’s incredibly professional, very bright, consumes a brief.”Lammy also calls vice-president JD Vance “a friend”. I ask why they get on. “I remember being at the inauguration of the new pope in Rome, with Angela Rayner and JD Vance,” he says. He seems tickled by the memory: “I don’t think JD and Angela will mind me saying that they were having a couple of drinks.” The setting was the gardens in Villa Taverna, the US ambassador’s residence, and “it was one of those lovely warm days in Italy”. Vance dropped ice cubes into wine glasses and filled them with rosé. “I really wanted a glass”– Lammy says he has a weakness for rosé – “but instead I had a Diet Coke.” I ask if Rayner was boisterous. “I wouldn’t say she’s rowdy when she has a drink because Angela Rayner has a big character. I mean, she is the Barbara Castle of our era. That’s not confined to a drink, it is her personality. She has so much character, so much spine, she makes me a bit shy. My personality is not as big as hers and we are there with the vice-president. So, I was probably the shyest of the three.”It occurred to him that they were “not just working-class politicians, but people with dysfunctional childhoods. I had this great sense that JD completely relates to me and he completely relates to Angela. So it was a wonderful hour and a half.” Like Rubio, Vance is a Catholic. Did they talk about faith? “I’ve had mass with him, in his home,” Lammy says, then glances at his spad and cries, “I can see the adviser twitching. ‘He’s mentioned religion!’ It’s an Alastair Campbell moment!” (He’s referring to Tony Blair’s spin doctor saying, “We don’t do God.”) The adviser assures him it’s fine.My sober assessment is that Putin is not ready to seriously negotiate. He still has maximalist and imperialist ambitionsAgainst expectations, Trump has made unprompted references to how much he “really likes” Starmer, “even though he’s a liberal”. The UK was the first to secure a tariff deal from Trump, and is still an exception. It’s one of the few conspicuous achievements of this Labour government. But Lammy agonises over the hiccups. Not least,Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s televised Oval Office appearance, when the Ukrainian president was ridiculed by Trump and Vance in the manner of two cats batting a mouse. “If I’m being honest, I felt,arrghhh!” Lammy says. “Why hadn’t I done more to support our Ukrainian colleagues in preparation for their meeting?” He quickly supplies the answer: the Ukrainians were invited last-minute, the British were focused on their own Trump meeting, there wasn’t time, so “I was being a bit hard on myself. But I still felt guilty.”Starmer rang Zelenskyy and invited him to No 10 the next day. “That embrace with Keir – I still feel quite emotional when I think about it – was a moment where the whole world breathed a sigh of relief.” Indeed, for Lammy this moment – Starmer and Zelenskyy locked in a bear hug on the pavement in Downing Street – was the “epitome of Britain being back in the place the global community wants us: bridge building, a glue, with a history that helps connects us to much of the world”.He describes travelling to Ukraine, the night trains from Poland to Lviv and on to Kyiv, arriving early morning to demolished apartment blocks, sandbags and bunkers, all reminiscent of war-torn Europe. “You asked me what it means to work in the Foreign Office building and the room I have. In a way, Ukraine powerfully connects me to Attlee, to Churchill, to that story, because we’ve got war on the continent. It’s an old seam and it’s a very fundamental part of the job.” He says he’s building on the work of previous foreign secretaries; of David Cameron, James Cleverly, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss. “You are at the centre of European security – probably the most fundamental part of my job. Here, Britain is absolutely in a leadership role.”Where will the war be in a year’s time? “My sober assessment is that Putin is not ready to seriously negotiate. He still has maximalist and imperialist ambitions. The battle Ukraine has fought, with UK, European and American support, is immense. I suspect that in a year’s time, talks will be going on. The question is how serious Russia is about those talks.”He admires the people of Ukraine, “their tenacity, their sort of steadfastness. The fact that even if the world left them behind, they’d still be waging a guerrilla war, such is their belief in their country. It’s deeply inspiring.”Lammy’s efforts to fit everything into his insanely packed schedule has come with a cost. In the Easter holidays, he and his wife, the artist Nicola Green, interrupted a family ski trip in France to travel to Italy to join King Charles on a state visit.After three days, “minding our ps and qs and being on best behaviour”, they waved the king off at the airport and “collapsed into” a pre-paid taxi to go back to the Alps. After a work trip like that, Lammy says, “you’re knackered”.The subsequent ride was first reported from the point of view of the French driver, who said that he realised Lammy was a VIP and argued he should be paid an extra £600. Lammy refused. An altercation ensued and, fearing the British foreign secretary had a gun, he drove off with their suitcases still in the boot. Newspapers devoured this version, but the driver has since been arrested for theft. A court date is set for the autumn.View image in fullscreenWith his wife, artist Nicola Green, in Rome in April this year.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyLammy’s version: towards the end of the six-hour journey, he and Green became suspicious that “the driver was taking longer than necessary”. They asked why and “it culminated in him demanding more money and pulling a knife”. Lammy did not see the knife – he was in the back seat because Green speaks better French – but “my wife saw it. He opened the glove compartment and showed it to her. She was terrified”. Although “it was scary”, Lammy did not panic. “I’ve got a pretty cool head. I’ve experienced quite a lot of things in my 53 years on the planet. I am not easily fazed.” When he and Green got out, the driver accelerated off. “We went to the police and they got our stuff back.” It was a bitter experience, “just awful, is the truth”. I ask if he was carrying a gun, and Lammy roars with laughter. “No. I don’t think I’ve ever held a handgun. Or shot one on a firing range.”Before I leave, an official photographer gets me to pose with Lammy, either side of a glass case holding an Enigma machine. Lammy, cropped hair speckled grey, straightens to his full 6ft, grin switching on like a lighthouse beam. As I slip out, he’s tucking into a pot of yoghurt, officials closing in to brief him.Five days later, we’re in Room 8 at the House of Commons as Lammy faces the foreign affairs select committee. The room is humid, the mood intense.Emily Thornberryasks in a voice of sweet menace what the British reaction is to a report that the Israeli government plans to move 600,000 Gazans into a humanitarian transit camp on the ruins of Rafah. Lammy says they are focused on a ceasefire, and briefs on the sticking points. Thornberry says the government has repeatedly said it would recognise Palestine: “I know today the two-state solution feels like a million miles away, but increasing numbers of people are concerned that if we continue to hold back on the recognition of Palestine, there won’t be anything left to recognise.”Lammy says he is working on a timetable with allies, including France, and agrees that there has been “more expansion in the West Bank in the last year than in the 15 preceding it. More violence … that the viability of two states is being put in question by those who are determined to pursue this.”Abtisam Mohamed MP asks for an assurance that the UK would oppose any deal that allowed any part of the West Bank to become part of new Israeli territory. Lammy says the settler violence flouts international law and Oslo. Thornberry flips open a black fan like a flamenco dancer, wagging it with impatience at her face.View image in fullscreen‘This is the first time in my life where I do not have impostor syndrome.’Photograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianAfterwards, I am bustled into Room 5 for a catchup. Lammy seems distracted. He was strong on the criminality of settlers in the West Bank but why, given the accepted definition of terrorism – the use or threat of use of violence for political ends – does he not consider these acts terrorism? He sighs. A clock ticks like the tap of a teaspoon on china. “They’re criminal acts. They’re illegal acts. They’re acts that we condemn and they’re acts that we’ve sought to sanction. They’re reprehensible and they’re designed to thwart those of us who believe that ‘two states’ is the only viable alternative. There is a set of voices in Israel that are determined to see a greater Israel [and] no [Palestinian] state at all. I stand against those voices.”I press: why are they not seen as terrorist acts by the UK government? “I don’t think they’re described as terrorist acts traditionally. I’ve sat with families who are subjected to violence and threats. Those families experience them as criminal acts. We support those families both financially and to advocate for their rights. We support the Palestinian Authority speaking up for many of those families.” Two weeks later, he finally shifts this position, describing “settler terrorism” in comments to the House.While he was in Damascus, I say, the Home Office declared the UK group Palestine Action a terrorist organisation. Are their protests “terrorist acts traditionally”? And while Lammy shook hands with President al-Sharaa, a former member of al-Qaida, and pledged UK support in the rebuilding of Syria, Sue Parfitt, an 83-year old vicar, was carted off by the police under counter-terrorism laws. Does that feel like a contradiction? “That’s a decision for the home secretary,” he says, adding of Yvette Cooper, “She sees warrants on a daily basis that are deeply challenging and worrying. Hers come from MI5. I see warrants based on threats overseas from MI6. She has to make assessments about terrorism. She’s made that assessment. She has my full support.”What was Sharaa like? “Measured. Presented well. Calm. Suit. Articulate.” Suit? “He was suited.” As opposed to wearing combat fatigues? “Yes. I was aware – and I pushed him on it, of course – that he once was a terrorist.” What did he say? “He said that was in time of war. He has learned. His focus is on bringing his country together, getting past the economic hardship – 90% of Syria is living in poverty. I said, ‘When I go back to my country, people will ask me, is he still a terrorist?’ He wanted to convince me that was the past. He recognises that he has to operate as leader in an inclusive way, face the future, rebuild the nation. We’re working with him on counter-terrorism – against Daesh [Isis] and others in the country that are deeply worrying. This is a very fragile time, but all of us want Syria to succeed. So we’ve got to work with him.”The young David Lammy was well-known for his political activism. Before his postgrad at Harvard Law School, he read Law at the School of Oriental and African Studies and practised as a barrister in London and the US. When he won his seat aged 27, he was the youngest MP in the house. He was spotted early by Blair and Brown, and moved through a series of jobs. Later, in opposition, he was seen as being on the left of the party and combined his work in Westminster with trigger-happy tweets and his own popular radio show on LBC.He says that although he is wearing “a diplomatic hat” today, “underneath it all is an activist and a social campaigner for sure”. I ask then, in the light of so many people protesting to little effect, what actually works? “Well, perhaps it’s best to look back on my career. I advocated for those [discriminated against] in the Windrush scandal, which led to an inquiry and a compensation scheme. I was also the first politician the morning after Grenfell to call for an inquiry.” His friend Khadija Saye, a 24-year-old artist and assistant at his wife’s art studio, lived on the 20th floor and died in the fire.View image in fullscreenArriving for his first day at the House of Commons, aged 27.Photograph: Martin Argles/The GuardianHe’s conscious that while some conflicts are highly visible, others are not. It grates that there isn’t more interest in the war in Sudan, which affects him personally. Privately, he’ll say it’s because those dying are African and black. Today, he says, Sudan is “the worst in terms of life lost and civilian catastrophe. Millions of women and children are suffering, raped, burned, killed. It’s not commanding global attention. It’s not on the news regularly. I have probably been the most prominent foreign secretary in the G7 and in Europe on the issue of Sudan.” He convened the London conference, put down a UN motion “which the Russians vetoed” and promises to “keep returning to the issue. Today I’m not acting as an activist. I’m the country’s chief diplomat. And diplomacy is often failing until it wins, is the truth.

It was a long time ago, probably when my mother died. But have there been moments in this last year where I’ve felt deep sadness? Yes.”Lammy’s constituency – one of the most diverse in the world, he says – includes a significant number of Charedim in Stamford Hill. The ultraorthodox Jewish community, who are particularly visible because of their distinctive traditional dress, have borne the brunt of rising antisemitism including violence, damage to property and, Lammy says, “horrible scenes of abuse in the streets”. When he visited a Jewish girls’ school soon after theHamas atrocities of 7 October, there was a palpable sense of shock, Lammy says. “I could feel the fear. It was very strong. There was a vulnerability among those women. And among their elders were Holocaust survivors.” He says the community tell him “they are focused on the hostages, on Hamas and terrorism”.Lammy was closely involved with the family ofEmily Damari, the British hostage who was released, aged 28, in January 2025 after being held in Gaza by Hamas for 471 days. While not a constituent, she was a Tottenham Hotspur fan, so “her mother and I met many times. She gave me a plastic flower to keep in a vase in my office and said, ‘You can take it out when my daughter is free.’” It is still on his desk: Lammy talks about the need to get the remaining hostages released as part of a ceasefire.View image in fullscreen‘I regret hugely that I’ve not been able to bring the horrendous war to an end.’Photograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianHe also works with constituents with ties to Gaza and the West Bank. “Palestinian groups and NGO workers I have met are also bereft and feel a desperate gnawing pain. It goes back to a visceral and almost ancient discourse around land and two communities who have experienced injustice for so many years.”How does he cope with the protests outside his home? “Something has changed in politics, particularly in this social media age. When I started, people wrote to you in green ink. Now the immediacy, the personalisation, the way your family, your children are involved ... I’m not going to pretend that in terms of my wife and my children I don’t feel protective.” He says the “dehumanising elements of politics are very troubling, very wounding, painful”.We are outside the British Library in St Pancras, waiting to greet the French foreign secretary. Lammy is exuberant. “My wife said as I left, ‘That’s a nice tie, darling.’” It’s bright blue, flapping in the breeze. Cars disgorge French officials, including the lean foreign secretary Jean-Noël Barrot, who has a graze of stubble and is pulling on a chic black vape. There’s handshaking, smiles, pictures, then a brisk walk up the side of the building, past rat traps and the smell of skunk, and into the lift for lunch at the Alan Turing Institute. Lammy peers at their Enigma machine, an upgrade from the one in his office, he says. On a table, someone has laid out La Durée macarons next to Fortnum & Mason fudge.A lot of public diplomacy requires standing next to symbolic objects and being photographed with folders containing signed “understandings”. Most of the work is done on WhatsApp. I overhear one of the French team whispering about how strong Emmanuel Macron’s cologne is, how it leaves a trail in his wake. Lammy and Barrot exchange details of their summer holidays, then Lammy leaves – bolting to see his daughter’s school play. He won’t be at the state banquet tonight because he’s on a flight to Malaysia. In opposition, he said he would travel at the pace of a US secretary of state.While he’s making good on that promise, British stalling over the recognition of a Palestinian state is frustrating the French. But, recognition, Lammy says “is, a card you can only play once”. The imperative, he says, is to end the violence. As we go to press, Macron commits to recognise Palestine at the UN in September.View image in fullscreenWith France’s foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot (left) and US secretary of state Marco Rubio, in Paris in April.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenWith French president Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer last year.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesThe next time we speak, he’s eating a pork pie. It’s the day after Diane Abbott’s second suspension from Labour, having said she did “not at all” regret the events that led to her suspension in 2023. Back then, she had written to the Observer saying Jews, Travellers and Irish people do not suffer racism in the way black people do. But that they experience prejudice that is “similar” to racism.Lammy says he had previously intervened to ensure she would be readmitted to the party, “because I was sad such an immense politician, the first of her kind in parliament, had found herself in this situation”. He had been doing all he could “behind the scenes” to bring her back in. “So I was very frustrated and upset that this had arisen again as a result of her out-of-nowhere backtracking on that statement.” He says whatever the outcome of the latest investigation, “I will continue to consider her a friend and have respect for her.”While we are on the subject of his colleagues, I ask how he felt about Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech on immigration, and the echoes of Enoch Powell in that phrase. “I think the use of language was poor,” he says. “Poor choice. And if someone had shown me the speech, I would’ve said, ‘Take that out.’”How does he reflect on a year of Labour in government? He lists their “big successes”, the “dozens of things” they have done to improve people’s lives” from planning reform to early years provision. But adds, “I slightly worry we have not conveyed that as well as we could.” I ask if I can add to that quote the wink he just gave me. He laughs.It’s boiling in the Grace Organisation community centre in Tottenham, a meeting place for older, predominantly West Indian constituents, some with disabilities or incipient dementia. Paulette Yusuf, who runs the place, is explaining the dilapidated state of the building and Lammy is nodding, deferring to an official on ways they might be able to help. In the main hall, an uplifting reggae gospel mix is playing. Scattered on tables are puzzles, colouring-in sets, books and games, including a box of Royal Bingo with William and Kate on the lid. At the back, there’s the snap of dominoes from a table of men, the occasional outburst. People look round when Lammy enters wearing his biggest smile yet. “My mum had her 60th here,” he says.“Hello, my good MP!” An elderly lady in large pearl earrings calls him over. She lives on his street. Another in a blue lace jacket is eating a pot of yoghurt. “We love you,” she says, but he’s being enveloped in a hug by a lady in a white hat. “You exist!” “I do exist,” he says. “Who’s that, Lammy?” another asks. “I’ve been hearing about you for years,” she tells him. “Good things?” Lammy wonders. She pinches his cheek. One woman knew his mum when she arrived in London: they worked together at the tube station in Camden. “That’s a long way back,” Lammy says, “You can’t have been more than 12.” She bats him away.Some attendees are in hi-vis, Sharpied with “If you see me walking alone, please call this number” followed by the Grace mobile. “I think I need one of those,” Lammy whispers. Next, he’s on the mic. He gives a shout out to all the countries in the Caribbean – “Do we have anyone from St Lucia? Jamaica? Barbados?” Each time there are cheers.View image in fullscreen‘I genuinely have a sense of being in the right place at the right time.’Photograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianSwaying to the music by the stage is a man in a pink cowboy hat. Lammy approaches. The man puts his fists up. For one heart-stop instant it looks as if the foreign secretary will be punched. Lammy doesn’t flinch. He puts his fists up and the two play at shadow boxing. His security detail un-tense.Afterwards I ask if it bothers him or his team that he is hugged and handled so much. “I’m quite touchy,” he says with a note of glee. His spad tells me I can’t use that in the wrong way. “No, Iamquite touchy,” Lammy insists. “I don’t care. I am a bit old-fashioned that way. I have a lot of respect for the elderly. That’s how I was brought up. My mother worked at the end of her life in sheltered housing as a housing officer. That human contact is important and I’m very comfortable with it.”Up the road at the Marcus Garvey Library, Lammy will take his constituency surgery, then record a podcast in the car on the way to King’s Cross. We’re taking the train to Peterborough – a journey of significance as a teenager. Not only was this the train that took him to his state boarding school aged 11, it was also on a platform here one spring Saturday in 1985 that he last saw his dad. David Lammy senior bent down to his son’s height, told him he loved him, to look after his mother, and kissed him goodbye. He had left the family home and later moved to America. Lammy says it was the single most “scarring” event in hislife. “My father didn’t come back. Psychologically that is devastating. There must have been a bit of me that blamed myself. I question whether he did in fact love me.”This he works through in therapy: he has “a wonderful” therapist and GP and has taken Prozac for anxiety. He finds the issue around his father hardest when he looks at his own children. “I could not imagine leaving them. I just couldn’t. I’m troubled that he was so troubled. I tend not to dwell on the past, but I do recognise the way the past informs who you are.”Lammy Sr was a taxidermist and alcoholic, hot-tempered and prone to rage. Previously Lammy has described his parents’ marriage as “tempestuous”. He clarifies that this included domestic violence. Did he witness it? “Yes.” Did he try to intervene?“No, no. I was the child holding my ears, crying in my bedroom … This feeling in the pit of your stomach, just this terror.” Was it a regular occurrence? “Regular enough.” Did the police come round? “Nooo, absolutely not. No one cared.”I’m quite a forgiving person, my nature is wanting to build bridges. It’s why I think I’m actually not bad in this roleHe adds that in those days in the communities where he grew up – Irish, Cypriot, “cockney” working-class, black West Indian – “a lot of men were going to the pub, coming home and beating their wives. It was the 70s. Violence was common. There were fights in the playground: kids mimicking what they’d seen at home – not that these things are unique to class, either.”His mother Rosalind would not have left her husband, he believes. Like many of her generation, she felt trapped. “My mother was still very much a country girl at heart. When Dad left, we thought we’d be taken into care. We didn’t know if my mum could survive. She wasn’t making much money in those days.” She struggled with the bills and bureaucracy, and “how you handle the state”. Lammy helped her “a lot”: “I was like one of the kids that comes to my surgery: advocating on her behalf.” When social services came knocking, the family were terrified. “We’d had a big, big fear of the state. Black families in the neighbourhood lived in fear of the police, a little bit of schools, too. There was a fear that things could happen you couldn’t control and that would not be fair. So, yeah, there were moments that we found scary. It’s what you perceive.”His father died in the US, “a pauper”, from throat cancer in 2003. Lammy says it was a horrible death. He received news that it was imminent, but chose not to go. “I was a young minister and I just decided I couldn’t emotionally handle seeing my father all these years later, dying desperately in this way. I did subsequently go to his grave. I gave him a headstone. And there was no sense of bitterness. Quite the opposite. I don’t bear grudges, it’s just not me.”I ask if all this makes loving his dad – the memory of his dad – more complicated. He thinks about this and says no. “I’m quite a forgiving person, my nature is wanting to build bridges, to reach out. It’s why I think I’m actually not bad at this role.”In fact, it’s more than “not bad”: “This is the first time in my life where I do not have impostor syndrome. I genuinely have a sense of being in the right place at the right time for this job.”David Lammy on the summer he lost a close friend to 7/7Read moreHe seems extroverted to me, but insists he’s shy and gauche. He credits Green with helping him “put on my armour on to walk out of the house and into public life every day”. They met 20 years ago at a singles party thrown by the former MP Oona King. “Nicola had no idea who I was,” he says. “I liked that she didn’t know that I was in public life, didn’t ask me what I did.” He fell for her quickly: “I think she found it all a bit intense.” A few months later, he took her on holiday to the Caribbean, “via Haiti, because I was on the board of Action Aid at the time and it had experienced a horrendous disaster. It was gruelling and not really what you do with a date. But she said she saw a window of my life. We were married within a year.” The couple have three children, two boys and an adopted daughter.There’s adoption in both families, Lammy says: his own mother and his wife’s grandmother. “There are kids that need a loving home. We talked about it and decided we would embark on this journey. It’s been one of the most rewarding things I’ve done, by some stretch. For my boys as well. I had a tough start, but not as tough as starting off with parents who can’t take care of you.”At home he says they talk about art. I am not sure I believe him. Green is “more political than he is” according to friends. But he likes theatre and film – “loved Sinners”– and his adviser confirms the only time they can’t reach him is when he’s in the cinema.Once every five weeks the family visits Chevening, the grace-and-favour country house, and he tears through the extensive overgrown woodland as a form of relaxation. “A good two- or three-hour walk is my idea of a great weekend afternoon.” Otherwise, he keeps fit with a former para called Alex twice a week.We’ve arrived in Peterborough and been driven to a country church where he will make a speech. A small crowd of protesters greet us with placards splodged with red paint. They are shouting about genocide, war crimes, children orphaned. Lammy’s composure looks shaken. I’m asking about his cherubic choirboy days at the local King’s School. His voice broke aged 13, he says, but he joins the parliamentary choir at Christmas “because I know all the old tunes. Singing is therapy. But if I can’t practise, I’m not going to sing.” You don’t have to be perfect, I tease. As the shouts grow louder, he looks suddenly cross. He points his finger accusatorially. “I can see what you’re doing, needling away at me.”Later, he admits he’s tired. Running on empty: “But still running.” He’s hoping to get away on holiday this month. “It will be quite enough to absolutely do nothing.” Maybe he will allow himself a glass of rosé. “I’ll have more than a glass – a bottle. Several!”Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyLabourForeign policyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

To the extent it could be tempting at times to conclude Shane Warne didn’t have 37 different nuggets of well-thumbed cricketing wisdom, he just said the same nugget of well-thumbed cricketing wisdom 37 times. But Warne was, of course, right, as he was about all cricket things, as you might expect from any self-respecting genius-level leg-spin, poker-playing, bikini-magnate-squiring wunderkind.England suffer late Zak Crawley blow in chase of 374 to win fifth Test and India seriesRead moreWhat attitude was expressed by England’s fielding on day three of this fine-margins final Test, as Indiabatted their way to a lead of 373? What kind of vibe, aura, energy is being projected by a unit that dropped a total of six catches in India’s second innings at the Oval, the most by any England team in almost 20 years?Judging by the current range of go-tos, the obvious choices range between super-cool, jocular moralising and inexplicably pissy. Maybe England were just jaded by repetition. In theabsence of Chris Woakes, Ollie Pope spent almost all of the first two sessions rotating his three tall, bang-it-in right-arm quicks, in what was surely one the most jarringly samey England bowling attacks of all time, death by right arm bang-it-in.For long periods this induced a kind of dog days late-summer ennui. It was at least a chance to experience in real-time the exact meaning of the English word “overton”, which describes a state of glazed and sated melancholy induced by watching excessive amounts of lumbering fast-medium bowled by a man in a visible black nylon under-vest. As in,by 2pm the entire Oval crowd was languishing in a state of deep Overton.It has felt at times in this Test as though Jamie Overton has been picked purely for his air of menace at on-field flashpoints, like a doorman or a bailiff’s assistant. But he found some rhythm before tea and seemed to swing the ball more than anyone else. Otherwise it was tempting to wonder if Pope might opt for plan B: Harry Brook bowling lobs, with added shame-chat from the infield. “You’re going to build an unassailable third innings lead against this?”View image in fullscreenHarry Brook lies on the ground after dropping Karun Nair.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIn the event the drip-drip of drops did provide a punctation to the afternoon as India progressed to 396 all out. The final list began the day before, and reads like this.4.5 oversYashasvi Jaiswal dropped by Brook off Gus Atkinson. Edged, second slip, travelling, burst the reverse cup. Drop rating: medium.12.2 oversJaiswal off Josh Tongue, dropped by Liam Dawson. Hard flat hook shot that travelled 40 yards straight on to Dawson’s clavicle. Drop rating: lost it in the lights. Mild. With notes of village.14.3 oversSai Sudharsan dropped by Zak Crawley off Overton. Third slip, wide, good height, parried. Drop rating: regulation bad.25.3 oversAkash Deep, Crawley again, off Tongue, diving to his left, hit him on the wrist. Drop rating: oh ffs.53.4 oversKarun Nair off Overton by Brook at second slip. Tough one, Crawley super-manning across, low out of the fingers. Drop rating: I might go home.57.4 oversJaiswal dropped off Overton by Ben Duckett at leg gully, fingertips, full stretch. Put there for the purpose: England’s tiniest man. Drop rating: hold me, I’m cold. So … so cold.The first of Saturday’s misses set the tone for what followed, spur for a thrilling nightwatchman’s half century. The combined run cost of all six was 127 runs. The last of them was England’s 20th of the series.In between Jaiswal was given space to compile an assured century. This was defined by his super-strength square cut, which ranges from the beautifully sculpted lift, arching his body into an S and deflecting over slips and sometimes the rope; and the more violent sabre-slashing fours and twos. Deep kept him company, standing tall and clumping it like a tribute Crawley act. The last time he’d got past seven was December 2024 in Brisbane.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His dismissal, as in the first innings, seemed to be a function of simply being too good to score runs, dangerously in form, too perfect, upright, balletic for this world. Gill was lbw playing across a straight one and reviewed because it seemed impossible he hadn’t actually hit it.England stuck to the task gamely but were walloped on to the back foot by Washington Sundar’s stunning 39-ball 50, Sundar taking the drop out of the equation by lifting some short stuff with the new ball into the crowd. Why did this happen? There is always talk of the “bad seeing ground”. But this has not notably been the case here.You cannot do that, Ben Stokes!That was on a dark day at the Oval. Seemed OK.We also know thatnobody wants to drop a catch. Is this helpful? Nobody wants to nick behind either, or averge 29.9 as an opener.Cricketis basically made out of things nobody wants to do. Take those away and what you have left is: no cricket.View image in fullscreenEngland's Zak Crawley (right) and Ollie Pope almost get tangled as Crawley catches out India's Washington Sundar.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut England are less focused in the field without Stokes. That bristling ginger-bearded superego at cover does make a difference, real and intangible. There were other moments of sloppiness. Jamie Smith has had to perform a rhythmic gymnastics routine behind the stumps. Overton bowling outside off stump with five fielders on the leg side. Is the problem here a drop?Plus England look understandably tired. It is an overlooked aspect of the modern schedule that, while five Test series have always happened, players often do this now with zero cricket either side, a sudden brain-mangling burst plonked between periods of rest. The schedule is year-round. Levels of focus, intensity and load come and go. Players are rested, then hammered. Nobody really knows what the effects of this are on body, sinews and mental reserves.England took the final Indian wicket here in non-drop double fielder mode, Pope and Crawley circling together under Sundar’s skied hoick, reaching up and taking it, somehow, in their combined 20 fingers. There will be a result now with two days left and England needing 324 runs to win with nine wickets remaining. By the end of Saturday those extra 127 runs felt like a product of gravity, fatigue and wear-and-tear. Also, it has to be said, collateral to a great but deeply gruelling series.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The headlines that he was contemplating a 15-year break from the game didn’t entirely reflect what he said – “I don’t know how long I’ll stop for: a year, two years, three years, five, 10, 15, I don’t know. But I will leave after this spell with City because I need to stop and focus on myself, on my body” – but his weariness was clear.Manchester City’s record £1bn deal with Puma and the value beyond bottom lineRead moreTo an extent it is not a surprise. Jürgen Klopp was exhausted (and self-aware) enough after almost 15 seasons at Dortmund and Liverpool (plus seven at Mainz)to quit last summer. There were times last season, particularly in that four-month spell either side of Christmas whenCity’s form dipped alarmingly, that Guardiola seemed shattered. By his own admission, his decision last Novemberto sign a contract extensionto summer 2027 was motivated in part by guilt at the downturn. “The problems we had in the last month, I felt now was not the right time to leave,” he said. The problems got much worse.To which there can be two reactions. On the one hand, it is rare and admirable that a manager should feel such a sense of responsibility to his club. While many are sacked before they have a chance to resolve problems, there are also plenty happy enough to walk away with a pay-off and pass the crisis on to somebody else. But on the other hand, it probably is not a great sign if a manager with two years left on his contract is already looking forward to the extended holiday he is going to have when it is all over.But management is exhausting. It was striking in the interview that the element Guardiola picked out as most debilitating was having opposing fans chanting he was going to be sacked in the morning, the sort of mundane banter that it is easy to assume just washes off managers as experienced and successful as Guardiola. Beyond that, though, it is useful to be reminded just how tough a job management is and it may be getting even tougher.Over the course of his two autobiographies, it becomes clear how relentless Brian Clough found the grind of management: there was no time to enjoy a victory on Saturday, he said, before he was having to start thinking about the game on Wednesday. That was before the calendar was as packed as it is now and Clough was somebody quite happy to pop over to Mallorca for a holiday during the season, somebody who was noted even at the time for the infrequency of his appearances on the training pitch.View image in fullscreenA crushing 5-1 defeat at Arsenal last season summed up City’s struggles on the pitch.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianManagers today have far more help than they used to. They have specialist coaches and analysts, and their job, at least at the top level, is focused largely on preparing the team. With one or two exceptions, transfers and long-term strategy is the responsibility of a sporting director.But still, it is an often thankless role where successes are quickly forgotten and a few bad weeks can lead to the sack. Guardiola, for all he may have disliked the banter from opposing fans, at least had enough credit in the bank not to fear that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Given he has a naturally sarcastic tone, it is never entirely easy to tell, but that can probably be taken at face value. One of the problems for a manager who has been in a job for an extended time, particularly when they have been as successful as Guardiola, is finding new challenges. Building a team to win the league is invigorating, stimulating, exciting, setting it going again to win again less so.The comedian Stewart Lee wrote in his autobiography about how on long tours he would deliberately lose part of his audience because of the kick he got from winning it back; it is not to suggest Guardiola would have chosen to be in this position to say he may relish the challenge of restoring City to the title.There is another factor, which is that very few managers remain at the very highest level for much more than a decade. Sir Alex Ferguson is an obvious counter-example, 20 years separating his first title at Manchester United from his last, even after his successes with Aberdeen, but he is an outlier who skews expectations. Arrigo Sacchi’s peak lasted about four years. Even José Mourinho was probably already past his best when he won his last league title, at Chelsea in 2014-15, 12 years after his first, at Porto.Every game Guardiola has taken charge of since he was appointed at Barcelona in 2008 has been dissected. For 17 years – less his year off in New York – opponents have been looking for ways to stymy his attacking plans and defensive vulnerabilities. Match footage has been pored over, data crunched. Part of Guardiola’s genius has been to keep evolving, to remain ahead of his pursuers.That has always happened, but never to the same extent as today. Teams have never been worked out so quickly; what might have taken a season 50 years ago now happens in a couple of weeks. To stay ahead is to adapt constantly and that is exhausting. There comes a point when the energy almost visibly leaves a manager, as it did with Mourinho, as it did with Arsène Wenger, and, unable to stay in front of the pack any longer, they lapse into self-parody.Guardiola is not there yet. Managerial arcs rarely end in a cliff edge; it is not that they are suddenly finished. But no career can go on for ever upwards. After 17 years at the top, as he begins to feel the toll, it may be that the descent has begun. Which may still be enough to win City another league title, but nothing lasts for ever.Explore more on these topicsFootballInside footballPep GuardiolaManchester CitycommentShareReuse this content"

The sacrifice paid off when he blitzed his way to a winning time of 9.94sec at the Alexander Stadium, before paying tribute to his family on the other side of the world.Hunter Bell’s dilemma over audacious bid for double world athletics gloryRead more“Today is a very difficult day for me,” he said. “My auntie is getting buried right now. Her funeral is going on and I’m missing out. I was very close with her, so today was a bit of a mental strength game for me.“I had to keep suppressing inside and I couldn’t speak to my family because I would get emotional. Jeremiah [Azu] was trying to console me because I almost started crying. This win was for her.”As a world medallist, Hughes was already assured of a 100m spot in the British team for next month’s Tokyo world championships, but runner-up Azu now has work to do. The world and indoor 60m champion surged into an early lead before he was reined in heading towards the finish line.His time of 9.97sec will not count as a world championships qualifying standard due to the 2.2m/s tailwind, leaving him three weeks to chase the required 10sec time before the team is confirmed. Louie Hinchliffe, who already has the standard, clocked 10.01sec for bronze.There was drama before the women’s 100m when the favourite Daryll Neita, who finished fourth at the Olympics last year, was harshly disqualified for a false start after twitching in her blocks.Her absence – having clocked a dominant 11.00sec to win her semi-final at a canter – meant no one came close to challenging Amy Hunt, who triumphed in a personal best 11.02sec to secure her seat on the plane for Tokyo.With Dina Asher-Smith – who is contesting only the 200m this weekend – guaranteed her spot, that leaves Neita uncertain of the final place. Desiree Henry, who finished second in 11.32sec, will now attempt an unlikely bid to clock the qualifying standard of 11.07sec. Neita will hope she does not succeed.View image in fullscreenDaryll Neita (lane six) leaves the track after being disqualified in the women’s 100m final.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“It would have been nice to have Daryll in the race,” said Hunt. “That was a big loss. I wanted to come out here and beat her. I want to prove myself in a head to head, so to not get the chance to race her was disappointing for me because I think that would have pushed me to an even quicker time. I personally would have run under protest, but the nature of championship racing is you have to hold your nerve on the line.”Hunt, Neita and Asher-Smith will now battle over 200m on Sunday, with the trio separated by less than half a second on season’s bests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She insisted she will not be affected by the trauma of last year’s Olympics, where she failed to record a single valid attempt when expected to challenge for gold.“It happened. It was just a bad day,” she said. “I definitely don’t think it will happen again and I’ll do everything in my power to make sure it doesn’t happen again. I’ve overcome all the demons that came from it. It’s all in the past.“I would love to get a medal. After what happened last year, I was so focused on getting a medal, I just need to get through qualification first and then think about it.

Hamilton wasknocked out in 12th, while his Ferrari teammate, Charles Leclerc, went on to take pole position for Sunday’s race, the first the Scuderia has claimed this year.Hamilton did not have an issue with his car on his final run in Q2 in Budapest nor was he impeded, he was simply not quick enough to go through, more than two-tenths down on Leclerc and took himself to task for his shortcoming. “It’s me every time. I’m useless, absolutely useless,” he said. “The team have no problem. You’ve seen the car’s on pole. So we probably need to change driver.”Hungarian Grand Prix: Charles Leclerc grabs pole for Ferrari after Hamilton flops againRead moreHe had signalled his own frustration immediately after completing the below-par lap, admonishing himself as he told his team: “Every time, every time.” When he climbed from the car he walked to theFerrarimotorhome holding his gloves in front of his visor.His exasperation was doubtless compounded by what he called an “unacceptable” error in qualifying at the last round in Belgium, where he could manage only 16th on the grid. Moreover, the Hungaroring is a circuit where the 40-year-old has a record second to none, eight wins and nine poles. However, this is the fourth time Hamilton failed to make the top 10 in qualifying this season and has been beaten over the single lap by Leclerc in 10 of the 14 meetings and is 30 points behind him in the standings.Expectations for the seven-time champion had been hugewhen he joined Ferrarithis season after 12 years at Mercedes, but the transition has been difficult. Adapting to the new car and team is proving a challenge and although he took a win in the sprint race in China he has yet to make the podium this season, the longest period he has gone without making it into the top three.The championship leader, Oscar Piastri, and his title rival Lando Norris had been expected to fight for pole, but the McLaren men had to settle for second and third respectively. Leclerc saw off Piastri by 0.026 seconds, with Norris 0.015secs behind the Australian. George Russell finished fourth for Mercedes.Leclerc said: “I don’t understand anything inFormula One. Honestly, the whole qualifying was extremely difficult. It was difficult for us to get to Q2, it was difficult for us to get to Q3. In Q3, the conditions changed a little bit. Everything became a lot trickier and I knew I just had to do a clean lap to target third.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not only did we witness precisely that here on Saturday, but Hull sent an errant shot whizzing past the head of Minjee Lee for added theatrical effect.Hull had been battling to make the AIG Women’s Open cut for much of Friday afternoon. She started her third round 11 shots adrift of Miyu Yamashita. Within nine holes, Hull was five under par and on the charge. Birdies at the 12th and 13th meant she was four behind Yamashita. Hull did bogey the 14th, meaning a 66, but Yamashita’s failure to build on her 36-hole position suddenly makes this a highly intriguing scene.Charlie Woods, son of Tiger, fades late and misses out on Junior Ryder CupRead moreShe had one player within six strokes of her at halfway. A messy 74 means her lead is a single shot. Her short putting touch totally deserted her over the closing stretch. Hull is three behind.On the penultimate hole, Yamashita outrageously saved par from 40ft. This was a rare highlight. Thoughts of a procession have quickly vanished. Back-to-back nines of 37 saw to that. The prospect of wind and rain on day four means this could turn into an epic scrap.Hull was in wonderfully bullish mood. “I just enjoy chasing,” she said. “It’s quite fun. I like it. It’s more fun that way. I like hunting someone down.” Will she go for it on Sunday? What a silly question. “100%. I haven’t got anything to lose, have I?”It would, in one sense, be ridiculous if Hull ends her wait for a major on the Welsh coast. She has never been a huge fan of links golf and entered this tournament nursing a back problem. Hull had also revealed she lost four kilograms because of illness aftershe was removed from the course at the Evian Championshipon a medical cart.“Kind of like playing golf with your mates,” said Hull of her mindset for the final round. “You just want to make birdies on every hole. That’s how it feels tomorrow.” Unsurprisingly, she now feels as strong as ever.View image in fullscreenMiyu Yamashita struggled on the greens in the third round on the way to a 74.Photograph: Nigel French/PAHull came close to injuring another member of the field. A rare loose shot, at the 4th, went flying past Lee after a single bounce as she addressed her ball on the 17th tee. The ball rebounded from signage at the back of the tee, meaning Hull was spared a shot from deep rough. “I like Minjee, I wouldn’t want to take her out,” she said with a smile.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m pretty focused. I just reset and then just go hit the ball.”This is not just the Yamashita and Hull show. Yamashita’s wobbling brought a number of players back into the tournament. Kim A-lim is the closest to Yamashita’s nine under. Andrea Lee is a shot further back at minus seven. Megan Khang, Rio Takeda and Minami Katsu are alongside Hull at six under. Georgia Hall will fancy her chances from four under and Hall is a shot ahead of Lottie Woad.

There’s a process to be had now and that’s all I’ll be looking to for the next couple of days.“How they performed for the next 20 minutes, and the performance they put on … I just said after the game [to the team] I was incredibly proud and very sorry for the incident.”Mitchell said: “We’ll have to suffer the consequences, that’s the reality. We understand the process and I certainly won’t break our circle. We’ll just have to deal with it and get on with it.“It’s unfortunate for Marlie because you can see the intent wasn’t there. The game sets high standards in that area and ultimately at the end of the day we’re trying to protect players. We’ll just take whatever we get on the chin.”Asked if he will change the squad if Packer receives a long ban, Mitchell said: “I think we might get a couple of weeks. So that’s easy to deal with.”A mid-range suspension for the flanker’s offence might be as long as six weeks, although England may also expect that to be halved based on her previous good disciplinary record.Packer’s dismisal marred a positive performance. The Red Roses were fluent and efficient as they steamrollered their opponents in the first warmup match before the World Cup.They also displayed composure and good decision-making in their biggest ever win against these opponents, qualities that will be paramount for this vastly talented squad when the tournament begins.Peña got Spain on the scoreboard with a sniping second-half finish but aside from that it was a exercise in dogged defending for the visitors, and an afternoon for England to fine-tune attacking combinations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England will be tested more significantly next weekend, when they travel to face France, the final warmup before meeting the USA at the Stadium of Light on 22 August.At the conclusion of the pre-match warmup, England’s squad disappeared down the tunnel to a cacophony of support: it was not fans but a group of fellow players doing the cheering. Whatever obstacles may appear in the next two months, team spirit will not be a problem.England tried to move the ball wide early but straight down the middle soon proved more effective. Lucy Packer and Lilli Ives Campion both got hands on the ball before Maddie Feaunati applied a finish for the first try after five minutes, the floodgates officially opening. England’s fourth, scored by a flying Jess Breach on the wing after a sweeping move, was the pick of seven tries before the break.Spain did rumble a maul over England’s try-line, but were held up by some smart defensive work. Mitchell began to empty his bench after the break, freshening up the front row on 49 minutes, the impressive Hannah Botterman crossing the try-line on 66min.Marlie Packer’s red card came for an inexplicably reckless lunge on Pẽna, but eight well-worked second-half tries were some consolation, Megan Jones rounding off the scoring. The vice-captain is left to await her disciplinary fate.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Niewiadoma-Phinney is a further half-minute behind.Ferrand-Prévot said: “I’ve still got to finish the job, but one year after the Games in Paris, to win here, on this mythic climb, it’s incredible.”The sense the race had been unsettled before the summit finishes was emphasised by the stop-start racing on the approach to the beyond category summit finish on the Madeleine, where the fight for the yellow jersey finally began. The pivotal moment came 12km from the summit when Gigante pulled clear of the favourites, with Pauliena Rooijakkers and Ferrand-Prévot in pursuit.Gigante, teammate to the overnight race leader, Kim Le Court, has struggled to keep pace on the descents, but her rapid climbing has compensated for that shortcoming. This time, though, Ferrand-Prévot was quick to respond to her sharp acceleration and the pair soon joined forces.The French rider also benefited from her Visma-Lease a Bike team’s tactics. Marion Bunol went in the early break, waiting ahead to pace her teammate up the climb. That gave her the respite she needed, before she dropped her final companion, Niamh Fisher-Black, five kilometres from the finish.Le Court, Niewiadoma-Phinney and Vollering had little or no meaningful response so Ferrand-Prévot’s climbing speed. It was a tough day for Le Court. The descending speed that had saved her overall lead on the previous stage to Chambéry let her down 24 hours later, when she raced too fast into a tight left-hand bend and somersaulted into a ditch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If anything the peloton of favourites pushed on even harder as Le Court dropped almost a minute behind.However, in the valley road leading to the next climb, the Côte de Saint-Georges d’Hurtières, the peloton slowed and Le Court rejoined the main group. After that, she led the way at the foot of the Madeleine, hoping to set up Gigante.Her efforts were not in vain, but she and Gigante had not factored in Ferrand-Prévot’s extended climbing powers. “Other teams don’t know what’s coming,” Le Court had said of Gigante’s climbing skills. But they had reckoned without Ferrand-Prévot.Now drawing huge crowds to the roadside and growing TV audiences, the fourth edition of the Tour Femmes, has built further on the success of the first three. “I really felt something big was happening,” Rousse said. “I had tears in my eyes. I was a little overwhelmed because women’s cycling has come so far.”Rousse also revealed that Christian Prudhomme, director of the men’s Tour, had said to her: “I no longer see any difference between the two Tours de France.”Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

A similarly shrewd purchase gave the owner one of his best days at the track on the final day ofGlorious Goodwood.Two Tribes, one of three runners in Cunningham’s colours in the Stewards’ Cup, picked up the £75,000 first prize in a valuable handicap at Ascot last week and added £125,000 for this feature race with an emphatic two-and-a-quarter length defeat of Strike Red.His two stable companions at the Richard Spencer yard crossed the line in fourth and fifth. “He was a four-grand foal,” Cunningham said. “That makes it even sweeter.”Better yet for Cunningham, Two Tribes is by the stallion Rajasinghe, who won the 2017 Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot for the owner in a course-record time. Cunningham was so frustrated at breeders’ lack of interest in Rajasinghe in the early years of his stud career that he announced this year that he would offer his services for free.“It’s massive,” he said. “We believed in the horse, but unfortunately not many others have, so it’s great to see him start getting some results. He’s still a track-record holder at Royal Ascot and at three grand [per cover] I couldn’t give him away, so in the end, I did give him away.“He did 58 covers after we did the free deal and at least I know he’s going to have some runners on the track in a couple of years’ time. If we hadn’t made that decision, he’d have been sub-10.”View image in fullscreenWaardah, ridden by Callum Rodriguez, surges ahead to win the Group Two Lillie Langtry StakesPhotograph: Andrew Matthews/PAIt was Cockney Rebel, the winner of the 2,000 Guineas in England and Ireland in 2007 and the first horse Cunningham owned outright, that gave a huge kickstart to his career on the turf. The colt is remembered in the name of his Rebel Racing and “it has just got bigger and bigger” ever since.“It’s my passion and fortunately it’s not my job,” said Cunningham, the founder and chief executive of an insurance business, . “That makes it a bit easier to speculate. We changed the policy [two years ago]. This is the second year where we’ve tried to buy a better quality of horse, spent more money. I wanted to come to days like today, you do get spoiled when you get a taste for it.“We’ll be reinvesting again at the yearling sales this year. We’ve already got six homebreds to come in as two-year-olds.”Waardah could be a horse to look out for in the last three months of the season after Owen Burrows’s lightly raced three-year-old stepped up to a mile-and-three-quarters in ultimately decisive style in the Group Two Lillie Langtry Stakes. Waardah has an entry in the Group One Yorkshire Oaks this month, but the Fillies & Mares event at Ascot on Champions Day in October is a likelier assignment.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowChester:2.10 Princess Rascal (nap) 2.45 Laazm 3.20 Lucky Hero 3.52 Kassaya (nb) 4.22 Abduction 4.52 Yanifer 5.22 Risen Again.Yarmouth:2.32 Moon Target 3.07 B Associates 3.42 Argentum 4.12 Arundel 4.42 Last Outlaw 5.12 Ventura Dream.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I thought she was going to get outstayed, but in the last half-furlong she was probably going away again,” Burrows said. “She will have no trouble going back to a mile-and-a-half either, so she is an exciting filly.“She is in the Yorkshire Oaks, though it’s important she gets a little bit of juice in the ground.

In fact, we all have the powerSat 2 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 10.20 EDTShareThere’s a common misconception that state-of-the-art technology has to be expensive, energy consumptive and hard to engineer. That’s because we have been persuaded to believe that innovative technology is whatever bombastic billionaires claim it is, whether that’s commercial spacecraft or the endless iterations of generative AI tools.As the Canadian technologist and engineerUrsula Franklin once said, fantasies of technology would have it that innovation is always “investment-driven, shiny, lab-born, experimental, exciting”. But more often than not, in the real world, it is “needs-driven, scrappy, on location, iterative, practical, mundane”. The real pioneering technologies of today are genuinely useful systems I like to call “frugal tech”, and they are brought to life not by eccentric billionaires but by people doing more with less. They don’t impose top-down “solutions” that seem to complicate our lives while making a few people very rich. It turns out that genuinely innovative technology really can set people free.Last month at Berlin’s once hippy, now increasingly corporatised Re:publica conference, for example, I met researchers from theAssociation for Progressive Communications(APC), who are using technologies such as software-defined radios and spectrum sensing to allow people in low-resource environments to stay connected despite limited bandwidth, power, hardware and communication infrastructure. These technologies are the basis of the local community networks that supply coverage tothe 2.5 billionpeople globally who lack internet access. In the Niger Delta, which suffers fromtoxic levels of air pollutionfrom its oil industry, APC is setting up connections and deploying low-cost sensors that monitor the environment. These play a crucial role in how locals can advise children when to stay inside and which areas to avoid playing in. This infrastructure is managed for and by the municipality, serves a pressing need and can be installed and built by the people who deploy it. Unlike, say, ChatGPT or a Blue Origin space rocket.The fact is, while generative AI is lauded as the technology of the minute, iterations such as Dall-E 3,Google Geminiand GPT are irrelevant to those who don’t have enough internet bandwidth to use them. The new digital divide is the gap between the top end of the global population – who have access to these power-intensive technologies – and those at the bottom, whose internet access, or lack of, remains static. That’s why some of today’s most brilliant minds are working out how to manage the trade-off between internet range and bandwidth, and whether there are obstacles in the way such as mountains and foliage.View image in fullscreenElon Musk at the Axel Springer award in Berlin, Germany, 1 December 2020.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/ReutersThe fact is that good innovation also often involves lobbying for good. So while big tech poured hundreds of millions into watering down theEU AI Act, good tech lobbies for better internet provisions for all. Policy and innovation go hand in hand, meaning that the consequences of good technology far exceed the technology itself, extending to governance and social welfare.At Re:publica’s “maker space”, I fiddled around with DIY solar-powered sensors that can be built using a Raspberry Pi computer and off-the-shelf components such as humidity sensors. I lost my partner, an engineer by training, to a microscope designed by the OpenFlexure project that was made from 3D printed materials. Microscopes are crucial for diagnosing infections but can cost millions of pounds, making them entirely inaccessible for many people across the globe. This one is lightweight, costs next to nothing and is open source, meaning that anyone can reproduce the design by 3D printing parts and cobbling them together with shop-bought motors and circuit boards. A bit like a cheap Ikea wardrobe, except that all the bits you need to assemble it can be bought inexpensively from a local electronics shop. Manufacturers from Ghana and Wales to Chile and Australia are all using OpenFlexure’s designs to give people everywhere access to low-source microscopy. We might think generative AI has invaded all corners of our lives, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. What is actually prolific and relevant to the majority are low-cost technologies that solve day-to-day business and social problems.While most of what we consider to be “hi-tech” is closed off behind proprietary algorithms, the open-source technologies above all require community involvement. This can be immensely empowering, and can improve public trust: it’s hard (and unwise) to give yourself over to a technology that won’t tell you how it works, particularly when its predefined settings allow only for meagre approaches to “user privacy”. As I ask my students, if you could develop an AI at your own home, and programme it to reflect your values and prioritise your safety, wouldn’t youtrust it more? Well, the idea isn’t so outlandish – it only feels impossible because big tech firms want us to think it is.Why does technology create new problems for each problem it solves? | Mark BuchananRead moreWhat is most outstanding about frugal innovation is not just that its technologies are impressive, but that it might actually prompt systemic change by showing people that tech can be developed locally, and not just imported from Silicon Valley. When farmer Chris Conderdug her own fibreoptic cableson her property in Lancashire, she set out “to prove that ordinary people could do it … it wasn’t rocket science”. By demonstrating that fast internet could be connected with fibre-optic cable, a digger and the desire to just get on and do it, she spawned an organisation calledB4RN, which promotes community fibre partnerships.Tech bros may want you to believe there is no point in making something new unless it is difficult, inaccessible and exclusionary. But technological innovation is about collaboration as much as it is about competition. For many people across the world, a product’s value isn’t in a sky-high valuation, or in it being impossible to take apart (as with impenetrable iPhones). Often, the smartest technologies are those that distil a problem down to its bread and butter components in order to disseminate a solution to the masses.So, while innovative individuals and communities around the world quietly get on with improving their lives and those around them, it’s high time the rest of us stopped being passive recipients of technology, and started asking ourselves what kind of world we want to live in and how to create it. Must the setting for innovation be £1bn-plus buildings likeGoogle’s new London officesin King’s Cross, located in nations that can afford to stomach eye-watering training costs and compute power requirements? Or might we instead be able to steer innovation from within our very communities – or households?Eleanor Drage is a senior research fellow at the University of Cambridge’s Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence and co-author of the The Good Robot: Why Technology Needs FeminismExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

Friday’sannouncementby the showrunner Michael Patrick King that the third series of And Just Like That would be its last was met with little surprise and I suspect some relief. Following a forthcoming two-part finale, Carrie Bradshaw will hang up her Manolos for good – and not a moment too soon.If a theme could be pulled from the scrambled threads of the third season of the Sex and the City reboot, it is, I think, the question of appearance versus reality. Early on in the series, rattled by the discovery of a rat infestation in her meadowy garden, Carrie seeks comfort from Aidan, the man she’s technically in a relationship with but due to a muddled and implausible arrangement, can’t actuallybewith for five years. Carrie thought her garden was perfect, she says, “but I just wasn’t looking underneath”.And Just Like That: Sex and the City spin-off to end after third seasonRead moreAfter three seasons ofAnd Just Like Thatthe answer to what lies beneath is, I fear, nothing. Take the shoes – in a frankly criminal throwback to one of the best plotlines of the original show, Carrie namechecks a superior earlier episode as she complains about her curmudgeonly downstairs neighbour asking her to remove her stilettos in the house. In A Woman’s Right to Shoes, Carrie’s stolen Manolo Blahniks stood for, in no particular order, the gulf that can open between friends at different life stages, the way marriage and motherhood are celebrated when the milestones of an independent life are not, attention inequity in friendships, and a woman’s right to spend her money however the hell she chooses. In Under the Table, Carrie’s shoes signify … that she has a crush.That’s not to say And Just Like That hasn’t had its moments of insight – they just tend to be immediately binned in favour of something silly. Despite episodes averaging 40 minutes in length, this season has been the trimmest so far, with excisions both necessary (Che Diaz) and unexplained (Nya) giving the remaining characters room to breathe. Seema learns that the key to romance is not pretending to be someone else, but letting go of the desire to be seen in a certain way. Lisa flounders in her attempt to balance work and family life. Charlotte, previously troubled by such challenges as the cancellation of her dog, finally gets a storyline worthy of her default mode of hysteria when Harry is diagnosed with prostate cancer.View image in fullscreenNicole Ari Parker, Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Sarita Choudhury.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/Rex/ShutterstockCharlotte and Lisa’s Park Avenue-set struggles with family life have some meat to them, but are bedevilled by every interaction with their children seeming to have come straight out of a toothpaste advertisement, or hell. See: Charlotte freaking out about not being able to work the party circuit to sell art as her smug children talk about veganism and polyamory, or the Todd Wexley family’s cringe banter and Lisa’s dismissive comments that her husband should start Ozempic.‘I’ve been crucified!’ Sarah Jessica Parker on dating, delis – and surviving three decades of Carrie hatersRead moreAt times like these the show feels like a charmless sitcom about the super-rich. In Sex and the City, the weekends in the Hamptons were just the backdrop to more resonant storytelling – in And Just Like That, sometimes the settingisthe story. In one scene, Charlotte begins to spiral at Tiffany’s, wondering if life is as fragile as the glass cabinets around her – but what might have been a serious meditation on midlife and mortality morphs into an unfunny joke about which society events Bitsy von Muffling is and isn’t invited to. Sometimes these vignettes verge on outright cruelty – after Lisa’s nemesis is marked as a gauche interloper by her Michael Kors handbag (wrong kind of designer, honey), it’s a lot harder to see her mother-in-law’s pronouncement that she has no time for the working class as mere satire.Meanwhile, the inexplicably homeless Miranda deflowers a nun, becomes a meme and gains a girlfriend, who, in lieu of a personality, possesses two Italian greyhounds and vile British colleagues apparently scooped straight from the cutting room floor of Too Much. It’s not until the 10th episode that we get to see Miranda, who barely resembles the beloved judgmental ice queen of Sex and the City, do the first Miranda-y thing of the entire series so far, when she stalks the woman her son got pregnant.The one bright spot of the season has been its treatment of Carrie’s faltering relationship with Aidan. A standout episode in which she visits him in Virginia sees a diminished Carrie, too afraid to ask for what she wants, settling for the smallest thing he can offer her – a spot in the guesthouse. Carrie switches her magenta Vivienne Westwood for a “sister wives” prairie dress, to attempt the role of cool country stepmum. But the performance of a happy blended family falls to pieces in a rare decent domestic scene, in which resentment and alienation explode into a conflict that ends with a broken window and a return to reality.View image in fullscreenSarah Jessica Parker and John Corbett.Photograph: Craig Blankenhorn/© 2023 WarnerMedia Direct, LLC. All Rights Reserved.The relationship eventually crumbles when Carrie realises that no matter how she changes for Aidan – selling her apartment, not being a brat in the countryside (remember Suffern?) – he cannot move past her previous infidelity. This, to me, is the point of returning to a story decades later: to show how people change, and how they don’t. How the cracks in a relationship can run so deep that even the layering sediment of time can’t fill them in, but only hide them. When Carrie finally ended it, I felt a tug of genuine emotion that can only come from having spent so much time with these characters.Alot has been madethis season of the idea of thehate-watch, especially given Miranda’s obsession with a Love Island-style show called Bi Bingo. “I finally discovered the joy of hate-watching,” she says, in what I assume is meant to be a winning nod at self-awareness by the showrunners.The thing is, I don’t believe that’s what those of us who loved Sex and the City (for who else would bother watching And Just Like That through three unexceptional seasons?) were doing. I’d describe it as something closer to hope-watching. We wanted to see the characters we loved, women once so convincingly and lovingly drawn, being flirty, frivolous and fabulously dressed in New York City. But more than that, we held out hope that something substantial might still remain beneath the sparkle. In two episodes’ time we’ll finally know the answer – and if we’re disappointed again, at least it’ll be for the last time.Explore more on these topicsAnd Just Like ThatSarah Jessica ParkerCynthia NixonTV comedyUS televisionTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Among the others was the England rugby international Neil Back, who had been part of the World Cup-winning squad of 2003 and could make a Russian oligarch’s close protection team look like the Cheeky Girls.I was not a noted sportsman in my youth – I have grown to enjoy watching sport but have never been at home in the culture of the clubhouse, the changing room or the training ground. However,Neiland I hit it off instantly. Within two days we were breaking into wardrobe to find out from the names on the aprons who our opposition would be. Within a week he was holding me aloft in an improvised lineout, a testament to his strength rather than my athletic grace. We talked about all sorts of things – shared life experience, unshared life experience – and one day he taught me something that changed my life.It is not an insight that others have not had. Indeed, it is obvious, a simple thing, but like so many obvious and simple things it is inexhaustibly difficult, too. It came up when we were thinking about which chips are best with burgers. I’m a french fry man myself, as slender and light as you like, but Neil goes for the chunky kind – cut immaculately, thrice cooked, then stacked as neatly as aLe Corbusier brise-soleil.I was struck by the intense focus Neil brought to this task, which he rehearsed over and over at home before we got to the kitchen. I asked why and he said: “Perfect practice makes perfect performance.” Of course it does, I thought, but then he said this was a mantra in the England team that won the World Cup. And of course, if Jonny Wilkinson had not practised and practised and practised kicking goals, we would have gone home as runners-up rather than winners.Perfect practice makes perfect performance, for what is a perfect performance other than practice that does not go wrong? I knew a bit about practice because I am a pianist and have been since childhood. I have practised countless pieces, scales and arpeggios, acquiring the 10,000 hours of experience that doing anything decently requires. But I was lackadaisical, and while I found it quite easy to execute some tricky passages, there were others that were too much for me – too quick, too dense, too complex to play accurately or musically. When I was young I used to busk my way through them, hitting the sostenuto pedal when I got to an unplayable bar to blur the inaccuracies. I would also affect what I thought were Lisztian flourishes at the keyboard as a distraction. I don’t suppose I fooled many people, but it got me through.When I ran away to London and joined a pop band, I had to learn to play in a different way. It is only now, in my 60s, that I have returned seriously to the classical repertoire I played in my teens. It is interesting to revisit who you were as a teenager 45 years later, and discover what has endured and what has changed. What has endured for me is a deep love of music, and what has changed is a willingness to try to play it properly; not to busk my way through difficult passages but to face them squarely, break them down, put them together slowly and methodically, to practise and practise and practise, and to discover the obvious thing: if you practise, you get better.This has not only made me a better pianist than I was then, even if I am not yet back to peak technique; it has made me a better musician. By that I mean more patient, more focused, more willing to engage. It’s been a life lesson, too.I read a story recently about a man who visited Rachmaninov, the greatest pianist of his day, at home in Los Angeles. As he approached the front door, he could hear the great man practising in his music room. What titanic flourishes, what miracles of touch and dexterity poured forth?A chord of two notes, played very slowly, over and over and over again.Richard Coles is a writer, broadcaster and former Church of England clergymanExplore more on these topicsPsychologyWords that changed everythingMasterChefRugby World Cup 2003TelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Our world has been too real for too long, and we all just want a bit of shelter from the storm.We look back in patronising nostalgia atObama’s Hope posterin the same way we insist music hasn’t beenreal musicsince about 1986 (or since 1966, or since the Great American Songbook, or since Mozart, depending who you talk to).The Fantastic Four: First Steps review – Marvel regains buoyancy with wacky superhero family sitcomRead moreMovie theatres are propped up by two monolith tent poles: DC’sumpteenth Supermanand Marvel’sFantastic Four reboot, both attempting a full factory reset of their flagship properties.It offers a return to the originals – AKA, the “good old days”. But this isn’t so much a yearning for a new optimism as it is a resuscitation of an old one. The Fantastic Four is even set in a 1960s Jetsons-style alternate reality (the first comic waspublished in 1961).Remember this? This is Things As They Should Be™.The great irony in this regurgitation of old aesthetics is that, they themselves looked forward. The joy and optimism of the space age showcased the marvellous and fantastic possibilities of technology and science, before we knew that those same industries would slowly start choking our own atmosphere.We want to go back to that time, when we could feel good about driving our big shiny bubble cars and tease our hair up guilt-free – without thinking about the ozone or whatever.This starts to feel like a photocopy of a photocopy. The AI boom is sampling and recycling things that already existThis perceived collective optimism was never real, of course. But now, after decades of doom storytelling and hope erosion, we want the dream back.What’s happening in the culture is more than the good honest fun of theme park recreations, 1950s diners and old west camera filters. This is an earnest but somehow deeply sad defibrillation of dead worlds, built around a hollow craving that can never ever be filled.We are birds constantly regurgitating and eating our own upchuck. Same flavour but different colour, different flavour but same chunks.Its passion looks inspirational, but its sniff is grief. It works, but not quite — as fresh as microwaved leftovers.It’s the cultural equivalent of Maga – the lie that there was some glorious past where things were flourishing and wholesome and if we can just get back there we’ll be on track again. But there never was that past. It’s a distortion of immature childhood memories and historical rewriting by big corporations.This is the multiverse made real by an increasingly small cabal of conglomerates leveraging their various assets, stuffing each storytelling turducken full of old money-makers to reduce the risk in anything new. It’s not so much the multiverse as the IP-verse. Every brand everywhere all at once.Over time this starts to feel like a photocopy of a photocopy. The AI boom is quite literally sampling and recycling things that already exist.When I see a brand-new building proudly inspired by the art deco movement of 100 years ago, I wonder if the great deco designers knew way back then that they were on the blind precipice of the future, or were they recreating their own nostalgic past? I wonder, as typography and graphic design trends cycle through recreations of past “vintage” ideas, what the concept of “vintage” meant to people back when it was, to them, modern?Having lost hope for the future, we have always looked back for comfort. We have to be cautious of the reasons why.Why did Nazi aesthetics have such a fetish for ancient Rome? Why did Soviet culture idolise modern industrial style? Even in The Handmaid’s Tale’s Gilead, they revere the natural and organic by insisting on non-GM and high-fat foods. The world around us tells us a lot about our beliefs.We are all potential victims of this ideological myth-making. It’s invisible but everywhere, and it’s difficult to tell if people in power aim to manufacture a world that matches their values or if it’s some kind of naturally developing, laissez-faire attraction.We’re all dreaming of a better time from the past, since there is no future. We’ve stopped dreaming about building – now we dream of recreating.The left needs its own version of techno-optimism | Amana Fontanella-KhanRead moreIt’s not recreating the actual thing that we want, it’s the yearning to recreate the feeling we had back then.In my local city centre, I drive past heritage-protected sandstone buildings with the names of the original shopfronts still carved at the top. The mason etching that date in the rock was doing it for the future, so as time stretched on his mark would stay there, even for me now as I whip past the exact same building in a space shuttle machine he could never even dream of.Imagine a shop front named something like, “Nolan and Sons Merchants, est. 1861.” And on the shop front awning below it, computer-printed on laminate in an deliberately old-timey font, “Buzz’d Cafe, est. 2025.”Take a sledgehammer to the wall of this cafe. Pierce the membrane of lino wallpaper printed to look like rustic bricks and find sterile chalk-white plasterboard from the previous shop, which was itself once added to modernise and cover the rustic brick walls beneath.You can find these rings of a tree in everything: generations on top of generations of us each trying to make our own existence matter and either cover or recover the ones before us.So, do we seek comfort in the baby blanket of our past myths – or do we try to create our own new ones?Martin Ingleis a writer and film-makerExplore more on these topicsSupermanOpinionFantastic FourcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s essentially a piece of Velcro that goes around your face to provide what the marketing copy describes as “targeted compression for shaping & sculpting” via “collagen yarn”. No, I don’t know what that means either.While I may be a tad unclear on how “collagen yarn” is supposed to work, I can tell you exactly how the Kardashian-Jenners operate: if there’s an insecurity that can be monetized, they’ll find a way to monetize it. Over the years the reality-TV-famous family have built an empire flogging everything from dubiousdetox teasto skincare products while posting heavily edited images that reinforcetoxic beauty standards. The new face wrap appears to be an attempt to cash in on growing interest around what has been dubbed a “snatched jawline” – which is essentially a very chiselled jaw. A number of dubious products, including jaw massagers and “mastic chewing gum”, have popped up, promising to help you achieve this look. Now Skims has come out with its own exciting face innovation to get into the action.The medical-looking Face Wrap also seems to play into the way in which plastic surgery has become normalized. Celebrities used to be fairly hush-hush about going under the knife. Now they’respilling all the details aboutwhich doctor they went to for their procedures and how much it cost. One surgeon told People magazine that the public is starting to see plastic surgery as just “another form of self-care”.Will the ghost of Epstein finally bring down King Trump? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWhile Skims’ new face wrap may scream “useless gimmick that promotes unhealthy beauty ideals”, it has already sold out and generated one unusual celebrity endorsement. In anInstagram videoposted on Thursday Anthony Hopkins sported one of the Skims masks and jokingly slipped back into his Silence of the Lambs character,“the late, great Hannibal Lecter”, who wore a similar chinstrap in the film to curb his cannibalism. “Hello Kim, I’m already feeling 10 years younger,” Hopkins says. In a caption he added: “Don’t be afraid to come over for dinner.”Also chiming in on all the Skims chatter is Katie Piper, a model and TV presenter who was the victim of anacid attackin 2008 orchestrated by her ex-boyfriend. In aTikTok posted on FridayPiper said that the Kardashians’ “latest offering” reminded of her what she had to wear during her burn survivor recovery. “Please, people, don’t imprison your face in this contraption,” Piper says. “Don’t be so cruel and unkind to your face … to encase it in a stupid strap that, by the way, does absolutely nothing.”Amen to that. While it may be obvious, it’s worth reiterating that the Kardashians and other celebrities don’t look the way that they do because they strap medieval-looking torture devices around their faces while they sleep. Rather they shell out for expensive procedures like$100,000 deep plane faceliftsand$500,000 facial rejuvenations. In 2023 Sharon Osbourne told theTelegraphthat while she hadn’t kept a running total of how much she had spent on cosmetic surgery, “it must top more than a million.” You can buy whatever sort of body you desire these days – it’ll just cost you an arm and a leg.Anti-abortion Texas Republican accused of paying for abortionsThe Republican state representative Giovanni Capriglione played an instrumental part in ensuring Texas has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the US. Now a former adult entertainer called Alex Grace hasclaimed that she was romantically involvedwith Capriglione – who is married with kids – for almost two decades and he “funded several abortions for his own personal gain”. (There are some other extremely disgusting allegations involving cookie batter that I won’t repeat.) Capriglionehas admittedto having an affair but says the rest of the story is lies. While I can’t confirm this particular case, there are plenty of other documented instances of anti-abortion extremistsfunding abortions for their mistresses.Elon Muskreposts tweetclaiming women were‘built to be traded to another tribe’Meanwhile, Donald Trump has been banging on about how Jeffrey Epstein “stole” Virginia Giuffre and other young female staffers, who he hired fromthe president’s Mar-a-Lago countryclub.

That story was sunk deep into our bones and passed between us as our treasured inheritance. It formed our sense of ourselves and our belief in Scotland’s good and worthy contribution to the world.We walked past statues of David Hume and Adam Smith. We celebrated their intellect and claimed it as our own. Yet no one spoke of what lay beneath that brilliance – of whose labour built their wealth, whose bodies were stolen, dispossessed and abused as a consequence of their “thinking”. Edinburgh was framed not as a city of complicity but of genius. That silence shaped us.Now, the University of Edinburgh’s review of its legacies of enslavement and colonialism joins a wider reckoning that has been building across Scotland. It confronts the stories we were told – that we continue to tell. That we love to tell.Scotland has long positioned itself as a nation on the margins of empire. We speak of being oppressed, victimised – or as a benign participant in the British imperial project. But many of us, through our family histories, have always known that’s not the whole truth. It’s a lie of omission. One that has excluded us, exiled us from a national story in which we also have histories to contribute, and in which we have a claim.Edinburgh University’srecent inquiryinto its history is sobering. It focuses on the institution’s financial gains from plantation slavery, its intellectual support of racial pseudoscience and its memorialisation of colonial figures. It names how Enlightenment thinking in Scotland justified racial hierarchies. These aren’t revelations for many Black and Brown Scots, or for those involved with Scotland’s anti-racism movements – they’re confirmations of truths long lived and denied.And still, we are met with denial, minimisation and the defensive recoil of a nation uncomfortable with the truth of itself. There’s a reflex to preserve pride at all costs within our society – even when the cost is exclusion and erasure of fellow Scots; of their histories and their story of Scotland.View image in fullscreenA sign hangs from the statue of David Hume on the Royal Mile, Edinburgh, after a Black Lives Matter protest, 7 June 2020.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAThe work of uncovering Scotland’s pivotal role in enslavement and colonialism has been led by individuals such as the academics Geoff Palmer and Stephen Mullen, Zandra Yeaman at the Hunterian Museum, Lisa Williams, founder of the Edinburgh Black History Walk, and the poet Shasta Hanif Ali, who explores the stories of the Indian ayahs who lived and worked in Edinburgh. Their work has helped us understand long-denied histories and given many of us a stronger sense of belonging as a result. The University of Edinburgh’s report adds further weight to their labour. But what comes next?Race is a social construct. But we must now confront the fact that it was constructed, in part, here, by so-called “great men” – our great men – whose legacy continues to shape our country and institutions. And their legacy still causes us harm.This harm is not abstract. In 2024 alone, Police Scotland recorded4,794 hate crimesunder the new Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act. Black and minority ethnic people are60% more likely to live in the most deprived parts of Scotlandthan their white counterparts. Black and minority ethnic workers havepoorer outcomes than white workerswhen applying for jobs in our public sector organisations.These are reverberations of a legacy born in Enlightenment philosophies that theorised racial hierarchies – ideas presented as science, later used to justify enslavement and colonialism. These narratives of white supremacy negatively affect us all, and they continue to endanger and blight the lives of Black and Brown people.What happens next must therefore go beyond apology and symbolism. It must be structural, sustained and fiercely imaginative. Education is key. Not just to correct the record, but to transform how we imagine and create a better nation. Within our schools, reform is under way – initiatives such as Education Scotland’sBuilding Racial Literacyprogramme and collectives such asThe Anti-Racist Educatorprovide vital resources and training.Such efforts must be scaled, funded and politically backed if they’re to meaningfully reshape how we understand ourselves, how we embed anti-racism within our institutions and how we teach Scotland’s history.Edinburgh council’sSlavery and Colonialism Legacy Review, endorsed by councillors in 2022, included a public apology and the creation of an implementation group, chaired by Irene Mosota, to guide reparative action. This included initiatives such as theDisrupting the Narrative project, which has formed the main body of my work as Edinburgh makar (the city’s poet laureate). The meetings of theScottish BPOC Writers Network’s writers group at the University of Edinburgh, and the important work of mentorship and support fromWe Are Here Scotlandare also living examples of this reparative work. This work is not symbolic – it is foundational. It allow us to rebuild from the margins, and write ourselves back into the story of Scotland, and into the story we tell.This is a live, unfinished conversation – one that must embrace intersectionality, mobilise solidarity and resist the far right’s weaponisation of pseudoscience and historical denial. Opposition to anti-racism is often framed as resistance to “political correctness”, and calls for decolonisation are frequently mocked or deliberately misunderstood. Silence, however, is complicity.History is not settled. Our story is not finished. We are capable of confronting ourselves honestly and critically. We can take pride in our history of social justice movements – but this pride must also own and acknowledge the truth of what and who built this nation. That means interrogating our past and the reasons for our collective amnesia. It means listening to voices long silenced. The time has come, Scotland. The time has finally come.Hannah Lavery is a Scottish poet and playwright.

He’s never before appeared so flustered, forced to answer question after question about the women and girls whose lives were destroyed by his former “best friend”.The world may never know what is inside the so-called “Epstein files.” What is clear is that the contents are damaging enough for the president and his human flak jackets to call the whole affair a “hoax”, recess Congress to prevent a vote on releasing the materials and send the deputy attorney general to visitTallahassee, Florida, to speak to theconvicted child sex traffickerGhislaine Maxwell, who was subsequently moved to a“cushy”,celebrity-riddledminimum security prison in Bryan, Texas.As the conservative pundit Bill Kristolnotedover the weekend: “[Richard Nixon] said of Watergate, ‘I gave them a sword. And they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.’ Trump may have given us a sword. We should use it.” Kristol is right, to a point. Liberals, progressives and never-Trump Republicans must not let voters forget Trump’s festering, open wound without neglecting the kitchen table, cost-of-living matters that hurt them last fall.Ghislaine Maxwell is not a victim. And if she is pardoned, it won’t be for the sake of justice | Arwa MahdawiRead moreIn 2007, a far sharper and far more spry Joe Biden delivered aquipso clever and cutting that it ended another man’s entire political career.Rudy Giulianiwas never able to recover after Biden observed how it seemed “there’s only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb, and 9/11”. The line was funny because it was true; it was lethal because it exposed the emptiness behind the former New York City mayor’s tragedy-fueled candidacy.This is the challenge for Democrats: how do they maintain a spotlight on a scandal that reveals Trump for who he is in a way thatfinallyresonates with his base without appearing to exploit a tragedy , à la Giuliani? They must ground the abstract conspiracy in everyday terms relatable to the average American.It goes like this: Trump protects elites.Say it in every stump speech, vent about it in vertical videos and keep it alive as a dominant narrative in the zeitgeist. Do not back away. The modern media environment rewards repetition and omnipresence, so Hakeem Jeffries should promise an Epstein select committee, Chuck Schumer should make Republicans release the Epstein files in return for votes to fund the government, and every leftwing activist in the country should be burying Pam Bondi’s justice department in a blizzard of Freedom of Information Act requests.In doing so, recognize that the response to the scandal is an encapsulation of a deeper truth that voters already feel. The president and the GOP protect the elite at the expense of ordinary Americans.Savvier Democrats get this. Some of the party’s best communicators have already been grasping for a message along these lines, as seen in the focus on Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders’s nationwideFighting Oligarchytour. But while those efforts have paid some political dividends, they have not come close to capturing the public imagination to the degree the Epstein files have.For at least some portion of the Maga movement, the past three weeks have finally managed to expose Trump for the hobnobbing, name-dropping, pompous ass that he’s always been. Why is this one particular story so effective – especially as most voters have known Trump to be a plutocratic wannabe for decades? Maggie Haberman’shypothesisis noteworthy: New York high society operates in two concentric circles. The Big Apple has a glittering “elite” withstatusat the center of a broader ring that wieldspower.Trump has always tried to straddle those rings, painting himself as the renegade billionaire. The Epstein affair shatters that mythos. It casts him not as a brash, bull-in-a-china-shop outsider but as the ultimate insider, rubbing shoulders with the very aristocracy his campaign rhetoric promised to upend.Democrats must lead with Epstein. Then they need to connect it to the president’s myriad failures. Why did Trump cut taxes for the richest Americans while cutting Medicaid in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act? For the same reason he is protecting Epstein and his buddies. Why is Trump risking union jobs in auto manufacturing so he can have a trade spat with Mexico and Canada? For the same reason he is protecting Epstein and his buddies. Why isDonald Trumptalking about firing the head of the Fed? For the same reason he is protecting Epstein and his buddies.Mallory McMorrow of Michigan, a Democratic Senate candidate, is already reading from this script. In recent weeks, she has demonstrated mastery in pairing Epstein with broader anti‑elite rhetoric. In onevertical video, she emphatically declared:This is exactly why there’s eroding trust in our institutions, because until we confront the rot that exists in our institutions, until we hold everyone, everyone accountable under the same set of rules and laws, we will keep living in a country where there are two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful, and one for everybody else. We deserve better. Release the files now.Trump’s friendship with Epstein is a proof point for elite favoritism and all of us who oppose the orange god king must use it to condemn inequality and unaccountable power within the GOP ecosystem.The Epstein scandal has captured our attention not just because it’s a lurid horror story, but because it confirms a truth people already believe: the rich view them as objects for exploitation. And if there’s one thing Trump has successfully messaged to all Americans, it’s that he’s very,veryrich.Epstein is the story. But he is also a stand-in for every closed maternity ward in a rural county, for every mom choosing between insulin and groceries and for every veteran battling the Department of Veterans Affairs while Silicon Valley billionaires buy senators. Democrats’ message is simple enough, actually: “Trump and the GOP protect the elite. They abandon you.”Think this messaging can be overdone? Look no further than Benghazi, a truly made-up scandal, which Republicans turned into a true political liability with Hillary Clinton’s emails. That story stuck because of repetition and omnipresence, but also because it struck a chord with something Americans already believed: that the Clinton family viewed themselves as above accountability.Even Trump’s own supporters are asking hard questions. Where are the files? Why is there a two-tiered system of justice? Why is Trump more interested in protecting his friends than releasing the truth? The Democratic response should be a noun, a verb and Jeffrey Epstein, and then the rot at the core of the American system. Deployed effectively, it can be as impactful and as memorable as Trump’s cruel but devastating 2024attack line: “Kamala is for they / them, President Trump is for you.”Trump protects elites.That’s why Trump is protecting Epstein’s circle.But who’s protecting you?Peter Rothpletz is a Guardian contributorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsDemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, he is being blocked by a powerful man who has conflated protest with terrorism and called for musicians whose views he dislikes to be dropped from festival bills. That man is also named Keir Starmer. Over the past six months, Trilling has spoken to two dozen Labour insiders, former colleagues of the prime minister and leading human rights advocates in an attempt to pin down the shapeshifting PM.Read more2.‘Generations of women have been disfigured’: Jamie Lee Curtis lets rip on plastic surgery, power and Hollywood’s age problemView image in fullscreen‘The wax lips are my statement against plastic surgery,’ says Jamie Lee Curtis.Photograph: Mary Rozzi/The Guardian“At 66, I get to be a boss,” says Jamie Lee Curtis. That is very much the vibe of this interview, in which the actor shows up “aggressively early” to the Zoom chat, opens up about her experience with addiction, and uses – and staunchly defends – the word “genocide” to describe the impact that cosmetic surgery has had on a generation of women. Emma Brockes speaks to Curtis before the forthcoming sequel to Freaky Friday, which sees the actor reuniting with Lindsay Lohan in the mother-daughter body-swap comedy (“I felt tremendous maternal care for Lindsay after the first movie, and continued to feel that”) – but their chat ends up becoming about so much more.Read more3.‘There’s an arrogance to the way they move around the city’: is it time for digital nomads like me to leave Lisbon?View image in fullscreenAlex Holder is considering leaving Lisbon after living in the city for five years.Photograph: Luis Ferraz/The Guardian“The lack of integration means I’m not the only remote worker feeling adrift. What happens when the shared spaces of your so-called community are sun-drenched cafes and boutique fitness studios? What does it mean to never volunteer, or spend time with an elderly person, to rarely take public transport, or read the local news?”It’s easy to romanticise the life of a digital nomad: swapping the office for a beachside cafe; living in a flat far more spacious than the ones available back home; being eternally drenched in the southern European sun. But this thoughtful piece by Alex Holder, who moved from London to Lisbon, reveals the cracks in this fantasy. “Maybe,” she wonders, “it’s time to move and make room for someone else.”Read more4.Can Democratic socialists get Zohran Mamdani across the finish line?View image in fullscreenA supporter wears a badge backing Zohran Mamdani at a campaign event in New York in June.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesHe had charisma. He had good content. He also had the support of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an organisation whose membership has grown from 6,000 or so upon its founding in the 80s to a sizeable 80,000 today. Zohran Mamdani’s record-setting success in New York’s June mayoral primary was bolstered by 60,000 volunteers knocking on 1.6m doors across the city – a vast effort, Dharna Noor writes, made possible by New York’s DSA field team.In this piece, Noor tracks the rise of an organisation that is increasingly shaping American politics – and considers whether it’s ready for a face-off with the Democratic establishment.Read more5.Euro 2025: our writers hand out their awards from the tournamentView image in fullscreenFrom left: Dutch star Vivianne Miedema, Spain’s Aitana Bonmatí and England goalie Hannah Hampton.Composite: Guardian Picture DeskFrom the match of the tournament and the best player to the most memorable goal, Guardian sports writers nominate their picks and personal highlights from Euro 2025, and share what they’d like to see next for women’s football – “Just more of everything!”Read more6.‘There’s an overwhelming bond of love’: the grandparents whose kids rely on them to raise a familyView image in fullscreenRita Labiche-Robinson with her nine-year-old granddaughter Nia.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThey say it takes a village, and parents today are ever increasingly turning to their own parents for help with childcare.

They far outnumbered the anti-hotel protesters.Some people in the hotel could be seen watching the demonstration from their windows. Sarah Bailey, 63, who is retired, held a sign that said: “To everyone in the hotel, you are valued, wanted [and] welcome.She said: “I know somebody that has connections with this hotel. I thought it was so important, because I realised they would be looking out of the windows, that we send a positive sign saying you are all these three things.“I think it’s so important to show people that have come here seeking safety and protection that they are welcome and to stand up to those who scare and bully them.”Pat Prendergast, 21, said: “I want people to feel safe.

Although the country had a brief respite last week as hot weather moved north and east, the institute said it expected temperatures of 30C might be reached again over the weekend.“We have some hot days ahead of us in northernNorway,” it said.InSweden, meteorologists said long-term heatwaves were noted at several stations in the north of the country, with a weather station in Haparanda measuring 25C or more for 14 days in a row. In Jokkmokk, Lappland, the heatwave lasted for 15 days.“To find a longer period at these stations, you have to go back more than a century,” said Sverker Hellström, a scientist at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.Blistering heat swept northern Europe in mid-July, driven by hot waters off the Norwegian northern coast and a stubborn area of high pressure that brought temperatures in the Nordics 8-10C above seasonal norms. The region has also since been hit by storms and lightning strikes that have sparked wildfires.The hot weather has taken people by surprise in a part of the continent better adapted to the cold. Researchers havefoundthat countries such as the UK, Norway and Switzerland will face the greatest relative rise in uncomfortably hot days as the planet heats up, and have warned that their infrastructure is not well-suited to cope.On Wednesday, an ice rink in northern Finland opened its doors to people seeking refuge from the heat after they overfilled the local hospital’s emergency room, according to Finnish media. On Thursday, herders warned that their reindeer were on the verge of dying in the heat.Swedish radio reported that foreign tourists heading north to Scandinavia for “coolcations” had instead encountered dangerous heat warnings.“As climate change progresses, exceptionally severe heatwaves will intensify,” said Heikki Tuomenvirta, a scientist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. “They are occurring more frequently, are more severe and last longer.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisNorwayEuropeFinlandSwedennewsShareReuse this content"

Warm sea surface temperatures, which are exacerbated by global heating, create favourable conditions for jellyfish.This contributes to a population bloom and a prolonged stay during the summer season, and experts say the conditions are likely to lead to the arrival of new jellyfish species that prefer warmer waters.With record-high sea surface temperatures in April and May this year, according to the Met Office, a greater number of jellyfish blooms are expected to populate the UK coast.Jellyfish are a foundational element of the aquatic food web, as they are types of plankton that form the bases of many food chains. Compass jellyfish, identified by dark stripes on their bells and long tentacles which cause a painful sting, are a particular favourite source of food for turtles, said Abigail McQuatters-Gollop, a marine conservation specialist at the University of Plymouth.View image in fullscreenThe compass jellyfish is a particular favourite source of food for turtles.Photograph: The Marine Conservation Society/Peter Bardsley/PAA common but spectacular species that has arrived in great numbers in UK waters this summer is the barrel jellyfish, which can grow to a metre in diameter. It has a thick bell with frilly arms. This species has a relatively mild sting and is eaten by humans in some areas of the world, such as parts of Asia.Other jellyfish species that have been identified this year include moon, lion’s mane, blue and mauve stinger species.View image in fullscreenMoon jellyfish are among the species that have been identified in the UK this year.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAThe number of jellyfish sightings recorded by the Marine Conversation Society in 2024 was 1,432, a 32% increase compared with the previous year. McQuatters-Gollop said some evidence suggests that we are “more likely to have more jellyfish blooms because of climate change and the water getting warmer.”But the jellyfish will not stay for long as they have a short lifespan, with some being born and dying within the same summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

McQuatters-Gollop said that extreme weather conditions that can break apart the fragile bodies of jellyfish are an effect of climate breakdown.She said jellyfish have “beautiful colours, long tentacles streaming behind them, and look like something that belong in outer space.“I wanted to encourage people to safely observe jellyfish and fall in love with them, because they are amazing and I feel so lucky when I dive and swim alongside them.”Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

The bell has a layer of mucus over it, which the moon jellyfish uses to catch plankton, which it inserts into its mouth using special tentacles.Nasa launched more than 2,478 young moon jellyfish in a container into space in 1991 to study the effects of microgravity on the gravity-sensitive organs of the species. Although they did not reach the moon, scientists discovered that the space-born jellyfish had difficulty swimming in Earth’s gravity, as their nervous system had adapted too well to microgravity.Lion’s maneView image in fullscreenLion’s mane jellyfish. Its sting can cause serious discomfort.Photograph: Nature Photographers Ltd/AlamyThe largest species of jellyfish in the world is the lion’s mane, which gets its name from its up to 3-metre-long, hair-like tentacles that look like, yes, a lion’s mane. These reddish-brown tentacles are packed with stinging cells and are used to prey upon fish and smaller jellyfish. The largest recorded lion’s mane specimen was found off the coast of Massachusetts, US, in 1865. It had a bell diameter of 210cm and tentacles measuring about 36.6 metres long.Although not fatal, the sting of a lion’s mane jellyfish can cause serious discomfort to a person, from localised redness and pain to vomiting and chest pain. A 34-year-old woman was taken to hospital in 2016 after suffering an allergic reaction from the sting of six lion’s mane jellyfish.Barrel jellyfishView image in fullscreenThe sting of a barrel jellyfish is typically mild and does not cause real harm.Photograph: Andrew Pearson/AlamyAnotherlarge speciesto look out for is the barrel jellyfish, with a bell diameter of as much as 90cm and which weigh as much as 35kg. They have eight frilly tentacles and, due to their enormous size, are often found washed up on beaches after searching for prey in shallow waters. Fish and small crabs are known to seek shelter within the tentacles of the barrel specimen, as a safe space from predators.The sting of a barrel jellyfish is typically mild and does not cause real harm to people. Countries across the world and particularly in south-east Asia haveeaten barrel jellyfishfor more than 1,700 years.Mauve stingerView image in fullscreenThe mauve stinger packs a punch with its 3-metre long tentacles full of stinging cells.Photograph: WaterFrame/AlamyThe mauve stinger is a small and beautiful jellyfish, typically coloured pink, purple or a bluey purple, and packs a punch with its 3-metre long tentacles full of stinging cells. The mauve stinger has one of the worst stings of all the species and can glow brightly at night when disturbed, giving it the scientific namePelagia noctiluca, which translates to “night-light of the sea”.Compass jellyfishView image in fullscreenThe compass jellyfish is a common sight off the UK coastline.Photograph: The Marine Conservation Society/Peter Bardsley/PAA common summer visitor to the UK is the compass jellyfish, named for its brown lined markings running down the centre of its yellowish-white bell that resemble a compass. When the compass jellyfish stings something, it often detaches a tentacle and leaves it behind, which can still sting despite not being connected to a body.The species, frequently encountered in Cornish coastal waters, can inflict a lot of pain from its sting, which should be rinsed with warm water for 30 minutes to reduce the pain.Crystal jellyfishView image in fullscreenThe crystal jellyfish is often used in scientific experiments.Photograph: Lisa Werner/AlamyThe nearly transparent and bioluminescent crystal jellyfish can emit light and exhibit a bright green light when exposed to light ranging from blue to ultraviolet. With up to 150 tentacles, this unique jelly is often used in scientific experiments for its bioluminescent properties and proteins, which have revolutionised fields such as cell biology, neuroscience and disease research.Their sting is considered not strong enough to penetrate through human skin and cause harm, but is strong enough to harm and paralyse their prey in the water.Blue jellyfishView image in fullscreenThe blue jellyfish develops its blue-purple bell once mature.Photograph: Nature Photographers Ltd/AlamyThe blue jellyfish, similar in shape to the lion’s mane species, can be colourless when young and develop its blue-purple bell once mature. This species can have up to 800 fine tentacles that resemble a head of hair; the jellyfish uses these tentacles to direct food – including other jellyfish – towards its mouth.The venom from a blue jellyfish sting can cause serious pain, which can last for hours or even days. Although the sting is nonlethal, it can be potentially dangerous for young children, elderly people, and those with allergies such as anaphylaxis.Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeWildlifeexplainersShareReuse this content"

His allegations included that she had stained a mattress with urine, and damaged a robot vacuum cleaner, a sofa, a microwave, a TV and an air conditioner.The woman denied any damage had been done to the apartment. She said she left it in good condition and had only two visitors during the seven weeks she stayed. A close examination of two pictures of the coffee table appears to show differences in the damage, leading the woman to believe they were digitally manipulated or generated by AI. She says the host was retaliating because she ended her tenancy early.Airbnb initially told her “after careful review of the photos”, she would have to reimburse the host a total of £5,314. She appealed against the decision.View image in fullscreenThere were differences between two photographs of the coffee table.“I informed them that I can provide testimony from an eyewitness who was with me during checkout and can attest under oath to the condition in which the property was left: clean, undamaged, and in good order,” she says. “I also clearly demonstrated visual discrepancies in images of the same object (wooden table) provided by the host that show clear signs of fabrication.”She adds: “These inconsistencies are simply not possible in genuine, unedited photographs of the same object. This should have immediately raised red flags and discredited the host’s claims if the evidence had been reviewed with even basic scrutiny, but Airbnb not only failed to identify this obvious manipulation, they entirely ignored my explanations and clear evidence that the material was fabricated.”Five days after Guardian Money raised questions about the case with Airbnb, the woman was told it had accepted her appeal and credited her account with £500. When she then said she was not going to rebook with Airbnb again, the company offered an £854 refund – a fifth of the cost of her booking. She refused to accept this and was refunded the full cost (£4,269) of her booking, and a negative review that the host had placed on her profile was taken down.“My concern is for future customers who may become victims of similar fraudulent claims and do not have the means to push back so much or give into paying out of fear of escalation,” the woman says.“Given the ease with which such images can now be AI-generated and apparently accepted by Airbnb despite investigations, it should not be so easy for a host to get away with forging evidence in this way.”The man who complained about her is listed as a “superhost” on Airbnb, which the site says is someone who is experienced and highly rated. He did not respond to a request for comment.Airbnb said he had been warned for violating its terms and told he would be removed if there was another similar report. The company told him that it could not verify the images he submitted as part of his complaint.Airbnb apologised and said there would be a review into how her case was handled. “We take damage claims seriously – our specialist team reviews all available evidence to reach proportionate outcomes for both parties, and to help ensure a fair approach, decisions can be appealed.”Serpil Hall, the director of economic crime at the management consultants Baringa, said that manipulating images and videos was now “easier than ever”, and software to do so was cheap, widely available and required little skill to use.In one recent case an insurance company found there had been an increase in false claims on vehicles and home repairs using photos that had been manipulated.“Recently, many companies have decided images can’t be taken at face value any more [during disputes], and there is a need for forensic tools and fraud intelligence models to validate them.”Explore more on these topicsAirbnbConsumer affairsRenting propertyPropertyArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Both were granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. She had several jobs in London, including one at the Institute of Mechanical Engineers where she worked as a typist.“I was a very good typist and I loved my job,” she said.View image in fullscreenComfort Olufunmilayo Olawo’s wedding in Islington in December 1966.The couple had two children who were born in London, but when she became pregnant with their third child she decided to return to Nigeria to give birth so that she could get support from her extended family there. She took the older two children with her and planned to return to London with them after the birth. But by the time she was ready to return permanently to London to rejoin her husband, more than two years had passed.Rollout of eVisas ‘could drag 200,000 people into Windrush-style scandal’Read moreAccording to the immigration rules, anyone who has indefinite leave to remain but is out of the UK for more than two years loses their right to remain.The only legal option available to her from that point onwards was to apply for an annual six-month visitor visa every year and commute between her husband in London and her extended family in Nigeria. She abided by these immigration rules scrupulously and did not overstay her visitor visas.Almost all of her family, which includes five children and 10 grandchildren, live in the UK.View image in fullscreenComfort Olufunmilayo Olawo and her daughter June Alawode in their garden in Oldham.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianThe previous government introduced a returning resident visa, for which her lawyer successfully applie, finally offering a legal alternative to the increasingly exhausting annual commute.

Support for them dropped from -10% to -15% while the industrial action was going on.Luke Tryl, the director of More In Common, said: “The biggest shift between the two weeks is people are now more likely to say the government should not do whatever it takes to end the strikes. My previous view was that it didn’t really matter if the public were on side with Streeting against the doctors because the doctors could just bring theNHSto a halt, people would just rather it worked. Even two weeks ago people thought that, but the fact that it has now flipped is interesting and people are more likely to say ‘dig in’.View image in fullscreenThe resident doctors’ picket line at King George hospital in London on Tuesday.Photograph: Lily Shanagher/PA“I do think it’s because Wes Streeting has been out there making the arguments. In focus groups, it seems like his message has landed. People are slightly, for the first time, more likely to say resident doctors are paid too much rather than too little.”However, there are two difficult caveats in the data for Streeting. The first is that most of the public blame the government for the strikes in the first place, with 39% saying it is ministers’ fault, 31% pointing the figure at resident doctors and 11% at hospital management. The second is thatLabourvoters are now the only political grouping who back the striking doctors, with a net 3% in favour of the strikes, down from a net 12% in favour before they started.Labour members tend to be even more sympathetic to strike action than Labour voters, so this group of people who choose the next party leader are not on board with the government’s arguments.And while there are no public rumblings of discontent about Streeting’s approach, some Labour MPs question the wisdom of pitching the industrial dispute as a battle – rather than taking a more emollient tone.“Jeremy Hunt never really recovered from his bruising encounter with the doctors,” says one Labour MP. “It never looks good to be talking about ‘war’ with public servants in a caring profession.”However, Labour sources say there is a huge difference between now and the strikes that Hunt was opposing in 2016 – then the first industrial action taken in more than 40 years, which centred more around shift patterns and contract changes.“The fact that public opinion has shifted so far against resident doctor strikes shows how different the landscape is,” the senior source said. “The truth is that, slowly but surely, people are noticing some of their family and friends are being seen quicker by the NHS. They don’t want to go backwards.“The Tories drove the NHS into the ground. In a large part, the malaise felt by resident doctors is that they’re just sick and tired of how poor working conditions have become over the 15 years of Tory government.“But the BMA’s leadership should recognise how they now have a government that is far different to deal with. Two above-inflation pay rises, the biggest hike in the public sector, work already under way on improving working conditions and so much more we can do if they chose to actually just work with government.”Ultimately, though, the wider mood about the strikes and Streeting’s leadership through the turmoil is likely to depend on how the NHS manages to hold up operationally.NHS sources said the first five-day strike had led to some services being cancelled but many fewer than on previous occasions, with trust leaders suggesting appointments and operations were at about 90-95% of usual activity. Figures for how many doctors turned out on strike were not yet available but sources suggested it had been patchy, and that trusts were “better at managing” the situation as they had practice now from prior strikes.The British Medical Association, the doctors’ union behind the strikes, has said hospitals were opting for unsafe cover rather than cancellation of operations, in a “reckless” approach to the strikes.But if Streeting can oversee minimal disruption in the NHS while doctors are on strike or reach a deal on other financial conditions, then the government could emerge strengthened.And while Labour voters support the doctors’ aims, they also like to see a government demonstrating operational competence and avoiding crisis.Tryl says: “If Labour fails on their mission of reducing waiting lists, that’s what will cut through and would damage Wes. But equally, if he holds firm and wins, it could help the government.“There is a sense that government isn’t in control any more is such a big driver of the ‘broken Britain’ mood, it kind of goes beyond individual services. If Wes can show the government is in control on this, that could end up helping.”Explore more on these topicsWes StreetingNHSHealthIndustrial actionDoctorsKeir StarmerLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

He was released in 2019.He was hoping to get a £3m ransom from the queen. However, he now claims the plot was always supposed to have failed and was an attempt to garner publicity to sell an autobiography.

Ultimately, the crackdown was unsuccessful and Hasina was forced to fleeBangladeshin a helicopter on 5 August last year, as angry protesters marched towards her residence and the military refused to forcefully stop them.View image in fullscreenAnti-government protesters gather outside Bangladesh’s parliament on 5 August 2024 celebrating the resignation of Sheikh Hasina.Photograph: Zabed Hasnain Chowdhury/Sopa Images/Rex/ShutterstockNow, just over a year since he was killed,the trial of Hasinawill begin on 3 August, as she stands accused of being responsible for the death of the 11-year-old and many others over those weeks.After months of evidence gathering, Bangladeshi prosecutors have charged her with crimes against humanity, including charges of order, incitement, complicity, conspiracy, and abetment of murder, torture and other inhuman acts. Her trial will be held before three judges of Bangladesh’s international crimes tribunal (ICT); a court that Hasina set up herself while in power.‘Because of women it became a people’s revolution’: what has changed one year on from Bangladesh’s student uprising?Read moreHasina will not be there. Since last August, she has been in India despite protests by the interim government leading Bangladesh. Multiple extradition requests for Hasina have been ignored.With the possibility she would be given the death penalty if found guilty, few believe Hasina will come back voluntarily. She has refused to be part of the proceedings except to plead not guilty, and has been given a state-appointed defence lawyer as she is being tried in absentia.In the days leading up to the trial, efforts have been made by Hasina and her Awami League party to discredit it and the tribunal, denying the charges and claiming they had received no formal legal notices of them. In an open letter published on Friday, Hasina described the protests that toppled her as a “violent interruption of our hard-fought democracy” and promised to “reclaim the institutions that were unlawfully seized”.Hossain’s father, Abul Khayer, spoke of his anger that Hasina would not be present in court. “I want to see Hasina tried in person,” he said. “She should face the families and answer for what she did. But India won’t give her back. Everyone knows that.”A year since his son was killed, Khayer said his grief had hardened into disillusionment and he expressed doubts that the tribunal would deliver true justice or accountability.View image in fullscreenMuhammad Yunus, the leader of Bangladesh’s interim government.Photograph: Monirul Alam/EPAAfter the toppling of Hasina a wave of optimism gripped Bangladesh, as an interim government led byNobel prize-winner Muhammad Yunuswas brought in with sweeping promises of democratic reform and accountability. But faith in the interim government has faded over the past year as many of the promised reforms have failed to materialise and Yunus has struggled to bring the deteriorating law and order situation and attacks against minorities under control.With the country’s first elections since the fall of Hasina due in February, Khayer feared the trial would become politicised. “Everyone has seen in the past how most often these kinds of cases have been used to gain political scores,” he said. “The trials are dragged for years to serve people’s political ambition.”Still, he insisted the trial should still go forward, if only to document the truth. “I don’t need her to sit in a dock to know what she did. She gave the orders. Everyone knows that. Let the world hear it.”For the many who saw their relatives and friends killed last July, the trial is a vital first step towards justice. While some senior government ministers and police officials were arrested, many in Hasina’s regime fled the country and remain abroad. In an effort to make the trial as transparent as possible, much of it will be live streamed on television, except for moments where sensitive witnesses are testifying.It is also just the beginning. Investigators are still working on bringing Hasina to trial for a ream of other atrocities allegedly committed during her 15 years in power, including enforced disappearances and the killing, torture and mass incarceration of opponents and critics.‘She’s the one who shattered us’: families of slain Bangladesh students wantk to hold Sheikh Hasina to accountRead moreMohammad Tajul Islam, the chief prosecutor of the ICT, said the prosecution and investigation agency of the court had been “working relentlessly” since September to find witnesses and gather evidence to bring Hasina to trial. He described it as a “very challenging task, particularly because destruction of evidence and the involvement of a huge number of perpetrators”.Islam noted that some of those allegedly involved remained in positions of power, often making victims and witnesses reluctant to come forward.He said he was confident that the prosecution had a strong case to prove crimes against humanity were committed by Hasina. Among the key witnesses will be her former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah al-Mamun, who has already pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against the former prime minister.While some have questioned whether Bangladesh’s judicial system – which was systematically eroded under Hasina – was capable of conducting a free and fair trial for Hasina, Islam said reforms had brought the ICT in line with international best practices. “It is critical for accountability and the rule of law, and also for the victims who seek justice,” he said. “Her intended absence from the trial should not shield her from justice.”Mohammad Arafat, who served as a senior minister in Hasina’s government and is also facing charges, called the tribunal a “political show trial”.“The Awami League categorically rejects the politically motivated charges brought against its leadership,” he said. “I urge the international community to recognise this tribunal for what it is: a tool to criminalise political opposition and rewrite lawful governance as criminality.”Mubashar Hasan, a political scientist who was forced into exile after he was abducted and tortured and is now a researcher at Western Sydney University, was among those who said that in an “ideal scenario” Hasina would instead be put on trial at the international criminal court in The Hague.The Yunus-led interim government has alreadybanned Hasina’s Awami League partyfrom taking part in the elections expected early next year, but critics have said this undermines the democratic nature of the polls, given that Awami League is still one of the country’s largest parties.The election is expected to be swept by the Bangladesh Nationalist party, whose leadership suffered years of persecution under Hasina. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, the Islamist party which was banned under Hasina, is also expected to do well, which has raised concerns about the rise of Islamic hardliners undermining the country’s secular foundations.Explore more on these topicsBangladeshSheikh HasinaSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Titles of his videos – generally a recording of him delivering his views direct to camera – include: “Why I Dislike Jews. It’s not complicated”, “Black Crimes Matter: Never Relax” and “Jews and FBI hate you and your free speech”.From Canada to Finland, a US neo-Nazi fight club is rapidly spreading across the globeRead moreTypically the videos attract hundreds of comments from like-minded YouTube users. His channel has seen such remarkable success that it has drawn apparently baseless allegations from other far-right creators that he is a “fed”. On an X account that frequently advertises his videos, his posts include antisemitic comments and in one response to a post about actor Jim Carrey he writes: “All of them deserve rope. I advocate for national socialism though, under which idiots like this would not fare too well.”Despite YouTube’s stated policies against hate speech and content that promotes violence against individuals or groups based on race, religion or other protected characteristics, Booth’s channel appears to be monetized through the YouTube Partner Program. The channel displays ads and Booth has thanked subscribers for their financial support through the platform.YouTube’s community guidelines explicitly prohibit content that “promotes violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization”.A YouTube spokesperson said: “Upon review, we terminated the channel for violating our community guidelines. Content that promotes violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on their ethnicity, nationality, race or religion is not allowed on YouTube.”According to YouTube, another account associated with Booth was terminated, and creators are no longer entitled to earn any revenue if their channel is terminated.The terminations happened after the Guardian reached out to YouTube with questions about Booth’s activities.Also according to YouTube, content that promotes violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on their ethnicity, nationality, race or religion is not allowed on the platform.In the wake of the ban, Booth took to X to say that he would move his content to “alt-tech” platforms such as Odysee.Booth is married to Meghyn “Meg” Booth, the Republican treasurer of Maple Valley Township. Meg Booth has “liked” several posts with extremist themes on Chris Booth’s Facebook account with her personal account. Chris Booth’s Facebook page also features extensive racist propaganda along with iconography often employed by neo-Nazis.The revelations raise questions about the extent to which YouTube, whose parent company Alphabet also owns Google, Waymo and other tech companies, has backslid on monitoring extremism on its platform.Jeff Tischauser, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), said Booth’s operation across YouTube, X and merchandising platforms was a “boilerplate Nazi grift”.“He may be earning money from YouTube, as well as hawking these racist and antisemitic items on his website like cups and T-shirts,” Tischauser added.He said that YouTube is “the premier site that these guys look to in order to expand their following and to make money off of that following”.How we identified BoothThe Guardian retrieved a Coral, Michigan, street address from EU-mandated General Product Safety Regulation compliance information on the Shameless Sperg merchandise page on the merchandising platform Printify. The property at that address is owned by Meg Booth, according to property records. Data brokers indicate that Chris Booth lives at the same address.Sites includingrealtor.comshow exterior views of the house at the property. The property’s color and cladding match those visible in videos published to YouTube on 14 and 15 May.Chris Booth appears to have made some efforts to remove photographs of himself and other potentially identifying information from his own social media accounts and other online spaces. However, he is visible in “shorts”-style videos posted by Meg Booth to Facebook. This video of Chris Booth depicts the same person visible in Shameless Sperg videos.The Guardian emailed both Chris and Meg Booth for comment.In an email, Meg Booth appeared to repudiate her husband’s views.“I am not involved in my husband’s content or political views, and I do not share or support any form of racism, antisemitism, or hate speech,” she wrote, adding: “My values are my own and are grounded in respect, inclusion, and service to the community.”Meg Booth concluded: “As an elected official, I’ve always acted independently, with integrity, and in line with the expectations of my office. I respectfully decline further comment.”Chris Booth did not directly respond, but in the day after the email he took to X to reaffirm his views, including a post in which he wrote: “I’ve come to believe fascists are born, not made. Discovering real fascism in my early thirties was like looking into a mirror and finally realizing why commies have called me a fascist for so long. They spotted it before I could, but then I wholeheartedly embraced it.”Extremist content rife with ‘crass racism’In his videos and on X, Booth explicitly embraces neo-Nazi ideology and promotes antisemitic conspiracy theories.On his Shameless Sperg X account, Booth writes: “I am the Shameless Sperg, I am a National Socialist, and I do sperg rants here,” with a link to his YouTube channel.On the YouTube channel, he writes: “This channel is a collection of sperg rants and commentary on the news & issues of the day, or whatever else is on my mind, from an autistically dissident and NS perspective.”“Sperg”, an abbreviation for Asperger syndrome, is used pejoratively in far-right circles for those whose obsessive and open extremism might put off normal people or draw unwanted attention. “NS” is commonly used as an abbreviation for “national socialist” in far-right circles.His videos almost all contain neo-Nazi perspectives, enunciating conspiratorial antisemitism, anti-Black racism and claims that white people are superior to all other races.In a June video titled “There is no Anti-Semitism without Semitism”, Booth states in relation to interwar Germany: “Extreme sadism and humiliation towards Gentiles is a Jewish tradition … Now, you might begin to understand why, after 14 years of seeing their people tormented by the Jews, millions of Germans organized, gained political power and broke the chains of Jewish tyranny in Germany.”The video continues with Booth arguing that antisemitism is a just response to the behavior of Jews, and sarcastically dismisses the idea that it is “just some ancient mental pathogen in the minds of the goyim, it just springs to life for no reason just to make things harder for the Jews”.In a July video, Booth defended recent attempts to create a whites-only community in Arkansas. He said: “White people are allowed to congregate together without being accompanied by some fucking Black person or some Jew.”In another July video Booth said: “Black people oppress themselves. I don’t do it. I have no interest in it. I, you know, I just want them away from me. You know, I want them away from me, my community, my state, my country. I don’t know. Just, I don’t know, get the fuck away from me.”In a May video supporting Trump’s program of allowing Afrikaner refugees into the country on the basis of a fictional “white genocide” in South Africa, Booth said: “You know, I’m hoping that they don’t completely lose South Africa to the Black plague, but, um, but in any event, uh, things are going to fall apart for them and go shit sideways.”Tischauser, the SPLC analyst, said that the themes of Booth’s videos mix “crass racism, basic historic white power talking points” and “pseudo-academic kind of takes on Black criminality or Black behavior”.Meg Booth, Chris Booth’s wife, was in November elected as the treasurer of Maple Valley Township running as a Republican.Her public social media profile does not feature the kind of extremist messaging that Chris Booth offers on his platform, though she has interacted with posts on his Facebook account, which is also freighted with racist messaging and neo-Nazi imagery.Chris Booth also “liked” posts in which his wife discussed her candidacy.Explore more on these topicsFar right (US)YouTubeAntisemitismRaceMichiganfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But: we don’t want to give up!”The post noted SchwuZ’s integral role in Berlin’s LGBTQ+ scene since it was founded in Kreuzberg in 1977, helping two years later to launch theChristopher Street Day paradeand the queer magazineSiegessäule.“For nearly 50 years, SchwuZ has been more than just a club. It’s a second living room. A place for queer art, community, family, resistance,” it said. “Many of us have found what we were looking for here: a home, our chosen family, and freedom.”SchwuZ, which is short forSchwulenZentrumor gay centre, moved to a much larger space with capacity for 1,000 revellers in fashionable Neukölln in 2013, which may have been the beginning of the end.This year the club has had a deficit each month of €30,000-€60,000 (£26,000-£52,000), with income on a downward slide, the public broadcaster RBB reported.SchwuZ’s managing director, Katja Jäger, said an ailing economy, an ageing core clientele and the creeping crisis in the Berlin club scene had all taken their toll.Surging rents and electricity prices have threatened to put many beloved Berlin hotspots out of business after a shortlived post-Covid revival, in a gloomy phenomenon known asClubsterben(the death of clubs).In May, SchwuZ had to let go of 33 employees – about a third of its staff, many of them long-serving – and cut back on professional drag shows. A crowdfunding campaign collected only €3,000 of a €150,000 goal.The club has now staged a last-ditch bid for supporters to rally behind it “for future queer generations who need a place that uplifts, empowers and makes them visible”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Busche Club, a historic gay and lesbian dance spot, closed last weekend after four decades, blaming rising operation costs. Busche was founded in 1988 in communist East Berlin and developed an image as the“anti-Berghain”– a party hotspot catering for an international crowd.On New Year’s Eve,Watergate, an upmarket riverside institutionand part of the electronic music scene, closed after 22 years, citing a range of challenges including inflation, a growing preference for outdoor music events, high DJ wages and a drop in budget flights to Berlin.The techno club Wilde Renate, which offers open-air and indoor dancing, has announced plans to shut at the end of the year after a protracted struggle with a property magnate over its lease.The planned extension of the A100 motorway poses a further threat to several popular clubs around Ostkreuz railway station, promptingprotests for Berlin’s centre-right government to abandon construction.Emiko Gejic, a spokesperson for the Club Commission lobby group, said: “Clubs are an important part of the city’s DNA … but also an economic factor.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeDance musicLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Combs was found guilty on 2 July of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, with each leaving him facing up to 10 years in prison – but he was acquitted of more serious sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges.“He was essentially, I guess, sort of half-innocent,” Trump remarked to Newsmax host Rob Finnerty. “He was celebrating a victory, but I guess it wasn’t as good of a victory.”Ghislaine Maxwell: could talking about Epstein be her get out of jail free card?Read moreA number of media outlets reported that Trump has been weighing a pardon for Combs, with whom he had partied in public and exchanged mutual declarations of friendship before winning his two presidencies.Trump has built a track record ofpardoningconvicted political supporters in what has been widely seen as a broader rebuke of a justice system that found him guilty of criminally falsifying business records less than six months prior to his victory in the 2024 White House election.Yet Combs evidently complicated matters for himself by having told the Daily Beast in 2017 that he did not “really give a fuck about Trump”. And in 2020, when Trump’s first presidency ended in defeat to Joe Biden, Combs – who is Black – told radio host Charlamagne tha God that “white men like Trump need to be banished”.“The number one priority is to get Trump out of office,” Combs said.Trump seemingly alluded to those comments in his interview on Friday with Newsmax when asked to revisit the concept of pardoning Combs.“When I ran for office, he was very hostile,” Trump said of the Bad Boy Records founder. “It’s hard, you know? We’re human beings. And we don’t like to have things cloud our judgment, right? But when you knew someone and you were fine, and then you run for office, and he made some terrible statements.“So I don’t know … It makes it more difficult to do.”Combs was convicted of flying people around the country, including male sex workers and girlfriends, for sexual encounters. He is tentatively scheduled to be sentenced on 3 October and has asked to be freed from custody on a $50m bond while awaiting that hearing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Halfway through my attempt to play the real-life version of the smash-hit reality BBC reality TV showThe Traitors, I realise something: I may be less charming than I’d hoped.“I don’t trust him,” intones a player to my left, scowling at my face as though she has just found it on the bottom of her shoe.“Yeah, he seems shifty!” exclaims her friend.I try to defuse the tension by smiling winningly.“Look at that smirk. He’s definitely a Traitor.”Oh dear.In retrospect, this should not have come as a surprise. Since The Traitors first burst on to our screens in November 2022, it’s become obvious that it’s not easy to convince people you’re telling the truth while being subjected to death-ray stares.Watching contestants go head to head as either traitors (who lie, scheme and murder fellow contestants by night) or faithfuls (who try to banish traitors so they can share a cash prize with fellow honest players) has united the UK around its TV sets. The show has won Baftas and Emmys, and drawn up to 10 million viewers an episode, and it’s largely down to the sheer unpredictability of what people will do when they’re put in a pressure cooker environment and suspicion is allowed to fester.View image in fullscreenPlayers thrash out their theories at the round table.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIt’s also what made Neil Connolly, the creative director behind The Traitors: Live Experience, decide to replicate the interior of a Scottish castle in Covent Garden inLondonand have players roleplay the TV show in groups of up to 12.“I wanted to make people’s hearts race,” he will tell me on the phone the following day. “That moment when you feel your heart pounding in your chest, I know that I’ve done my job correctly.”Well, as I play the game, his wishes are coming true. Largely because I am a faithful, who is doing a terrible job of convincing anyone.Along with a group of other journalists, I’m sitting in a wood-panelled room containing an impressive replica of the round table around which all the TV show’s fiercest debates take place. Occasionally, our host – a tartan-clad Claudia Winkleman-channelling actor – announces that it is now “night” and instructs us to put on a “blindfold” (more commonly known as “blacked-out ski goggles”). We wait while the Traitors remove theirs and plot who to kill – or secretly recruit. And then, masks removed, fierce debate breaks out.‘The crosser Jeremy Paxman got, the more we giggled’: what it’s like to come last on a TV showRead more“The way you reacted there was a bit ‘Hugh Grant in a romcom’,” declares one player, casting suspicion towards a particularly emotive participant. “Bit strange.”It’s not long before all the tropes of the TV show pop up. People begin to form cliques. The phrase “100% faithful” is repeated time and again. Rather than evicting people based on any form of evidence, players are banished purely due to looking a bit odd. Hugh Grant ends up being evicted – and turns out to be a faithful. Randomness rules.“We had one woman who voted for someone, then said: ‘It’s because you remind me of Miles Jupp from Balamory,’” laughs Connolly. “One guy turned around his slate and said: ‘I’ve voted for you, Tom, because I don’t know how to spell the other person’s name.’”I, however, am determined to learn from everything I’ve seen on the TV show. I refuse to go with the herd. I vote on the basis of evidence, rather than conjecture about facial tics. And I never throw around baseless accusations, lest I kill one of my own. In short: I repeatedly vote for the person next to me, as I’m convinced I heard him removing his goggles during the night-time.As the debates go on, I somehow attract more suspicion. The number of votes against me increases. Luckily, my methodology proves popular and we successfully evict two traitors who were overly noisy when removing their blindfold. Less luckily, a faithful player announces that she’d like to banish me and then is murdered by the traitors.“You killed her!” declares her friend, to the gasps of the room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We solve clues to find numbers hidden around the room, which we then put in the correct order by communicating with “the dead” – the players who have either been banished or murdered, and are now watching us on TV from a nearby room. Unlike the TV show, in which these tasks earn contestants money for the prize pot, we get points for our total on the daily leaderboard.As we go back into another debate, it turns out that my dogged voting for the same player is paying off. Enough other people have become suspicious, and he is evicted.“What a relief,” he announces before he leaves the room. “I was a traitor.”The best TV of 2025 in the UK so farRead moreSuddenly, people are looking at me differently. For the rest of the session, not a single player votes for me, until our host announces: “It is now time for the end game!”Dramatic music swells and we’re told to press a button. We can vote either to end the game if we believe everyone to be faithful or to continue banishing if we don’t. Over three stressful rounds, we’re whittled down from six players to three. The game ends, and we have to declare. Are we all faithful? In which case we all win. Or is there a traitor among us? In which case only they are victorious.I declare first. Then player number two proves to be on the side of good as well. And, finally, the last player announces: “I’m a faithful.” We won – and I’m in shock. Surely it doesn’t normally go this smoothly?“Oh no,” laughs Connolly. “At the end of one game, a player had to tell his fiancee he was a traitor. Before he even finished speaking, she had ripped off her engagement ring and thrown it on the floor.”Wow. Thank god I’m 100% faithful.The Traitors: Live Experienceis in Covent Garden, London.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe TraitorsLondonEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’re very close without being romantically interested in each other, and she has a habit of meddling in his relationships. Hmmm. We’re accustomed to onscreen chemistry of the explosive kind, which is generally used to exploit a heteronormative set-up. We see a man and woman getting along, and can’t help but wonder when they will burst into flames.Platonic(Apple TV+, from Wednesday), which starsSeth RogenandRose Byrneand returns for a second series, is flame-retardant. Will and the married Sylvia do not pine for or want to roll around on each other, but they do rely on, delight in, irritate and deeply understand each other. It’s a worthy addition to what we might call the Ephroniverse – the slim canon of stories about whether straight women and men can be friends. As their titles suggest, Platonic comes to a different conclusion thanWhen Harry Met Sally. It’s the correct conclusion – so why is the question still interesting?Platonic digs into situations we’re more used to seeing in WhatsApp group chats. Sylvia is horrified that Will’s male friendships are more ribald than theirs is. Will realises he has incompatible personalities when he’s with his fiancee and oldest friend, so tries to avoid socialising with them together. Can a man and woman stay friends if his fiancee does not like her? Where do his allegiances lie? While these dilemmas could arise within any friendship, the gendered aspect has a specific thorniness.Despite the title, this is no philosophical treatise. It’s a comedy, occasionally a brilliant one. Rogen made his name in stoner-bro buddy-hang movies, but has elevated himself since. Watching him, I’m mostly wondering: which Muppet am I thinking of? Cookie Monster? Grover? Fozzie Bear? He’s actually a comic straight man, albeit one in whom silliness gleams. Take his pronunciation of Veuve Clicquot, which in Rogen’s mouth delightfully becomes “Voove.” (He’s trying to replace all the bubbly at his engagement party, after a friend of his misplaces an LSD-laced flute. “You’re saying this is a champagne problem?” smirks the shop assistant.)Byrne has proved equally funny, usually playing against her Audrey Hepburn looks. She’s nimble, intelligent, good with detail, able to play big or bone dry as required. She’s at her best when squashing discomfort. In the first episode of the new series, the engaged Will admits he has a crush on a young sandwich-maker. It’s a typical Platonic scenario, pitting Sylvia’s friendship obligations against her feminine solidarity. Byrne squirms as a reluctant wingwoman, yet manages to steer Will wisely, without preaching. “The thing about that girl in there that you have to remember is … she has a Deadpool tattoo. It’s terrible.”Platonic is a comforting watch – low-stakes but precisely observed and full of mischievous turns. The best of its cameos may be Saturday Night Live alumnus Beck Bennett as former party animal Wildcard, friend to both Sylvia and Will. (A laugh-out-loud scene in which he and Will discussSydney Sweeneyhas, against all odds, a kind of magical innocence.) Sylvia’s Jeopardy-loving husband and their sardonic children make welcome returns, alongside her acerbic mom-friend Katie, played by Carla Gallo.The show’s writing is equally weighted to its male and female stars, and it soars on their shared scenes, their bickering zephyrs. When all is said and done, it is a love story. TV has, in the past, contributed to a culturally threadbare understanding of that word. We should welcome this widening lens, a better aspect ratio to understand ourselves.If Platonic had solely been a Larry David-esque examination of friendship’s minutiae, it would have been perfect. There is a higher stakes romantic storyline running through that feels more generic, and may struggle to sustain 10 episodes of interest. Friendship, though, is something we can watch indefinitely, along with peppery dialogue, relatable dilemmas and absurd scenarios. It’s also a healthy reminder that chemistry doesn’t only mean combustible. More often, it’s about fizzing merrily along.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherRose ByrneSeth RogenTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inside the high-stakes, secretive world of competitive spreadsheetingNew documentary Spreadsheet Champions follows six competitors as they head to the Microsoft Office Specialist world championship in FloridaGiselle Au-Nhien NguyenFri 1 Aug 2025 20.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 10.27 EDTShareSix years ago, Melbourne-based film-maker Kristina Kraskov read an article about an internationalMicrosoftExcel competition and had two thoughts. The first: “What the hell, that can’t be real.” The second: “There’s got to be a film about this – I want to watch it so badly.”There wasn’t a film about competitive spreadsheeting, so Kraskov decided to make it herself. The subject appealed to the director, whose work captures “different inner worlds that are a bit unusual on the outside”, including a short film titled Party in the Back, about a mullet festival.Spreadsheet Champions, which will screen at the Melbourne international film festival, follows six young competitors from around the world as they head to Florida for the 2023Microsoft Office Specialist world championshipto showcase their skills. It might sound silly, but Excel is an incredibly sophisticated application – according to the documentary, the average person uses only 10-15% of its capabilities, but would-be competitors are required to understand closer to 70% of what it can do.The competition is built and run by Certiport, a performance-based examination provider, and officially endorsed by Microsoft. It’s a two-parter: the first half tests proficiency in formulas, functions and features through a series of complex questions, graded on both accuracy and speed. The second section is a more creative application of this knowledge – as Kraskov puts it, “understanding the story of the data, or the soul of what it is actually telling you”.View image in fullscreen‘It helped me a lot’ … Carmina, the teenage competitor from Guatemala, in Spreadsheet Champions.Photograph: Supplied by Melbourne international film festivalThe championship has run since 2002 and is open to students between the ages of 13 and 22. Each competitor first has to qualify as the best in their home country. For such an esoteric endeavour, the stakes are oddly high – the MOS championship only allows competitors to enter once in their lives.“In most sporting competitions, you have your main players that come back every year and your very set rivalries – but for this competition, they can only compete once, so everyone that’s coming through can never come back,” Kraskov says.“They qualify in their home countries at vastly different times around the world, so it made it really challenging for us – but as soon as anyone qualified in a country that we could go to, we would talk to them on Zoom, and work our way down from there.”The six competitors in Spreadsheet Champions are Alkimini, 20, from Greece; Braydon, 16, from Australia; Carmina, 16, from Guatemala; De La Paix, 19, from Cameroon (who doesn’t have a laptop or wifi, so had to study at school); Mason, 15, from the US; and Nam, 21, from Vietnam. Each contestant has personality quirks which shine through in the film – from the camera-shy and stereotypically “nerdy” to the charismatic and boisterous. “Our intention is really about how amazing this competition is – we’re not here to make fun of or disparage anyone,” Kraskov says.View image in fullscreenDe La Paix, right, from Cameroon, doesn’t have a laptop or wifi, so had to prepare for the competition at school.Photograph: Supplied by Melbourne international film festivalKraskov and the film’s producer, Anna Charalambous, spent about a week with each competitor in their home country, observing their day-to-day lives, from home to school, and spending time with their family and friends.“People reveal themselves a lot if you just pay attention to how they live their lives,” Kraskov says. “Teenagers are not quite fully formed adults yet, so they don’t really connect things about themselves or their personalities – they just live their lives. The parents were so insightful and knowledgable about their kids – it gave us a lot of information about how they would potentially thrive or struggle, and who they really were.”Many of the contest’s specifics are shrouded in secrecy, which posed another challenge for the film-makers. The competition is overseen by a man named – in a wonderful example of nominative determinism – Bing.“It’s so high-level security,” Kraskov says. “Bing eventually trusted us and gave us questions that would be retired … At the end of the day, he has to deliver a hardcore, secure, world-expert level exam the next year, and our priority is to show the complexity of what it is and what they’re doing.”Participating in the MOS Championship can set these kids up for adult life. Carmina, the Guatemalan competitor, is now 18 and studying mechatronics engineering at university. In the film, she is shown as a bubbly, bright teenager who loves One Direction (she still does) and excels at, well, Excel.‘You didn’t just succeed, you Exceled’: Sydney man dubbed the ‘Annihilator’ wins spreadsheet world championshipRead moreWatching the documentary transported Carmina back to the competition and her younger self – and made her realise what she took from the experience. “I knew the results already, but watching it again [I felt] a little bit of suspense,” she says. “I tend to doubt a little bit of myself and with that experience [of competing] I learned to just go into it and try things out … It helped me a lot.”Spreadsheet Champions had its world premiere at SXSW in Texas earlier this year and five of the six students will be in Melbourne to attend Miff. Kraskov is proud to shine a light on them – everyday people doing something a little different with their lives.“Celebrities, musicians and models get plenty of attention,” she says. “But people that dedicate their lives to things that a lot of people don’t care about – I find that so much more fascinating.”Spreadsheet Champions airs at the Melbourne international film festival from 10-24 August;see here for all dates and locations.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsMicrosoftComputingMelbourne international film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Lim doesn’t just shift tickets. His huge social media following ensures waves of global attention for everything he does or that is written about him.This Prom will achieve this for an unusual reason. Soon after Lim began Rachmaninov’s fourth piano concerto, a distant alarm started ringing in the Albert Hall. Red lights flashed high up. Yamada and Lim pressed on. At the end of the movement, Yamada left the podium and disappeared off-stage, leaving the musicians and audience uncertain. After about five minutes, though it felt longer, the red lights stopped, the alarm was silenced and Yamada returned, to applause and relief all round.By all accounts, Lim was laid-back about it afterwards. I bet the BBC was less relaxed. But it did not seem to affect the pianist himself, who often showed how naturally he can conjure a willing audience into silence with his range and touch. Lim’s command of sound is wide, as his Korngold encore would also prove, but Rachmaninov’s fourth is not an easy work to project, especially in a vast hall. It veers, sometimes vertiginously, between weighty and whispering, and there are hints of composers like Ravel. The playing was wonderful, but a bit more spaciousness in the interpretation would have made it even better.View image in fullscreenConductor Kazuki Yamada.Photograph: Mark Allan/BBCAt the start, Yamada conducted a glisteningly clear account of John Adams’s propulsive foxtrot The Chairman Dances, which showcased the excellence of the CBSO’s wind and percussion sections. Then, after the interval, and in an already notably less crowded hall than before, cameBerio’s Sinfonia, with its swirling and microscopically fragmentary mix of styles and cultures, written amid the reckless intensities of 1968.Berio’s score for orchestra and voices, some electronically enhanced, could once feel like an obsequy for a dying western culture, with its homage to Mahler, and its allusions to Martin Luther King and absurdist theatre. Yamada and his musicians captured the piece’s hauntingly chaotic sound world and its troubled intensity. But, like so much else, Sinfonia has become a period piece now. It reconnects with an era in music that no longer exists, when composers and audiences were far more open to the disruptive and the new than they are now. The steady trickle of some remaining members of the audience towards the exits throughout the performance felt like testimony to that.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.ThePromscontinue until 13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsClassical musicProms 2025Promslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The setting is the delayed Euro 2020 tournament, the one in which Gareth Southgate’s England beat ancient rivals Germany, then Ukraine and Denmark before facing Italy at Wembley.For an obsessive fan such as Billy Kinley, someone who lives for football and its attendant culture of booze and thuggery, it is an excitement almost too great to bear. That is as close a reason as he can come up with for pulling down his shorts and shoving a flare between his bum cheeks on match day. It is an act of exuberance that turns him into a viral sensation.View image in fullscreenCommunication breakdown … Alex Hill in Why I Stuck a Flare Up My Arse for England.Photograph: Rah PetherbridgeIt also gives him cause to wonder how his life has reached such a place, especially now he has been abandoned by his childhood pal Adam and dumped by his previously tolerant girlfriend. If he knew the phrase toxic masculinity, he would have to use it; a once sweet-natured boy, he has traded his old stability for the camaraderie of the terraces and the excesses of drugs and violence. The flare is his way of belonging.Under the direction of Sean Turner, Hill plays Billy with gusto. In the working-class tradition of Steven Berkoff and John Godber, he gives a have-your-cake-and-eat-it performance that revels in macho exuberance even while it delivers a sobering message about communication breakdown.The details of that breakdown are slipped in teasingly. It feels like there is more to be said about Adam’s fate and the degree to which Billy should be held accountable for failing to listen to his friend. It is a boisterous play about boisterousness, one that will keep knocking in the goals for audiences, even if it says more about the thrill of the hooligan lifestyle than the emotional inarticulacy behind it.At Underbelly Bristo Square, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025ComedyEdinburgh festivalTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Eight years ago this month, a Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, resulted in three deaths and at least 19 serious injuries.If it did not attract the same level of global attention as the mob attack on the US Capitol three-and-a-half years later, it raised a similar red flag about the rise of extremist ideology in the US and beyond.Priyanka Shetty was an acting student at the University of Virginia at the time of the clash between protesters and counter-protesters and set about recording the community’s responses. She spoke to fellow citizens, trawled far right websites, found contemporary news reports and, more recently, got hold of court transcripts from the prosecution of the white-supremacist conspirators.In a polished and confident performance, directed by Yury Urnov for Richard Jordan and Yellow Raincoat productions, she snaps quickly from voice to voice to create a social collage: those who saw trouble coming, those blind-sided by it and those defiant in their racist tribalism. Lawyers talk about first amendment rights, officials talk about the joy of life in a friendly college town and witnesses comment on theindifference of police officersas violence erupted.The tapestry of perspectives makes Charlottesville not just an obvious condemnation of loathsome beliefs, but a richer vision of how such disruption tears at the social fabric.Going a step further, the Indian-born Shetty weaves in her own experience of discrimination: a joke in class about her appearance; failing to get a part in either of the college productions; her complaints brushed aside by a dismissive teacher.

James Graham’s musical, premiering at the Edinburgh international festival, is at least as epic, even if it bites off more than it can possibly chew.It takes us back to the real-life drama of the Royal Bank of Scotland and the government bailout after its collapse. Fred Goodwin was CEO and the bank had such a meteoric rise under his tenure that it claimed to be the largest in the world.Graham works hard to make the banking part of the story snappy – and succeeds. Directed by Andrew Panton, it is pacey even if long, serious but funny, all set to song and kinetic projections across towers on Anna Fleischle’s set which might be inflated columns of the share index.There is musical comedy even as the singing chorus presides over Goodwin’s fall; darker satire as banking culture is captured, complete with after-hours karaoke nights (Franz Ferdinand’s Take Me Out, Kylie Minogue’s Can’t Get You Out of My Head etc).This is a moment in economic history when bankers such as Goodwin (Sandy Grierson) become emperors, trumping the power of parliament, so it seems. Grierson plays a fascinatingly bland tyrant, looking every bit the accountant he is by training. But like his office lover, Rita (Hannah Donaldson), says, he is a lion lying in the grass. When he reveals himself as such, he is ruthless indeed: a white-collar Scarface, high on power.Graham gives Goodwin’s tale the ancient Greek treatment at times, with ghosts, hallucinatory hissing characters and the emergence of what seems like an underworld beneath the cracked reality of banking life. From this, amid rumbles and puffs of smoke, Brian Cox emerges as the spectre of moral philosopher and founder of free market economics, Adam Smith.He is entertaining rather than fearful and seems knowingly to be Brian Cox the actor playing Smith the character. In between discussions on Smith’s “invisible hand” the tone flips back into a comical vein. Smith admires Goodwin’s scented candles and develops a penchant for John Lewis. There is a satirical diversion into A Christmas Carol territory, with a snowy night-time trip across Edinburgh, that serves no greater purpose. It is entertaining nonetheless, and Cox amuses as Smith.Some of the antithetical elements do clash and dilute meaning. Is this a play about hubris, you wonder, or a satire of it – or is it attempting to grapple with the nature of capitalism itself rather than just Goodwin’s legacy? Its scope is so broad, its characterisation broad-brush too and there is not enough drama to Goodwin’s actual downfall. Some balls are dropped, such as Goodwin and Rita’s relationship – its trajectory all but abandoned after one comical sex scene. Yet Graham’s marshalling of material is impressive overall, and it is a miracle that the flips from comedy to Gothicism and back do not jar.Graham has, as always, done his homework on the subject, meticulously so. Co-produced by Dundee Rep theatre, and set in Edinburgh, there is knowing local humour (Leith is labelled an underworld, New Town is heaven, for example). Scottish statesmen stand at the centre of No 10 politics: Alistair Darling (Sandy Batchelor) is amusingly drawn. Gordon Brown (Andy Clark) becomes something of an ethical touchstone, the hero of the piece here even though, as Goodwin points out, it was Brown who gave him the freedom to take RBS down the disastrous road that he did. Everyone is flatly drawn, though that does not impede the enjoyment.There are explanations of Adam Smith’s philosophies, the sub-prime mortgage crisis and capitalism itself, but the fourth wall is never pierced. Characters often face the audience while delivering a mini treatise, and it is miraculous too that this does not seem like heavy-handed exposition.It becomes clear that Goodwin follows the word of Smith’s ideas but not the spirit. This is what leads him to his amoral drive towards acquisition. We hear how he only read one of Smith’s books – not the one that spoke of the ethics of the free market. It is a funny turn in the narrative, but too flip to be convincing.Goodwin’s fall never really comes either, dramatically. He stares out at the audience defiantly, even as the lights go down. There is no remorse, no learning. It’s chilling but also anti-climatic.Yet still sparky and exuberant as Graham’s plays always are, with heaps of knowledge, humour and sharp lines. It sprawls, turns eccentric corners and defies expectations. Its ambition, and epic scope, is simultaneously a strength and weakness.At Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, until 9 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalMusicalsTheatreComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

I got into it around 2012, when I was 23, and I’ve been playing ever since. It’s a game of endless possibility. You can do anything in it. You can build your own houses, machines, businesses, and put your own personality on to it. It’s an easy escape and can become quite addictive. It’s just so much more colourful, fun and cosy than the real world.But when you play this game for a decade you start to learn this incredible lesson about patience. It’s essentially a game where you build your world one block at a time. In the moment it’s this lovely dopamine-drip exercise, but recently it’s started to change my perspective on the world. You look back at what you’ve created and begin to appreciate all the work you’ve put in. I know that might sound silly. It’s just a game about blocks. But until you zoom out with time and perspective you don’t appreciate it for what it is.I just walk around and look at the water and the fish and the trees in these worlds that I’ve builtSince January, I’ve changed my approach to the game. We’d just shot my sitcom, Transaction, in the winter and it was a wonderful experience. But then Trump’s inauguration happened halfway through and all this terrible messaging for transgender people came with it. It all got too much. Everything became about patching over that pain with personal achievement. And that’s what Minecraft is on one level. You build and you build and you don’t think about anything. But that’s not a sustainable way to live. To stop and take a break and celebrate the things you have achieved – rather than trying to escape your worry by achieving more – is something I started to adopt.So I’ve basically been playing Minecraft but not really building anything for the last six months. I just walk around and look at the water and the fish and the trees in these beautiful worlds that I’ve built. It’s got this strange sense of hygge about it. It’s a game where you can go hell for leather, or you can relax and turn relaxation into a craft. It’s a cosy game and I didn’t notice that until I needed a cosy place to escape to. The little journeys you take can be amazing. You can walk past a tree and even though it essentially stays the same over the years, you remember how that tree felt five years ago. There was a wolf here back then. It’s a living memory palace that also happens to be beautifully rendered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There’s no opacity. No light bouncing off the water. You can just see through it and you know it’s water and you get that same refreshing feeling. There’s also a night and day cycle but it’s expedited. So every five minutes the moon comes up, the sun comes down. And at night-time things get quite scary in the game. You have to go inside or the monsters will get you. There’s a primeval connection – like a rewilding in a virtual world. I don’t know if it’s the healthiest way to live but it works for now.When the world feels like it is moving incredibly fast, it’s so helpful to think that it’s all just a conglomeration of thousands and thousands of steps, thousands of tiny blocks being placed or moved. It’s easy to forget that and think we’ve hit some sort of singularity where things have changed incredibly fast. That’s not the case. It’s just a series of tiny steps that are still happening. Minecraft constantly reminds me that we’re in a state of movement. There’s no big decision to be made now. We can go back and change things. We can take it down. Put it back together again. Take those components and change it into something new.Jordan’s show, Is That a C*ck in Your Pocket, or Are You Just Here to Kill Me?, is at Assembly Square George Garden, Edinburgh,to 24 August.Share your experienceShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

One veteran promoter walks us through ​the thrills, threats and total meltdowns​ and what ​t​o do when it all goes wrongGwilym MumfordSat 2 Aug 2025 02.01 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 02.03 EDTShareWe’re in the thick of festival season in the UK, where every weekend seems to host a dizzying array of musical mega-events. The likes of Glastonbury, Download, TRNSMT, Wireless and others may already be in the rear-view, but there are still plenty more to come across all manner of genres: Camp Bestival (happening this very weekend), Creamfields,Green Man, All Points East, Reading and Leeds, End of the Road and so many others, across farms, city parks, country estates and the odd mid-Wales mountain range.For the people who run these festivals, months or even a full years-worth of work will have gone into readying for a single, crucial long weekend. The stakes are high: whether things go off without a hitch or not will, in some cases, determine that festival’s future. And boy, are there a lot of potential hitches: electricity, sanitation, ticketing, food and drink, security, and the fragile egos of famous musicians, to name but a few. “The scary thing about festivals is, if you take away one small element, the whole thing collapses,” says promoter James Scarlett.James should know. He books and organises not one but two annual festivals:2000Trees, a 15,000-capacity alternative, punk and indie festival in Cheltenham, which last month completed its 17th edition with headline appearances from emo veterans Alexisonfire and Taking Back Sunday, along with Keir Starmer faves Kneecap; andArcTangent, which specialises in metal, math rock, prog, post-rock and general experimental music, and later this month (13-16 Aug) will lure 5,000 punters to a farm near Bristol to hear bands as varied as post-rock titansGodspeed You! Black Emperor, prog-metallers Tesseract, lugubrious indie dance veteransArab Strapand a duo called Clown Core who play avant garde jazz fusion froma portable loo.In addition, James is also the co-host – along with Gavin McInally, who runs Manchester extreme metal festival Damnation – of2 Promoters 1 Pod, a weekly, unvarnished, slightly sweary look at how a festival comes together from the booking of bands to the construction of the site. If you have even the most cursory interest in how festivals work, it’s a fascinating listen.All of which makes James the person you’d call for in case of something going badly awry on site. So in this week’s Guide we’ve decided to test his firefighting skills, by asking him to solve a series of festival disasters, including some ripped from recent headlines. Read on for his thoughts on awol headliners, heatwaves and herds of marauding deer.View image in fullscreenHot and loving it … the crowd enjoy Leprous at Arctangent.Photograph: Joe SinghFestival disaster #1|Your headlining band are playing a mind-blowing set but are overrunning. You’ve already reached the curfew time your festival has agreed with the local council and the band still haven’t played their biggest song yet. What do you do?“I have, occasionally in the past, let bands breach curfew. We got caught once doing it at ArcTangent. A council member was driving home from another event and just thought they’d stop outside the farm. He heard the music stop at 11pm … and then start again at three minutes past! We received a slap on the wrist that time, and have a good relationship with the council as our crowds are never any hassle – but you can lose your licence over breaking curfew, and then the whole festival is gone. So I think normally the answer is the curfew is the curfew. Still, If you’ve got a headliner who, say, have 45 minutes of technical difficulties, I think there might be an argument to let them break the licence just in order to keep the crowd happy, you don’t want an angry 15,000 people who didn’t get the headliner that they wanted. There’s a health and safety argument for breaking your curfew if that happens.”Festival disaster #2|A heatwave has descended on the festival site.You’ve not been told to shut it down, but temperatures are reaching the mid-to-high 30s. What do you do?“This year we had 53 cases of heatstroke at 2000Trees on the Wednesday of the festival, when people had only just arrived. It’s pretty impressive that people have come straight in and gone: bang, heatstroke! You have to have a really good first aid tent. We cleaned the local depot out of saline drips for ours, because so many people were coming in extremely dehydrated. In fact one drummer from a band, Future of the Left, had to go to the tent for severe dehydration and heatstroke. He’s a very energetic drummer and in those tents the heat rises, you’re higher than the crowd, and you’re properly going for it – not really a working environment you want to be in! Still, we’ve clocked up mid-30s temperatures at 2000Trees at least twice and once at ArcTangent, and you can still run an event in that. It’s about communication with your audience: drink water, wear a hat, wear sunscreen, try to find some shade.”Festival disaster #3|An Icelandic volcanic ash cloud leaves the headliner you’ve booked stranded in mainland Europe with no way of making it to the festival in time. What do you do?“If a headliner drops out, you’re in trouble. You’ve just got to be honest with your audience that the band aren’t gonna be there. And all you can really do is bump whoever was second from top up a slot, and everyone moves up. We go into each festival with a long backup list of bands that are either local or already on site as punters. So if we get a dropout, we can usually fill the gap at short notice. You can always guarantee that someone will miss a train, miss a flight, get stuck in traffic or just get confused about what day they’re playing … which is quite frustrating if you spend all year booking a lineup!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What do you do?“What the UK prime minister says about Kneecap is of little interest to me to be honest. I’m not being bullied. We were having ex-MPs and current MPs writing to 2000Trees, like they have a say in what we do. We’re a business, it’s not up to them. I think it was a help that a few other festivals have stuck to their guns on keeping Kneecap on the bill: Glastonbury and Green Man for example. It does give you a little bit of solidarity. If everyone had folded on it and we were the last ones, I guess I would have felt more pressure. I don’t think we would have caved until such time as it was a risk to the business over it. And in the end there was no risk. Kneecap were good as gold at 2000Trees – they did a brilliant, amazing headline set, one of the best we’ve ever had at the festival.”Festival disaster #5|A fire breaks out on site just days before the festival begins, destroying your main stage,Tomorrowland-style. What do you do?“If you don’t have the main stage for your festival you’re probably going to have to cancel because there’s not enough space for everyone across the other stages. So you’d be on the phone to every stage and marquee company across the country trying to find a replacement. The problem is, with the massive explosion in the festival industry in recent times, stages and marquees are very hard to come by. It’s likely to be squeaky bum time. In the case of Tomorrowland, amazingly, they borrowed Metallica’s stage. Bands like ACDC and Metallica tend to tour with two rigs, so they’ll be playing one night on a stage with a lighting and sound rig. And ahead of them, in the next city, there’ll be another team building their stage for the next show. When that show’s finished, they tear that rig down and move on to the next place. Which is crackers really – it’s hard to imagine the scale of that.”Festival disaster #6|A herd of deer has descended on the festival, trampling over tents and chomping on the merch stall. What do you do?“Well, we had pigs and swans invading our VIP campsite at 2000Trees this year! The pigs had broken out of a nearby farm. There’s no gentle way of getting a pig out of a campsite, really, you have to manhandle them. Our production team were chasing them around – it was quite a comic scene. For the swans we rang up the RSPB – 999 for birds – and they advised us to not do anything, and eventually they’d take off, which they did. Deer would be more difficult. You can’t go manhandling deer, particularly stags with their antlers. We have 140 pages of risk assessments, covering every risk you could ever imagine … but pigs in the camp was not on that list!”If you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterGlastonbury festivalGreen MannewslettersShareReuse this content"

Hot days spent camping with friends, impromptu picnics in the park, afternoons watching the tennis, reading in the garden with Test Match Special on in the background.Foodhas had to fit around summer life and, of all the meals, this has been one of the best. It has summer etched into the heart of it in that it’s fresh, flavourful and good for feeding a crowd. It’s a (very) wild take on Laotian crispy rice salad and is abundant with herbs, garden vegetables and, crucially, there’s barely any “cooking” involved at all.Summer crispy rice salad with tofu, lime and herbsIf you want to get ahead, cook the rice earlier or even the day before, and refrigerate. Not all vegan fish sauces are equal: Thai Taste makesa good one.Prep15 minCook1 hrServes4, or 6 as a side350g jasmine rice, or 1kg leftover cooked rice5 tbsp rapeseed oil280g extra-firm tofu, drained2-3 red bird’s eye chillies, to taste, stalks discarded, flesh finely sliced7½ tbsp vegan fish sauce7½ tbsp lime juice(from 4-5 limes)1½ tbsp light muscovado sugar1 large cucumber(300g), halved lengthways, seeds scooped out and flesh cut into julienne strips3 round shallots, peeled, halved and cut into very thin half-moons300g cherry tomatoes, halved40g coriander, roughly chopped40g mint, leaves picked50g roasted salted peanuts, choppedIf you’re cooking the rice from scratch, put it in a sieve and rinse under the cold tap until the water runs clear. Tip the rice into a pan, add 600ml just-boiled water and bring back to a boil. Cover, turn down the heat to a whisper and leave to cook for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the rice to steam, still with the lid on, for another five minutes. Spread the rice on your largest oven tray and leave to cool completely.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Stir three tablespoons of oil through the cooled rice, then bake, turning occasionally, for 45 minutes, until golden and crisp at the edges.Put the drained tofu on a board and crumble it with your fingers (or use the back of a knife to break it up). Tip on to a second oven tray, drizzle over the remaining two tablespoons of oil and bake for the last 20 minutes of the rice cooking time.Take out the rice and tofu trays and leave to cool slightly. In a bowl, whisk the chilli, fish sauce, lime juice and sugar until the sugar dissolves.In a large bowl, combine the cucumber, shallot, tomatoes, herbs, tofu and peanuts, add the crisp rice, then pour the dressing over the top. Toss gently to coat everything evenly, then serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegan food and drinkSaladRiceVegetarian food and drinkSummer food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Naomi Larsson PiñedaSat 2 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTShareAnastasia, 31There was an occasion when we had sex eight times in one day – we still call it our dirty weekendRicky and I have been together for 12 years and married for three. I still think about the first time we had sex – it was incredible. I remember thinking: how is this our first time? Because in my experience first times had always been a bit awkward.It was so instantly fun and pleasurable, and felt very safe straight away. Ricky seemed so confident, and I thought: this guy must really know what he’s doing. It was only later that I found out he hadn’t slept with many people at all.I’d known him for less than a week, but it was some of the best sex I’d ever had. I don’t think there is a correlation between penis size and sexual prowess, but Ricky has got a really nice penis. He went down on me that first time, which was rare for me.Sometimes I think: should we be having more sex? But that pressure is more societal than anythingThere was an occasion when we had sex eight times in one day – we still call it our dirty weekend. Now we sometimes have sex once in eight days – but I’m still just as happy and satisfied. When you meet someone new it’s crazy and exciting, and then you just become really comfortable together. I have not once thought: I wish we were having more sex. Sometimes I have wondered:shouldwe be having more sex? But that pressure is societal more than anything.We have realised that although we don’t have sex that often now – maybe once a fortnight – when we do, we really do it.Sexwill last an hour and it is very active. In that moment, neither of us is thinking about anything else. We are very connected. We have quite a set routine now, but it works for us.I need some emotional connection before having sex, even if it’s just watching TV together. I like to have a shower and be prepped, whereas Ricky is ready to go at any time. We are both so busy that, despite living together, we can go a few days without even having time to chat about our day. So, for me, it is important to prioritise that kind of intimacy before sex.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I was a late bloomer and didn’t have sex until I was at university, but I thought about it so much. They say that if you want something, the worst way to get it is to want it too badly, and that was me when it came to losing my virginity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’m pretty sure the girl who I lost my virginity to didn’t know I was a virgin. And then suddenly there was this person who I was falling in love with, and it felt very mature. It was fantastic to have the person who was my first consistent sexual partner then become my permanent partner. I was not only falling in love with Anastasia, I was falling in love with sex as well. I’ve got so used to having sex with someone who I absolutely love.Though I’m very content with the amount of sex we’re having, I think we would be happier having moreWhen we got together she was so complimentary about the first night we had sex because I made her come and I went down on her, and it was generally a really good time.Even after 12 years, when we have sex we never half-ass it. It always feels really good. You fall into the habit of knowing one another and knowing what the other likes and dislikes.I do feel as if I can be slightly impatient, as Anastasia really likes the scene to be set before we have sex. In fact, sometimes if we haven’t laid the groundwork enough, we can start and then just fall out of sync.Though I’m very content with the amount of sex we’re having, I think we would be happier having more. Often she’ll suggest it to me and I’ll be like: “Yeah, OK.” Then, within two seconds, I’m like: “This is the best. Why don’t I do this every single day? How do I distract myself so successfully that I don’t want to do this twice a day?”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, results day is 14 August, while in Scotland it is this coming Tuesday (5 August).For many, the most-important feature will be the size of the interest-free overdraft on offerAt this time of year, high street banks and building societies dangle various tempting goodies in front of young people, knowing full well that some will stay on as customers for years – or even decades – after they have finished their studies and entered the world of work.However, for many, the most-important feature will be the size of the interest-free overdraft on offer.You are not required to have a student bank account – you could opt for a standard current account. However, those aimed at university-goers typically offer features you cannot get elsewhere.“Students may be enticed by the free perks, but it is essential they compare the whole bundle alongside the 0% overdraft in the first instance,” says Rachel Springall, a finance expert at the websiteMoneyfactscompare.co.uk.Interestingly, this year Martin Lewis’sMoneySavingExpert.comand theSave the Studentwebsite have chosen the same providers when it comes to their top four student accounts: Santander, NatWest and its Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) brand, and Nationwide.Once again, NatWest and RBS have been highlighted as the banks offering the most generous interest-free overdraft deals – up to £3,250 in the third year of study. That’s assuming you are eligible for that amount.Santander is not as generous but it scores highly. That is partly because, with most banks, the quoted overdraft amounts are “up to” and may only be available in your final year at university or only to those with a decent credit rating, whereas with Santander you are guaranteed the full £1,500 in years one to three, provided you meet the basic criteria, explains the Save the Student money advice website. Santander’s free four-year young person’s railcard is also a big draw.Here we look at the perks and interest-free overdrafts on offer from the main players.NatWest and RBSView image in fullscreenNatWest and RBS have been highlighted as the banks offering the most generous interest-free overdraft deals.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThe freebies:£85 cashback (although down from £100 last year) and a free tastecard, valid for four years and offering two-for-one meals out and other dining discounts. NatWest and RBS say the tastecard is worth £79.99 a year, although at the time of writing, annual membership was available for £29.99.Interest-free overdraft:up to £2,000 from year one (limited to £500 in your first term). Up to £3,250 from year three onwards.Anything else?NatWest and RBS again came top inSave the Student’s banking surveyearlier this year, with student satisfaction scores of 4.34 and 4.32, respectively, out of five.SantanderView image in fullscreenSantander was the most commonly used bank among those surveyed by Save the Student.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAThe freebies:the Edge student account comes with a free four-year 16-25 railcard that the bank says is worth £115, offering students up to a third off most rail fares. There’s a prize draw for those who open, or transfer to, the account before 17 October this year, with prizes ranging from £20 to £100,000. Also, you can pay into a regular savings account paying 5%, and get access to cashback and offers via the bank’s Santander Boosts rewards programme.Interest-free overdraft:£1,500 for the first three years, provided you meet the basic criteria (registering for online banking and paying in a certain amount). This can increase to £1,800 in year four and £2,000 in year five if students continue with their studies.Anything else?Santander was once again the most commonly used bank among those surveyed by Save the Student, although its market share has dropped slightly to 18% from 21% last year. “Even when I was at university, Santander were very popular,” says Tom Allingham, the communications director at Save the Student. “They definitely make a conscious effort in that space.” However, in terms of overdrafts, NatWest and RBS “are offering more than £1,000 more at the maximum level”, he adds.NationwideView image in fullscreenNationwide offers £100 cashback and £120 worth of Just Eat vouchers.Photograph: Dinendra Haria/SOPA Images/ShutterstockThe freebies:the building society offers £100 cashback and £120 worth of Just Eat vouchers, paid out as £10 a month over the first year.Interest-free overdraft:provided you meet the basic criteria, you are guaranteed a £1,000 0% overdraft in year one. It is then up to £2,000 in year two, and up to £3,000 in year three (and beyond, if applicable).Anything else?If you have, or open, a savings account withNationwideas well, you could get an annual Fairer Share scheme payment. For the last three years running it has paid out £100 to eligible members.

So you might as well pick an account that can offer some respite. In my case it was the Santander Edge student current account.I was sold on the free four-year 16-25 railcard. Throughout each year at university my railcard has come up trumps in a variety of ways. In my first year at university, it made home feel just that little bit closer. With a 33% saving on each fare, I was constantly spotted on platform 1 with a big bag of laundry. In my second year, my railcard served as a gateway to explore more of the country. I’ve ticked off new sporting venues, as well as Bristol and Stansted airports. Moving into my final year, as the crunch begins, my railcard will act as an enabler to complete valuable internships and work experience.My account also comes with a 0% overdraft, which is a reassuring presence should any part of university life catch up with me.There were a variety of options that didn’t quite capture my eye. NatWest offered a tastecard letting you take advantage of restaurant deals and food discounts. In my case I found that after the first semester, the likelihood of eating out quickly diminishes.Student financeonly stretches so far!Other accounts offered cashback at certain retailers, which, considering my limited record of high street spending, would have been wasted on me.Talking of the high street, the fact that there’s a Santander branch in my university town was also a factor. My family is still wedded to the chequebook, so a place to deposit cheques, even in 2025, is greatly appreciated.Alfie Howlettis studying a three-year BA journalism degree at the University of GloucestershireExplore more on these topicsStudent financeBanks and building societiesCurrent accountsStudentsHigher educationBankingNatWest GroupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With steak and kebabs also off the menu because they are too pricey, Britons are switching to poultry.However, this extra demand is pushing up the price of chicken. A 600g pack of chicken thighs, for example, now costs £5.54. This is an increase of 64p, or 13%, on last year, based on the pre-promotion prices across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons.Inflation has been mounting in the meat and poultry aisles since the turn of the year, which Andrew Keeble, the managing director and founder of Heck Sausages, described as a “perfect storm”.Chicken prices had risen in the past two years from £2.85 a kilo to £5.50, driven by a combination of avian flu and the industry drive to reduce the number of chickens in each shed on welfare grounds, hetold the BBC.“We fully support it but you get fewer chickens in a shed [and] there aren’t enough sheds, to put it bluntly, and that is driving availability prices through the roof at the moment,” Keeble said.The pain doesn’t end at the patty cost for burger fans either, as the price of cheese slices and brioche buns has gone up, too, according to Assosia.Even the soft drink to wash it all down is more expensive because of soaring packaging costs, with polymer plastic prices more than doubling since November 2024. Drinks brands are also contending with the rising cost of sugar and fruit concentrates.According to the latest shop price monitor from the British Retail Consortium, food pricesrose by 4% in Julyfrom a year earlier, up from 3.7% in June and above the three-month average of 3.5%.The BRC’s chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said households would have noticed their higher grocery bills after food price inflation rose for the sixth consecutive month.“Staples such as meat and tea were hit the hardest as wholesale prices for both categories have been hit by tighter global supplies,” she said. “This has helped push up overall shop prices.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No wonder the place was considered for training by the Apollo program. Its sparse life forms include an intimidating shrub whose thorns mimic the stingers on the scorpions that come out after dark. A harsh, forbidding place, but beautiful too.

We’d seen samples of its space rock in the excellent display at the Museum of Central Australia in Alice and were keen to see where they fell. There are six known impact sites in the Territory and the two most accessible are Henbury and Tnorala (Gosse Bluff). We visited both during Victoria’s fifth Covid lockdown in 2021.Henbury is a site where a nickel-iron meteor about the size of a garden shed disintegrated before striking the land to carve out over a dozen impact craters, just 4,500 years ago – so recently that the site has significant cultural meaning as a sorry place for the Luritja people, whose sacred songs and oral histories tell of this devastating event.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningScientific models suggest the meteorites hit Earth at 40,000km/h in an explosion akin to the Hiroshima blast.View image in fullscreenA chunk of meteor found in 1931 at Henbury.Photograph: Matteo Chinellato/AlamyThe site’s 12 craters are best viewed when the sunlight’s low angle reveals the smaller, heavily eroded examples. Among the youngest of Earth’s known impact sites, Henbury’s pits have been scoured by wind and rare deluges down the Finke River flood plain. Extreme temperatures do the rest.The largest crater is 180m across, the smallest the size of a back yard spa. The explosion sprayed out tonnes of pulverised rock in a distinctive rayed pattern still visible around Crater No.3 – the only known terrestrial example. Temptingly, specimens of the actual meteorite hurled out with this ejecta may still be found. The 45kg chunk in the Museum of Central Australia is one example of 680kg collected so far, though digging or damaging the site without a permit is illegal. We don’t find any meteorite fragments, but we leave with memories of a humming sunrise and night with a billion almost touchable stars.View image in fullscreenAt night, the sky above the MacDonnell Ranges is dazzling – unmarred by urban light pollution.Photograph: burroblando/Getty ImagesFrom Tylers Pass lookout, two hours west along the Namatjira Drive from Alice Springs, Tnorala (Gosse Bluff) appears as a mountain range thrusting incongruously from the endless western plains. In fact, these peaks were created in seconds when an object up to 1km wide hit the Earth at about 250,000km/h, 142m years ago, with an explosive force at least 20 times more powerful than all the world’s nuclear weapons.No trace of that object has been found, so it was likely an icy comet that vaporised on impact. Erosion has since reduced the crater from its original 22km diameter.

Locally, they would have been vaporised, and anything living within 100km killed by the massive shock wave and extreme heat. The sound of the explosion likely travelled around the world. The Tnorala bolide event was a prelude to the big one, Chicxulub on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula, which wiped out the dinosaurs 77m years later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A group of star woman were dancing in a corroboree in the Milky Way when one woman placed her baby in a turna (wooden cradle). The dancing shook the galaxy and the turna slipped, with the baby falling to Earth as a blazing star, striking the ground to create the crater’s distinctive bowl shape.These days “awesome” is a word debased by glib use. It’s apt driving into the 5km-wide Tnorala crater, surrounded by cliffs 180 metres high, formed in a blink by a literally Earth-shattering event as our planet’s crust rebounded to form the crater’s inner ring. The rock strata in these peaks show that some were lifted from a depth of 4km by incredible explosive force, and are now inverted.View image in fullscreenThe view over Tnorala (Gosse Bluff), a crater created by a meteor.Photograph: Genevieve Vallee/AlamyIt’s not just awareness of this ancient violence that marks Tnorala as a sorry place. Local information boards describe it as a pre-colonial massacre site. So it’s doubly proper that camping is forbidden.It’s an unwelcoming place, where an object large enough to be classified as a city-killer fell from the sky. This kind of comet is now thankfully detectable by telescopes such as the new Vera C Rubin observatory in Chile, and also proven asfeasible to steer off course.So forget Mars. Cancel that ticket.

We emerge like an amphibious invasion force – about 160 swimmers, making our way to the hotel pool bar where drinks await. So far, so civilised. But this is only a warm-up …View image in fullscreenOn 24 August 1875, Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim the Channel, slathered in animal fat to fend off the cold. At the time, it was heralded as a feat of near-superhuman endurance. One hundred and fifty years later, I signed up for a modern take on the 33.3km (21-mile) swim (the shortest distance across the Channel, although Webb was blown off course and ended up swimming something like 63km). This Croatian adaptation involves swimming between islands off the Dalmatian coast, is split across four days and includes a welcoming hotel (the three-star Places Hvar by Valamar) to recuperate in at the end of each day. And thankfully, neoprene has replaced tallow.Within minutes, I spot an octopus waving lazily from its underwater gardenThe trip is run byUltraSwim 33.3, a new company named after the Channel stretch, offering multiday swim challenges in spectacular locations – Croatia, Montenegro, Greece and Switzerland – with an emphasis on comfort and support.“The Channel is the Everest of swims,” says Mark Turner, UltraSwim 33.3’s co-founder. “But the window to do it is short, it’s expensive, and – let’s be honest – not a particularly appetising stretch of water. With us, you get the same distance in beautiful surroundings, without having to rough it.”View image in fullscreenThe writer, ‘trying not to think about how far I am from dry land’I’ve been on swimming holidays before with companies such as SwimTrek and StrelSwimmingAdventures, and I’ve swum up to 5km a day, but with breaks for drinks, lunch and soaking up the sun. UltraSwim takes a more structured, challenge-oriented approach. Each day begins early – we are in the water by 8am, before boat traffic picks up – and swimmers go up to 12km without pausing for more than a quick pit stop.A detailed training plan landed in my inbox after I’d signed up and I quickly realised I wasn’t fit enough, or perhaps was mentally unprepared, for the full 33.3km swim. Thankfully, there were two shorter options available: the 11.1km “Discovery” and the 22.2km “Build” packages, both nodding to the Channel challenge.On the first day, we set off from a jetty close to the hotel and, within minutes, I spot an octopus waving lazily from its underwater garden. I’d love to linger, but time and tide wait for no swimmer. Several kilometres later, I stumble out of the water on to the beach at Uvala Veli Dolac, exhausted but elated. We are greeted by a spread of high-energy snacks and a lot of talk about carb loading – a far cry from Webb’s fuelling strategy of beer, brandy and beef tea.I enjoy swimming across the sun-dappled kelp forests, the calm rhythm of stroke after strokeAccording to theChannel Swimming and Piloting Federation, Webb’s swim has now been repeated 3,250 times. The endurance trend is visible in other areas, too, from ultramarathons and multiday cycling tours to open-water relays. Increasingly, it seems, people want to return from holiday not rested but with a sense of accomplishment.On days two and three, we tackle some proper “Channel” swims across 2-3km stretches of open water, from the Kabal headland to Stiniva beach, and Cape Pelegrin to Palmižana. On the map these are marked as ferry routes, but the views I enjoyed from the deck when I arrived in Hvar – all pine-studded islands and turquoise waters – feel very different when in the water: a distant headland to aim for, choppy seas and the occasional jellyfish.I’ve never attempted anything quite like this before, and it’s not a challenge I relish. But I put my head down and try not to think about how far I am from dry land. There’s a GPS tracker in my tow float, kayakers on either side, and a clear course to follow – thankfully more straightforward than the one Webb swam, where strong tides dragged him way off course, turning a 21-mile crossing into a 39-mile slog.View image in fullscreenStari Grad on Hvar, one of the oldest towns in Europe.Photograph: Nathaniel Noir/AlamyAs I swim for just over two hours, I find it hard to fathom how he kept going for nearly 22. I distract myself by recalling snapshots from the trip: the 16th-century Tvrdalj Castle in Stari Grad, where the poet Petar Hektorović once lived; and the Diocletian’s Palace in Split, where I spent a relaxed day exploring its golden alleyways and multiple layers of history, from the Roman and Venetian empires to Yugoslavia and the past 30 years of an independent Croatia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The name “Pakleni” comes frompaklina, a pine resin once used for boat building.Our 160-strong group is made up of swimmers from across the globe, from as far and wide as Brazil, Dubai and Australia. There are almost equal numbers of men and women, with ages ranging from 20 to 73. Some are training for an actual Channel crossing, others just want a challenge.“It’s type-two fun,” Joe from Dublin tells me. “The kind that’s only fun after it’s over.” I think I’m more of a type-one (enjoying things at the time) person, but I do enjoy swimming across the sun-dappled kelp forests, the calm rhythm of stroke after stroke, and the quiet pride of finishing each day’s swim.View image in fullscreenThe Pakleni archipelago, off the southwest coast of Hvar island.Photograph: Ivan Coric/Alamy“We find that people surprise themselves,” says Turner. “The way we structure it with pacing and support, swimmers who’ve never gone beyond a few kilometres leave feeling they’ve done something extraordinary.”Non-swimming partners aren’t left out. They can follow by boat, cheer from the shore or explore Stari Grad and Hvar. One non-swimmer told me he’d racked up a fair few kilometres on an ebike, visiting lavender farms, vineyards and sleepy fishing villages. “Other than a brief dip, swimming’s not really my thing,” he shrugged. “But my girlfriend loves it, so we’re both happy.”On the final day, we aim for the bell tower of St Stephen’s Cathedral and swim the last few kilometres into Hvar’s harbour, emerging beside the Venetian arsenal to a glass of champagne, handed to us after we pass the finishing posts, to bemused stares from regular tourists.A few hours later, after a soothing massage in a spa hotel, I’m wandering Hvar’s labyrinthine streets, stopping to enjoy fresh fish and Croatian wine, with no more talk of carb loading. I didn’t win anything. I didn’t swim the full 33.3km. But I completed the 11.1km course and tasted something akin to what Captain Webb must have felt: the slow, steady triumph of body over distance, albeit without the freezing water of the Channel, or the beef tea. And, instead of the pale grey cliffs of Cap Gris-Nez to signal the end, the golden limestone of Hvar.The trip was provided byUltraSwim 33.3. Packages from €1,800ppfor four nights(in a group of four, the fourth swimmer goes half-price), includinghotel accommodation, breakfasts, post-swim lunches and guided swims.

In return, the paying ticket-holders, who may not otherwise be invited to many weddings, could mingle with other guests and enjoy somebody’s happy day.“I thought: ‘woah, that’s quite something’, having people you don’t know at your wedding,” said Jennifer. “But we took the flyer, went away to think about it and decided why not? If we can see the profiles beforehand on the app and choose who to accept, it could be something quite original to do.”The new rules of small talk: how to nail every conversation, from first dates to weddings, parties and funeralsRead moreJennifer, 48, and her husband, Paulo, 50, who met on a dating app during the pandemic and have an 18-month-old son, will marry later this month at a country manor an hour east of Paris. Theirs is the first wedding to have paying guests. Their friends and family will number 80 adults and 15 children, some travelling from England, Germany and Portugal. But alongside those loved ones, there will be five paying strangers who have bought tickets.The ticket-holders will be present for the whole day, from the afternoon wedding ceremony and vows in the garden, to outdoor drinks on the lawn with live music, then a sit-down dinner in a vast dining room, with a choice of fish or vegetarian options – no meat because the bride is vegetarian. Then there will be the traditional partying on the dancefloor. The paying guests have to abide by the dress-code – defined on the wedding invitations as “chic and elegant” – and Jennifer and Paolo vetted their profiles before choosing who will attend.View image in fullscreenA young couple arriving hand in hand at their wedding reception.Photograph: Hiraman/Getty Images“It’s not only about the money, which is a drop on a hot stone in terms of the overall wedding cost,” said Jennifer, “although it will help a bit in terms of the cost of things like decoration and the dress. It’s also because we thought it could be fun and we’re extrovert and open to sharing things.”Jennifer, who acts on stage and TV, and Paulo, a former athlete who works in the building trade, also thought that the five paying strangers – one couple and three single men – could be a boost for their other guests. “We have a lot more single women friends coming to our wedding than single men, so we thought this could balance things out a bit,” Jennifer said.Laurène, 29, a toymaker living in the Paris area, and her husband, a landscape gardener, will be among the handful of strangers paying to attend. “I thought selling tickets to your wedding to strangers sounded interesting,” Laurène said. “I don’t have a big family so I don’t get to go to lots of weddings, it’s great to be able to experience a wedding and different traditions, even if it’s strangers. I’m keen to check out the decoration and music, and we’ll be partying on the dancefloor.”Katia Lekarski, who founded Invitin earlier this year to match wedding couples with paying guests, said six marriages so far were due to take part, mainly in the Paris area. “I was renting my house in south-easternFranceto some people who were attending a wedding, and my five-year-old daughter asked: ‘Why aren’t we also invited to weddings?’ I thought: what if we could pay for tickets to a wedding and help the couple getting married in that way?”Lekarski’s view was that with so many apps proposing meeting up with strangers – from tour-guides to dating or dinners with groups of new people – why not add weddings into the mix. In India, the company, Join My Wedding, already connects foreign tourists with couples having traditional weddings, as a cultural experience under the line: “You haven’t been to India until you’ve been to an Indian wedding”. In France, the idea was for local people to attend a wedding as a day out and shared experience, with Invitin taking a commission.View image in fullscreenOwen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in The Wedding Crashers.Photograph: New Line/Sportsphoto/AllstarLekarski, a former fashion model who previously ran an online platform selling and distributing interior design goods for children, described the project as at a very early stage and said her biggest challenge was finding couples and guests to take part.Couples who have shown interest in opening up their wedding to paid ticket-holders have been mostly between 25 and 35, Lekarski said, but there was one much older couple preparing to renew their vows. Only a small number of paid guests would attend – five to 10, each paying an average of €100 to €150, but tickets can be higher depending on the venue. They would have to sign up to strict rules including dressing appropriately, arriving on time, drinking with moderation, and not publishing or sharing photos without authorisation.The best wedding gifts in the UK: 13 ideas that couples will actually wantRead moreThe wedding couple, who usually have so many of their own guests to talk to, aren’t obliged to meet the paying guests and chat to them. “A wedding has its own ecosystem where guests get chatting to each other of their own accord,” Lekarski said.The paying guests Laurène and her husband, who got married themselves a month ago at a historic farm building south of Paris, are taking it very seriously. “We’re going to go about it as if we’re real guests, we’ll dress up nicely and bring a little gift.”Laurène’s grandparents met at a wedding in Dijon and she thinks weddings are the ultimate social feelgood event. “Everyone is in a kind and happy mood, dressed up and celebrating love. This is not something you can do too often as tickets are quite expensive, but it’s a great opportunity.”The only thing they’re not sure about is whether they’ll be in the wedding pictures. “We’d love to be in the group photo, but I’m not sure how that will work, it is a bit bizarre after all.”Explore more on these topicsWeddingsFranceParisAppsMarriageEuropeFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If there’s a best way for an animal to die, I can’t say I’ve found itTim DowlingSat 2 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 10.26 EDTShareIn the days before my father-in-law’s funeral, my wife and I drive to his cottage in the country with the dogs. Our schedule – shredded and hastily reassembled around events – has a window just big enough to go down there, check on things, do the front hedge, weed a bit. It seems important, even if it probably isn’t.Shortly after we arrive a visitor remarks on the decline of the old dog.“Really?” my wife says. “I guess we don’t notice.”Since we were last here the old dog – now nearly 16 – has certainly become more wobbly, more incontinent and more prone to falling asleep suddenly, in strange places. But her decline hasn’t been steady. She’s also prone to brief episodes where she leaps and capers like a young dog, episodes that are themselves a little alarming.“Is she having fun?” I say, as the dog runs in circles round our feet. “Does this look like fun?”Anyway, she likes it down here. She’s been coming since she was a puppy, and she knows her way round. It is possibly more familiar to her than our house, which we’ve only lived in for eight years. The stone floor is remarkably resilient when it comes to chronic incontinence. And the weather is amazing.In the morning my wife goes out to pick up a few things. I sit at the table in front of my laptop, trying to make a start on a eulogy. The new dog is on the sofa. The old dog is asleep on the floor alongside its bed, as if she tipped over on the way to it, and decided that close was close enough.It occurs to me that this time last year I was at work onmy own father’s eulogy. This affirms my superstition that death has a season, and that season, for me, is summer. My mother died in June; I remember the sound of lawnmowers when I called my wife to tell her.Later that day, under a warm afternoon sun, I am trying to extract bindweed from a raised bed. It’s a pleasingly thankless task, requiring little thought and carrying no risk of completion. My wife is pegging out some laundry by the back door. A few feet away from her, the old dog is having one of her rare episodes of sprightliness, tearing through the tall grass in excited figures of eight, and snorting with delight.She’s liked this cottage since she was a puppy. The stone floor is remarkably resilient to chronic incontinenceMy wife turns her back for a few minutes, and when she turns around, the old dog is gone. She comes and finds me to ask if I’ve seen her. I haven’t.The old dog doesn’t wander as a rule, and is most likely inside, fast asleep in some new and unlikely spot. Except she isn’t. Once we’ve checked all the obvious places, we decide to split up. We search in silence, because you can’t call a deaf dog.I take the track leading away from the house, secretly because I figure it’s the path most likely to lead toward a positive outcome. If the dog has headed this way, I’m sure to find her safe.But I get quite a long way up the track without finding anything at all. From up there I can just hear my wife’s voice calling my name. As faint as it is, I can tell she has bad news.In the end the new dog found the old dog, burrowing deep into brambles and weeds towards the bed of a trickling, nearly dry stream, where she lay dead. She was not 30ft from where my wife last saw her. We looked, it turns out, in all the wrong places.“Oh dear,” my wife says, kneeling on the grass. “I feel so guilty.”“Me too,” I say.My wife rings our sons to break the news, and they take it hard. When the old dog was the new dog, the youngest one was only 10 years old. He was given the honour of picking a name. He took my advice, and called her Nellie.Later I text them all to tell them to check on the tortoise, because as far as I’m concerned death’s season still has some way to run.In the following days more than one person will offer up the hopeful notion that animals sometimes take themselves off to die. I’m not sure how likely I find this, or how comforting. Other friends suggest that it’s better all round for a dog to expire somewhere it’s been happy, in full pursuit of being a dog, rather than on the cold floor of a veterinarian’s office.I’ve sat on the floor holding a dog, tears running off my nose into its fur, while a vet administered that final injection. And now I’ve fought through brambles to pull a dead dog out of a stream. And personally, I would struggle to register a preference.Explore more on these topicsPetsThe Tim Dowling columnFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She answered those questions honestly, truthfully, to the best of her ability,” attorney David Oscar Markus told reporters. “She never invoked a privilege. She never refused to answer a question.”Maxwell’s highly unusual two-day sit-down with the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche – who served as Donald Trump’s criminal defense attorney before working for his justice department – came as the US president tiptoes through a political minefield related to Epstein and his own social links to the disgraced former financier.But Blanche’s meeting – held amid rumors and denials of a pardon for Maxwell shortly before her sudden move on Friday to a Texas prison – did not just show Trump’s flagging efforts at damage control over the Epstein scandal. Maxwell is simultaneously pursuing several other strategies to be freed from her 20-year federal prison sentence.Ghislaine Maxwell is talking – but what can she tell and can she be believed?Read moreAnd, some experts believe, Maxwell’s ultimate aim is probably not really revealing the whole truth and everything she knows about Epstein, Trump and other powerful figures. Instead, it is all about earning her freedom.Maxwell’s team ispushingthe US supreme court to consider her appeal, which contends that she was shielded from prosecution in Epstein’s controversial 2007 plea agreement – an argument that has been opposed by the same justice department that has now met with her.Maxwell is also trying to make the most of a congressional subpoena, threatening to invoke her fifth amendment right against self-incrimination unless she is given immunity. Her legal team has also suggested clemency – which Trump could grant immediately.This broad-spectrum approach, which several longtime defense attorneys said represented sound legal strategy, has prompted skepticism about whether any discussions reflect an actual desire to reveal truth. More, Maxwell’s track record ofallegedlying undermines whatever truths Trump officials claim they want to reveal in highly publicized meetings.“If I were representing her, I would be doing exactly the same thing. The supreme court petition has virtually no chance of success. The issues raised are not novel or of general relevance to other cases,” said Ron Kuby, a longtime defense attorney whose practice focuses on civil rights.Kuby told the Guardian that the supreme court agrees to take on “only the smallest fraction” of petitions. “Filing a supreme court petition is akin to playing the lotto, you can’t win unless you play, but your likelihood of winning is slim, so it’s a last-ditch effort that defendants use when they have enough money for full due process.”The parallel strategy of actively pursuing clemency with the Trump administration is sound because Trump could commute her sentence or issue a pardon, Kuby said. “Because these are all federal convictions, he can let her out of jail tomorrow,” he added.As for why Maxwell would seem willing to shed light on Epstein despite a low likelihood of a positive outcome, “she has nothing to lose.“The question isn’t ‘why would she meet with them’? She’ll do anything for people who can help with this,” Kuby said.Ghislaine Maxwell is not a victim. And if she is pardoned, it won’t be for the sake of justice | Arwa MahdawiRead moreEric Faddis, a trial attorney and founding partner of the Colorado firm Varner Faddis, voiced similar sentiments about Maxwell’s strategy.“For anyone who’s been sentenced to 20 years in prison, it would behoove them to explore all potential avenues to try and better their legal position, and it looks like that’s what Maxwell is doing here,” Faddis said.Other legal experts agree.“Maxwell’s attorneys are doing everything they can to keep her out of prison,” said John Day, a former prosecutor in New Mexico who foundedthe John Day Law Office.The Epstein controversy swirling around Trump may prove an excellent opportunity that few could have foreseen.“This is a moment in time that wasn’t there before, where she suddenly has an opening to try to get a change in her situation,” Day said. “Up until the Epstein case resurfaced and the Epstein-Trump issues came to the forefront of people’s attention, Maxwell was just doing her time.“Suddenly, she is trying to make the case that she has information, and she has information that’s worth trading for, and she’s hoping, her lawyers are hoping, that somehow someone is going to decide that it’s worth giving her a break.”Should Maxwell receive any favorable outcome, it might do little to promote truth and much to foment uncertainty.“If there is some kind of a deal that came out of the nine hours that Todd Blanche met with her, then any information that comes out of that is always going to be seen in the context of ‘what was the deal?’” Day said.Indeed, Trump’s handling of the Epstein files has done little but sow doubt. The Trump justice department released a memo insisting there was no Epstein client list, and decided not to release extensive case files, despite his campaign promise to do so.This backtracking on releasing documents helped fan the flames ofcontroversythat came after the publication of a Wall Street Journalarticleclaiming that Trump contributed a “bawdy” letter to a birthday present for Epstein – compiled by Maxwell.Shortly after the story ran, Trumpannouncedthat he had directed his justice department to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts in Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal cases.This purported push for transparency, vis-a-vis Bondi’s request for unsealing, does not appear to have quelled backlash against Trump. The Wall Street Journal on 23 Julyreportedthat Bondi told Trump his name appeared in the Epstein files on multiple occasions.Epstein, whom prosecutors stated abused girls as young as 14, had long enjoyed the company of numerous high-profile men in his circle – among them Trump and Britain’s Prince Andrew. Epstein killed himself in jail awaiting trial six years ago.Trump’s camp has insisted that a pardon is not in the works, with a senior administration official saying: “No leniency is being given or discussed. That’s just false. The president himself has said that clemency for Maxwell is not something he is even thinking about at this time.”But at other times, Trump’s comments on the issue have raised eyebrows, with himsaying:“I’m allowed to do it, but it’s something I have not thought about.” He has alsoremarked: “Well, I’m allowed to give her a pardon, but nobody’s approached me with it. Nobody’s asked me about it” and that “Right now, it would be inappropriate to talk about it.”Top congressional Republicans aretoeing the linewhen it comes to the idea of potential presidential relief, including the House speaker, Mike Johnson. “Well, I mean, obviously that’s a decision of the president,” Johnson said on Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. “I won’t get in front of him. That’s not my lane.”The political benefit for Trump from a pardon – however unlikely – remains nearly nil, as it would do little to support his prior claims about wanting the truth revealed.“The giant problem here – although what we have seen is that people are capable of believing all kinds of things if Trump says they are true – I don’t think there’s anything that Ghislaine Maxwell can say that will put any of this to rest,” Kuby said. “Certainly, the optics of giving an actual convicted child [abuser] clemency does not easily align with the right wing’s purported concern about child abuse.”Explore more on these topicsGhislaine MaxwellDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But since Trump scrapped the parole, I chose to come to Brazil,” he added, referring to the US president’selimination of the humanitarian programme known as CHNV, which had benefited migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.For years, Venezuela’spolitical and economic criseshas driven people out of the country, creating a global diaspora of nearly 8 million. However,as of June this year, Brazil has had twice as many asylum requests from Cubans, 19,419, compared with Venezuelans, 9,850.Map of central and south America highlights the Romaima, Amapá and Paraná regions of Brazil.Cubans typically travel to Guyana or Suriname, countries with less bureaucratic visa processes, before crossing the land border into the northern Brazilian states of Roraima and Amapá.But many are continuing their journey way down south, particularly to Curitiba – a city home to 1.8 million and the capital of Paraná state – which ranks just behind the northern entry-point towns in Cuban asylum requests.The city has the highest GDP of the southern state capitals and is known for itsstrong public transportation, healthcare and education systems.There are so many Cubans and Venezuelans in Curitiba that they’ve formed two leagues of softball, a sport virtually unknown in football-obsessed Brazil.About 350 players, split across 16 teams, play the larger-ball, compact version of baseball on makeshift pitches of two parks in São José dos Pinhais, just outside Curitiba.View image in fullscreenErnesto Alberto Keiser Limonta, a softball catcher, came to Brazil from Cuba a year ago.Photograph: Melvin Quaresma/The GuardianThe catcher of one team, Ernesto Alberto Keiser Limonta, 30, arrived last year. He lives with his wife and is now focused on bringing the rest of the family to join them. “I chose Curitiba because I was told it’s a prosperous, safe city that has a lot of work,” he said.Almost every Sunday, Limonta takes to the field infull uniform– cap, jersey bearing the flags of Cuba and Brazil, trousers, socks, and cleats without metal studs, to avoid injuries that could prevent someone from working the next day.Given that the heavy influx of Venezuelans began earlier, they make up most of the players, but the roughly 20 Cubans have managed to form a dedicated Team Cuba.“There’s a saying among migrants – and now it’s being repeated by Cubans – that our north is the south,” said one Venezuelan, Angel Blanco, 44, whofounded one of the leagues.The movement began last year when –according to the UN Refugee Agency– Brazil became the country with the highest number of Cubans applying for asylum (22,288 applications), ahead of Mexico (17,884) and the US (13,685). The figures could be even higher, as many Cubans struggle even to submit their requests.Tello, for instance, has been seeking help from thehumanitarian NGO Joséas he still has not been able to book an appointment with the federal police to formally register his request. Only with the protocol, which also serves as an ID, can migrants be officially hired by Brazilian employers.View image in fullscreenAbout 350 players, split across 16 teams, play softball in Curitiba.Photograph: Melvin Quaresma/The GuardianAppointments must be booked online, and the next available slot wasn’t until November, Tello said. “I’m afraid I’ll run out of money – and if I do, I’ll end up sleeping on the streets. In this cold, I’d be dead within days,” he added, referring to the city’s climate, where temperatures can drop to 5C.A federal police spokesperson said the gap was “due to high and growing demand” and that “ongoing efforts to expand capacity have not been enough to keep pace with the exponential number of migrants arriving in the region.”Yaneth Corina Lara Garcia, a Venezuelan who works as an integration assistant at the non-profit organisationCáritas Curitiba, said: “It’s six months in which, unable to get formal work, Cuban migrants end up vulnerable to exploitation – including modern slavery.”Another common challenge for Cubans is having their university degrees recognised, which forces many into lower-paid jobs, such as construction or cooking.Yarismeli Nardo, 36, a psychologist who has lived in Curitiba since 2019, is one of the few to have had her degree recognised. But it wasn’t easy, she says. The Federal University of Paraná opens justone application round per year, requiring a lengthy list of documents – often difficult to obtain in Cuba – as well as exams and interviews.However, she persisted, and while working as a pharmacy sales assistant, Nardo completed the process. She now spends two days a week working as a psychologist at a clinic and the rest as an IT technician.Now, six years after she left, Nardo is planning her first holiday back to Cuba.“I want to save a little money, because my biggest wish is to see my grandmother, who’s 94,” she said. “When I first came here, I felt as if I was nobody – starting from scratch, where no one knew me. Now I feel as if I’m finally catching my breath.”Explore more on these topicsCubaBrazilVenezuelaMigrationDonald TrumpAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "18.40 EDTTrump offers wildly false claim about job numbers released before 2024 election to defend firing of labor statistics chiefSpeaking to reporters on Friday,Donald Trumpdefended his decision to fireErika McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor statistics, and falsely accused her of having released reports just before the 2024 election that overstated the number of new jobs created by the Biden-Harris administration.Asked by a reporter, “Why did you fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics?” Trump replied: “Because I think her numbers were wrong, just like I thought her numbers were wrong before the election.”The president then went on to give a wildly inaccurate account of the jobs data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2024.On Friday, Donald Trump gave reporters a wildly inaccurate account of when the bureau of labor statistics revised job numbers in 2024.“Days before the election, she came out with these beautiful numbers for Kamala, I guess Biden-Kamala, and she came out with these beautiful numbers trying to get somebody else elected,” Trump said, entirely misrepresentingthe jobs reportreleased on 1 November 2024, four days before the election, which in fact showed the US added just 12,000 jobs over the previous month.At the time, the Trump campaigncalled the jobs report“a catastrophe” that “definitively reveals how badly Kamala Harris broke our economy”.On Friday, however, the president offered a very different account of that report released just nine months ago.“Then, right after the election,” Trump claimed, “she had an 8- or 900,000 dollar [sic] massive reduction, said she made a mistake.”What Trump was misremembering is a Bureau of Labor Statistics announcement,on 21 August 2024, that updated data showed that there had been 818,000 fewer jobs added in the US in the previous year than it had initially estimated. That downward revision was large, but part of an annual process, in which the bureau updates its initial estimates when it gets better data.The same day that revision was announced in 2024, Trump, who was then recalibrating his campaign to focus on Kamala Harris,posted on Truth Socialthat the Biden-Harris administration had been “caught fraudulently manipulating Job Statistics” and the “New Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the Administration PADDED THE NUMBERS with an extra 818,000 Jobs that DO NOT EXIST, AND NEVER DID.”On Friday, however, Trump repeatedly insisted that the August revision had not come until after the November election.Before leaving for another long weekend of golf, Trump repeated his false claim about McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor statistics he just fired, to another reporter.“Before the election,” Trump recalled, wrongly, “she gave out numbers that were so good for the Democrats, it was like unbelievable.”“And then right after the election, she corrected those numbers with, I think, almost 900,000 correction,” he said, referring incorrectly to the revision that had taken place in August and had been a boon to his campaign.“Well today she did the same thing, with the 253,000, whatever the number was,” Trump added, referring to McEntarfer’s last act of office: Friday’s announcement that the US economy added 258,000 fewer jobs in May and June than previously estimated.ShareUpdated at22.03 EDT"

Are they promoting prescription drugs?Read moreAfter the explosion in popularity of drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, it has become easy to order supplements, patches and pills online that claim to mimic their GLP-1 stimulating effects – even from reputable suppliers.The ad featured a testimonial signed off “Helen, 68, Sydney” who apparently considered the product to be “one of the best gifts I’ve given myself in years”. The promotion used a series of “before and after photos” which appeared to be AI-generated.It included detailed claims about the product, which it said was “perfect” for people with “big appetites” or “anyone who’s tried GLP-1 drops or injections without much result”.View image in fullscreenA Facebook page called ‘Emma Davis’ links to a website claiming to sell GLP-1 substances.Photograph: FacebookThe comments section was filled with hopeful messages and glowing testimonials, posted by what appeared to be Australian women.But details in their profiles told a different story.A reverse image search suggested they were fake and their pictures stolen from real women including, in one case, Polish war correspondent Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska, whose photo was used for a profile of Gold Coast woman “Isla Taylor”.Pikulicka-Wilczewska confirmed it was her image and that she didn’t know it was being used in this way. “Obviously, the account in question should remove it asap and should not use it again,” she said in an email to Guardian Australia.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAnother profile, apparently that of a middle-aged blonde woman from Canberra, used photos of three women including a guest columnist at a local newspaper in Ohio and a well-known former US TV host. Guardian Australia sought comment from both of these women and contacted the fake profiles.View image in fullscreenAfter the explosion in popularity of drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, it has become easy to order supplements, patches and pills online that claim to mimic their GLP-1 stimulating effects – even from reputable suppliers.Composite: Victoria Hart/Guardian designThe ad linked to the website Maementcurves.com, which was still active as of Friday,althoughthe page with the weight-loss products appeared to have been taken down after Guardian Australia contacted the site for comment.The site claimed the product, “STDEI GLP-1 Weight Loss Oral Liquid”, was made in Australia and developed by a local, family-owned company, even though it is readily available elsewhere on the internet including on AliExpress, eBay and an array of other “ghost stores”.Fake profiles and reviews ‘particularly insidious’The Maementcurves.com site, portraying itself as Australian, claimed the treatment had even saved the life of a customer who had been “seriously obese and close to death” and was “especially endorsed by Lyndi Cohen, one of Australia’s leading dietitians”.Cohen told Guardian Australia she was aware of the site and that her likeness was “being abused and misrepresented” to promote a product she would “obviously not endorse”.“We sent them a cease and desist letter.

A spokesperson for the regulator said scam websites should be reported to Scamwatch for assessment to determine whether they should be taken down.Meta declined to comment.

Organisers said more than 800,000 young pilgrims from 146 countries around the world had assembled as part of a Jubilee of Youth – and perhaps as many as 1 million.Smiling from his popemobile, the first US pope waved to throngs of screaming young people lining his route, many running for a better vantage point.Pope condemns Gaza war’s ‘barbarity’ as 93 reported killed by Israeli fire while waiting for foodRead moreThey had already spent the day in the hot sun listening to music, praying and talking with fellow Catholics. “The pope is here” announced an excited voice over the public address to thunderous applause from the crowd.But the tenor of the event became more solemn and contemplative as the pope took to the stage, carrying a large wood cross. “Dear young people, after walking, praying and sharing these days of grace of the Jubilee dedicated to you, we now gather together in the light of the advancing evening to keep vigil together,” Leo, 69, told them.In the crowd was French pilgrim Julie Mortier, 18, whose voice was hoarse from singing and screaming for hours. “We’re too happy to be here. Seeing the pope, that’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she said.Event organisers said people had continued to arrive during the vigil and that it was possible that attendance numbers had reached 1 million.View image in fullscreenPope Leo XIV arrived on a helicopter to the Jubilee of Youth prayer vigil.Photograph: Vatican Pool/Getty ImagesMost pilgrims said they would camp overnight for a Sunday morning mass at the site led by Leo. That will mark the culmination of the week-long youth pilgrimage, a key event in the Catholic church’s Jubilee holy year.Some in the crowd were so far away they could not see the massive stage with a golden arch and towering cross that dominated the open area – which at more than 500,000 sq m was the size of about 70 football fields.“I’m so happy to be here, even if I’m a bit far from the pope. I knew what to expect,” British student Andy Hewellyn said.“The main thing is that we’re all together,” he said ahead of the pope’s appearance, as other young people nearby played guitars, sang or snoozed in the sun.Italian broadcaster Rai called the event a Catholic “Woodstock”, as throughout the day nearly two dozen musical and dance groups, many of them religious, entertained the crowds.In a video message, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, welcomed pilgrims to the capital, who were “praying, singing, joking among themselves, celebrating in an extraordinary party”.The Jubilee of Youth, which began on Monday, comes nearly three months after the start of Leo’s papacy, and 25 years after the last such massive youth gathering in Rome under Poland’s pope, John Paul II.Early on Saturday, groups of young people set off from central Rome for the venue in Tor Vergata. They were ready to spend the next 24 hours surrounded by a crowd of people and sleep under the stars.Victoria Perez, who carried a Spanish flag, could not contain her excitement at seeing “the pope up close”. “It’s the first time I’m going to see him, and I can’t wait,” the 21-year-old said, looking forward to a “night of prayers under the stars”.French pilgrim Quentin Remaury, 26, said he had been inspired by the late Pope Francis’s rousing message to youth during a 2016 visit to Krakow, Poland. “Pope Francis told us to ‘get off your couches’, and that really gave me a boost,” he said.Throughout the week, attenders participated in church-planned events, such as confession at Circus Maximus, one of Rome’s top tourist spots.On Friday, about 1,000 priests were on hand, with 200 white gazebos serving as makeshift confessionals lining the hippodrome where chariot races were once held in Ancient Rome.The pilgrimage unfolds as under-30s navigate economic uncertainty, the climate crisis and international conflict, with some pilgrims travelling from war-torn areas such as Syria and Ukraine.Samarei Semos, 29, who said she had travelled three days from her native Belize to get to Rome, said she hoped Leo would have a strong say about “third world countries”.The Vatican said that before the vigil the pope had met and prayed with travellers accompanying an 18-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who died on Friday night.Rai News reported that the young woman had died of a heart attack on a bus while returning to her lodging from an event in Rome.Security at the venue was tight, and organisers said at least 4,300 volunteers and more than 1,000 police were watching over the vigil.Explore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVThe papacyCatholicismChristianityReligionItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But: we don’t want to give up!”The post noted SchwuZ’s integral role in Berlin’s LGBTQ+ scene since it was founded in Kreuzberg in 1977, helping two years later to launch theChristopher Street Day paradeand the queer magazineSiegessäule.“For nearly 50 years, SchwuZ has been more than just a club. It’s a second living room. A place for queer art, community, family, resistance,” it said. “Many of us have found what we were looking for here: a home, our chosen family, and freedom.”SchwuZ, which is short forSchwulenZentrumor gay centre, moved to a much larger space with capacity for 1,000 revellers in fashionable Neukölln in 2013, which may have been the beginning of the end.This year the club has had a deficit each month of €30,000-€60,000 (£26,000-£52,000), with income on a downward slide, the public broadcaster RBB reported.SchwuZ’s managing director, Katja Jäger, said an ailing economy, an ageing core clientele and the creeping crisis in the Berlin club scene had all taken their toll.Surging rents and electricity prices have threatened to put many beloved Berlin hotspots out of business after a shortlived post-Covid revival, in a gloomy phenomenon known asClubsterben(the death of clubs).In May, SchwuZ had to let go of 33 employees – about a third of its staff, many of them long-serving – and cut back on professional drag shows. A crowdfunding campaign collected only €3,000 of a €150,000 goal.The club has now staged a last-ditch bid for supporters to rally behind it “for future queer generations who need a place that uplifts, empowers and makes them visible”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Busche Club, a historic gay and lesbian dance spot, closed last weekend after four decades, blaming rising operation costs. Busche was founded in 1988 in communist East Berlin and developed an image as the“anti-Berghain”– a party hotspot catering for an international crowd.On New Year’s Eve,Watergate, an upmarket riverside institutionand part of the electronic music scene, closed after 22 years, citing a range of challenges including inflation, a growing preference for outdoor music events, high DJ wages and a drop in budget flights to Berlin.The techno club Wilde Renate, which offers open-air and indoor dancing, has announced plans to shut at the end of the year after a protracted struggle with a property magnate over its lease.The planned extension of the A100 motorway poses a further threat to several popular clubs around Ostkreuz railway station, promptingprotests for Berlin’s centre-right government to abandon construction.Emiko Gejic, a spokesperson for the Club Commission lobby group, said: “Clubs are an important part of the city’s DNA … but also an economic factor.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeDance musicLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Although the country had a brief respite last week as hot weather moved north and east, the institute said it expected temperatures of 30C might be reached again over the weekend.“We have some hot days ahead of us in northernNorway,” it said.InSweden, meteorologists said long-term heatwaves were noted at several stations in the north of the country, with a weather station in Haparanda measuring 25C or more for 14 days in a row. In Jokkmokk, Lappland, the heatwave lasted for 15 days.“To find a longer period at these stations, you have to go back more than a century,” said Sverker Hellström, a scientist at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.Blistering heat swept northern Europe in mid-July, driven by hot waters off the Norwegian northern coast and a stubborn area of high pressure that brought temperatures in the Nordics 8-10C above seasonal norms. The region has also since been hit by storms and lightning strikes that have sparked wildfires.The hot weather has taken people by surprise in a part of the continent better adapted to the cold. Researchers havefoundthat countries such as the UK, Norway and Switzerland will face the greatest relative rise in uncomfortably hot days as the planet heats up, and have warned that their infrastructure is not well-suited to cope.On Wednesday, an ice rink in northern Finland opened its doors to people seeking refuge from the heat after they overfilled the local hospital’s emergency room, according to Finnish media. On Thursday, herders warned that their reindeer were on the verge of dying in the heat.Swedish radio reported that foreign tourists heading north to Scandinavia for “coolcations” had instead encountered dangerous heat warnings.“As climate change progresses, exceptionally severe heatwaves will intensify,” said Heikki Tuomenvirta, a scientist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. “They are occurring more frequently, are more severe and last longer.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisNorwayEuropeFinlandSwedennewsShareReuse this content"

Russia isn’t Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country.“Don’t go down the Sleepy Joe road!” he added, referring to the former US president Joe Biden.Some security analysts called Trump’s move a rhetorical escalation with Moscow but not necessarily a military one, given that the US already has nuclear-powered submarines that are deployed and capable of striking Russia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Thursday he described Russia’s continued attacks on civilian areas as “disgusting”.“I go home. I tell the first lady, ‘You know, I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.’ She said, ‘Oh, really? Another city was just hit,’” he said in at the White House last month.Putin has not responded to Trump’s ultimatum. On Friday, he said he wanted a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine butgave no indication that he was willing to make any concessions to achieve it, after a week in which Russian missiles and drones again caused death and destruction across Ukraine.“We need a lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy both Russia andUkraine, and would ensure the security of both countries,” said Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a week before a new deadline imposed by Trump for hostilities to cease.Putin has periodically claimed to be interested in peace, but only on terms wholly unacceptable to Kyiv. Last week, the third round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but broke up in less than an hour and have so far led to no agreements except on prisoner exchanges.In an apparent reference to Trump’s comments, Putin said on Friday: “As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations.

The UN says 859 Palestinians have been killed during that time in the vicinity of these sites, and more than 500 have been killed along the routes of food convoys.Health officials reported that Israeli airstrikes and gunfire killed at least 18 Palestinians on Saturday, including three who were in the area around a distribution site.

Both the GHF and the Israeli army have said they only shoot if there is a threat, or fire warning shots to disperse crowds.Doctors inGazahave reported treating an increasing number of gunshot and shrapnel wounds in patients who were trying to get food at the aid sites.“We weren’t close to them [the troops] and there was no threat,” a witness, Abed Salah, who was among crowds close to the GHF site near Netzarim corridor, told AP. “I escaped death miraculously.”Officials added that 10 of Saturday’s casualties were killed by strikes in central and southern Gaza, with five people killed in two separate strikes on tents sheltering displaced people.The US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who accompanied Witkoff on the trip on Friday, claimed the GHF sites were delivering “more than one million meals a day” and called the distribution “an incredible feat”.View image in fullscreenThe US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, visit an aid distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation on Friday.Photograph: Ambassador Mike Huckabee/X/ReutersReports from aid workers, doctors, and journalists in Gaza paint a different story, with UN-backed food security experts saying this week that the “worst-case scenario of famine” is now playing out in Gaza.Seven Palestinians died of malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours, including a child, the territory’s health ministry said on Saturday.

Let’s stop pretending otherwise | Mehdi HasanRead moreAfter international outcry, airdrops of aid have resumed, and several European countries have announced plans to join the Jordan-led coalition orchestrating the drops, but aid groups say this delivers only a fraction of what aid trucks can supply – and are also dangerous. What is really needed, they say, is to open the land borders and restore the full flow of aid.“If there is political will to allow airdrops – which are highly costly, insufficient + inefficient, there should be similar political will to open the road crossings,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote on X on Saturday.The German government, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, joined calls for Israel to deliver more aid on Saturday, saying that the current amount remains “very insufficient”. The criticism came after the German military completed its first food airdrops into Gaza.In Tel Aviv, Witkoff joined families of hostages protesting, as they urged the Israeli government to end the war and release their loved ones.Yotam Cohen, brother of 21-year-old hostage Nimrod Cohen, told AFP: “The war needs to end. The Israeli government will not end it willingly. It has refused to do so.”Negotiations between Hamas and Israel aimed at securing a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and a deal for the release of hostages ended in deadlock last week, with Witkoff blaming Hamas for a “lack of desire to reach a ceasefire”.Hamas said on Saturday that it would not lay down arms unless an independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state is established.Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesFamineIsraelIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Shortly after, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) saidthe reports were “false”but the IDF told the Guardian that the incident was “still under review”.Iain Overton and Lucas Tsantzouris, the team at AOAV, said the statistics suggested Israel was seeking to create a “pattern of impunity” by failing to conclude or find no fault in the vast majority of cases involving “the most severe or public accusations of wrongdoing by their forces”.The IDF said it “conducts examination and investigation processes regarding exceptional incidents that occurred during operational activity, in which there is a suspicion of a violation of the law” in accordance with its obligations under Israeli and international law.It operates internal systems to conduct examinations and allegations of war crimes, including criminal investigations by the military advocate general’s police department and fact-finding assessments (FFA) by a separate team in the general staff.The relatively short passage of time, in investigatory and legal terms, means other unresolved cases may also result in prosecutions, though the two researchers said IDF inquiries had become “more opaque and slow-moving” as the number of civilian casualties in Gaza has mounted.AOAV said it had found reports of 52 cases in English-language media where the Israeli military said it had conducted or would conduct an investigation after allegations of civilian harm or wrongdoing by its forces in Gaza or theWest Bankbetween October 2023 and the end of June 2025. They involve the deaths of 1,303 Palestinians and the wounding of 1,880.One case resulted in a prison sentence for an Israeli soldier. An IDF reservist receiveda seven-month jail term in Februaryafter he was convicted by a military court of the aggravated abuse of Palestinian security detainees. He had repeatedly attacked bound and blindfolded prisoners with his fists, a baton and his assault rifle at the Sde Teiman detention centre.Five other cases ended with violations found. In one,an IDF colonel and a major were sacked in April 2024and three other commanders reprimanded a few days after seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen were killed in an airstrike. The IDF said it was a “grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification”, though the charity said the rapid investigation lacked credibility.The remaining 46 cases, representing 88% of the total, seven were closed without any finding of fault, AOAV said. A further 39 remain under review or with no outcome reported, including four deadly incidents over the course of last month when Palestinians were killed near or at various food distribution points on the Gaza Strip.According to the IDF: “Any report … complaint or allegation that suggests misconduct by IDF forces undergoes an initial examination process, irrespective of its source.” In some instances the evidence is such that a criminal investigation by military police is ordered, while in others an initial investigation takes place.These are referred to the IDF general staff’s FFA mechanism to determine “whether there is a reasonable suspicion of criminal misconduct”. Critics of the system, such as the Yesh Din human rights group, say FFA investigations can take years and have led toone known prosecutionafter 664 inquiries relating to previous IDF military operations in Gaza, in 2014, 2018-19 and 2021.In August 2024, the IDF said the FFA had collected information on “hundreds of incidents” relating to the war in Gaza alone, while the military advocate general’s office had launched 74 criminal investigations.Of these, 52 related to the deaths and mistreatment of detainees and 13 to the stealing of enemy ammunition, while a minority related to allegations of war crimes in combat situations. Three related to the “destruction of civilian property without military necessity” and six concerning “alleged illegal use of force”.The IDF statistics differ from the investigations tracked by AOAV because the research group used a different methodology. AOAV reviewed episodes where there were reports of an investigation being or having been conducted and also took in incidents on the West Bank as well as Gaza.The IDF said that “dozens of military police investigations have been opened” and that “most of these investigations are still ongoing”. The FFA mechanism, meanwhile, had “completed its review in dozens of cases” and these had transferred to the military advocate general for possible criminal investigation.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaWar crimesPalestinian territoriesInternational lawWest BanknewsShareReuse this content"

For months they have watched as their children waste away.“All my children have lost nearly half of their body weight,” said Jamil Mughari, a 38-year-old from Maghazi in central Gaza. “My daughter, who is five years old, now weighs only 11kg. My son Mohammad has become just skin and bones. All my children are like this.“I myself used to weigh 85kg, and now I’m down to 55.”He was struggling to sustain the strength required to find food for his family. “Sometimes, while walking in the street, I feel dizzy and that I’m about to collapse, but I force myself to stay upright. I also sometimes experience shivering,” he said.The mathematics of starvation: how Israel caused a famine in GazaRead moreOver the course of the week, Gaza passed two appalling milestones. The official Palestinian death toll passed 60,000, although the real figure, including those buried under the rubble from Israeli airstrikes, is likely to be far higher.Chart showing the number of people killed or injured while seeking aidThe human cost is likely to continue to rise steeply as starvation catches up with bombs and gunfire as an indiscriminate killer. On Tuesday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a panel of experts from the UN and other aid organisations, which had long warned of the threat of famine, confirmed that the line had been crossed.“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the IPC said, as it called for a ceasefire to prevent further “catastrophic human suffering”.The 2.2 million people of Gaza have long been experts in hunger, forced to scavenge for food each day in the face of Israel’sdeliberate and severe restrictions to aid deliveries.Mughari said that food was almost nonexistent: “We can go for a week or two without any flour. Sometimes we only have one meal a day, which is lentils, and sometimes we find nothing at all to eat – we spend the day drinking water just to feel full.”Cumulative recorded deaths in Gaza as a direct result of malnutritionHis family has had to move seven times since the war began, forced to flee repeated Israeli offensives. But there was no way to escape the hunger that now grips the entire territory.“Sometimes we get lentils from donations or charitable people, or we borrow some money to buy them, that’s it,” he said. “We don’t receive any food aid from soup kitchens; those are only for certain camps, in small quantities.“They [Israelis] spread news about aid coming in, but only the strong and those with weapons seize the trucks and sell the goods at extremely high prices. How can the poor afford to buy them at such prices?”The four food distribution sites across Gaza run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation are open for only a few minutes a day, leading to huge crowds of desperate people, who havecome under Israeli firewhile seeking humanitarian assistance, leading to mass casualties.View image in fullscreenMourners carrying the body of a Palestinian man who was killed while trying to reach aid trucks entering northern Gaza through the Zikim crossing with Israel.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APMansoura Fadl al-Helou, a 58-year-old widow, is too frail to go to the distribution points and refuses to let her son go, for fear he would not come back alive.“The situation there is terrible and very dangerous. The worst part is the chaos among the men – people pushing and throwing each other to the ground,” she said. “Only my one son is here, but I always stop him from going near the aid trucks because of the danger posed by the army. I couldn’t bear to see him come back to me as a martyr.”Mughari has undergone open-heart surgery and all his children are under 12. Even if they wanted to risk their lives for the chance of finding food, they are unable to.“I try to remain steadfast so I can provide my children with anything to eat,” he said. “We have sent many messages to the world, but no one has moved. We no longer know what to say. All I can tell the world is that we are dying slowly, save us from this tragedy.”Tonnes of food aid entering Gaza by month, 2025Among the horrors the Israel-Gaza war has brought to its people, the torture of parents seeing their children starve and being powerless to save them is surely one of the worst.“My youngest daughter is 14 years old, and her ribcage bones are clearly visible due to extreme weakness and malnutrition,” said Abu al-Abed, a father from Deir al-Balah. “I have four daughters and three sons. They suffer from dizziness and fatigue because of the lack of food. If I, their father, feel this way, how much worse must it be for them?”He said they did not receive any aid and that the food market was expensive and they could afford to buy only a little there. “The prices are extremely high; they haven’t reached such levels of inflation even in European countries. And here in Gaza, there is no source of income at all.“There used to be soup kitchens in the area, but now they no longer exist. There are no places that provide free food any more.View image in fullscreenPalestinians struggling to receive meals from a charity in Gaza City in July.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHe said he no longer believed the world had any sense of responsibility. “For years, they boasted about human rights and the protection of lives. What I see now is that all of this was a lie, we were deceived by these slogans.How will the UK’s recognition of Palestine help those starving in Gaza? - podcastRead more“If we had asked them to protect the rights of animals in Gaza, they would have responded immediately and done the impossible. But when it comes to the rights of the Palestinian people, no one remembers us or feels for us, not the Arabs, not the Muslims, not the Christians, no one.”The official IPC recognition of what the people of Gaza knew only too well – that they are starving – brought some faint hope that the outside world would finally stir itself to act, though long experience did not bring much confidence that would happen.Al-Helou said: “We have been suffering from this famine for a long time, and no one has acted. I hope that through this message, the world will finally move to help us and save us from this slow death.”The news of the UK’s pledgeto recognise Palestine in September, barring a ceasefire and a fundamental change in direction from Israel, impressed her even less.“I don’t know what would change if the British government recognises the state of Palestine. What kind of state has no sovereignty, no right to self-defence?” she asked. “It’s a good step to recognise us and the state of Palestine, but it should be a real recognition – not symbolic. A state with real rights, real sovereignty, and a people with rights like any other nation.”Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelFamineAidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump later told reporters that such a move would be “a good step” if true.“I understand thatIndiais no longer going to be buying oil from Russia,” he said. “That’s what I heard. I don’t know if that’s right or not. That is a good step. We will see what happens.”However, official sources in India, quoted by the news agency ANI, rebutted Trump’s claim, saying Indian oil companies had not paused Russian imports and that supply decisions were based on “price, grade of crude, inventories, logistics and other economic factors”.The Guardian view on Trump’s tariffs: both a political and an economic threat | EditorialRead moreTrump’s remarks came a day after the White House announced tariffs of 25% on all Indian goods, along with a penalty for buying arms and energy from Russia amid the war inUkraine.Trump has given an 8 August deadline for Vladimir Putin to stop the war or risk further sanctions on tariffs on countries that import Russian oil.Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Indian state-owned refineries had suspended Russian oil purchases amid the tariff threats and narrowing price discounts.But on Saturday, the New York Times cited two unnamed senior Indian officials who said there had been no change in Indian government policy related to importing Russian oil. One said the government had “not given any direction to oil companies” to cease buying oil from Russia.“These are long-term oil contracts,” one of the sources said. “It is not so simple to just stop buying overnight.”The sources cited by ANI said Indian oil refineries operated in full compliance with international norms, and that Russian oil had never been directly sanctioned by the US or EU. “Instead, it was subjected to a G7-EU price-cap mechanism designed to limit revenue while ensuring global supplies continued to flow.”They added: “India’s purchases have remained fully legitimate and within the framework of international norms.”The sources also noted that if India had not “absorbed discounted Russian crude combined with Opec+ production cuts of 5.8 mb/d [millions of barrels a day], global oil prices could have surged well beyond the March 2022 peak of US$137/bbl [a barrel], intensifying inflationary pressures worldwide”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

India says that as a major energy importer it must find the cheapest supplies to protect its population against rising costs.On Friday, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, said: “We look at what is available in the markets, what is on offer, and also what is the prevailing global situation or circumstances.”Jaiswal added that India had a “steady and time-tested partnership” with Russia.This partnership has been a point of contention for the White House, with Trump posting on Truth Social on 30 July that while India was “our friend”, it had always bought most of its military equipment from Russia and was “Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE – ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!”In a second post, Trump added: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”Ukraine’s military said on Saturday it had hit oil facilities inside Russia, including a refinery in Ryazan, causing a fire on its premises. The strike also hit an oil storage facility, a military airfield for drones and an electronics factory.Explore more on these topicsIndiaRussiaDonald TrumpOilTrump administrationTrump tariffsCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Why is it my job to provide mental health support for whatever reason it is that you ended up in that [situation]?’“Do you know what it is? Free labour of women is where it comes from.“It comes from a fundamentally sexist place in that women didn’t have these services, so a load of women across the country got together and made these services and offered them to other women for free, and they didn’t get paid for their labour.“So they put down a mattress and made a refuge. They set up counselling services and got people who were trained to be therapists and got their voluntary hours and set it up for free.”Phillips said people do not recognise how heavily the UK has relied on women providing support that previously did not existShe added: “Nobody offered diabetes medicine for free. Pharmaceutical companies didn’t go, ‘Wow, this is really important. People will die without this. We’ll just give it away for free.’“That is what the women in our country did in the 1960s and 1970s and 1980s and we got fat on that expectation that that service will be provided for free.“And we also belittled it as an issue that wasn’t absolutely, fundamentally mainstream to the safety and security of our nation.“Undoing that is really hard and it’s going to take a long time.”Explore more on these topicsJess PhillipsWomenViolence against women and girlsCharitiesVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

They far outnumbered the anti-hotel protesters.Some people in the hotel could be seen watching the demonstration from their windows. Sarah Bailey, 63, who is retired, held a sign that said: “To everyone in the hotel, you are valued, wanted [and] welcome.She said: “I know somebody that has connections with this hotel. I thought it was so important, because I realised they would be looking out of the windows, that we send a positive sign saying you are all these three things.“I think it’s so important to show people that have come here seeking safety and protection that they are welcome and to stand up to those who scare and bully them.”Pat Prendergast, 21, said: “I want people to feel safe. I think the [anti-hotel protesters] over there are making people feel unsafe.

The club want land used as a rail freight terminal to complete the Old Trafford Regeneration Project, which they claim will bring £7.3bn a year to the UK economy.United have held talks with Freightliner, the haulage company that owns and operates the terminal, about buying the land, but negotiations are deadlocked due to a disagreement over the price.View image in fullscreenFreightliner owns the land next to the existing Old Trafford, where United want to create this new stadium.Photograph: Foster + Partners/PAWhile Freightliner is understood to have expressed a willingness to relocate from Trafford Park to nearby St Helens, the company is seeking around £400m for the land, with United valuing it at between £40m and £50m. Ratcliffe has made it clear United are unwilling to accept the asking price set by Freightliner’s parent company, Brookfield, and initial discussions are believed to have reached an impasse.A source said Freightliner “have United over a barrel”. The company is willing to relocate to a proposed new site that would offer increased capacity for trains, but it is in no rush to move. The club’s view is that Freightliner will only receive what would be a significant windfall if they are willing to drop the asking price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Manchester United unveil 100,000-seat new stadium projectRead moreWhenunveiling designs for the Old Trafford master plan, produced by Foster + Partners, in March, Ratcliffe set an ambitious target of completing what he described as a five-year build by 2030. United had been hoping to begin preparatory building work by the end of this year, but failing to secure the Freightliner site will delay the start date.United’s options at this stage would be to increase their offer, wait for Freightliner to lower its demands, or scale back the project so that the freight terminal land is not required. It is also possible the newOld Trafford Mayoral Development Corporation, chaired by SebastianCoe, could issue a compulsory purchase order, although that would be subject to legal challenges and would lead to further delays.Completion by 2030 was always seen as an ambitious target outside the senior leadership team at Old Trafford, given United have yet to obtain planning permission, secure ownership of all the land required or formally appoint architects. While Foster + Partners produced the artist impressions and videos of the proposed new stadium, the club plan to run a formal tender process to appoint architects.‘Zippos circus is in town!’ Can Man Utd really raise £2bn for a throbbing big top?Read moreAt a Fans Forum event on 30 June, United conceded that securing the land required could prove an obstacle to beginning work this year. United were asked by supporters whether building would commence in 2025 or 2026 and responded: “Planning work is continuing, including the consultations with fans discussed during today’s meeting.“Discussions are also ongoing with local authorities, land owners and potential funding partners with a view to securing the land and the finance we need to proceed with the project. It remains our ambition to proceed with the project as quickly as possible, but we can only do this once the necessary land and funding is in place.”View image in fullscreenHow Manchester United’s new home could look on match days.Photograph: ReutersUnited have estimated the cost of the project at £4.2bn, but claim it will bring huge social and economic benefits to the local community and wider region, including 92,000 jobs, more than 17,000 new homes as well as attracting an extra 1.8 million visitors annually.The cost for the stadium has been projected by United to be around £2bn, although given the tented roof alone is likely to cost £300m, industry sources say £3bn is a more realistic budget. Freightliner’s demands for £400m could result in the redevelopment being significantly over budget from the start.United are not seeking any public money to build the stadium itself.

He was in the Montana national guard from 2006 to March 2009 and left military service in the rank of sergeant.“This isn’t just a drunk/high man going wild,” Brown’s niece, Clare Boyle, wrote in a Facebook message to the Associated Press. “It’s a sick man who doesn’t know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn’t know where or when he is either.”Montana ranked second worst in the country in terms of prevalence of mental illness and access to care, according to the non-profitMental Health America. Two-thirds of adults in Montana also lived in homes with guns, the highest rate in the country,according to a 2016 studyfrom RAND, a thinktank.The owner of the Firefly Café in Anaconda told the Associated Press that she locked up her business after a friend alerted her to the shooting.“We are Montana, so guns are not new to us,” Barbie Nelson said. “For our town to be locked down, everybody’s pretty rattled.”Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsMontanaGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump, along with other prominent Republican lawmakers, have argued that Smith’s investigations into Trump amounted to illegal political activity.Smith was appointed as special counsel by then attorney general Merrick Garland in 2022 – three days after Trump announced his bid for a second term – to investigate potential interference with the 2020 election and the handling of classified documents.However, the US office of special counsel, the federal agency investigating Smith, is different from the type of justice department-appointed special counsel position that was held by Smith.As an independent federal agency, it lacks the power to bring criminal charges, but can instead seek disciplinary action for a federal government employee or refer its findings to the justice department for investigation.In a series ofsocial media postson Wednesday, Cotton said that Smith’s legal actions “were nothing more than a tool for the Biden and Harris campaigns. This isn’t just unethical, it is very likely illegal campaign activity from a public office.”Cotton said Smith “pushed for an out-of-the-ordinary, rushed trial for President Trump, with jury selection to begin just two weeks before the Iowa caucuses.

The publication cited others who said they were deceived into signing the petitions.The discovery, if confirmed, is likely to be insignificant to Adams’ independent campaign, which is required to produce 7,500 signatures to qualify him as a candidate. The Adams campaign has turned in nearly 50,000 signatures.What to know about the victims of the New York City skyscraper shootingRead moreStill, the finding adds complexity to a race to lead the nation’s largest city that pits the incumbent mayor against Democratic party nomineeZohran Mamdani, former New York governorAndrew Cuomo, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and ex-prosecutor Jim Walden.Cuomo and Walden, like Adams, are running as independents.Flaws in the petition system to gain access to the ballot are likely to be tested in the future as candidates look for ways to circumvent the ranked-choice primary system, the publication said.Candidates typically employ outside contractors to harvest signatures. In the case of Adams’ petition operation, the irregularities were attributed to at least nine workers who together submitted more than 5,000 signatures.A single campaign worker collected more than 700 signatures on a single day, the outlet said, adding that some appeared to be submitted in “strikingly similar handwriting among many residents in a single building”.The Adam’s campaign did not immediately respond to request for comment. But earlier it had told the Gothamist it expected the companies it hired to follow the law, and it would conduct its own review of the signatures.An attorney for Adams said the mayor did not direct anyone to break the law and that his campaign would “determine whether any corrective action is warranted”.Veteran election law attorney Jerry Goldfeder told the publication it is not uncommon for invalid signatures to be collected.“ Every now and again, somebody tries to cut corners, and they’re generally caught and sometimes those cases are referred to the district attorney or the US attorney, and there are prosecutions,” Goldfeder said.The report comes amid heightened tensions in the city after a gunman killed four people in a midtown office building on Monday, including off-dutyNew YorkCity police officer Didarul Islam, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, security guard Aland Etienne and property manager Julia Hyman.The Adams administration has urged New Yorkers to seek help and support from mental health services if they find themselves struggling in the aftermath of the attack, while Mamdani is walking back past criticism of the city’s police, saying his prior calls to defund the force were “out of step” with his current thinking.“I’m not defunding the police,” Mamdani said on Wednesday. “I’m not running to defund the police.“I am running as a candidate who is not fixed in time, one that learns and one that leads, and part of that means admitting as I have grown. And part of that means focusing on the people who deserve to be spoken about.”New York City’s mayoral election is scheduled for 4 November.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkEric AdamsZohran MamdaninewsShareReuse this content"

Without evidence to back his claims, the president wrote onsocial mediathat were numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad” and the US economy was, in fact, “BOOMING” on his watch.Trump fires labor statistics chief hours after data showed jobs growth slowedRead moreBut the firing of McEntarfer, who had been confirmed to her role in January 2024 during Joe Biden’s presidency, has alarmed members of Trump’s own party.“If the president is firing the statistician because he doesn’t like the numbers but they are accurate, then that’s a problem,” said Wyoming Republican senator Cynthia Lummis. “It’s not the statistician’s fault if the numbers are accurate and that they’re not what the president had hoped for.”Lummis added that if the numbers are unreliable, the public should be told – but firing McEntarfer was “kind of impetuous”.North Carolina senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, said: “If she was just fired because the president or whoever decided to fire the director just … because they didn’t like the numbers, they ought to grow up.”Kentucky senator Rand Paul, another Republican, questioned whether McEntarfer’s firing was an effective way of improving the numbers.“We have to look somewhere for objective statistics,” he said. “When the people providing the statistics are fired, it makes it much harder to make judgments that you know, the statistics won’t be politicized.”According to NBC News, Paul said his “first impression” was that “you can’t really make the numbers different or better by firing the people doing the counting”.Tillis and Paul were both opponents of Trump’s recent economic legislative package, which the president dubbed the “big, beautiful bill”.But Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who supported the legislation after winning substantial economic support for her state, remarked that the jobs numbers could not be trusted – and “that’s the problem”.“And when you fire people, then it makes people trust them even less,” she said.William Beach, a former BLS commissioner appointed by Trump in his first presidency,posted on Xthat McEntarfer’s firing was “totally groundless”.

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders described it as “the sign of an authoritarian type”, and he said the decision would make it harder for the American people “to believe the information that comes out of the government”.Paul Schroeder, executive director of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics, described the president’s allegation against McEntarfer as “very damaging and outrageous”.He said: “Not only does it undermine the integrity of federal economic statistics, but it also politicizes data which need to remain independent and trustworthy.

A blizzard of economic reports has cast a pall on such claims in recent days.This week’s data on Trump’s early economic record was mixed – good, mad and ugly – with jobs numbers so weak he reached for the catchphrase he once used to build himself into a reality TV star:you’re fired.Trump orders firing of labor statistics chief hours after data showed jobs growth slowedRead moreThe picture is chaotic, with robust headline growth in the world’s largest economy, wild swings in trade, and a remarkable slowdown in the labor market.For six months, Trump has staged an extraordinary campaign to overhaul the global economy and extract concessions from Washington’s allies and rivals by threatening and imposing steep tariffs on their US exports.But the unpredictable, erratic rollout of this strategy has already had bizarre consequences.Resilient-ish growthCharts showing GDP growthOn the surface, at least, this week’s deluge of data opened with good news: theUS economyreturned to growth in the second quarter, with gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of economic health – expanding at a rate not seen since last summer.But this followed an unexpected contraction in the first quarter, and underlined some more concerning figures, such as a 15.6% drop in private domestic investment. Businesses have been struggling to keep up with the hour-by-hour jerks and jolts on sweeping economies policies.Yes, there was good growth in the last quarter but in the first six months, the US economy grew at a mediocre 1.2%. The Wall Street Journal called it“the weirdest GDP report ever”.Imports surge and plungeChart of import growthDelve a bit deeper, and you start to see how the US economy is grappling with a series of extraordinary forces as Trump hammers out his trade strategy.Firms spent much of the first quarter waiting for the president to reveal his plans for tariffs: which countries would be targeted, at what rates, and when. They stockpiled, triggering an unprecedented surge in imports that pushed growth into the red.In the second quarter, however, as Trump started to ramp up his economic attacks, imports tumbled at an equally astonishing pace. Net exports – how much a country exports more than it imports – boosted GDP.Interest rates on holdChart of interest ratesThis is Trump’s least favorite chart. Despite his many public demands, threats and attacks, the Federal Reserve has not yet cut interest rates this year.Why? Jerome Powell, the central bank’s chair, has repeatedly argued it should wait and see the impact of the president’s trade strategy before moving. Fed officials are worried that inflation – despite Trump’s claims that it has collapsed on his watch – has actually remained stubborn, and might rise as a result of his tariffs.This has gone down extremely poorly in the White House, where officials are counting down the weeks until Powell’s term as chair ends next May.Jobs growth stallsChart showing job growth over timeData released on Friday fundamentally changed the way US policymakers and politicians think about the economy. Until then, many inside the Fed thought everything was broadly ticking over nicely – andTrump administrationofficials claimed they were overseeing a boom in activity.But July’s employment report revealed far fewer jobs were created that month than economists had expected, and revised down estimates for May and June by an astonishing 258,000. Job creation has stalled.“Look, this jobs report isn’t ideal,” Stephen Miran, chairman of the White House council of economic advisers, told CNN, before suggesting that fading uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy would lead to significant improvement.“It’s all going to get much, much better from here,” he added.Explore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a story that not only drew attention to hislinks to a convicted sex offender, it also risked widening a growing wedge between the president and some of his most vociferous supporters. The White House quickly concluded a full-force response was required.It was Tuesday 15 July. The Wall Street Journal had approached Trump’s team, stating it planned to publish allegations that Trump had composeda crude poem and doodleas part of a collection compiled for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday.The claim would have been damaging at any moment, but the timing was terrible for the president. The Epstein issue was developing into the biggest crisis of his presidency. Strident Maga supporters had been angered by the Trump administration’s refusal to release government files relating to the late sex offender.Trump and his loyal press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reached for the nuclear option. From Air Force One, they called the Journal’s British editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker.View image in fullscreenEmma Tucker.Photograph: Bryan Olin Dozier/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThey turned up the heat. Trump fumed that the letter was fake. Drawing wasn’t his thing.Threats were made to sue, a course of action he had previously unleashed against other perceived media enemies.Washington DC began to hum with rumours that the Journal had a hot story on its hands. When no article materialised on Wednesday, some insiders perceived a growing confidence within the White House that their rearguard action had killed the story. They were wrong.DC’s gossip mill had reached fever pitch by Thursday afternoon. The article finally emerged in the early evening. The city collectively stopped to read.In the hours that followed publication, the tension intensified. Trump revealed he had confronted Tucker, stating the story was “false, malicious, and defamatory”. By Friday, he had filed a lawsuit suing the Journal and its owners for at least $10bn (£7.6bn).Tucker was at the centre of a maelstrom of stress and political pressure. It was the greatest challenge of her two and a half years heading the Journal, but far from the first.Two months in, having been parachuted in from London, she was fronting a campaign to have the reporterEvan Gershkovichreturned from a Russian prison. She had also faced denunciations from journalists as she pushed through a modernisation drive that included brutal layoffs. Her plans focused on giving stories a sharper edge. On that metric, the Trump call suggested she was overachieving.Has the Epstein affair strained Trump’s cozy relationship with the Murdoch media empire?Read moreThroughout her rise, an enigmatic quality has surrounded Tucker. Friends, colleagues and even some critical employees describe an amiable, fun and disarmingly grounded person. Many regarded her ability to retain such qualities in the treacherous terrain of the Murdoch empire as uncanny. The puzzle is exacerbated by the assumption she does not share the rightwing, pro-Brexit views ofRupert Murdoch, News Corp’s legendary mogul.Yet Murdoch doesn’t hand the Journal to just anyone. While thepro-Maga Fox Newsis his empire’s cash cow, the Journal is his prized possession, giving him power and respectability in wider US political circles, as the Times does in the UK. So, why Tucker?The answer, according to people who have worked with her, is her possession of two qualities Murdoch rates highly: a willingness to make unpopular decisions for the sake of his businesses and a lust for a politically contentious scoop.View image in fullscreenA message calling on Donald Trump to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein is projected on to the US Chamber of Commerce opposite the White House on 18 July.Photograph: Alex Wroblewski/AFP/GettyLionel Barber, a former Financial Times editor who also worked with Tucker for the FT in Brussels, said: “She has a very sharp nose for a good news story – always did.”Tucker edited the University of Oxford’s student magazine, the Isis, and joined the FT as a graduate trainee. “She was a very convivial colleague, great company and good on a night out, but you knew when it came down to the work, she would nail it,” said a colleague. “Very hard-nosed.”After stints in Brussels and Berlin, she won a powerful ally in Robert Thomson, then the FT’s foreign editor. Thomson became a close friend to Murdoch, a fellow Australian, while working in the US for the FT. Thomson jumped ship to edit the Times of London in 2002 and in 2008 was dispatched to New York to oversee Murdoch’s freshly acquired Journal. Before he went, Thomson helped lure Tucker to the Times, where she eventually became deputy editor.It was her elevation to editor of the Sunday Times in 2020 that seems to have impressed Murdoch. She showed a willingness to make difficult staffing decisions and widened the Sunday Times’s digital ambitions, recasting the pro-Brexit paper to appeal to a wider audience.It was there she made an enemy of her first populist world leader. Just months into her tenure, the Sunday Times published a damning account of how Boris Johnson, the then UK prime minister, had handled the Covid pandemic.Downing Street erupted, taking the unusual step of issuing alengthy rebuttal, denouncing “falsehoods and errors”. The paper was called“the most hostile paper in the country”to Johnson’s government, despite having backed him at the previous year’s election. Rachel Johnson, the former prime minister’s sister, is one of Tucker’s closest friends.View image in fullscreenA New York City vendor poses with a copy of the Wall Street Journal on 29 March 2024 with a mostly blank front page to mark the one-year anniversary of the imprisonment in Russia of the reporter Evan Gershkovich.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty“I don’t think she was ever reckless,” said one Sunday Times staffer. “But I think she absolutely wanted to push the boundaries of getting as much into the public domain as she possibly could.”Many assumed Tucker’s destiny was to edit the Times, but she was catapulted to New York to run the Journal at the start of 2023, immediately embarking on a painful streamlining process.Senior editors were axed. Pulitzer prize winners ditched. The DC bureau, the most powerful, was particularly targeted with layoffs and new leadership.One reporter spoke of people crying, another of the process’s serious mental impact. It made Tucker’s editorship divisive, leading to the extraordinary spectacle of journalists plastering her unoccupied office with sticky notes denouncing the layoffs.Even some who accepted cuts questioned the methods. Several pointed to the use of “performance improvement plans”, with journalists claiming they had been handed unrealistic targets designed to push them out the door. One described it as “gratuitously cruel”.A Journal spokesperson said: “Performance improvement plans are used to set clear objectives and create a development plan that gives an employee feedback and support to meet those objectives. They are being used exactly as designed.”The Tucker enigma re-emerged at the Journal, as staff noted the same mix of personable demeanour, enthusiasm for stories and willingness to make cuts.View image in fullscreenWall Street Journal editors and reporters listen to Emma Tucker speak about the release of Evan Gershkovich in a successful prisoner exchange in Turkey between the US and Russia on 1 August  2024.Photograph: Chase Gaewski/Wall Street Journal/WSJ/Reuters“She’s very emotionally intelligent – like, the 99th percentile,” said one. They said morale had improved more recently. New hires have followed.A cultural shift on stories also arrived. What emerges is a Tucker Venn diagram. At its overlapping centre lie stories with two qualities: they cover legitimate areas of public importance and aim squarely at eye-catching topics with digital reach.Tucker gave investigative reporters the examples of Elon Musk and China as two potential areas. Some complained the topics were “clickbaity”. However, one journalist who had had reservations conceded: “Musk turned out to be a pretty good topic.” Tucker’s use of metrics around web traffic and time spent reading a story irked some reporters.Headlines were made more direct. Honorifics such as “Mr” and “Mrs” were ditched. There was a ban on stories having more than three bylines. “She loosened a lot of the strictures that we had,” said one staffer. “We’re encouraged to write more edgy stories.”Positioning the Journal as a punchy rival to the liberal New York Times juggernaut may be a good business plan, but doing so while not falling foul of Murdoch’s politics remains a delicate balance.“There’s a particular moment now where theWall Street Journalhas to prove its mettle as the pre-eminent business and financial markets media organisation,” said Paddy Harverson, a contemporary of Tucker’s at the FT, now a communications executive. “They’re up against Trump, yet they have an historically centre-right editorial view. She has guided the paper along that tightrope really well.”Allies said Tucker laid a marker of intent in terms of punchy stories when she published an article on the alleged cognitive decline of Joe Biden. It was initially described as a “hit piece” by the Biden administration. Some see the Epstein story as the latest evidence of Tucker’s shift.There are journalists, however, who blame Trump’s response for giving the story attention it simply didn’t warrant. Others disagree about the extent of Tucker’s changes, pointing to the Journal’s history of breaking contentious stories, including the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. However, the net result of the Epstein letter saga has been to draw attention to Tucker’s attempted change in tone.Trump’s lawsuit means the furore may only just be beginning. Many seasoned media figures assume Murdoch, who does not respond well to bullying, will not back down. However, neither billionaire will relish having to face depositions and disclosures. Any settlement from Murdoch could put pressure on Tucker, depending on its details.Dow Jones, which publishes the Journal,has said it has“full confidence in the rigour and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit”. The courts may yet reject Trump’s case.“I don’t think [Murdoch] will just flop over,” said Barber. “The issue here is that Trump went around boasting that he killed the story … For an editor, that’s very difficult. But I’m pretty damn confident there’s no way [Tucker] would publish without having it properly sourced.”"

Presidentstypically respect its independence, leaving the central bank to make an objective decision – without political interference – about the best policy on interest rates for the US economy.“Too Little, Too Late. Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell is a disaster,” Trump wrote, minutes after Friday’s lackluster jobs report. “DROP THE RATE! The good news is that Tariffs are bringing Billions of Dollars into the USA!”Powell has repeatedly argued that the best approach for the Fed right now is to wait and see the impact of Trump’s aggressivetariffstrategy before cutting rates. But Trump has increasingly used Powell, whom he appointed during his first term, as something of a piñata – repeatedly accusing him of damaging the US economy.Two members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee dissented from its other policymakers’ call to hold rates steady this week, and – to the president’s delight –published their reasonson Friday.“STRONG DISSENTS ON FED BOARD,” Trump wrote, claiming: “IT WILL ONLY GET STRONGER!”By Friday evening, however, Trump’s tone appeared to have changed as he told Newsmax during an interview that Powell will “most likely” stay in his position.Trump said he would remove Powell “in a heartbeat” and said the Fed’s interest rate was too high but added that others have said Powell’s removal would “disturb the market”.“He gets out in seven or eight months and I’ll put somebody else in,” Trump said.On Friday afternoon, another member of the committee abruptly resigned. Adriana D Kugler, whose term was set to expire in January, announced she would step down next week.She did not provide a reason for the move, and will return to Georgetown University as a professor in the fall.“I am especially honored to have served during a critical time in achieving our dual mandate of bringing down prices and keeping a strong and resilient labor market,” Kugler said in a statement.Her resignation creates a vacancy for the White House to fill.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsBusinessDonald TrumpJerome PowellFederal ReserveUS economyTrump tariffsEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The lead had changed hands multiple times, with Pallister taking a remarkable five seconds off her personal best and McIntosh – the 17-year-old phenomwho ended Ledecky’s 13-year unbeaten streakearlier this year – appearing poised to complete a historic title sweep.Backstroke queen Kaylee McKeown pulls off another golden doubleRead moreWith the win, Ledecky extended her perfect record in global 800m freestyle finals to 11 wins from 11, dating back to her breakout Olympic gold in 2012 at just 15 years old. It marks her 23rd career world title, trailing only Michael Phelps’ 26, and her 30th world championship medal overall. Shealso won gold in the 1,500mand bronze in the 400m earlier in the week, her 800–1,500 double once again underscoring her dominance in distance freestyle.“I was really happy, obviously,” Ledecky said afterward. “It’s the fastest I’ve ever been at a world championships. It’s been a great season, and coming into tonight, I knew I was going to be happy with it no matter the outcome. That really took the pressure off and allowed me to enjoy the race and appreciate the moment.”“They pushed me all the way,” she added. “That’s pretty incredible, three of us going under 8:10. I just kept telling myself to trust my legs, because I’ve gotten a bit better at kicking. Just running home at the end.”View image in fullscreenAustralia’s Lani Pallister, top, Katie Ledecky of the US, center, and Canada’s Summer Mcintosh, bottom, compete in the women’s 800m freestyle on Saturday in Singapore.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesLedecky also reflected on her mindset at this stage of her decorated career. “I don’t think I have anything to lose at this point. I’m just enjoying the crowd, swimming against the best in the world. Everyone in that heat is the next generation of swimmers coming up. Just proud to be a part of it.”Saturday’s showdown had been billed as a changing-of-the-guard moment, with McIntoshseeking to match Phelps’s recordof five individual titles at a single world championships, a milestone no female swimmer has ever reached. But beating Ledecky in the 800 always loomed as the toughest obstacle.McIntosh entered the meet in white-hot form, havingbroken three world records in five daysat the Canadian trials and posted the third-fastest 800m time ever in June. She alsohanded Ledecky a rare defeatearlier this year at a sectional meet in Florida.“I think this is a really big learning lesson for me,” McIntosh said. “I went into the 800 free with full confidence … but I’ll try to get this out of my mind quickly and finish strong in the IM.” The Canadian will look to close her remarkable week with a fourth gold in Sunday’s 400m individual medley, where she is the prohibitive favorite.Pallister, who also earned bronze in the 1,500m and finished fourth in the 400m, said the performance exceeded even her own expectations. “I knew I had a sub-8:10 in me,” the Australian told Nine Network. “I didn’t think I’d be 8:05 here, but now I’m really thrilled with that.” The 22-year-old credited her previous races next to Ledecky for building her confidence in the distance events.Ledecky’s gold came on a triumphant night for the United States team, which has endured both illness and criticism throughout the week in Singapore. With Phelps and Ryan Lochtepublicly questioning the team’s managementamid astomach bug outbreak, the Americans responded with their best day of the meet by winning three golds on Saturday and setting a world record in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay.That team – Jack Alexy, Patrick Sammon, Kate Douglass and Torri Huske – clocked 3:18.48, breaking Australia’s 2023 mark. Gretchen Walsh also claimed the women’s 50m butterfly title in 24.83, completing a sprint double after earlier winning the 100 fly.The United States now lead the medal table with eight golds heading into the final day of competition. But no victory resonated more than Ledecky’s, a race that reaffirmed her place atop the sport and reminded the world, yet again, that the queen of distance freestyle still reigns.Explore more on these topicsKatie LedeckySwimmingSummer McIntoshUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Hamilton wasknocked out in 12th, while his Ferrari teammate, Charles Leclerc, went on to take pole position for Sunday’s race, the first the Scuderia has claimed this year.Hamilton did not have an issue with his car on his final run in Q2 in Budapest nor was he impeded, he was simply not quick enough to go through, more than two-tenths down on Leclerc and took himself to task for his shortcoming. “It’s me every time. I’m useless, absolutely useless,” he said. “The team have no problem. You’ve seen the car’s on pole. So we probably need to change driver.”Hungarian Grand Prix: Charles Leclerc grabs pole for Ferrari after Hamilton flops againRead moreHe had signalled his own frustration immediately after completing the below-par lap, admonishing himself as he told his team: “Every time, every time.” When he climbed from the car he walked to theFerrarimotorhome holding his gloves in front of his visor.His exasperation was doubtless compounded by what he called an “unacceptable” error in qualifying at the last round in Belgium, where he could manage only 16th on the grid. Moreover, the Hungaroring is a circuit where the 40-year-old has a record second to none, eight wins and nine poles. However, this is the fourth time Hamilton failed to make the top 10 in qualifying this season and has been beaten over the single lap by Leclerc in 10 of the 14 meetings and is 30 points behind him in the standings.Expectations for the seven-time champion had been hugewhen he joined Ferrarithis season after 12 years at Mercedes, but the transition has been difficult. Adapting to the new car and team is proving a challenge and although he took a win in the sprint race in China he has yet to make the podium this season, the longest period he has gone without making it into the top three.The championship leader, Oscar Piastri, and his title rival Lando Norris had been expected to fight for pole, but the McLaren men had to settle for second and third respectively. Leclerc saw off Piastri by 0.026 seconds, with Norris 0.015secs behind the Australian. George Russell finished fourth for Mercedes.Leclerc said: “I don’t understand anything inFormula One. Honestly, the whole qualifying was extremely difficult. It was difficult for us to get to Q2, it was difficult for us to get to Q3. In Q3, the conditions changed a little bit. Everything became a lot trickier and I knew I just had to do a clean lap to target third.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The club want land used as a rail freight terminal to complete the Old Trafford Regeneration Project, which they claim will bring £7.3bn a year to the UK economy.United have held talks with Freightliner, the haulage company that owns and operates the terminal, about buying the land, but negotiations are deadlocked due to a disagreement over the price.View image in fullscreenFreightliner owns the land next to the existing Old Trafford, where United want to create this new stadium.Photograph: Foster + Partners/PAWhile Freightliner is understood to have expressed a willingness to relocate from Trafford Park to nearby St Helens, the company is seeking around £400m for the land, with United valuing it at between £40m and £50m. Ratcliffe has made it clear United are unwilling to accept the asking price set by Freightliner’s parent company, Brookfield, and initial discussions are believed to have reached an impasse.A source said Freightliner “have United over a barrel”. The company is willing to relocate to a proposed new site that would offer increased capacity for trains, but it is in no rush to move. The club’s view is that Freightliner will only receive what would be a significant windfall if they are willing to drop the asking price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Manchester United unveil 100,000-seat new stadium projectRead moreWhenunveiling designs for the Old Trafford master plan, produced by Foster + Partners, in March, Ratcliffe set an ambitious target of completing what he described as a five-year build by 2030. United had been hoping to begin preparatory building work by the end of this year, but failing to secure the Freightliner site will delay the start date.United’s options at this stage would be to increase their offer, wait for Freightliner to lower its demands, or scale back the project so that the freight terminal land is not required. It is also possible the newOld Trafford Mayoral Development Corporation, chaired by SebastianCoe, could issue a compulsory purchase order, although that would be subject to legal challenges and would lead to further delays.Completion by 2030 was always seen as an ambitious target outside the senior leadership team at Old Trafford, given United have yet to obtain planning permission, secure ownership of all the land required or formally appoint architects. While Foster + Partners produced the artist impressions and videos of the proposed new stadium, the club plan to run a formal tender process to appoint architects.‘Zippos circus is in town!’ Can Man Utd really raise £2bn for a throbbing big top?Read moreAt a Fans Forum event on 30 June, United conceded that securing the land required could prove an obstacle to beginning work this year. United were asked by supporters whether building would commence in 2025 or 2026 and responded: “Planning work is continuing, including the consultations with fans discussed during today’s meeting.“Discussions are also ongoing with local authorities, land owners and potential funding partners with a view to securing the land and the finance we need to proceed with the project. It remains our ambition to proceed with the project as quickly as possible, but we can only do this once the necessary land and funding is in place.”View image in fullscreenHow Manchester United’s new home could look on match days.Photograph: ReutersUnited have estimated the cost of the project at £4.2bn, but claim it will bring huge social and economic benefits to the local community and wider region, including 92,000 jobs, more than 17,000 new homes as well as attracting an extra 1.8 million visitors annually.The cost for the stadium has been projected by United to be around £2bn, although given the tented roof alone is likely to cost £300m, industry sources say £3bn is a more realistic budget. Freightliner’s demands for £400m could result in the redevelopment being significantly over budget from the start.United are not seeking any public money to build the stadium itself. The club declined to comment on a private commercial negotiation.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedManchesterGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

The headlines that he was contemplating a 15-year break from the game didn’t entirely reflect what he said – “I don’t know how long I’ll stop for: a year, two years, three years, five, 10, 15, I don’t know. But I will leave after this spell with City because I need to stop and focus on myself, on my body” – but his weariness was clear.Manchester City’s record £1bn deal with Puma and the value beyond bottom lineRead moreTo an extent it is not a surprise. Jürgen Klopp was exhausted (and self-aware) enough after almost 15 seasons at Dortmund and Liverpool (plus seven at Mainz)to quit last summer. There were times last season, particularly in that four-month spell either side of Christmas whenCity’s form dipped alarmingly, that Guardiola seemed shattered. By his own admission, his decision last Novemberto sign a contract extensionto summer 2027 was motivated in part by guilt at the downturn. “The problems we had in the last month, I felt now was not the right time to leave,” he said. The problems got much worse.To which there can be two reactions. On the one hand, it is rare and admirable that a manager should feel such a sense of responsibility to his club. While many are sacked before they have a chance to resolve problems, there are also plenty happy enough to walk away with a pay-off and pass the crisis on to somebody else. But on the other hand, it probably is not a great sign if a manager with two years left on his contract is already looking forward to the extended holiday he is going to have when it is all over.But management is exhausting. It was striking in the interview that the element Guardiola picked out as most debilitating was having opposing fans chanting he was going to be sacked in the morning, the sort of mundane banter that it is easy to assume just washes off managers as experienced and successful as Guardiola. Beyond that, though, it is useful to be reminded just how tough a job management is and it may be getting even tougher.Over the course of his two autobiographies, it becomes clear how relentless Brian Clough found the grind of management: there was no time to enjoy a victory on Saturday, he said, before he was having to start thinking about the game on Wednesday. That was before the calendar was as packed as it is now and Clough was somebody quite happy to pop over to Mallorca for a holiday during the season, somebody who was noted even at the time for the infrequency of his appearances on the training pitch.View image in fullscreenA crushing 5-1 defeat at Arsenal last season summed up City’s struggles on the pitch.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianManagers today have far more help than they used to. They have specialist coaches and analysts, and their job, at least at the top level, is focused largely on preparing the team. With one or two exceptions, transfers and long-term strategy is the responsibility of a sporting director.But still, it is an often thankless role where successes are quickly forgotten and a few bad weeks can lead to the sack. Guardiola, for all he may have disliked the banter from opposing fans, at least had enough credit in the bank not to fear that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion‘It’s a lonely job’: Neil Warnock on management, Guardiola and his ire for FergusonRead moreAnd he is right; there is perhaps no other job somebody faces such unending scrutiny, such vocal criticism, from people who, frankly, know far less about it than they do (and, yes, that includes journalists, and no, that does not mean all criticism is necessarily misguided).Guardiola has spoken with a degree of enthusiasm about the challenge of rebuilding City. Given he has a naturally sarcastic tone, it is never entirely easy to tell, but that can probably be taken at face value. One of the problems for a manager who has been in a job for an extended time, particularly when they have been as successful as Guardiola, is finding new challenges. Building a team to win the league is invigorating, stimulating, exciting, setting it going again to win again less so.The comedian Stewart Lee wrote in his autobiography about how on long tours he would deliberately lose part of his audience because of the kick he got from winning it back; it is not to suggest Guardiola would have chosen to be in this position to say he may relish the challenge of restoring City to the title.There is another factor, which is that very few managers remain at the very highest level for much more than a decade. Sir Alex Ferguson is an obvious counter-example, 20 years separating his first title at Manchester United from his last, even after his successes with Aberdeen, but he is an outlier who skews expectations. Arrigo Sacchi’s peak lasted about four years. Even José Mourinho was probably already past his best when he won his last league title, at Chelsea in 2014-15, 12 years after his first, at Porto.Every game Guardiola has taken charge of since he was appointed at Barcelona in 2008 has been dissected. For 17 years – less his year off in New York – opponents have been looking for ways to stymy his attacking plans and defensive vulnerabilities. Match footage has been pored over, data crunched. Part of Guardiola’s genius has been to keep evolving, to remain ahead of his pursuers.That has always happened, but never to the same extent as today. Teams have never been worked out so quickly; what might have taken a season 50 years ago now happens in a couple of weeks. To stay ahead is to adapt constantly and that is exhausting. There comes a point when the energy almost visibly leaves a manager, as it did with Mourinho, as it did with Arsène Wenger, and, unable to stay in front of the pack any longer, they lapse into self-parody.Guardiola is not there yet. Managerial arcs rarely end in a cliff edge; it is not that they are suddenly finished. But no career can go on for ever upwards. After 17 years at the top, as he begins to feel the toll, it may be that the descent has begun. Which may still be enough to win City another league title, but nothing lasts for ever.Explore more on these topicsFootballInside footballPep GuardiolaManchester CitycommentShareReuse this content"

We had too many on the pitch today who just did what they wanted to do. When you want to just jog around, there’s a big problem. Some of them have to drop their ego. I’ll look at us tactically and accept my responsibility but today wasn’t really tactical, it was a mentality problem. We got more than we deserved today.”Yet it wasRangerswho started brightest, with home goalkeeper Calum Ward palming a 25-yard free-kick from skipper James Tavernier around a post in the fourth minute, and Kieran Dowell heading Joe Rothwell’s corner over the crossbar. Attacker Djeidi Gassama, who started in place of Findlay Curtis in the only change from Wednesday’s draw with Panathinaikos in Athens, curled a shot wide after taking a pass from Brazilian striker Danilo, who then clipped the bar with a shot from 25 yards.And it seemed all too easy when Tavernier headed in a Rothwell delivery to the back post for his 131st Gers’ goal, after home skipper Paul McGinn had shanked a clearance to concede a corner. But while dangerous in attack, the visitors looked fragile in defence at times and in the 24th minute keeper Jack Butland fumbled an effort from an unmarked Longelo, then blocked the shot on the rebound from striker Apostolos Stamatelopoulos.View image in fullscreenThe equaliser from Emmanuel Longelo left Rangers manager Russell Martin critical of his players.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PABoth sides were intent on playing out from the back and there were numerous turnovers but little in the way of goalmouth action, until Ward made a save from Gassama’s header two minutes after the interval. Minutes later, Callum Slattery’s whipped-in free-kick, after he had been fouled by Tavernier, found Elijah Just at the back post but he could not control his header.Motherwell grew in confidence and newmanager, Jens Berthel Askou – a former teammate of Martin at Norwich – saw Butland make a diving save from McGinn’s low drive after the defender had burst into the box, with John Souttar completing the clearance.Stamatelopoulos headed over from just under the bar and then, with three minutes remaining, Longelo burst into the box and when the ball was cleared, Johnny Koutroumbis returned it into the area, Just chested it back and Longelo drilled it low past Butland for a well-deserved equaliser. And only a fine Butland save in added time from substitute Tom Sparrow prevented a defeat.In his post-match press conference, Martin continued the criticism of his side’s performance. “Motherwell were really good, credit to them. But I said to the players, the problems haven’t been tactical, yet. They’ve been mentality, about energy, about courage, intensity, aggression, to play.”“Today, we go ahead and play some OK stuff. Every time we get in the final third, we turn the ball over and make crazy decisions. They’re either selfish decisions or they’re based on anxiety, so we need to get to the bottom of that. Because there was far too much stuff that we haven’t worked on or haven’t seen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let us be clear: any individuals found to have engaged in such actions will face the strictest possible sanctions, including banning orders and legal action where appropriate.”Addressing the fan directly onSwindon’s YouTube channel, Holloway said: “I’m disgusted by whoever that person was. Whoever you are, you’re not a Swindon fan. I’m not having you, and I hope you get caught. That is absolutely horrific. How dare you put our club in the situation you’ve just done … we don’t want you in football.“If you’ve ripped a seat out and thrown it at somebody, I just can’t stand you, whoever you are. And I will find you. I want us to find that person, and shame them.”Earlier he told BBC Radio Wiltshire: “That’s not right; that’s not football. You think you’re upset and all of this?

Such amazing memories. It was so hard to make the decision. I need a new environment to push myself. I need a little bit of change – 10 years is a long time. I came to north London as a kid, 23 years old, such a young age. I leave this club as a grown man, a very proud man.”Frank had indicated in July that the forward may be on his way out of Spurs and refused to confirm whether Son would remain as club captain for the new season. “If a player has been at a club a long time, then there will always be a decision for the club to take,” Frank said before Tottenham’s first pre-season fixture against Reading on 19 July.Son has been at Tottenham since joining from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer of 2015, going on to score 173 goals in 454 appearances in all competitions. He registered just seven goals in the Premier League last season, when Spurs finished 17th, before lifting the Europa League – the first piece of club silverware of his career – following thevictory against Manchester Unitedin May’s final in Bilbao.Quick GuideSix magic Son moments at SpursShowNovember 2018With Spurs homeless as their new stadium is built, Son provides a moment to remember against Chelsea at Wembley. He chases Dele Alli’s ball down the channel, breezes past Jorginho, cuts inside David Luiz and calmly slots past Kepa Arrizabalaga to make it 3-0 to the hosts.April 2019With the opening game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium goalless after 55 minutes, Christian Eriksen finds Son on the edge of the Crystal Palace area. A couple of touches moves the ball on to his left foot and a finish into the bottom corner is an historic first on new ground.April 2019A couple of weeks later, Son scores two goals in three minutes – the second a trademark curler past Ederson – to give Spurs hope in their Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City in a chaotic tie that ended with Mauricio Pochettino’s side winning on away goals on their way to the final.December 2019The goal that would win the Puskas award. Son collects the ball on the edge of his own box and sets off, picking up more speed as he avoids the trailing legs of various Burnley defenders. Nobody can keep up with him as he streaks through the centre of the pitch and beats Nick Pope.December 2020Some 12 minutes into the north London derby, Harry Kane sends a ball down Tottenham’s left for Son to chase. As Arsenal defenders backtrack towards their own penalty area, the South Korean lets fly and Bernd Leno can get nowhere near an arching shot that sent Spurs on their way to a 2-0 win.September 2022After winning the golden boot the season before, Son started the 2022-23 campaign without a goal in the first six league games. Dropped by Antonio Conte for a match against Leicester, the substitute comes on to score a hat-trick – the first and second goals spectacular ones from distance – and relief is etched across his face.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Winning a title in Europe felt like I had achieved everything I possibly could,” Son added. “I spent a lot of time reflecting on whether I wanted to experience football in a different environment, and I had those conversations with myself over and over again.”View image in fullscreenSon Heung-min with the Europa League trophy.Photograph: Nick Potts/PALos Angeles FC are interestedin bringing Son to MLS and have been tracking the forward for some time but have yet to make an official bid. They signed Hugo Lloris, another Spurs captain, in December 2023. There is not yet thought to be any interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia.Son came on as a substitute in Tottenham’s friendly win against Arsenal in Hong Kong on Thursday and has featured in three of the club’s four pre-season matches this summer. Frank’s side are due to face Newcastle in Seoul on Sunday, when Son is expected to play and captain Spurs in what could be his final appearance for the club.“For me, personally, I would have loved to have worked with this fantastic person and player,” Frank said during Saturday’s press conference. “He is a true Spurs legend in every aspect, one of the greatest players to play in thePremier League. It is never easy to find the perfect timing and me coming in from the side, it makes it a bit easier to end on a high.”View image in fullscreenThomas Frank with Son Heung-min in Seoul.Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/APSon will leave Tottenham with just one trophy, that Europa League triumph under Ange Postecoglou, but also with a host of individual awards, most notably the Premier League’s golden boot, which he shared with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah in the 2021-22 season.He won Fifa’s Puskás award in 2020 for a solo run and finish against Burnley. Despite the presence of Harry Kane, Son won Tottenham’s player of the year three times in the space of four years between 2019 and 2022. He will leave fifth on the club’s all-time list of goalscorers behind Kane, Jimmy Greaves, Bobby Smith and Martin Chivers.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurPremier LeagueHeung-min SonShareReuse this content"

On Saturday, they announced the signing of the goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale from Southampton on a season-long loan.Liverpool have had a £110m bid for Isak rejectedafter their sporting director, Richard Hughes, made an enquiry about the Sweden international’s availability to Newcastle two weeks ago. Newcastle value Isak at £150m.Liverpool’s ‘take it or leave it’ £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by NewcastleRead more“I am very much removed from everything that is happening back home,” Howe said in Seoul, where Newcastle are due to play Tottenham on Sunday. “I was made aware there was a bid yesterday. That bid was turned down before I heard about it.“There are people back in England dealing with the situation. I really don’t know what is going to happen next, but we still support Alex in every way. My wish is still that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.”Isak has not been part of the club’s pre-season tour of Asia, which Newcastle said was due to a minor thigh injury. However, the 25-year-old has been training at his former club Real Sociedad in Spain this week.“I know where he is through the media, so it’s difficult for me to go into any detail,” Howe said. “The situation is far from ideal. It is quite complex.”Isak, who has scored more than 20 Premier League goals the past two seasons, has three years left on his contract. There has been no progress on a new contract for him.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak has not been part of the club’s pre-season tour to Asia.Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesNewcastle are yet to line up a replacement for Isak. They are reported to have made a formal bid of €75m (£65.5m) plus €5m in add-ons to RB Leipzig for Sesko. That is said to match Leipzig’s valuation, but Manchester United are also targeting the forward.“We are looking for the best players that we can get,” Howe said, refusing to comment on Sesko individually. “Whatever our target position is, we’re looking for the best. That’s the only way we’re going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it’s quality over quantity. It always has been.”Newcastle’s opening offer for Yoane Wissa was rejected by Brentford last month, while they were beaten to the signing of Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitikéby Liverpool. “It’s been a challenging summer,” Howe said. “We’ve missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons. But we’re still very competitive and we’re still in there trying to bring very good players to the club and that won’t change until the window shuts.”Newcastle have endured a difficult pre-season with defeats to Celtic (4-0), Arsenal (3-2) and the K-League All Stars (1-0). The Denmark Under-21 striker Will Osula, who scored twice last season, started all three matches in Isak’s absence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a World Cup year, the England goalkeeper has opted for a move away from the Championship side and will play under his former manager Howe at St James’ Park.“Working with the manager and his coaching staff again were a big draw for me,” Ramsdale said. “They’ve already had a great influence on my career and the gaffer turned me from a man into a professional footballer at Bournemouth.

ALL women’s voices?” “Yes.” “Are you married to a woman?” “I am. And she feels the same.” Hmm. To be fair to Dave from Egham, whose name has been changed to protect the confused, the whole setup here was pretty bleak. It was Dave’s destiny a week on from England’s victory at Euro 2025 to find himself going viral after an appearance on LBC radio.In the clip Dave objects to the sound of all women’s voices, even if they’re Adele or Billie Holiday. Specifically he objects to women talking about women’s sport, which Dave hates because it is being thrown down his throat, and thrown down his throat to the extent he has to ring up a radio station and talk about the women talking about the women’s sport, simply to disentangle its tendrils from his throat, to steal a few gargling, sputtering final breaths.Full-backs and future stars: the issues facing Lionesses before World Cup bidRead moreWhat are we supposed to do with this? In Ernst Gombrich’s A Little History of the World, which is the best history of the world even when it’s wrong, he suggests that language evolved because humans were driven by the ice age into caves, forced to find ways of sharing social spaces, that this miracle of industry, sociability, turnip production schemes, and ultimately beauty, poetry and abstract thought, evolved out of a closeness driven by basic human survival.You feel a bit for the cave-human in this context. What have we done with this miracle of human connection? Two million years on, here we are on a radio station designed solely to mainline endless gabbling voices into your weepingly overstuffed consciousness, listening to a man talking in an endless gabbling voice about how the endless gabbling voices torture him, although only voices with undescended larynx folds describing sport, as agreed with by Mrs Dave, who is definitely not a broom handle with a wig and a pair of yellow rubber gloves.And yes, it is easy to laugh at Dave, although not perhaps to dismiss him completely. In part because he isn’t even the least sympathetic person in the clip. That role is occupied by the host, who looks like what happens when a pomegranate with a notably overblown sense of self-regard has somehow grown a goatee and worked out how to sit in a chair, and who clearly knows he has a live one on his hook, that this is rage-content gold, and who reels Dave in like a mutant farmed salmon.But also because while Dave’s pain may be misguided and unprocessed it is also telling us an interesting thing about all this. I got to watch the Euros as a fan, a rare pleasure when you work as a reporter. It was really fun, a chance just to enjoy the games and get to know the players and support whoever was good.The standard was high. The women’s game at this level has distinctive patterns, a pass-and-move sport, a business of close angles and sudden transitions. Often the matches were two or three things at once like an English summer’s day, ranging in a single sitting from slick zippy combinations, to endurance-race wrestle, to shootout drama.View image in fullscreenAlex Scott (left) and Jill Scott do their punditry duties at the Euro 2025 final.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockThe TV coverage was good. The whole thing has calmed down from the early days of being forced to justify its existence, the cult-like vibe where everyone has to be inspirational all the time and the studio chat could feel like an evangelical church coffee morning.The pundits were agreeably cutting when England stumbled. Ellen White is just a really good analyst. Nedum Onuoha was an excellent selection. It was very easy to get lost in it all. Even if, after a while, there was a sense of absence, a missing static field, a tonal difference that Dave does identify, albeit incorrectly.The missing noise here was: noise, the familiar sounds of rage, pain and betrayal. Instead the tone of the women’s Euros was happiness. The players were courteous. Nobody hated anyone else. England wished Spain well on the eve of the final.Mainly it was all just seductively unencumbered, operating in its own energy field, a pitch that became more distinct as the endless gurgle of the Premier League reasserted itself this week. And yes, the klaxon is sounding here. Don’t define women’s sport by men’s sport! But what about the other way round? Because the Euros also illuminated something about men’s sport that feels both blindingly obvious and a little strange in its own right.Why is men’s football defined so powerfully by rage and pain? Why does it reach for these emotions reflexively at every turn? This, I believe is what Dave is really talking about. He doesn’t find women’s sport alien because the voices are women’s voices. He finds it strange because they’re happy, because they’re not talking about the usual things, reaching for that hammy old emotional compass. Is it real if it doesn’t hurt?The women’s Euros seemed able to operate without this burden of history. Evenvictory in a big tournamentwas a joyful thing, not a grimacing, howling assertion of some lost sporting identity. Nobody was being flame-throwered here, no hurt expunged. For those of us afflicted with that endless backbeat of fear and rage it was like the moment the free jazz quartet in the corner of the bar stops playing and suddenly you just get to enjoy your cocktail.The fact is men do sometimes love to fetishise their own pain, their capacity for powerful emotions, to create a sense of quest. Men’s sport has been defined by longing, disappointment, catharsis. This is its cultural heritage. Men like to yearn, to feel tribal. What do I have without my minor chords, my bruises? This vision of winning demands wounds, a narrative of redemption. The Southgate-era men’s team confronted this by falling into a state of premature enragement when it looked like victory might actually be possible. Stop winning wrong. Win more English.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Heroic men aren’t tortured by female voices talking about sport. John Wayne isn’t storming out of the living room because Gabby Logan is on. But then nothing really adds up about the Dave-style objections to women’s sport receiving coverage.View image in fullscreenSome 65,000 fans turned out for England’s victory parade in London.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockDave says women’s football is being thrown down his throat. Well, maybe, but everything is being thrown down your throat. Men’s football, the bacon double whopper, walk-in baths, the car that won’t make you happy. We live in a down-your-throat culture. Why is a few weeks of women playing a ballgame a problem? And not, for example, Pringles or Nigel Farage.There is the objection that women’s football is parasitic on men’s football, that it is not yet commercially self-sufficient. Who cares? This is what growth is. You invest. Currently men’s football is subsidising iffy agents, supercars and money laundering. Why should it not also fund something that’s going to make people kick a ball, be active, feel pleased? What else is sport for, if not that?And this is commercially sensible growth, growth that doesn’t destroy stuff or distort existing leagues or glorify Gianni Infantino. There are no disbenefits to women’s sport being allowed to grow, nothing bad you can point to. Which is fine. But how are we supposed to cope with that?Some parts of the football media have done their best to contort success at the Euros into a more recognisable shape. England won by digging in and being determined. Yes, this is how we beat foreigners now. With will and spirit and traditional values. Sarina Wiegman as wing-commander Charles Reep, Chloe Kelly as the evacuation of Dunkirk. Lucy Bronze and Stuart Pearce, every single one of their limbs broken, standing on the Dover cliffs, waving a single flapping femur in salute to the skies, Does this work? Can we run with it?Really, though, it is simply a process of accommodation. What Dave from Egham is really telling us is that the time is now past where it’s worth broadcasting this stuff. It is simply rage in the dark. It will pass. More vital right now is that sense of clarity around the women’s team, of something existing in its own clean, clear square of light. Can it be preserved?This England group is at a perfect stage in many ways, halfway in and halfway out of its own period of growth. There are still players there who came up in the old days of bandaging their own strains and getting buses to training. There will of course be a fall, a time where there is nostalgia for the current success. But there is also a chance here to subvert this paradigm, to retain that sense of connection, of a victory that felt like happiness not vindication, pleasure not the release from pain, and that was carried to us by women’s voices.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The sacrifice paid off when he blitzed his way to a winning time of 9.94sec at the Alexander Stadium, before paying tribute to his family on the other side of the world.Hunter Bell’s dilemma over audacious bid for double world athletics gloryRead more“Today is a very difficult day for me,” he said. “My auntie is getting buried right now. Her funeral is going on and I’m missing out. I was very close with her, so today was a bit of a mental strength game for me.“I had to keep suppressing inside and I couldn’t speak to my family because I would get emotional. Jeremiah [Azu] was trying to console me because I almost started crying. This win was for her.”As a world medallist, Hughes was already assured of a 100m spot in the British team for next month’s Tokyo world championships, but runner-up Azu now has work to do. The world and indoor 60m champion surged into an early lead before he was reined in heading towards the finish line.His time of 9.97sec will not count as a world championships qualifying standard due to the 2.2m/s tailwind, leaving him three weeks to chase the required 10sec time before the team is confirmed. Louie Hinchliffe, who already has the standard, clocked 10.01sec for bronze.There was drama before the women’s 100m when the favourite Daryll Neita, who finished fourth at the Olympics last year, was harshly disqualified for a false start after twitching in her blocks.Her absence – having clocked a dominant 11.00sec to win her semi-final at a canter – meant no one came close to challenging Amy Hunt, who triumphed in a personal best 11.02sec to secure her seat on the plane for Tokyo.With Dina Asher-Smith – who is contesting only the 200m this weekend – guaranteed her spot, that leaves Neita uncertain of the final place. Desiree Henry, who finished second in 11.32sec, will now attempt an unlikely bid to clock the qualifying standard of 11.07sec. Neita will hope she does not succeed.View image in fullscreenDaryll Neita (lane six) leaves the track after being disqualified in the women’s 100m final.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“It would have been nice to have Daryll in the race,” said Hunt. “That was a big loss. I wanted to come out here and beat her. I want to prove myself in a head to head, so to not get the chance to race her was disappointing for me because I think that would have pushed me to an even quicker time. I personally would have run under protest, but the nature of championship racing is you have to hold your nerve on the line.”Hunt, Neita and Asher-Smith will now battle over 200m on Sunday, with the trio separated by less than half a second on season’s bests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She insisted she will not be affected by the trauma of last year’s Olympics, where she failed to record a single valid attempt when expected to challenge for gold.“It happened. It was just a bad day,” she said. “I definitely don’t think it will happen again and I’ll do everything in my power to make sure it doesn’t happen again. I’ve overcome all the demons that came from it. It’s all in the past.“I would love to get a medal. After what happened last year, I was so focused on getting a medal, I just need to get through qualification first and then think about it.

If the statisticians and bookmakers don’t fancy their chances the team themselves are not just confident but “chilled” about the task they face on day four.“It is a replay from Headingley,” said Josh Tongue. “It will be a great day of cricket and a great day for us if we get the runs. How we play as a batting unit is very positive and very exciting. The batting we’ve got, I can’t see why we can’t give it a good go. We’re pretty chilled. Not much overthinking about it. I don’t see why we can’t chase down these runs.”England suffer late Zak Crawley blow in chase of 374 to win fifth Test and India seriesRead moreEngland scored 50 of them across the final session on Saturday before Mohammed Siraj bowled Zak Crawley with the last ball of the day, giving the tourists a lift in their pursuit of a win that would tie the series at 2-2.“We are really confident,” said their second-innings centurion Yashasvi Jaiswal. “We just need to focus on our process and keep bowling in the right areas. That’s what we are thinking. There’s always movement in the wicket, swing movement and seam movement. It’s not that easy to bat.”With Chris Woakes out of action because of theshoulder injury he sustained on the opening day, England’s three remaining seamers had to bear an outsized burden across India’s second innings. Tongue took five wickets in his 30 overs to finish the series with 19 – England’s best tally, and from only three games – while Gus Atkinson and Jamie Overton bowled 27 and 22 respectively.View image in fullscreenEngland's Josh Tongue celebrates as he leaves the field after his five wicket haul.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It was obviously going to be tough for us bowlers but I thought we stuck at it very well,” Tongue said. “I feel like sometimes I didn’t bowl as best as I could, especially on the first day here, but I’m obviously very chuffed to get the wickets.”Jaiswal’s 118 was the 19th century of a series that has seen plenty of extraordinary batting but the only one so far in this match, while he shared a partnership of 107 – again, the only one in this game to reach triple figures – with India’s nightwatchman, Akash Deep, who scored 66 and was, in Tongue’s words, “obviously frustrating”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s more fun that way.’Ewan Murrayat Royal PorthcawlSat 2 Aug 2025 14.40 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 14.52 EDTShareThere are few things more exciting in golf than a marauding Charley Hull. Not only did we witness precisely that here on Saturday, but Hull sent an errant shot whizzing past the head of Minjee Lee for added theatrical effect.Hull had been battling to make the AIG Women’s Open cut for much of Friday afternoon. She started her third round 11 shots adrift of Miyu Yamashita. Within nine holes, Hull was five under par and on the charge. Birdies at the 12th and 13th meant she was four behind Yamashita. Hull did bogey the 14th, meaning a 66, but Yamashita’s failure to build on her 36-hole position suddenly makes this a highly intriguing scene.Charlie Woods, son of Tiger, fades late and misses out on Junior Ryder CupRead moreShe had one player within six strokes of her at halfway. A messy 74 means her lead is a single shot. Her short putting touch totally deserted her over the closing stretch. Hull is three behind.On the penultimate hole, Yamashita outrageously saved par from 40ft. This was a rare highlight. Thoughts of a procession have quickly vanished. Back-to-back nines of 37 saw to that. The prospect of wind and rain on day four means this could turn into an epic scrap.Hull was in wonderfully bullish mood. “I just enjoy chasing,” she said. “It’s quite fun. I like it. It’s more fun that way. I like hunting someone down.” Will she go for it on Sunday? What a silly question. “100%. I haven’t got anything to lose, have I?”It would, in one sense, be ridiculous if Hull ends her wait for a major on the Welsh coast. She has never been a huge fan of links golf and entered this tournament nursing a back problem. Hull had also revealed she lost four kilograms because of illness aftershe was removed from the course at the Evian Championshipon a medical cart.“Kind of like playing golf with your mates,” said Hull of her mindset for the final round. “You just want to make birdies on every hole. That’s how it feels tomorrow.” Unsurprisingly, she now feels as strong as ever.View image in fullscreenMiyu Yamashita struggled on the greens in the third round on the way to a 74.Photograph: Nigel French/PAHull came close to injuring another member of the field. A rare loose shot, at the 4th, went flying past Lee after a single bounce as she addressed her ball on the 17th tee. The ball rebounded from signage at the back of the tee, meaning Hull was spared a shot from deep rough. “I like Minjee, I wouldn’t want to take her out,” she said with a smile.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m pretty focused. I just reset and then just go hit the ball.”This is not just the Yamashita and Hull show. Yamashita’s wobbling brought a number of players back into the tournament. Kim A-lim is the closest to Yamashita’s nine under. Andrea Lee is a shot further back at minus seven. Megan Khang, Rio Takeda and Minami Katsu are alongside Hull at six under. Georgia Hall will fancy her chances from four under and Hall is a shot ahead of Lottie Woad. Twenty-three players are within seven of what is now very much an under-pressure leader.Explore more on these topicsWomen's OpenGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

Mohammed Siraj, scourge of the hosts 24 hours earlier, sent a searing yorker into Zak Crawley’s stumps to bring about the close and set India on course for a 2-2 draw.All that stands between Shubman Gill’s hardy tourists and this outcome are nine English wickets. And with Chris Woakes unlikely to bat with a dislocated shoulder, it may only take eight. After losing Crawley to the penultimate ball, England will resume in the morning on 50 for one but still with 324 more runs needed to win.Josh Tongue insists England ‘pretty chilled’ at prospect of big run chaseRead moreThe hosts certainly felt like the outside bet when Siraj hit the bullseye and the Indian supporters in the stands erupted. England’s target of 374 may just be three more than theycruised to in the first Testat Headingley but this is a far more capricious surface and the balance of power has long since shifted.Not only that, the highest successful run chase at the Oval is the 263 that England chased down against Australia, nine wickets down, in 1902. A certain Gilbert Jessop struck the record 76-ball century that day – the record that England’s aggressive current generation keep unsuccessfully flirting with.And there is also another injury concern in the ranks. Ben Duckett survived what was a hostile late 14-over burst from India’s quicks but as he walked off on 34 not out, his hand was throbbing after a brutish blow from Prasidh Krishna. If England are to stand any chance of securing a 3-1 series scoreline, they will probably need their incendiary opener fit and firing.If there was confidence to be found for England – and there was little to speak of as Siraj wheeled away in celebration – it came from the 396 all out that India stuck on the board in 88 overs. This was driven by Yashasvi Jaiswal’s 118 from 164 balls, a remarkable 66 from nightwatchman Akash Deep and some late fireworks off the glowing bat of Washington Sundar.The Oval is usually Ollie Pope’s happy place but England’s stand-in captain endured a pretty torturous day. He was hampered by the absence of Woakes, his attack was strung out by just 51 overs of respite between innings, and furtherdamaged by six catches going to groundacross the innings.Jaiswal was afforded two of those lives on the second evening but, after resuming on 51, the left-hander did not offer another until, with the lead already sitting at 250 runs, he slashed Josh Tongue to deep backward point.Even this dismissal was a case of umpteenth time’s a charm, with Jaiswal previously murderous to anything short outside off stump. Mike Selvey once wrote that “were I ever to be condemned to beheading, I would like Robin Smith to be the swordsman” – a line that came to mind every time Jaiswal rocked back and powerfully cut the ball to the rope with precision.View image in fullscreenA kneeling Yashasvi Jaiswal plays a shot during his knock of 118 anchored India’s second innings and put them in the driving seat.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEngland knew all about the 23-year-old’s proficiency here, having witnessed the Jude Bellingham-style century celebration three times previously. More surprising was the identity of his partner during an initial third-wicket stand that, worth 107 runs, represented the highest of this fast forward match.Deep had previously made one half-century in senior cricket but over the course of the first 90 minutes he switched from nightwatchman to fully-fledged No 4. OK, not quite. But until Jamie Overton finally knocked him over, his 12 carved fours and assiduous defensive work demoralised a side that, in theory, should have started out with some optimism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another was Crawley shelling Deep at slip on 21, setting the tone for an innings that eventually climaxed after tea with Sundar hammering 53 off 46 balls.England’s attack was running on fumes by the end, tenderised by Jaiswal class and, continuing a theme of the series, a 77-ball 53 from Ravindra Jadeja. Sundar ruthlessly applied the finishing touches, firing up the dhol drums among the Indian supporters with four fours and four heaved sixes. And no, none were struck off Harry Brook’s liquorice all sorts.Without a frontline spinner to offer both threat and relief, England’s three fit seamers deserve credit for their efforts. Tongue had a second Test five-wicket haul to show for it – five for 125, admittedly – while Gus Atkinson, the most consistent, took his match tally to eight. Among these was Gill lbw for 11 with the first ball after lunch, ending the Indian captain’s mighty series with 754 runs but, curiously, an average of just 13.5 inside the M25.This match has been a struggle for Overton, however, with his right-arm heft less suited to the pitch – his home pitch, no less – and his radar not helped by a lack of form in the lead-up: Deep’s removal ended a run of 63 overs in first-class cricket without a wicket, while Dhruv Jurel, lbw for 34 with a nice outswinger, was just his fourth of the season.While England largely eschewed rotation in the hope of winning this series early – ending up with Ben Stokes injured and both Brydon Carse and Jofra Archer needing a breather – Overton’s selection still felt like one that was made with an eye on the Ashes. With impressive resilience summed up by the indefatigable Siraj, India have simply kept coming.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Pagliuca also would contribute $100m for a new practice facility in Boston for the team, the person said.The person spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Saturday because the deal hasn’t been publicly announced. The sale is pending approval of the league and its Board of Governors.“Relocation decisions are made by theWNBABoard of Governors and not by individual teams,” the league said in a statement.The Sun have played one regular season game at TD Garden eac of the last two years, including one against Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever in July.The league has announced five expansion teams that will begin play over the next five seasons with Portland (2026), Toronto (2026), Cleveland (2028), Detroit (2029) and Philadelphia (2030) joining the WNBA. Each paid a then-record $250m expansion fee.Nine other cities bid for expansion teams, including Houston, which the league singled out as getting a team in the future when it announced Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia in June. Boston did not.“No groups from Boston applied for a team at that time and those other cities remain under consideration based on the extensive work they did as part of the expansion process and currently have priority over Boston. Celtics’ prospective ownership team has also reached out to the league office and asked that Boston receive strong consideration for a WNBA franchise at the appropriate time.”The Boston Globe first reported the sale.The Sun are owned by the Mohegan Tribe, which runs the casino where the team has played since 2003. The Tribe bought the franchise for $10m and relocated it from Orlando that year. The Connecticut franchise was the first in the league to be run by a non-NBA owner and also became the first to turn a profit.The team announced in May that it was searching for a potential buyer for the franchise and had hired investment bank Allen & Company to conduct the probe.The WNBA has experienced rapid growth the last few seasons and ownership groups have been investing more into their teams, including player experiences. That has come in the way of practice facilities. The Sun are one of the few teams in the league that haven’t announced any plans for a new training facility.Connecticut practices either at the arena in the casino or a local community center.Despite the lack of facilities, the Sun have been one of the most successful teams in the league, making the postseason in 16 seasons, including a run of six straight semifinal appearances. But the team was hit hard this offseason with the entire starting five from last season leaving either via free agency or trade.Connecticut are currently in last place in the WNBA at 5-21. The team sent out a letter to season ticket holders last week saying they’d still be playing at the casino next year.The last team to be sold in the WNBA was in 2021 when real estate investor Larry Gottesdiener led a group that bought the Atlanta Dream for under $10m. A year earlier, Mark Davis paid roughly $2m for the Las Vegas Aces.Explore more on these topicsConnecticut SunWNBABoston CelticsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It features former Australian rules footballers battling for a single $US3mNFLpunting contract with the New Orleans Saints.This year’s showdown began with Matt Hayball, a former Geelong Cat and the Saints’ incumbent punter, against James Burnip, a 198cm rookie from Mount Macedon in Victoria, who just wrapped a standout punting career at the University of Alabama. The Saints complicated the battle this week by signing a third punter, American Kai Kroeger.Pipeline of Australian punting talent shakes off backlash to pin hopes on NFL draft | Jack SnapeRead moreOnly one will survive final cuts on 26 August, when NFL teams must slash their training camp rosters from 90 players to 53. The winner will enjoy the spotlight and riches of playing in America’s most popular sports league, while the losers will be unemployed and left with the long shot hope one of the other 31 NFL teams might need a punter.“It’s the nature of the NFL,” Hayball tells Guardian Australia from a boisterous Saints locker room inside the Ochsner Sports Performance Center in New Orleans. “You’re always competing for your position, and it’s the same for every other player in this building.”This isn’t Hayball’s first showdown. Last year, he was the rookie and edged out West Australian and Saints incumbent punter Lou Hedley. A year before that, it was Hedley who was the rookie and ousted the incumbent, American punter Blake Gillikin.View image in fullscreenJames Burnipgoes through drills during practice at a New Orleans Saints minicamp in Metairie.Photograph: Gerald Herbert/APNo NFL team has embraced Australian punters more than the Saints in recent years. They prize their mobility, toughness and versatile kicking skills, honed from years of booting a Sherrin on both feet. Special teams coordinator Phil Galiano even dubbed Hayball “The Aussie Flash” last season after a successful fake punt saw him dash 11 yards for a first down.Despite the cutthroat stakes, Hayball and Burnip maintain a relaxed camaraderie.“There’s only going to be one punter at the end of camp, but it’s friendly,” Burnip says. “We still wake up, get a coffee together, eat, and head out to practice. We’re trying to make each other better.”“James is talented and a good dude,” says Hayball. “It’s a similar situation to last year with Lou. We’re learning from each other while competing. But really, we’re competing against ourselves.”Hayball and Burnip are graduates of ProKick Australia, the Melbourne-based punting academy that has sent several hundred former Australian rules footballers to play with US colleges.“Matt was leaving ProKick for the US when I was just starting,” Burnip says. “We kept in touch whenever he came back to Australia.”View image in fullscreenJames Burnip in Alabama Crimson Tide colours.Photograph: Michael Chang/Getty ImagesLike many before them, both endured the heartbreak of seeing their AFL dreams fade. Hayball was raised in Adelaide, played U18s as a midfielder with the West Adelaide Football Club and was drafted by Geelong in 2015. But after three years playing for the Cats in the second-tier VFL, he was delisted. He joined ProKick, secured a punting scholarship at Florida Atlantic University, and later transferred to Tennessee’s Vanderbilt University.Burnip played junior footy in the Riddell District Football League, but when it became clear the AFL wasn’t in his future, he pivoted. “I found ProKick, and the rest is history,” he says.Burnip landed at US college football powerhouse Alabama in 2021, won the starting job under legendary coach Nick Saban, and became the Tide’s punter for four seasons – although Saban often referred to him as a “rugby player”.While Hayball enters the Saints camp as the incumbent and having led the NFL last season in punts downed inside the opponent’s 20-yard line, recent history favours the rookie. The Saints have opted for the rookie punter in each of the last three training camp duels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those can be game changers.”If Hayball wins the job and stays in New Orleans, he has one non-NFL goal: exploring the Louisiana swamps on an alligator sightseeing tour.“I know [Saints kicker Blake] Grupe is into that kind of stuff, so I might tag along next time he goes,” Hayball says.When asked if Americans might expect him to go full Steve Irwin and jump out of the boat and wrestle an alligator, he grins. “Nah, I couldn’t see myself doing that. Even though our crocs are way bigger in Australia, I still wouldn’t want to share the water with them.”Explore more on these topicsNFLAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, she ran in the opening round of the women’s 100m at US track and field championships in Eugene, Oregon. She has an automatic bye to the world championships in September in Tokyo as the defending champion.The 25-year-old Richardson was booked into the South Correctional Entity (SCORE) in Des Moines, Washington, at 6.54pm last Sunday and released Monday at 1.13pm.“USATF is aware of the reports and is not commenting on this matter,” USA Track and Field said in a statement.Richardson’s agent did not immediately reply to an email request for comment.The police report said an officer at the airport was notified by a Transportation Security Administration supervisor of a disturbance between Richardson and her boyfriend, sprinter Christian Coleman.The officer reviewed camera footage and observed Richardson reach out with her left arm and grab Coleman’s backpack and yank it away. Richardson then appeared to get in Coleman’s way with Coleman trying to step around her. Coleman was shoved into a wall.The report later said Richardson appeared to throw an item at Coleman, which the TSA indicated may have been headphones.In the police report, the officer said: “I was told Coleman did not want to participate any further in the investigation and declined to be a victim.”Richardson won the 100 at the 2023 world championships in Budapest and finished with the silver at the Paris Games last summer. She also helped the 4x100 relay to an Olympic gold.She had a positive marijuana test at the 2021 U.S. Olympic trials and didn’t compete at the Tokyo Olympics.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It’s about to spend hundreds of billions moreTech giants have spent more on AI than the US government has on education, jobs and social services in 2025 so farBlake MontgomerySat 2 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 08.01 EDTShareThe US’s largest companies have spent 2025 locked in a competition to spend more money than one another, lavishing $155bn on the development ofartificial intelligence, more than the US government has spent oneducation, training, employment and social servicesin the 2025 fiscal year so far.Based on the most recent financial disclosures of Silicon Valley’s biggest players, the race is about to accelerate to hundreds of billions in a single year.Over the past two weeks, Meta,Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, Google’s parent, have shared their quarterly public financial reports. Each disclosed that their year-to-date capital expenditure, a figure that refers to the money companies spend to acquire or upgrade tangible assets, already totals tens of billions.Capex, as the term is abbreviated, is a proxy for technology companies’ spending on AI because the technology requires gargantuan investments in physical infrastructure, namely data centers, which require large amounts of power, water and expensive semiconductor chips.Googlesaid during its most recent earnings call that its capital expenditure “primarily reflects investments in servers and data centers to support AI”.Meta’s year-to-date capital expenditure amounted to $30.7bn, doubling the $15.2bn figure from the same time last year, per its earnings report. For the most recent quarter alone, the company spent $17bn on capital expenditures, also double the same period in 2024, $8.5bn.Alphabetreported nearly $40bn in capex to date for the first two quarters of the current fiscal year, and Amazon reported $55.7bn. Microsoft said it would spend more than $30bn in the current quarter to build out the data centers powering its AI services. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the current quarter’s capex would be at least 50% more than the outlay during the same period a year earlier and greater than the company’s record capital expenditures of $24.2bn in the quarter to June.“We will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead,” Hood said.For the coming fiscal year, big tech’s total capital expenditure is slated to balloon enormously, surpassing the already eye-popping sums of the previous year. Microsoft plans to unload about $100bn on AI in the next fiscal year, CEO Satya Nadella said Wednesday. Meta plans to spend between $66bn and $72bn. Alphabet plans to spend $85bn, significantly higher than its previous estimation of $75bn. Amazon estimated that its 2025 expenditure would come to $100bn as it plows money into Amazon Web Services, which analysts now expect to amount to $118bn. In total, the four tech companies will spend more than $400bn on capex in the coming year, according to theWall Street Journal.The multibillion-dollar figures represent mammoth investments, which the Journal points out is larger than the European Union’s quarterly spending on defense. However, the tech giants can’t seem to spend enough for their investors. Microsoft, Google andMetainformed Wall Street analysts last quarter that their total capex would be higher than previously estimated. In the case of all three companies, investors were thrilled, and shares in each company soared after their respective earnings calls. Microsoft’s market capitalization hit $4tn the day after its report.EvenApple, the cagiest of the tech giants, signaled that it would boost its spending on AI in the coming year by a major amount, either via internal investments or acquisitions. The company’s quarterly capex rose to $3.46bn, up from $2.15bn during the same period last year. The iPhone maker reported blockbuster earnings Thursday, with rebounding iPhone sales and better-than-expected business in China, but it is still seen as lagging farthest behind on development and deployment of AI products among the tech giants.Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said Thursday that the company was reallocating a “fair number” of employees to focus on artificial intelligence and that the “heart of our AI strategy” is to increase investments and “embed” AI across all of its devices and platforms. Cook refrained from disclosing exactly how much Apple is spending, however.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What happened when the expert became the patient?An experienced clinician in prosthetics, Jim Ashworth-Beaumont found himself the perfect guinea pig for a radical new option for amputeesSimon UsborneSat 2 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 08.05 EDTShareWhen the air ambulance brought Jim Ashworth-Beaumont to King’s College hospital in south-east London, nobody thought he had a hope. He had been cycling home when a lorry driver failed to spot him alongside his trailer while turning left after a set of traffic lights. The vehicle’s wheels opened his torso like a sardine tin, puncturing his lungs and splitting his liver in two. They also tore off his right arm. Weeks after the accident, in July 2020, Ashworth-Beaumont would see a photo of the severed limbtaken by a doctor while it lay beside him in hospital. He had asked to see the picture and says it helped him come to terms with his loss. “My hand didn’t look too bad,” he says. “It was as if it was waving goodbye to me.”Ashworth-Beaumont, a super-fit and sunny former Royal Marine from Edinburgh, would go on to spend six weeks in an induced coma as surgeons raced to repair his crushed body. But as he lay on the road, waiting for the paramedics, his only thoughts were that he was dying. He did not have the wherewithal to consider the irony of his predicament.In the late 1990s, after he had left the marines, Ashworth-Beaumont, now 59, studied for a degree in prosthetics and orthotics at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. Clinicians in these disciplines help patients with pain, function and mobility by making and fitting devices such as prosthetic limbs and orthotic braces. He had written research papers and trained prosthetists while specialising as an orthotist at the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital (RNOH) in north-west London. “Now I was the patient,” he says.I meet Ashworth-Beaumont for the first time in Greenwich Park, near the south London home he shares with his wife, Keri, a solicitor he met on a night out in 2002. It’s early summer 2024, almost four years after the accident in nearby Catford. He speaks softly through a smile that cracks only when he considers how far he has come and the support he has had: “Without Keri, I think I would have sat in a corner and wasted away.”At first, his missing arm was a low priority for Edmund Fitzgerald O’Connor, the plastic surgeon who attended to his horrific abdominal injuries. But, by another twist of fate, the ambitious surgeon, who is 47, had a particular interest in limb loss. For years, he had been searching for the perfect candidate for a radical procedure he wanted to begin offering to amputees.View image in fullscreenAshworth-Beaumont with plastic surgeon Edmund Fitzgerald O’Connor (left) and implant co-creator Rickard BrånemarkView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Mark Chilvers/The GuardianOsseointegration (OI), or direct skeletal fixation, is a relatively new way to attach prosthetic limbs. Rather than rely on a socket moulded to fit over a residual limb or stump – a method that dates back centuries – arms or legs are attached to a titanium implant inserted into the surviving bone (“osseo” means bone). Fixing a prosthesis to the implant, which emerges from the stump like a little tusk, is as easy as changing a camera lens.OI patients need no longer tolerate irritation or infection where the socket rubs against skin and flesh. They gain a fuller range of motion and improved control and proprioception – the innate sense of where we and our extremities are in space. A prosthesis becomes part of the body rather than an awkward appendage. “It feels like I’ve got my own leg back,” Hanneke Mooij, a Dutch secretary, tells me three years after receiving an implant following decades of torment from ill-fitting sockets.At the same time, rapid advances in electronic limbs mean surgeons can now effectively wire them into the brain. Taken together, OI and the latest prosthetics appear to bring a bionic future within reach. But the technique’s evolution has also been fraught, limiting its adoption. In a small number of cases, implants or bones have cracked. Painful infections have taken hold in the fleshy hole that surgeons must create around the implant. OI is also very expensive at a time when amputees struggle to access basic prosthetics care.You couldn’t have made up a better candidate, but I wasn’t going to tell him until I knew he would surviveFitzgerald O’Connor is convinced more of the 25,000 patients seen by the NHS prosthetics service each year could benefit from OI. When we first meet, the National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence (Nice), the body that issues guidance on NHS treatment and funding, is reviewing OI. “When you’re doing 15 to 20 amputations a year and you have patients coming back with recurrent problems with their stump, it’s saddening to know there’s a viable alternative they can’t access,” he says.The surgeon had been building a team to start offering OI, in the private sector at first, when he got the call from King’s. He had been searching for a patient who was resilient and in good health, who could help drive wider acceptance of the technique. If Ashworth-Beaumont could fund his treatment, his professional knowledge of what it takes to come back from a traumatic amputation would be a bonus. “You couldn’t have made up a better candidate,” Fitzgerald O’Connor says. “The conversation started in my mind the day he came in, but I wasn’t going to bring it to him until I knew he would survive.”Osseointegration relies on a process that was discovered by accident. In the 1950s, Per-Ingvar Brånemark, a Swedish scientist based in Gothenburg, put optical devices housed in titanium into the legs of rabbits to observe the way bones heal. Once the study was over, the metal had fused to the bone and couldn’t be removed, defying conventional wisdom about the body’s tendency to reject foreign objects.The discovery inspired Brånemark, who died in 2014, to invent dental implants, first used in the 1980s, that fuse to the jaw with titanium screws, removing the need for dentures. Wondering if the bond could hold larger devices, Brånemark and his son, Rickard, an engineer training as an orthopaedic surgeon, designed a larger implant. In 1990, they screwed two into the above-knee stumps of a woman who had been run over by a tram.The procedure was eye-catching, evoking scenes from science fiction –Star WarsorThe Six Million Dollar Man. It was also divisive. “I remember lecturing in the US in the late 90s when this senior professor stood up and said, ‘Only an idiot can believe this will ever work,’” says Rickard Brånemark, 65, who founded Integrum, the first OI company, in 1998. But a handful of enterprising surgeons saw an irresistible logic in bone-anchored prosthetics. Integrum soon had competition.In Sydney, Australia, Munjed Al Muderis, an Iraqi-born orthopaedic surgeon who had fled Saddam Hussein’s regime after refusing to cut off the ears of draft dodgers, developed his own device, which he first implanted in 2008. He says patients have received more than 2,000 of his implants, which are hammered rather than screwed into bone. (Brånemark says surgeons have installed more than 700 Integrum devices.)View image in fullscreen‘I see it almost as a duty to explore the possibilities.’Photograph: Sophia Spring/The GuardianAl Muderis, 52, is the technique’s most bullish advocate. He is now offering it to victims of vascular conditions including diabetes, the biggest cause of leg amputations. (Other surgeons typically turn down such candidates, fearing their rehabilitation could be hampered by lifestyle factors.) “There is a big opportunity for this technology to take over from the traditional socket-mounted prosthesis,” Al Muderis insists via Zoom as he changes out of his scrubs.The surgeon tells me about a current case he says demonstrates OI’s potential – a seven-year-old Iraqi orphan who lost an arm in a roadside dog attack while he slept. He was later adopted by a wealthy Chinese family. In the coming months, Al Muderis plans to fit the boy with an implant, which will need to be replaced as he grows. Unlike other OI surgeons, he argues that children can be suitable candidates despite the need for further operations. In the case of leg amputees, he says, OI gets children walking again sooner. “It’s all a balance,” he adds, pointing out that sockets in children need changing a lot more often than OI implants.The boy will also undergo a procedure called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), which involves rerouting amputated nerves. This can help relieve pain in the stump, where the severed nerves can thicken into tumour-like neuromas. Remarkably, it can also help amputees control prosthetic limbs with their minds.I knew these things professionally, but it really brings it home when you first try to move your shoulder and nothing happensTo achieve this, Al Muderis will surgically attach the severed nerves, which had travelled to muscles in the boy’s arm and hand, to small, inessential sections of muscle in his chest instead. Tiny electrodes implanted under the skin will connect these muscle sites to the prosthetic arm via eight cables wired through the body and the titanium implant. When the boy moves to grab a water bottle, his brain will activate the chest muscles, which will forward the signal to the corresponding motors in his arm and hand. “It’s amazing because the transmission is instant,” Al Muderis says of TMR, which he adds is not yet widely available.Integrum has also adapted its implants to allow amputees to upgrade to TMR and other advanced control systems in the future. Yet Al Muderis – who, like Brånemark, has been to Ukraine to offer OI to injured soldiers – says scepticism holds back the technique, including in the UK. He partly blames regulations and resistance to the idea of an implant that perforates the skin: “This is a completely revolutionary technology which violates many of the principles of orthopaedics.”Brånemark is more conservative but also thinks far more amputees could benefit than the few thousand globally who have implants. When Fitzgerald O’Connor told him about his plans and the unlikely case of the one-armed prosthetist, the Swedish surgeon agreed to back his British OI team and oversee its first operation. “A lot of people still don’t know about OI, even in Sweden,” Brånemark says. “As someone who also works in the field, Ashworth-Beaumont can be a really good advocate.”For weeks, HIs life hung in the balance. He had lost almost all liver and kidney function. Sepsis set in as he lay in a coma. His first wife and their two grown-up children came down from Scotland to say goodbye. “The first thing I remember, coming out of the coma, was my daughter’s face; it’s still a really strong image in my mind,” Ashworth-Beaumont says. He thinks he inherited his fighting spirit from his father, a docker’s son from Liverpool, who worked as a bellboy before becoming a successful restaurateur. His mother still runs a gift shop in her 80s. He also has childhood memories of a cousin who lost his legs in a car crash. “I guess amputation was always on my radar,” he says.After struggling to focus at school, at 16 he joined the marines, where he excelled. Fitness was a passion, and he became skilled in mechanical and electronic engineering, which led to his prosthetics career. In the final year of his degree, begun in 1996, he worked at Steeper, a British prosthetics firm that would one day supply his motorised elbow. He joined the RNOH in 2005 while racing in triathlons and moonlighting as a personal trainer. He was at peak fitness when the lorry hit him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He would need a highly functional prosthesis; his job is physical, requiring the manipulation of limbs, as well as the making and fitting of devices. He was all ears when Fitzgerald O’Connor shared his plans. He also knew it would take time, and that the advice in prosthetics care is to try standard devices first.It was almost a year after his accident, when he was about to return to work, that Ashworth-Beaumont received a body-powered arm on the NHS. These mechanical devices are a step up from static prostheses, which can incorporate hooks or skin-coloured hands. By rounding his shoulders, he could open a metal claw attached by a cable to a back harness: “It works, but the technology has been around for hundreds of years.”Socket attachments date back to the 16th century or earlier. Designs and materials have changed, but the principle is the same: a socket must grip the stump for good function but not so tightly as to cause discomfort. Suction helps keep a socket on, but Ashworth-Beaumont needed strapping to pull his against his short stump, which further limited comfort and mobility. He ended up wearing the arm for just a few hours a day at work, and describes a circular problem for arm amputees. The motivation to use a prosthetic leg is high, to avoid relying on crutches or a wheelchair: “But there’s so much we can still do with one arm.” Patients tend to get frustrated with prosthetic arms, often stashing them away and making do. Ashworth-Beaumont says this partly explains a reluctance in the NHS to offer advanced devices, particularly early on. “But the problem is they’re also not giving people the opportunity to try these components when so many of us would benefit.”View image in fullscreenAshworth-Beaumont’s previous arm …View image in fullscreen… and his latest model. Photographs: Sophia Spring/The Guardian. Styling: Hope LawrieHe went private to get a better arm sooner, using money raised from a legal settlement with the lorry company and a family crowdfunder. Working with Alan McDougall, a prosthetist at Proactive, a private clinic in Surrey, he upgraded to a stealthy black electric device with motors in the elbow, wrist and hand. He learned to flex his residual biceps and triceps independently to activate the motors, via sensors built into the socket. Subtle hand movements allowed him to adopt different grips. It’s a step below TMR, but it works: I see it in action when we next meet and Ashworth-Beaumont gives me one of the firmest handshakes I’ve had.The electric arm, which is worth more than £100,000, meant he could do more, but it further exposed his socket’s shortcomings. It was heavier than the NHS device, requiring a tighter, less comfortable fit. He could pick up a mug, say, but the flesh interface also made it hard to position the hand precisely, creating a lag between brain and hand. OI increasingly felt like the solution. Ashworth-Beaumont considered himself an overqualified guinea pig with an opportunity to highlight his profession and widen access to the latest tech. “I see it almost as a duty to explore the possibilities,” he told me in 2021, when I first got in touch.Ashworth-Beaumont would not be the first British amputee to receive an Integrum implant. Starting in the late 90s, Brånemark’s new devices were used in a trial involving 18 patients at Queen Mary’s hospital in Roehampton, south-west London, where the modern British prosthetics industry emerged after the first world war. While the trial had some success and provided valuable data, the experience of its least fortunate participants still reverberates around the field and the debate about NHS provision.Gemma Trotter, a fitness instructor from south London, was 16 when she had a leg amputated above the knee after a car crash. Held back for years by uncomfortable sockets, she set aside her reservations about OI, which she had viewed as “crackers”, and joined the trial in 2003, aged 21. It was transformative. “Suddenly I could feel the floor through my leg again. If I wore jeans, a lot of people didn’t even know I was an amputee,” she says. “I got married, had a baby … they were the best nine years of my life.”Then the implant broke and became infected. By then the trial team had disbanded, limiting follow-up care. Trotter, now 42, has endured more than a decade of pain and attempted fixes by surgeons including Brånemark. She is waiting to have her third implant removed after more problems, and won’t risk having another. (Brånemark tells me that, while there is a risk of failure with any implant, Integrum’s success rate has significantly improved since the Roehampton trial.)Trotter remains one of only a few dozen patients in the UK who have had OI, which is more widely available in countries with insurance-based health systems. Hanneke Mooij, the Dutch patient, is surprised to hear OI is hard to access in the UK. She received an Integrum device in 2022, 36 years after losing her leg in a motorbike crash. She is part of a Dutch group of 20 one-legged female friends who call themselves “the flamingos”, half of whom have had OI surgery in the past few years. “I’m convinced this is the future,” she says.Most British OI recipients are patients at Relimb, a private clinic founded at the Royal Free hospital in north-west London in 2018. Its directors, Norbert Kang and Alex Woollard, use Al Muderis’s implants and have about 60 patients on their books, almost all funded by legal settlements after traumatic accidents. Partly with the Roehampton trial in mind, they do not think the NHS has the resources to offer the skilled and long-term care required to make OI successful. “No matter how beneficial it is and how well we can do it now, we’re not going to change health economics,” Woollard says.I went out for​ dinner for my birthday and used a knife and fork​ properly. I feel​ more competentHe and Kang are not alone in having doubts. Nicky Eddison, chair of the British Association of Prosthetists and Orthotists, says the professions are already facing a staffing and recruitment crisis, and some NHS trusts are making do with just two specialists. “Whatever technical advances you make, we can’t deliver them without skilled clinicians,” she says.Yet proponents of OI make a case for long-term cost savings. Stephen Cruse, founder of the Amputation Foundation, a charity in Merseyside, had OI surgery with Al Muderis in 2016, eight years after losing his legs in a car crash while in Australia. After returning to the UK, he convinced an Australian government compensation scheme to fund his surgery after calculating it would save money in five years. “They were paying about £30,000 a year on sockets, liners and maintenance,” says Cruse, who had a “nightmare” with sockets but now rarely needs to see his prosthetist.Last December, Nice published new guidelines. It now recommends that OI can be used in the NHS but only by multidisciplinary teams with specific training, and the NHS tells me its policy – not to offer it widely – isn’t changing, based on the risks and its funding priorities. Fitzgerald O’Connor says there may be ways to secure funds in exceptional cases, and he will continue to push for wider access as evidence of OI’s efficacy grows. “To leave it in a silo, where it’s only accessible with vast amounts of money, does a disservice to patients who are suffering,” he says.After long delays caused by Covid and post-Brexit paperwork, Ashworth-Beaumont finally gets a date for his private surgery: a Saturday in October 2024. “I tend to take things in my stride, but it feels like jumping out of a plane,” he tells me a few weeks before the operation. “You know the systems are there to protect you, but there’s always that 1% chance things could go awry.”The day before the surgery, which will take place at St Thomas’s hospital in central London, I join Ashworth-Beaumont at a private clinic farther up the Thames at Battersea power station. Fitzgerald O’Connor and Aaron Saini, an orthopaedic surgeon who is also part of the new OI team, have gathered amputees and professionals to discuss this case and prosthetics technology more widely. The subject of NHS care keeps cropping up.Craig Mackinlay, a former Conservative MP from Kent, lost all four limbs to sepsis in 2023. Five months later, he received a standing ovation when he strode into the House of Commons wearing prostheses. Fitzgerald O’Connor, who performed the amputations, looked on from the public gallery. It was a triumphant comeback, but Mackinlay has since highlighted NHS shortcomings, including long waits and early black rubber prostheses that resembled “clubs … I couldn’t see what they’d be good for apart from breaking windows or pub fights.”Mackinlay, now a life peer, has since gone private, with support from device firms and his own money. In a debate in the Lords this May, he said he would still be in a wheelchair had he not accessed better legs sooner. “The technology is out there and the NHS will give some of it to you, but it takes years,” he says. “Why are we holding people back?” In response, Baroness Merron, a health minister, announced a review of the provision of advanced prostheses. In a statement, an NHS spokesperson insists that it “provides a comprehensive package of care and support for people who have lost limbs, including a range of prosthetics”.View image in fullscreenAshworth-Beaumont ahead of his operation, with Fitzgerald O’Connor (left), Brånemark (right) and orthopaedic surgeon Aaron SainiView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Mark Chilvers/The GuardianWhen I ask Ashworth-Beaumont if everything is starting to feel a bit real, he takes a deep breath. “This is all positive,” he says, his voice cracking. “Sorry, I’m just thinking about the last four years.” Fitzgerald O’Connor places a hand on his shoulder. “It was tough, but you made it,” he says. The next morning, Brånemark, Fitzgerald O’Connor and Saini screw the Integrum implant into Ashworth-Beaumont’s humerus, carefully rebuilding his soft tissue around it. “I’ve been walking around like I’m made of crystal,” he tells me two days later via Zoom as he waits for bone and metal to bond.Not long after Christmas, he is ready for an arm. McDougall has adapted Ashworth-Beaumont’s body-powered device so he can attach it to his implant. Even with the encumbrance of the cable and harness needed to move the hand, he is struck by the enhanced control of a firmly anchored limb. “I went out for dinner with Keri for my birthday and used a knife and fork properly,” he says. “I feel more competent as an individual.”By early March he is ready to go full bionic, connecting his heavier electric arm. At Proactive, plaster casts of stumps stand like sculptures in the workshop. As well as adapting the more advanced arm, McDougall has added a small cuff to house the muscle sensors that used to sit inside Ashworth-Beaumont’s socket. The arm would look at home in a sci-fi props department, with its carbon fibre-effect shell and translucent glove, which reveals some of the hand’s moving parts. Then there’s the gap in the upper arm, where only the titanium implant links flesh to hardware. Yet when the prosthesis hangs from Ashworth-Beaumont’s shoulder, it somehow looks like part of him. Without the socket and straps, his silhouette is symmetrical: he is whole again.Soon motors whirr as he tests his bionic joints, raising his arm above his head in a way he hasn’t been able to do since the accident. McDougall adjusts it using a Bluetooth-connected iPad app. “This is really good,” Ashworth-Beaumont says as he picks up a stray screw from a workbench. Within days, he’s performing tasks previously beyond him. Hoovering feels like a privilege.Five years after his old arm appeared to wave goodbye, Ashworth-Beaumont is as aware as anyone of the limitations of the health service. “I’ve spent, what, five hours with Alan today, there’s no way you’d get that time in the NHS,” he says. While he watches the OI debate continue, returning to his own NHS job has felt like his biggest achievement. As well as being able to meet the physical demands of his work, his ordeal has changed his relationship with patients. “I was quite emotional about it after my first few appointments,” he says. “I really did know how they felt.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleMedical researchMedicineHealthDisabilityHealthcare industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first: “What the hell, that can’t be real.” The second: “There’s got to be a film about this – I want to watch it so badly.”There wasn’t a film about competitive spreadsheeting, so Kraskov decided to make it herself. The subject appealed to the director, whose work captures “different inner worlds that are a bit unusual on the outside”, including a short film titled Party in the Back, about a mullet festival.Spreadsheet Champions, which will screen at the Melbourne international film festival, follows six young competitors from around the world as they head to Florida for the 2023Microsoft Office Specialist world championshipto showcase their skills. It might sound silly, but Excel is an incredibly sophisticated application – according to the documentary, the average person uses only 10-15% of its capabilities, but would-be competitors are required to understand closer to 70% of what it can do.The competition is built and run by Certiport, a performance-based examination provider, and officially endorsed by Microsoft. It’s a two-parter: the first half tests proficiency in formulas, functions and features through a series of complex questions, graded on both accuracy and speed. The second section is a more creative application of this knowledge – as Kraskov puts it, “understanding the story of the data, or the soul of what it is actually telling you”.View image in fullscreen‘It helped me a lot’ … Carmina, the teenage competitor from Guatemala, in Spreadsheet Champions.Photograph: Supplied by Melbourne international film festivalThe championship has run since 2002 and is open to students between the ages of 13 and 22. Each competitor first has to qualify as the best in their home country. For such an esoteric endeavour, the stakes are oddly high – the MOS championship only allows competitors to enter once in their lives.“In most sporting competitions, you have your main players that come back every year and your very set rivalries – but for this competition, they can only compete once, so everyone that’s coming through can never come back,” Kraskov says.“They qualify in their home countries at vastly different times around the world, so it made it really challenging for us – but as soon as anyone qualified in a country that we could go to, we would talk to them on Zoom, and work our way down from there.”The six competitors in Spreadsheet Champions are Alkimini, 20, from Greece; Braydon, 16, from Australia; Carmina, 16, from Guatemala; De La Paix, 19, from Cameroon (who doesn’t have a laptop or wifi, so had to study at school); Mason, 15, from the US; and Nam, 21, from Vietnam. Each contestant has personality quirks which shine through in the film – from the camera-shy and stereotypically “nerdy” to the charismatic and boisterous. “Our intention is really about how amazing this competition is – we’re not here to make fun of or disparage anyone,” Kraskov says.View image in fullscreenDe La Paix, right, from Cameroon, doesn’t have a laptop or wifi, so had to prepare for the competition at school.Photograph: Supplied by Melbourne international film festivalKraskov and the film’s producer, Anna Charalambous, spent about a week with each competitor in their home country, observing their day-to-day lives, from home to school, and spending time with their family and friends.“People reveal themselves a lot if you just pay attention to how they live their lives,” Kraskov says. “Teenagers are not quite fully formed adults yet, so they don’t really connect things about themselves or their personalities – they just live their lives. The parents were so insightful and knowledgable about their kids – it gave us a lot of information about how they would potentially thrive or struggle, and who they really were.”Many of the contest’s specifics are shrouded in secrecy, which posed another challenge for the film-makers. The competition is overseen by a man named – in a wonderful example of nominative determinism – Bing.“It’s so high-level security,” Kraskov says. “Bing eventually trusted us and gave us questions that would be retired … At the end of the day, he has to deliver a hardcore, secure, world-expert level exam the next year, and our priority is to show the complexity of what it is and what they’re doing.”Participating in the MOS Championship can set these kids up for adult life. Carmina, the Guatemalan competitor, is now 18 and studying mechatronics engineering at university. In the film, she is shown as a bubbly, bright teenager who loves One Direction (she still does) and excels at, well, Excel.‘You didn’t just succeed, you Exceled’: Sydney man dubbed the ‘Annihilator’ wins spreadsheet world championshipRead moreWatching the documentary transported Carmina back to the competition and her younger self – and made her realise what she took from the experience. “I knew the results already, but watching it again [I felt] a little bit of suspense,” she says. “I tend to doubt a little bit of myself and with that experience [of competing] I learned to just go into it and try things out … It helped me a lot.”Spreadsheet Champions had its world premiere at SXSW in Texas earlier this year and five of the six students will be in Melbourne to attend Miff. Kraskov is proud to shine a light on them – everyday people doing something a little different with their lives.“Celebrities, musicians and models get plenty of attention,” she says. “But people that dedicate their lives to things that a lot of people don’t care about – I find that so much more fascinating.”Spreadsheet Champions airs at the Melbourne international film festival from 10-24 August;see here for all dates and locations.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsMicrosoftComputingMelbourne international film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s essentially a piece of Velcro that goes around your face to provide what the marketing copy describes as “targeted compression for shaping & sculpting” via “collagen yarn”. No, I don’t know what that means either.While I may be a tad unclear on how “collagen yarn” is supposed to work, I can tell you exactly how the Kardashian-Jenners operate: if there’s an insecurity that can be monetized, they’ll find a way to monetize it. Over the years the reality-TV-famous family have built an empire flogging everything from dubiousdetox teasto skincare products while posting heavily edited images that reinforcetoxic beauty standards. The new face wrap appears to be an attempt to cash in on growing interest around what has been dubbed a “snatched jawline” – which is essentially a very chiselled jaw. A number of dubious products, including jaw massagers and “mastic chewing gum”, have popped up, promising to help you achieve this look. Now Skims has come out with its own exciting face innovation to get into the action.The medical-looking Face Wrap also seems to play into the way in which plastic surgery has become normalized. Celebrities used to be fairly hush-hush about going under the knife. Now they’respilling all the details aboutwhich doctor they went to for their procedures and how much it cost. One surgeon told People magazine that the public is starting to see plastic surgery as just “another form of self-care”.Will the ghost of Epstein finally bring down King Trump? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWhile Skims’ new face wrap may scream “useless gimmick that promotes unhealthy beauty ideals”, it has already sold out and generated one unusual celebrity endorsement. In anInstagram videoposted on Thursday Anthony Hopkins sported one of the Skims masks and jokingly slipped back into his Silence of the Lambs character,“the late, great Hannibal Lecter”, who wore a similar chinstrap in the film to curb his cannibalism. “Hello Kim, I’m already feeling 10 years younger,” Hopkins says. In a caption he added: “Don’t be afraid to come over for dinner.”Also chiming in on all the Skims chatter is Katie Piper, a model and TV presenter who was the victim of anacid attackin 2008 orchestrated by her ex-boyfriend. In aTikTok posted on FridayPiper said that the Kardashians’ “latest offering” reminded of her what she had to wear during her burn survivor recovery. “Please, people, don’t imprison your face in this contraption,” Piper says. “Don’t be so cruel and unkind to your face … to encase it in a stupid strap that, by the way, does absolutely nothing.”Amen to that. While it may be obvious, it’s worth reiterating that the Kardashians and other celebrities don’t look the way that they do because they strap medieval-looking torture devices around their faces while they sleep. Rather they shell out for expensive procedures like$100,000 deep plane faceliftsand$500,000 facial rejuvenations. In 2023 Sharon Osbourne told theTelegraphthat while she hadn’t kept a running total of how much she had spent on cosmetic surgery, “it must top more than a million.” You can buy whatever sort of body you desire these days – it’ll just cost you an arm and a leg.Anti-abortion Texas Republican accused of paying for abortionsThe Republican state representative Giovanni Capriglione played an instrumental part in ensuring Texas has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the US. Now a former adult entertainer called Alex Grace hasclaimed that she was romantically involvedwith Capriglione – who is married with kids – for almost two decades and he “funded several abortions for his own personal gain”. (There are some other extremely disgusting allegations involving cookie batter that I won’t repeat.) Capriglionehas admittedto having an affair but says the rest of the story is lies.

He’s never before appeared so flustered, forced to answer question after question about the women and girls whose lives were destroyed by his former “best friend”.The world may never know what is inside the so-called “Epstein files.” What is clear is that the contents are damaging enough for the president and his human flak jackets to call the whole affair a “hoax”, recess Congress to prevent a vote on releasing the materials and send the deputy attorney general to visitTallahassee, Florida, to speak to theconvicted child sex traffickerGhislaine Maxwell, who was subsequently moved to a“cushy”,celebrity-riddledminimum security prison in Bryan, Texas.As the conservative pundit Bill Kristolnotedover the weekend: “[Richard Nixon] said of Watergate, ‘I gave them a sword. And they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.’ Trump may have given us a sword. We should use it.” Kristol is right, to a point. Liberals, progressives and never-Trump Republicans must not let voters forget Trump’s festering, open wound without neglecting the kitchen table, cost-of-living matters that hurt them last fall.Ghislaine Maxwell is not a victim. And if she is pardoned, it won’t be for the sake of justice | Arwa MahdawiRead moreIn 2007, a far sharper and far more spry Joe Biden delivered aquipso clever and cutting that it ended another man’s entire political career.Rudy Giulianiwas never able to recover after Biden observed how it seemed “there’s only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb, and 9/11”. The line was funny because it was true; it was lethal because it exposed the emptiness behind the former New York City mayor’s tragedy-fueled candidacy.This is the challenge for Democrats: how do they maintain a spotlight on a scandal that reveals Trump for who he is in a way thatfinallyresonates with his base without appearing to exploit a tragedy , à la Giuliani? They must ground the abstract conspiracy in everyday terms relatable to the average American.It goes like this: Trump protects elites.Say it in every stump speech, vent about it in vertical videos and keep it alive as a dominant narrative in the zeitgeist. Do not back away. The modern media environment rewards repetition and omnipresence, so Hakeem Jeffries should promise an Epstein select committee, Chuck Schumer should make Republicans release the Epstein files in return for votes to fund the government, and every leftwing activist in the country should be burying Pam Bondi’s justice department in a blizzard of Freedom of Information Act requests.In doing so, recognize that the response to the scandal is an encapsulation of a deeper truth that voters already feel. The president and the GOP protect the elite at the expense of ordinary Americans.Savvier Democrats get this. Some of the party’s best communicators have already been grasping for a message along these lines, as seen in the focus on Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders’s nationwideFighting Oligarchytour. But while those efforts have paid some political dividends, they have not come close to capturing the public imagination to the degree the Epstein files have.For at least some portion of the Maga movement, the past three weeks have finally managed to expose Trump for the hobnobbing, name-dropping, pompous ass that he’s always been. Why is this one particular story so effective – especially as most voters have known Trump to be a plutocratic wannabe for decades? Maggie Haberman’shypothesisis noteworthy: New York high society operates in two concentric circles. The Big Apple has a glittering “elite” withstatusat the center of a broader ring that wieldspower.Trump has always tried to straddle those rings, painting himself as the renegade billionaire. The Epstein affair shatters that mythos. It casts him not as a brash, bull-in-a-china-shop outsider but as the ultimate insider, rubbing shoulders with the very aristocracy his campaign rhetoric promised to upend.Democrats must lead with Epstein. Then they need to connect it to the president’s myriad failures. Why did Trump cut taxes for the richest Americans while cutting Medicaid in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act? For the same reason he is protecting Epstein and his buddies. Why is Trump risking union jobs in auto manufacturing so he can have a trade spat with Mexico and Canada? For the same reason he is protecting Epstein and his buddies. Why isDonald Trumptalking about firing the head of the Fed? For the same reason he is protecting Epstein and his buddies.Mallory McMorrow of Michigan, a Democratic Senate candidate, is already reading from this script. In recent weeks, she has demonstrated mastery in pairing Epstein with broader anti‑elite rhetoric. In onevertical video, she emphatically declared:This is exactly why there’s eroding trust in our institutions, because until we confront the rot that exists in our institutions, until we hold everyone, everyone accountable under the same set of rules and laws, we will keep living in a country where there are two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful, and one for everybody else. We deserve better. Release the files now.Trump’s friendship with Epstein is a proof point for elite favoritism and all of us who oppose the orange god king must use it to condemn inequality and unaccountable power within the GOP ecosystem.The Epstein scandal has captured our attention not just because it’s a lurid horror story, but because it confirms a truth people already believe: the rich view them as objects for exploitation. And if there’s one thing Trump has successfully messaged to all Americans, it’s that he’s very,veryrich.Epstein is the story. But he is also a stand-in for every closed maternity ward in a rural county, for every mom choosing between insulin and groceries and for every veteran battling the Department of Veterans Affairs while Silicon Valley billionaires buy senators. Democrats’ message is simple enough, actually: “Trump and the GOP protect the elite. They abandon you.”Think this messaging can be overdone? Look no further than Benghazi, a truly made-up scandal, which Republicans turned into a true political liability with Hillary Clinton’s emails. That story stuck because of repetition and omnipresence, but also because it struck a chord with something Americans already believed: that the Clinton family viewed themselves as above accountability.Even Trump’s own supporters are asking hard questions. Where are the files? Why is there a two-tiered system of justice? Why is Trump more interested in protecting his friends than releasing the truth? The Democratic response should be a noun, a verb and Jeffrey Epstein, and then the rot at the core of the American system. Deployed effectively, it can be as impactful and as memorable as Trump’s cruel but devastating 2024attack line: “Kamala is for they / them, President Trump is for you.”Trump protects elites.That’s why Trump is protecting Epstein’s circle.But who’s protecting you?Peter Rothpletz is a Guardian contributorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsDemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

Let’s stop pretending otherwiseMehdi HasanThe US government, enabled by the media, is an active participant in Israel’s atrocities in GazaSat 2 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 06.01 EDTShareCan we finally stop pretending that what we have been witnessing in Gaza over the past 22 months is a “war,” a “conflict,” or even a “humanitarian crisis”? Many of the world’s leading human rights and humanitarian groups – includingAmnesty International,Human Rights WatchandDoctors Without Borders– agreed months ago that what is being livestreamed to our phones on a daily basis is indeed a genocide.This week, Israel’s own leading human rights group announced that it had reached “the unequivocal conclusion that Israel is taking coordinated action to intentionally destroy Palestinian society in the Gaza Strip”. In other words, saidB’Tselem, “Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip”.The debate over whether or not Gaza is a genocide is, effectively,over. So can we now also stop pretending that we are mere bystanders to this genocide? That our sin is one only of omission rather than commission? Because the inconvenient truth is that the US has not just looked the other way, as tens of thousands of Palestinians have been besieged and bombed, starved and slaughtered, but helped Israel pull the trigger. We have been complicit in this genocide, which is itself a crime underarticle III of the Genocide convention.I lead a top Israeli human rights group. Our country is committing genocide | Yuli NovakRead moreAs retired Israeli Maj Gen Yitzhak Brickacknowledgedin November 2023: “All of our missiles, the ammunition, the precision-guided bombs, all the airplanes and bombs, it’s all from the US. The minute they turn off the tap, you can’t keep fighting. You have no capability … Everyone understands that we can’t fight this war without the United States. Period.”In fact, given Brick’s assessment, I would argue that what we have witnessed inGazafrom the US government isworsethan complicity. It is active participation in an ongoing genocide.Donald Trump has given Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and his far-right government not only the green light to“clean out”Gaza and“finish the job”, but also the arms, intel and funds to do so. When Netanyahu launched his blockade of all food and aid going into Gaza in March, heemphasizedit was done “in full coordination with President Trump and his people”. “Over the past six months,”Axiosreported in late July, “Trump has given Netanyahu an almost free hand to do whatever he wants in Gaza.” An Israeli official told the site: “In most calls and meetings Trump told Bibi: ‘Do what you have to do in Gaza.’”Trump’s Republican allies in the House and Senate are even more gung-ho. Forget complicity; Congress is filled with GOP cheerleaders for genocide, from Senators Tom“bounce the rubble in Gaza”Cotton to Lindsey“level the place”Graham. The newest member of the House, Randy Fine, a Republican representative of Florida, has called for thenuking of Gazaand said just days ago that Palestinians in Gaza should“starve away”until the Israeli hostages are all released. (A reminder thatincitementto genocide is also a crime underArticle III of the Genocide convention.)But we cannot let Democrats off the hook either. The first 16 months of this mass slaughter unfolded on a Democratic president’s watch. From the get-go, Joe Biden gave Netanyahu and his cabinet of génocidaires everything they needed –2,000-lb bombstodrop on refugee campsfilled with Palestinian children? Check. UN security councilvetoesto prevent the passage of resolutions calling for a permanent ceasefire? Check. The burial of internal US government reports warning ofwar crimesandfaminein Gaza? Check.It wasn’t just Biden. The vast majority of Democrats in Congress spent much of 2024 casting vote after vote to keep arming, funding and whitewashing the mass killing of Palestinian civilians. Even now, in the summer of 2025, seven high-profile Democratic senators were happy to take asmiling photowith Netanyahu, including the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, whoclaimstalk of genocide is antisemitic and says his job“is to keep the left pro-Israel”.Then there is the US media’s complicity in this genocide. It isn’t just the Radio Rwanda wannabes over at Fox, where the morning host Brian Kilmeade hassaidit was hard “to separate the Palestinians from Hamas” and the primetime host Jesse Watters has said“no one wants”Palestinian refugees and“demographically [Palestinians] are a threat”.There are also genocide enablers in theliberalmedia. Those who repeatedly insist Israelis have a right to defend themselves while never asking whether Palestinians do. Those who parrot Israeli government talking points while sanitizing the violence inflicted on Gaza. Palestinians, remember, are not killed by Israeli bombs or bullets; they just “die.”US newsrooms have bent over backwards to present “both sides,” even when one side has been deemed genocidal by some of the world’sleading scholars on genocide. The New York Times, per aninternal memoobtained by the Intercept, instructed journalists covering Gaza to limit the use of the terms “genocide” and “ethnic cleansing” and to “avoid” using the phrase “occupied territory” when referring to the West Bank and Gaza.Onestudy of media coverage, also published by the Intercept, found that “highly emotive terms for the killing of civilians like ‘slaughter’, ‘massacre’, and ‘horrific’ were reserved almost exclusively for Israelis who were killed by Palestinians, rather than the other way around”. Anotherstudy, published in the Nation, found that “with one exception the Sunday shows covered and debated [Gaza] for 12 months without speaking to a single Palestinian or Palestinian American”.Go beyond the media. Elite US institutions are also disgracefully complicit in the annihilation of Gaza, from theIvy Leagueuniversitiesthat punished anti-genocide protesters on campus; to thewhite-shoe law firmsthat disqualified anti-genocide applicants for jobs; to thebig techcompanies accused by a UN special rapporteur of profiting from the genocide.Most Americans, of course, don’t want to believe that our country is helping commit one of the 21st century’s worst atrocities. But, again, we must stop pretending. Our complicity and collusion are clear. As my Zeteo colleague Spencer Ackerman haswritten: “This is an American genocide as much as it is an Israeli one.”The US supplied and thenresuppliedthe bombs and bullets used to kill tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians; the US facilitated the destruction of homes and hospitals; the US signed off on the starvation of children. These are the undeniable facts.And so to the Biden and Trump administrations, to Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to the US media, I say this: history will judge you. For the bombs you sent, the votes you cast, the lies you told. This will be your shameful legacy when the dust finally settles in Gaza, when all of the bodies have been pulled from the rubble. Not defending your ally or fighting terrorism, but non-stop complicity in a genocide; aiding and abetting the crime of crimes.Mehdi Hasan is the founder, CEO and editor-in-chief of the media companyZeteo.Explore more on these topicsGazaOpinionPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaTrump administrationDonald TrumpBiden administrationJoe BidencommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to do itGeorg RiekelesandVarg FolkmanNothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The EU should now steel itself and reject the terms imposed by Donald TrumpSat 2 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 10.20 EDTShareUrsula von der Leyen’s Turnberry golf course deal has been rightlycalled a capitulationand a humiliation for Europe. Assuming such an accord would put an end to Donald Trump’s coercion and bullying was either naive or the result of a miserable delusion. The EU should now steel itself and reject theterms imposed by Trump.Is this deal really as bad as it sounds? Unfortunately, it is, for at least three reasons.The blow to Europe’s international credibility is incalculable in a world that expects the EU to stand up for reciprocity and rules-based trade, to resist Washington’s coercionas Canada, China and Brazil have, rather than condoning it.Economically, it’s a damaging one-way street: EU exporters lose market access in the US while the EU market is hit by more favoured US competition. Core European industrial sectors such as pharma and steel and aluminium are left by the wayside. The balance also tilts in the US’s favour in important sectors such as consumer goods, food and drink, and agriculture.Tariffstend to stick, so this is long-term damage. The EU even gives up its right to respond to future US pressures through duties on digital services or network fees.To top it off, von der Leyen’s defence and investment pledges (for which she had no mandate) go against Europe’s interest. The EU’s competitiveness predicament is precisely one of net investmentoutflows. As international capital now reallocates under the pressures of Trumponomics and a weakening dollar, the case for Europe to become astrategic investment powerwas strengthening. Von der Leyen’s promise of$600bn in EU investmentin the US is therefore disastrous messaging.How could this happen? All EU member states wanted to avoid Trump’s 30% tariff threat and a trade war, but none perhaps as much as Germany and Ireland, supported by German carmakers and US big tech firms. Yet Irish sweetheart digital tax deals, as well as BMW and Mercedes’s plans tomove production hubsto the US (also to serve the EU market), cannot be Europe’s future.EU governments were distinctly unhelpful in building theEU’s negotiating position. But in the end, it was von der Leyen who blinked and she has to take responsibility. Her close team took control in the closing weeks and went into the final meeting manifestly prepared only to say yes, which made Trump’s steamrolling inevitable.Let’s think of the counterfactual: if von der Leyen had stepped into the room and rejected these terms, Trump’s wrath and some market turmoil may have ensued. But ultimately it would very likely have come to a postponement, a new negotiation and, at some point, a different deal that would not be so lopsided or unilaterally trade away deep and long-term European interests and principles. Instead, von der Leyen became a supplicant to a triumphant Trump.The situation is reminiscent of the final rounds of theBrexit negotiationsfive years ago when von der Leyen similarly was giving in to unacceptable demands from Boris Johnson, only to U-turn under pressure from a steelier EU chief negotiator and a quartet of member states.Today, von der Leyen runs Brussels with a strong presidential hand and has largely done away with internal checks and balances inside the commission. That is her prerogative and her style, but the upshot should not be weak, ineffective and unprincipled dealings on Europe’s major geopolitical challenges, from Trump to Gaza.Trump news at a glance: president unleashes slew of new tariff rates for trading partnersRead moreThe “deal” in Scotland is in reality an unstable interim accord. Nothing is yet inked or signed; Washington and Brussels are already locking horns onits interpretationand negotiations on the finer (and broader) points are ongoing. The 27 EU governments will inevitably get involved as the final deal needs to be translated into an international agreement and EU law. Some big powers – Germany and Italy seemingly – are on board, reluctant or not. However, internal political dynamics may change their calculations. Opposition parties and rightwing contenders who are a real political threat to leaders in Germany and France are already lambasting the deal.Unless von der Leyen strikes a dirty bargain with the member states, the European parliament will also have a say. The longtime chair of its trade committee, Bernd Lange, has set the tone for how the deal would be viewed there, calling it “asymmetry set in stone” and even “a misery”. As details seep out on what von der Leyen has really agreed to and what the US expects from the EU, and all the consequences become clear, an already unpalatable deal may become even more so.Weakening US economic data andreturning stock market jittersshow that Trump’s negotiation footing is fragile. Hisnew tariff threatscome with new extensions, up to 90 days in the case of Mexico, as his position is overstretched. For Europe, the lesson from the Brexit negotiations – one that von der Leyen ought to have grasped before now – is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. There is now an opportunity for EU governments and the European parliament to course correct and salvage something from this train wreck.Georg Riekeles is a former EU official who served on the Commission’s task force for the Brexit negotiations.

Our world has been too real for too long, and we all just want a bit of shelter from the storm.We look back in patronising nostalgia atObama’s Hope posterin the same way we insist music hasn’t beenreal musicsince about 1986 (or since 1966, or since the Great American Songbook, or since Mozart, depending who you talk to).The Fantastic Four: First Steps review – Marvel regains buoyancy with wacky superhero family sitcomRead moreMovie theatres are propped up by two monolith tent poles: DC’sumpteenth Supermanand Marvel’sFantastic Four reboot, both attempting a full factory reset of their flagship properties.It offers a return to the originals – AKA, the “good old days”. But this isn’t so much a yearning for a new optimism as it is a resuscitation of an old one. The Fantastic Four is even set in a 1960s Jetsons-style alternate reality (the first comic waspublished in 1961).Remember this? This is Things As They Should Be™.The great irony in this regurgitation of old aesthetics is that, they themselves looked forward. The joy and optimism of the space age showcased the marvellous and fantastic possibilities of technology and science, before we knew that those same industries would slowly start choking our own atmosphere.We want to go back to that time, when we could feel good about driving our big shiny bubble cars and tease our hair up guilt-free – without thinking about the ozone or whatever.This starts to feel like a photocopy of a photocopy. The AI boom is sampling and recycling things that already existThis perceived collective optimism was never real, of course. But now, after decades of doom storytelling and hope erosion, we want the dream back.What’s happening in the culture is more than the good honest fun of theme park recreations, 1950s diners and old west camera filters. This is an earnest but somehow deeply sad defibrillation of dead worlds, built around a hollow craving that can never ever be filled.We are birds constantly regurgitating and eating our own upchuck. Same flavour but different colour, different flavour but same chunks.Its passion looks inspirational, but its sniff is grief. It works, but not quite — as fresh as microwaved leftovers.It’s the cultural equivalent of Maga – the lie that there was some glorious past where things were flourishing and wholesome and if we can just get back there we’ll be on track again. But there never was that past. It’s a distortion of immature childhood memories and historical rewriting by big corporations.This is the multiverse made real by an increasingly small cabal of conglomerates leveraging their various assets, stuffing each storytelling turducken full of old money-makers to reduce the risk in anything new. It’s not so much the multiverse as the IP-verse. Every brand everywhere all at once.Over time this starts to feel like a photocopy of a photocopy. The AI boom is quite literally sampling and recycling things that already exist.When I see a brand-new building proudly inspired by the art deco movement of 100 years ago, I wonder if the great deco designers knew way back then that they were on the blind precipice of the future, or were they recreating their own nostalgic past? I wonder, as typography and graphic design trends cycle through recreations of past “vintage” ideas, what the concept of “vintage” meant to people back when it was, to them, modern?Having lost hope for the future, we have always looked back for comfort. We have to be cautious of the reasons why.Why did Nazi aesthetics have such a fetish for ancient Rome? Why did Soviet culture idolise modern industrial style? Even in The Handmaid’s Tale’s Gilead, they revere the natural and organic by insisting on non-GM and high-fat foods. The world around us tells us a lot about our beliefs.We are all potential victims of this ideological myth-making. It’s invisible but everywhere, and it’s difficult to tell if people in power aim to manufacture a world that matches their values or if it’s some kind of naturally developing, laissez-faire attraction.We’re all dreaming of a better time from the past, since there is no future. We’ve stopped dreaming about building – now we dream of recreating.The left needs its own version of techno-optimism | Amana Fontanella-KhanRead moreIt’s not recreating the actual thing that we want, it’s the yearning to recreate the feeling we had back then.In my local city centre, I drive past heritage-protected sandstone buildings with the names of the original shopfronts still carved at the top. The mason etching that date in the rock was doing it for the future, so as time stretched on his mark would stay there, even for me now as I whip past the exact same building in a space shuttle machine he could never even dream of.Imagine a shop front named something like, “Nolan and Sons Merchants, est. 1861.” And on the shop front awning below it, computer-printed on laminate in an deliberately old-timey font, “Buzz’d Cafe, est. 2025.”Take a sledgehammer to the wall of this cafe. Pierce the membrane of lino wallpaper printed to look like rustic bricks and find sterile chalk-white plasterboard from the previous shop, which was itself once added to modernise and cover the rustic brick walls beneath.You can find these rings of a tree in everything: generations on top of generations of us each trying to make our own existence matter and either cover or recover the ones before us.So, do we seek comfort in the baby blanket of our past myths – or do we try to create our own new ones?Martin Ingleis a writer and film-makerExplore more on these topicsSupermanOpinionFantastic FourcommentShareReuse this content"

Among the others was the England rugby international Neil Back, who had been part of the World Cup-winning squad of 2003 and could make a Russian oligarch’s close protection team look like the Cheeky Girls.I was not a noted sportsman in my youth – I have grown to enjoy watching sport but have never been at home in the culture of the clubhouse, the changing room or the training ground. However,Neiland I hit it off instantly. Within two days we were breaking into wardrobe to find out from the names on the aprons who our opposition would be. Within a week he was holding me aloft in an improvised lineout, a testament to his strength rather than my athletic grace. We talked about all sorts of things – shared life experience, unshared life experience – and one day he taught me something that changed my life.It is not an insight that others have not had. Indeed, it is obvious, a simple thing, but like so many obvious and simple things it is inexhaustibly difficult, too. It came up when we were thinking about which chips are best with burgers. I’m a french fry man myself, as slender and light as you like, but Neil goes for the chunky kind – cut immaculately, thrice cooked, then stacked as neatly as aLe Corbusier brise-soleil.I was struck by the intense focus Neil brought to this task, which he rehearsed over and over at home before we got to the kitchen. I asked why and he said: “Perfect practice makes perfect performance.” Of course it does, I thought, but then he said this was a mantra in the England team that won the World Cup. And of course, if Jonny Wilkinson had not practised and practised and practised kicking goals, we would have gone home as runners-up rather than winners.Perfect practice makes perfect performance, for what is a perfect performance other than practice that does not go wrong? I knew a bit about practice because I am a pianist and have been since childhood. I have practised countless pieces, scales and arpeggios, acquiring the 10,000 hours of experience that doing anything decently requires. But I was lackadaisical, and while I found it quite easy to execute some tricky passages, there were others that were too much for me – too quick, too dense, too complex to play accurately or musically. When I was young I used to busk my way through them, hitting the sostenuto pedal when I got to an unplayable bar to blur the inaccuracies. I would also affect what I thought were Lisztian flourishes at the keyboard as a distraction. I don’t suppose I fooled many people, but it got me through.When I ran away to London and joined a pop band, I had to learn to play in a different way. It is only now, in my 60s, that I have returned seriously to the classical repertoire I played in my teens. It is interesting to revisit who you were as a teenager 45 years later, and discover what has endured and what has changed. What has endured for me is a deep love of music, and what has changed is a willingness to try to play it properly; not to busk my way through difficult passages but to face them squarely, break them down, put them together slowly and methodically, to practise and practise and practise, and to discover the obvious thing: if you practise, you get better.This has not only made me a better pianist than I was then, even if I am not yet back to peak technique; it has made me a better musician. By that I mean more patient, more focused, more willing to engage. It’s been a life lesson, too.I read a story recently about a man who visited Rachmaninov, the greatest pianist of his day, at home in Los Angeles. As he approached the front door, he could hear the great man practising in his music room. What titanic flourishes, what miracles of touch and dexterity poured forth?A chord of two notes, played very slowly, over and over and over again.Richard Coles is a writer, broadcaster and former Church of England clergymanExplore more on these topicsPsychologyWords that changed everythingMasterChefRugby World Cup 2003TelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

That story was sunk deep into our bones and passed between us as our treasured inheritance. It formed our sense of ourselves and our belief in Scotland’s good and worthy contribution to the world.We walked past statues of David Hume and Adam Smith. We celebrated their intellect and claimed it as our own. Yet no one spoke of what lay beneath that brilliance – of whose labour built their wealth, whose bodies were stolen, dispossessed and abused as a consequence of their “thinking”. Edinburgh was framed not as a city of complicity but of genius. That silence shaped us.Now, the University of Edinburgh’s review of its legacies of enslavement and colonialism joins a wider reckoning that has been building across Scotland. It confronts the stories we were told – that we continue to tell. That we love to tell.Scotland has long positioned itself as a nation on the margins of empire. We speak of being oppressed, victimised – or as a benign participant in the British imperial project. But many of us, through our family histories, have always known that’s not the whole truth. It’s a lie of omission. One that has excluded us, exiled us from a national story in which we also have histories to contribute, and in which we have a claim.Edinburgh University’srecent inquiryinto its history is sobering. It focuses on the institution’s financial gains from plantation slavery, its intellectual support of racial pseudoscience and its memorialisation of colonial figures. It names how Enlightenment thinking in Scotland justified racial hierarchies. These aren’t revelations for many Black and Brown Scots, or for those involved with Scotland’s anti-racism movements – they’re confirmations of truths long lived and denied.And still, we are met with denial, minimisation and the defensive recoil of a nation uncomfortable with the truth of itself. There’s a reflex to preserve pride at all costs within our society – even when the cost is exclusion and erasure of fellow Scots; of their histories and their story of Scotland.View image in fullscreenA sign hangs from the statue of David Hume on the Royal Mile, Edinburgh, after a Black Lives Matter protest, 7 June 2020.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAThe work of uncovering Scotland’s pivotal role in enslavement and colonialism has been led by individuals such as the academics Geoff Palmer and Stephen Mullen, Zandra Yeaman at the Hunterian Museum, Lisa Williams, founder of the Edinburgh Black History Walk, and the poet Shasta Hanif Ali, who explores the stories of the Indian ayahs who lived and worked in Edinburgh. Their work has helped us understand long-denied histories and given many of us a stronger sense of belonging as a result. The University of Edinburgh’s report adds further weight to their labour. But what comes next?Race is a social construct. But we must now confront the fact that it was constructed, in part, here, by so-called “great men” – our great men – whose legacy continues to shape our country and institutions. And their legacy still causes us harm.This harm is not abstract. In 2024 alone, Police Scotland recorded4,794 hate crimesunder the new Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act. Black and minority ethnic people are60% more likely to live in the most deprived parts of Scotlandthan their white counterparts. Black and minority ethnic workers havepoorer outcomes than white workerswhen applying for jobs in our public sector organisations.These are reverberations of a legacy born in Enlightenment philosophies that theorised racial hierarchies – ideas presented as science, later used to justify enslavement and colonialism. These narratives of white supremacy negatively affect us all, and they continue to endanger and blight the lives of Black and Brown people.What happens next must therefore go beyond apology and symbolism. It must be structural, sustained and fiercely imaginative. Education is key. Not just to correct the record, but to transform how we imagine and create a better nation. Within our schools, reform is under way – initiatives such as Education Scotland’sBuilding Racial Literacyprogramme and collectives such asThe Anti-Racist Educatorprovide vital resources and training.Such efforts must be scaled, funded and politically backed if they’re to meaningfully reshape how we understand ourselves, how we embed anti-racism within our institutions and how we teach Scotland’s history.Edinburgh council’sSlavery and Colonialism Legacy Review, endorsed by councillors in 2022, included a public apology and the creation of an implementation group, chaired by Irene Mosota, to guide reparative action. This included initiatives such as theDisrupting the Narrative project, which has formed the main body of my work as Edinburgh makar (the city’s poet laureate). The meetings of theScottish BPOC Writers Network’s writers group at the University of Edinburgh, and the important work of mentorship and support fromWe Are Here Scotlandare also living examples of this reparative work. This work is not symbolic – it is foundational. It allow us to rebuild from the margins, and write ourselves back into the story of Scotland, and into the story we tell.This is a live, unfinished conversation – one that must embrace intersectionality, mobilise solidarity and resist the far right’s weaponisation of pseudoscience and historical denial. Opposition to anti-racism is often framed as resistance to “political correctness”, and calls for decolonisation are frequently mocked or deliberately misunderstood. Silence, however, is complicity.History is not settled. Our story is not finished. We are capable of confronting ourselves honestly and critically. We can take pride in our history of social justice movements – but this pride must also own and acknowledge the truth of what and who built this nation. That means interrogating our past and the reasons for our collective amnesia. It means listening to voices long silenced. The time has come, Scotland. The time has finally come.Hannah Lavery is a Scottish poet and playwright.

In fact, we all have the powerSat 2 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 10.20 EDTShareThere’s a common misconception that state-of-the-art technology has to be expensive, energy consumptive and hard to engineer. That’s because we have been persuaded to believe that innovative technology is whatever bombastic billionaires claim it is, whether that’s commercial spacecraft or the endless iterations of generative AI tools.As the Canadian technologist and engineerUrsula Franklin once said, fantasies of technology would have it that innovation is always “investment-driven, shiny, lab-born, experimental, exciting”. But more often than not, in the real world, it is “needs-driven, scrappy, on location, iterative, practical, mundane”. The real pioneering technologies of today are genuinely useful systems I like to call “frugal tech”, and they are brought to life not by eccentric billionaires but by people doing more with less. They don’t impose top-down “solutions” that seem to complicate our lives while making a few people very rich. It turns out that genuinely innovative technology really can set people free.Last month at Berlin’s once hippy, now increasingly corporatised Re:publica conference, for example, I met researchers from theAssociation for Progressive Communications(APC), who are using technologies such as software-defined radios and spectrum sensing to allow people in low-resource environments to stay connected despite limited bandwidth, power, hardware and communication infrastructure. These technologies are the basis of the local community networks that supply coverage tothe 2.5 billionpeople globally who lack internet access. In the Niger Delta, which suffers fromtoxic levels of air pollutionfrom its oil industry, APC is setting up connections and deploying low-cost sensors that monitor the environment. These play a crucial role in how locals can advise children when to stay inside and which areas to avoid playing in. This infrastructure is managed for and by the municipality, serves a pressing need and can be installed and built by the people who deploy it. Unlike, say, ChatGPT or a Blue Origin space rocket.The fact is, while generative AI is lauded as the technology of the minute, iterations such as Dall-E 3,Google Geminiand GPT are irrelevant to those who don’t have enough internet bandwidth to use them. The new digital divide is the gap between the top end of the global population – who have access to these power-intensive technologies – and those at the bottom, whose internet access, or lack of, remains static. That’s why some of today’s most brilliant minds are working out how to manage the trade-off between internet range and bandwidth, and whether there are obstacles in the way such as mountains and foliage.View image in fullscreenElon Musk at the Axel Springer award in Berlin, Germany, 1 December 2020.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/ReutersThe fact is that good innovation also often involves lobbying for good. So while big tech poured hundreds of millions into watering down theEU AI Act, good tech lobbies for better internet provisions for all. Policy and innovation go hand in hand, meaning that the consequences of good technology far exceed the technology itself, extending to governance and social welfare.At Re:publica’s “maker space”, I fiddled around with DIY solar-powered sensors that can be built using a Raspberry Pi computer and off-the-shelf components such as humidity sensors. I lost my partner, an engineer by training, to a microscope designed by the OpenFlexure project that was made from 3D printed materials. Microscopes are crucial for diagnosing infections but can cost millions of pounds, making them entirely inaccessible for many people across the globe. This one is lightweight, costs next to nothing and is open source, meaning that anyone can reproduce the design by 3D printing parts and cobbling them together with shop-bought motors and circuit boards. A bit like a cheap Ikea wardrobe, except that all the bits you need to assemble it can be bought inexpensively from a local electronics shop. Manufacturers from Ghana and Wales to Chile and Australia are all using OpenFlexure’s designs to give people everywhere access to low-source microscopy. We might think generative AI has invaded all corners of our lives, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. What is actually prolific and relevant to the majority are low-cost technologies that solve day-to-day business and social problems.While most of what we consider to be “hi-tech” is closed off behind proprietary algorithms, the open-source technologies above all require community involvement. This can be immensely empowering, and can improve public trust: it’s hard (and unwise) to give yourself over to a technology that won’t tell you how it works, particularly when its predefined settings allow only for meagre approaches to “user privacy”. As I ask my students, if you could develop an AI at your own home, and programme it to reflect your values and prioritise your safety, wouldn’t youtrust it more? Well, the idea isn’t so outlandish – it only feels impossible because big tech firms want us to think it is.Why does technology create new problems for each problem it solves? | Mark BuchananRead moreWhat is most outstanding about frugal innovation is not just that its technologies are impressive, but that it might actually prompt systemic change by showing people that tech can be developed locally, and not just imported from Silicon Valley. When farmer Chris Conderdug her own fibreoptic cableson her property in Lancashire, she set out “to prove that ordinary people could do it … it wasn’t rocket science”. By demonstrating that fast internet could be connected with fibre-optic cable, a digger and the desire to just get on and do it, she spawned an organisation calledB4RN, which promotes community fibre partnerships.Tech bros may want you to believe there is no point in making something new unless it is difficult, inaccessible and exclusionary. But technological innovation is about collaboration as much as it is about competition. For many people across the world, a product’s value isn’t in a sky-high valuation, or in it being impossible to take apart (as with impenetrable iPhones). Often, the smartest technologies are those that distil a problem down to its bread and butter components in order to disseminate a solution to the masses.So, while innovative individuals and communities around the world quietly get on with improving their lives and those around them, it’s high time the rest of us stopped being passive recipients of technology, and started asking ourselves what kind of world we want to live in and how to create it. Must the setting for innovation be £1bn-plus buildings likeGoogle’s new London officesin King’s Cross, located in nations that can afford to stomach eye-watering training costs and compute power requirements? Or might we instead be able to steer innovation from within our very communities – or households?Eleanor Drage is a senior research fellow at the University of Cambridge’s Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence and co-author of the The Good Robot: Why Technology Needs FeminismExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

Friday’sannouncementby the showrunner Michael Patrick King that the third series of And Just Like That would be its last was met with little surprise and I suspect some relief. Following a forthcoming two-part finale, Carrie Bradshaw will hang up her Manolos for good – and not a moment too soon.If a theme could be pulled from the scrambled threads of the third season of the Sex and the City reboot, it is, I think, the question of appearance versus reality. Early on in the series, rattled by the discovery of a rat infestation in her meadowy garden, Carrie seeks comfort from Aidan, the man she’s technically in a relationship with but due to a muddled and implausible arrangement, can’t actuallybewith for five years. Carrie thought her garden was perfect, she says, “but I just wasn’t looking underneath”.And Just Like That: Sex and the City spin-off to end after third seasonRead moreAfter three seasons ofAnd Just Like Thatthe answer to what lies beneath is, I fear, nothing. Take the shoes – in a frankly criminal throwback to one of the best plotlines of the original show, Carrie namechecks a superior earlier episode as she complains about her curmudgeonly downstairs neighbour asking her to remove her stilettos in the house. In A Woman’s Right to Shoes, Carrie’s stolen Manolo Blahniks stood for, in no particular order, the gulf that can open between friends at different life stages, the way marriage and motherhood are celebrated when the milestones of an independent life are not, attention inequity in friendships, and a woman’s right to spend her money however the hell she chooses. In Under the Table, Carrie’s shoes signify … that she has a crush.That’s not to say And Just Like That hasn’t had its moments of insight – they just tend to be immediately binned in favour of something silly. Despite episodes averaging 40 minutes in length, this season has been the trimmest so far, with excisions both necessary (Che Diaz) and unexplained (Nya) giving the remaining characters room to breathe. Seema learns that the key to romance is not pretending to be someone else, but letting go of the desire to be seen in a certain way. Lisa flounders in her attempt to balance work and family life. Charlotte, previously troubled by such challenges as the cancellation of her dog, finally gets a storyline worthy of her default mode of hysteria when Harry is diagnosed with prostate cancer.View image in fullscreenNicole Ari Parker, Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Sarita Choudhury.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/Rex/ShutterstockCharlotte and Lisa’s Park Avenue-set struggles with family life have some meat to them, but are bedevilled by every interaction with their children seeming to have come straight out of a toothpaste advertisement, or hell. See: Charlotte freaking out about not being able to work the party circuit to sell art as her smug children talk about veganism and polyamory, or the Todd Wexley family’s cringe banter and Lisa’s dismissive comments that her husband should start Ozempic.‘I’ve been crucified!’ Sarah Jessica Parker on dating, delis – and surviving three decades of Carrie hatersRead moreAt times like these the show feels like a charmless sitcom about the super-rich. In Sex and the City, the weekends in the Hamptons were just the backdrop to more resonant storytelling – in And Just Like That, sometimes the settingisthe story. In one scene, Charlotte begins to spiral at Tiffany’s, wondering if life is as fragile as the glass cabinets around her – but what might have been a serious meditation on midlife and mortality morphs into an unfunny joke about which society events Bitsy von Muffling is and isn’t invited to. Sometimes these vignettes verge on outright cruelty – after Lisa’s nemesis is marked as a gauche interloper by her Michael Kors handbag (wrong kind of designer, honey), it’s a lot harder to see her mother-in-law’s pronouncement that she has no time for the working class as mere satire.Meanwhile, the inexplicably homeless Miranda deflowers a nun, becomes a meme and gains a girlfriend, who, in lieu of a personality, possesses two Italian greyhounds and vile British colleagues apparently scooped straight from the cutting room floor of Too Much. It’s not until the 10th episode that we get to see Miranda, who barely resembles the beloved judgmental ice queen of Sex and the City, do the first Miranda-y thing of the entire series so far, when she stalks the woman her son got pregnant.The one bright spot of the season has been its treatment of Carrie’s faltering relationship with Aidan. A standout episode in which she visits him in Virginia sees a diminished Carrie, too afraid to ask for what she wants, settling for the smallest thing he can offer her – a spot in the guesthouse. Carrie switches her magenta Vivienne Westwood for a “sister wives” prairie dress, to attempt the role of cool country stepmum. But the performance of a happy blended family falls to pieces in a rare decent domestic scene, in which resentment and alienation explode into a conflict that ends with a broken window and a return to reality.View image in fullscreenSarah Jessica Parker and John Corbett.Photograph: Craig Blankenhorn/© 2023 WarnerMedia Direct, LLC. All Rights Reserved.The relationship eventually crumbles when Carrie realises that no matter how she changes for Aidan – selling her apartment, not being a brat in the countryside (remember Suffern?) – he cannot move past her previous infidelity. This, to me, is the point of returning to a story decades later: to show how people change, and how they don’t. How the cracks in a relationship can run so deep that even the layering sediment of time can’t fill them in, but only hide them. When Carrie finally ended it, I felt a tug of genuine emotion that can only come from having spent so much time with these characters.Alot has been madethis season of the idea of thehate-watch, especially given Miranda’s obsession with a Love Island-style show called Bi Bingo. “I finally discovered the joy of hate-watching,” she says, in what I assume is meant to be a winning nod at self-awareness by the showrunners.The thing is, I don’t believe that’s what those of us who loved Sex and the City (for who else would bother watching And Just Like That through three unexceptional seasons?) were doing. I’d describe it as something closer to hope-watching. We wanted to see the characters we loved, women once so convincingly and lovingly drawn, being flirty, frivolous and fabulously dressed in New York City. But more than that, we held out hope that something substantial might still remain beneath the sparkle. In two episodes’ time we’ll finally know the answer – and if we’re disappointed again, at least it’ll be for the last time.Explore more on these topicsAnd Just Like ThatSarah Jessica ParkerCynthia NixonTV comedyUS televisionTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Halfway through my attempt to play the real-life version of the smash-hit reality BBC reality TV showThe Traitors, I realise something: I may be less charming than I’d hoped.“I don’t trust him,” intones a player to my left, scowling at my face as though she has just found it on the bottom of her shoe.“Yeah, he seems shifty!” exclaims her friend.I try to defuse the tension by smiling winningly.“Look at that smirk. He’s definitely a Traitor.”Oh dear.In retrospect, this should not have come as a surprise. Since The Traitors first burst on to our screens in November 2022, it’s become obvious that it’s not easy to convince people you’re telling the truth while being subjected to death-ray stares.Watching contestants go head to head as either traitors (who lie, scheme and murder fellow contestants by night) or faithfuls (who try to banish traitors so they can share a cash prize with fellow honest players) has united the UK around its TV sets. The show has won Baftas and Emmys, and drawn up to 10 million viewers an episode, and it’s largely down to the sheer unpredictability of what people will do when they’re put in a pressure cooker environment and suspicion is allowed to fester.View image in fullscreenPlayers thrash out their theories at the round table.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIt’s also what made Neil Connolly, the creative director behind The Traitors: Live Experience, decide to replicate the interior of a Scottish castle in Covent Garden inLondonand have players roleplay the TV show in groups of up to 12.“I wanted to make people’s hearts race,” he will tell me on the phone the following day. “That moment when you feel your heart pounding in your chest, I know that I’ve done my job correctly.”Well, as I play the game, his wishes are coming true. Largely because I am a faithful, who is doing a terrible job of convincing anyone.Along with a group of other journalists, I’m sitting in a wood-panelled room containing an impressive replica of the round table around which all the TV show’s fiercest debates take place. Occasionally, our host – a tartan-clad Claudia Winkleman-channelling actor – announces that it is now “night” and instructs us to put on a “blindfold” (more commonly known as “blacked-out ski goggles”). We wait while the Traitors remove theirs and plot who to kill – or secretly recruit. And then, masks removed, fierce debate breaks out.‘The crosser Jeremy Paxman got, the more we giggled’: what it’s like to come last on a TV showRead more“The way you reacted there was a bit ‘Hugh Grant in a romcom’,” declares one player, casting suspicion towards a particularly emotive participant. “Bit strange.”It’s not long before all the tropes of the TV show pop up. People begin to form cliques. The phrase “100% faithful” is repeated time and again. Rather than evicting people based on any form of evidence, players are banished purely due to looking a bit odd. Hugh Grant ends up being evicted – and turns out to be a faithful. Randomness rules.“We had one woman who voted for someone, then said: ‘It’s because you remind me of Miles Jupp from Balamory,’” laughs Connolly. “One guy turned around his slate and said: ‘I’ve voted for you, Tom, because I don’t know how to spell the other person’s name.’”I, however, am determined to learn from everything I’ve seen on the TV show. I refuse to go with the herd. I vote on the basis of evidence, rather than conjecture about facial tics. And I never throw around baseless accusations, lest I kill one of my own. In short: I repeatedly vote for the person next to me, as I’m convinced I heard him removing his goggles during the night-time.As the debates go on, I somehow attract more suspicion. The number of votes against me increases. Luckily, my methodology proves popular and we successfully evict two traitors who were overly noisy when removing their blindfold. Less luckily, a faithful player announces that she’d like to banish me and then is murdered by the traitors.“You killed her!” declares her friend, to the gasps of the room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We solve clues to find numbers hidden around the room, which we then put in the correct order by communicating with “the dead” – the players who have either been banished or murdered, and are now watching us on TV from a nearby room. Unlike the TV show, in which these tasks earn contestants money for the prize pot, we get points for our total on the daily leaderboard.As we go back into another debate, it turns out that my dogged voting for the same player is paying off. Enough other people have become suspicious, and he is evicted.“What a relief,” he announces before he leaves the room. “I was a traitor.”The best TV of 2025 in the UK so farRead moreSuddenly, people are looking at me differently. For the rest of the session, not a single player votes for me, until our host announces: “It is now time for the end game!”Dramatic music swells and we’re told to press a button. We can vote either to end the game if we believe everyone to be faithful or to continue banishing if we don’t. Over three stressful rounds, we’re whittled down from six players to three. The game ends, and we have to declare. Are we all faithful? In which case we all win. Or is there a traitor among us? In which case only they are victorious.I declare first. Then player number two proves to be on the side of good as well. And, finally, the last player announces: “I’m a faithful.” We won – and I’m in shock. Surely it doesn’t normally go this smoothly?“Oh no,” laughs Connolly. “At the end of one game, a player had to tell his fiancee he was a traitor. Before he even finished speaking, she had ripped off her engagement ring and thrown it on the floor.”Wow. Thank god I’m 100% faithful.The Traitors: Live Experienceis in Covent Garden, London.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe TraitorsLondonEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Lim doesn’t just shift tickets. His huge social media following ensures waves of global attention for everything he does or that is written about him.This Prom will achieve this for an unusual reason. Soon after Lim began Rachmaninov’s fourth piano concerto, a distant alarm started ringing in the Albert Hall. Red lights flashed high up. Yamada and Lim pressed on. At the end of the movement, Yamada left the podium and disappeared off-stage, leaving the musicians and audience uncertain. After about five minutes, though it felt longer, the red lights stopped, the alarm was silenced and Yamada returned, to applause and relief all round.By all accounts, Lim was laid-back about it afterwards. I bet the BBC was less relaxed. But it did not seem to affect the pianist himself, who often showed how naturally he can conjure a willing audience into silence with his range and touch. Lim’s command of sound is wide, as his Korngold encore would also prove, but Rachmaninov’s fourth is not an easy work to project, especially in a vast hall. It veers, sometimes vertiginously, between weighty and whispering, and there are hints of composers like Ravel. The playing was wonderful, but a bit more spaciousness in the interpretation would have made it even better.View image in fullscreenConductor Kazuki Yamada.Photograph: Mark Allan/BBCAt the start, Yamada conducted a glisteningly clear account of John Adams’s propulsive foxtrot The Chairman Dances, which showcased the excellence of the CBSO’s wind and percussion sections. Then, after the interval, and in an already notably less crowded hall than before, cameBerio’s Sinfonia, with its swirling and microscopically fragmentary mix of styles and cultures, written amid the reckless intensities of 1968.Berio’s score for orchestra and voices, some electronically enhanced, could once feel like an obsequy for a dying western culture, with its homage to Mahler, and its allusions to Martin Luther King and absurdist theatre. Yamada and his musicians captured the piece’s hauntingly chaotic sound world and its troubled intensity. But, like so much else, Sinfonia has become a period piece now. It reconnects with an era in music that no longer exists, when composers and audiences were far more open to the disruptive and the new than they are now. The steady trickle of some remaining members of the audience towards the exits throughout the performance felt like testimony to that.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.ThePromscontinue until 13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsClassical musicProms 2025Promslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

I got into it around 2012, when I was 23, and I’ve been playing ever since. It’s a game of endless possibility. You can do anything in it. You can build your own houses, machines, businesses, and put your own personality on to it. It’s an easy escape and can become quite addictive. It’s just so much more colourful, fun and cosy than the real world.But when you play this game for a decade you start to learn this incredible lesson about patience. It’s essentially a game where you build your world one block at a time. In the moment it’s this lovely dopamine-drip exercise, but recently it’s started to change my perspective on the world. You look back at what you’ve created and begin to appreciate all the work you’ve put in. I know that might sound silly. It’s just a game about blocks. But until you zoom out with time and perspective you don’t appreciate it for what it is.I just walk around and look at the water and the fish and the trees in these worlds that I’ve builtSince January, I’ve changed my approach to the game. We’d just shot my sitcom, Transaction, in the winter and it was a wonderful experience. But then Trump’s inauguration happened halfway through and all this terrible messaging for transgender people came with it. It all got too much. Everything became about patching over that pain with personal achievement. And that’s what Minecraft is on one level. You build and you build and you don’t think about anything. But that’s not a sustainable way to live. To stop and take a break and celebrate the things you have achieved – rather than trying to escape your worry by achieving more – is something I started to adopt.So I’ve basically been playing Minecraft but not really building anything for the last six months. I just walk around and look at the water and the fish and the trees in these beautiful worlds that I’ve built. It’s got this strange sense of hygge about it. It’s a game where you can go hell for leather, or you can relax and turn relaxation into a craft. It’s a cosy game and I didn’t notice that until I needed a cosy place to escape to. The little journeys you take can be amazing. You can walk past a tree and even though it essentially stays the same over the years, you remember how that tree felt five years ago. There was a wolf here back then. It’s a living memory palace that also happens to be beautifully rendered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There’s no opacity. No light bouncing off the water. You can just see through it and you know it’s water and you get that same refreshing feeling. There’s also a night and day cycle but it’s expedited. So every five minutes the moon comes up, the sun comes down. And at night-time things get quite scary in the game. You have to go inside or the monsters will get you. There’s a primeval connection – like a rewilding in a virtual world. I don’t know if it’s the healthiest way to live but it works for now.When the world feels like it is moving incredibly fast, it’s so helpful to think that it’s all just a conglomeration of thousands and thousands of steps, thousands of tiny blocks being placed or moved. It’s easy to forget that and think we’ve hit some sort of singularity where things have changed incredibly fast. That’s not the case. It’s just a series of tiny steps that are still happening. Minecraft constantly reminds me that we’re in a state of movement. There’s no big decision to be made now. We can go back and change things. We can take it down. Put it back together again. Take those components and change it into something new.Jordan’s show, Is That a C*ck in Your Pocket, or Are You Just Here to Kill Me?, is at Assembly Square George Garden, Edinburgh,to 24 August.Share your experienceShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

James Graham’s musical, premiering at the Edinburgh international festival, is at least as epic, even if it bites off more than it can possibly chew.It takes us back to the real-life drama of the Royal Bank of Scotland and the government bailout after its collapse. Fred Goodwin was CEO and the bank had such a meteoric rise under his tenure that it claimed to be the largest in the world.Graham works hard to make the banking part of the story snappy – and succeeds. Directed by Andrew Panton, it is pacey even if long, serious but funny, all set to song and kinetic projections across towers on Anna Fleischle’s set which might be inflated columns of the share index.There is musical comedy even as the singing chorus presides over Goodwin’s fall; darker satire as banking culture is captured, complete with after-hours karaoke nights (Franz Ferdinand’s Take Me Out, Kylie Minogue’s Can’t Get You Out of My Head etc).This is a moment in economic history when bankers such as Goodwin (Sandy Grierson) become emperors, trumping the power of parliament, so it seems. Grierson plays a fascinatingly bland tyrant, looking every bit the accountant he is by training. But like his office lover, Rita (Hannah Donaldson), says, he is a lion lying in the grass. When he reveals himself as such, he is ruthless indeed: a white-collar Scarface, high on power.Graham gives Goodwin’s tale the ancient Greek treatment at times, with ghosts, hallucinatory hissing characters and the emergence of what seems like an underworld beneath the cracked reality of banking life. From this, amid rumbles and puffs of smoke, Brian Cox emerges as the spectre of moral philosopher and founder of free market economics, Adam Smith.He is entertaining rather than fearful and seems knowingly to be Brian Cox the actor playing Smith the character. In between discussions on Smith’s “invisible hand” the tone flips back into a comical vein. Smith admires Goodwin’s scented candles and develops a penchant for John Lewis. There is a satirical diversion into A Christmas Carol territory, with a snowy night-time trip across Edinburgh, that serves no greater purpose. It is entertaining nonetheless, and Cox amuses as Smith.Some of the antithetical elements do clash and dilute meaning. Is this a play about hubris, you wonder, or a satire of it – or is it attempting to grapple with the nature of capitalism itself rather than just Goodwin’s legacy? Its scope is so broad, its characterisation broad-brush too and there is not enough drama to Goodwin’s actual downfall. Some balls are dropped, such as Goodwin and Rita’s relationship – its trajectory all but abandoned after one comical sex scene. Yet Graham’s marshalling of material is impressive overall, and it is a miracle that the flips from comedy to Gothicism and back do not jar.Graham has, as always, done his homework on the subject, meticulously so. Co-produced by Dundee Rep theatre, and set in Edinburgh, there is knowing local humour (Leith is labelled an underworld, New Town is heaven, for example). Scottish statesmen stand at the centre of No 10 politics: Alistair Darling (Sandy Batchelor) is amusingly drawn. Gordon Brown (Andy Clark) becomes something of an ethical touchstone, the hero of the piece here even though, as Goodwin points out, it was Brown who gave him the freedom to take RBS down the disastrous road that he did. Everyone is flatly drawn, though that does not impede the enjoyment.There are explanations of Adam Smith’s philosophies, the sub-prime mortgage crisis and capitalism itself, but the fourth wall is never pierced. Characters often face the audience while delivering a mini treatise, and it is miraculous too that this does not seem like heavy-handed exposition.It becomes clear that Goodwin follows the word of Smith’s ideas but not the spirit. This is what leads him to his amoral drive towards acquisition. We hear how he only read one of Smith’s books – not the one that spoke of the ethics of the free market. It is a funny turn in the narrative, but too flip to be convincing.Goodwin’s fall never really comes either, dramatically. He stares out at the audience defiantly, even as the lights go down. There is no remorse, no learning. It’s chilling but also anti-climatic.Yet still sparky and exuberant as Graham’s plays always are, with heaps of knowledge, humour and sharp lines. It sprawls, turns eccentric corners and defies expectations. Its ambition, and epic scope, is simultaneously a strength and weakness.At Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, until 9 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalMusicalsTheatreComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The setting is the delayed Euro 2020 tournament, the one in which Gareth Southgate’s England beat ancient rivals Germany, then Ukraine and Denmark before facing Italy at Wembley.For an obsessive fan such as Billy Kinley, someone who lives for football and its attendant culture of booze and thuggery, it is an excitement almost too great to bear. That is as close a reason as he can come up with for pulling down his shorts and shoving a flare between his bum cheeks on match day. It is an act of exuberance that turns him into a viral sensation.View image in fullscreenCommunication breakdown … Alex Hill in Why I Stuck a Flare Up My Arse for England.Photograph: Rah PetherbridgeIt also gives him cause to wonder how his life has reached such a place, especially now he has been abandoned by his childhood pal Adam and dumped by his previously tolerant girlfriend. If he knew the phrase toxic masculinity, he would have to use it; a once sweet-natured boy, he has traded his old stability for the camaraderie of the terraces and the excesses of drugs and violence. The flare is his way of belonging.Under the direction of Sean Turner, Hill plays Billy with gusto. In the working-class tradition of Steven Berkoff and John Godber, he gives a have-your-cake-and-eat-it performance that revels in macho exuberance even while it delivers a sobering message about communication breakdown.The details of that breakdown are slipped in teasingly. It feels like there is more to be said about Adam’s fate and the degree to which Billy should be held accountable for failing to listen to his friend. It is a boisterous play about boisterousness, one that will keep knocking in the goals for audiences, even if it says more about the thrill of the hooligan lifestyle than the emotional inarticulacy behind it.At Underbelly Bristo Square, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025ComedyEdinburgh festivalTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

They’re very close without being romantically interested in each other, and she has a habit of meddling in his relationships. Hmmm. We’re accustomed to onscreen chemistry of the explosive kind, which is generally used to exploit a heteronormative set-up. We see a man and woman getting along, and can’t help but wonder when they will burst into flames.Platonic(Apple TV+, from Wednesday), which starsSeth RogenandRose Byrneand returns for a second series, is flame-retardant. Will and the married Sylvia do not pine for or want to roll around on each other, but they do rely on, delight in, irritate and deeply understand each other. It’s a worthy addition to what we might call the Ephroniverse – the slim canon of stories about whether straight women and men can be friends. As their titles suggest, Platonic comes to a different conclusion thanWhen Harry Met Sally. It’s the correct conclusion – so why is the question still interesting?Platonic digs into situations we’re more used to seeing in WhatsApp group chats. Sylvia is horrified that Will’s male friendships are more ribald than theirs is. Will realises he has incompatible personalities when he’s with his fiancee and oldest friend, so tries to avoid socialising with them together. Can a man and woman stay friends if his fiancee does not like her? Where do his allegiances lie? While these dilemmas could arise within any friendship, the gendered aspect has a specific thorniness.Despite the title, this is no philosophical treatise. It’s a comedy, occasionally a brilliant one. Rogen made his name in stoner-bro buddy-hang movies, but has elevated himself since. Watching him, I’m mostly wondering: which Muppet am I thinking of? Cookie Monster? Grover? Fozzie Bear? He’s actually a comic straight man, albeit one in whom silliness gleams. Take his pronunciation of Veuve Clicquot, which in Rogen’s mouth delightfully becomes “Voove.” (He’s trying to replace all the bubbly at his engagement party, after a friend of his misplaces an LSD-laced flute. “You’re saying this is a champagne problem?” smirks the shop assistant.)Byrne has proved equally funny, usually playing against her Audrey Hepburn looks. She’s nimble, intelligent, good with detail, able to play big or bone dry as required. She’s at her best when squashing discomfort. In the first episode of the new series, the engaged Will admits he has a crush on a young sandwich-maker. It’s a typical Platonic scenario, pitting Sylvia’s friendship obligations against her feminine solidarity. Byrne squirms as a reluctant wingwoman, yet manages to steer Will wisely, without preaching. “The thing about that girl in there that you have to remember is … she has a Deadpool tattoo. It’s terrible.”Platonic is a comforting watch – low-stakes but precisely observed and full of mischievous turns. The best of its cameos may be Saturday Night Live alumnus Beck Bennett as former party animal Wildcard, friend to both Sylvia and Will. (A laugh-out-loud scene in which he and Will discussSydney Sweeneyhas, against all odds, a kind of magical innocence.) Sylvia’s Jeopardy-loving husband and their sardonic children make welcome returns, alongside her acerbic mom-friend Katie, played by Carla Gallo.The show’s writing is equally weighted to its male and female stars, and it soars on their shared scenes, their bickering zephyrs. When all is said and done, it is a love story. TV has, in the past, contributed to a culturally threadbare understanding of that word. We should welcome this widening lens, a better aspect ratio to understand ourselves.If Platonic had solely been a Larry David-esque examination of friendship’s minutiae, it would have been perfect. There is a higher stakes romantic storyline running through that feels more generic, and may struggle to sustain 10 episodes of interest. Friendship, though, is something we can watch indefinitely, along with peppery dialogue, relatable dilemmas and absurd scenarios. It’s also a healthy reminder that chemistry doesn’t only mean combustible. More often, it’s about fizzing merrily along.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherRose ByrneSeth RogenTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As even those who haven’t read it are likely to know by now, the book charted Raynor Winn and her husband Moth’s emotionally and physically transformative long-distance walk along the South West Coast Path in the wake of utter disaster: a financial collapse that cost them their home, and Moth’s diagnosis with an incurable neurological disorder. Winn followed it with two further books in a similar vein, The Wild Silence and Landlines, also bestsellers. Earlier this year came a film of The Salt Path, starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs. That original book by a first-time writer had become what writers, editors and booksellers all dream of: a bestselling, spin-off generating brand.But it wasn’t the first nature memoir to top the charts, by any means. In 2012,Wildby Cheryl Strayed described the 26-year‑old’s hike across the west coast of America in the wake of her mother’s death and the end of her marriage, and after soaring up the book charts it was made into a film starring Reese Witherspoon two years later. That same year,H Is for Hawkby Helen Macdonald was a surprise bestseller, telling the story of a year spent training a Eurasian goshawk as a journey through grief after the death of their father. In 2016, Amy Liptrot’sThe Outrunsaw her return to the sheep farm on Orkney where she’d grown up in order to recover from addiction through contact with nature; it was also recently filmed, with Saoirse Ronan in the lead role. Meanwhile, in last year’s bestsellingRaising Hare, foreign policy adviser Chloe Dalton describes moving to the countryside, rescuing a leveret and rediscovering her relationship with the land.There is clearly a thriving market for this particular blend of nature writing, personal memoir and a specific form of self-help in which the embattled individual – or in the case of The Salt Path, a couple – finds solace, sustenance and even redemption by withdrawing from everyday society and launching themselves into the great outdoors. It’s not difficult to see why such narratives are attractive, but what do they tell us about ourselves and our relationship with the natural world? And what damage might The Salt Path affair do to this genre of nature memoir?View image in fullscreenThe Salt Path author Raynor Winn with her husband, Moth.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianIt is not given to any of us to know the definitive truth, of course, and any memoir is subject to the pitfalls of perception, memory and judgment. But the two most significant accusations levelled against Winn are that, some time before the journey described in The Salt Path, she embezzled large amounts of money from an employer, and that she exaggerated the severity of Moth’s illness. She denies both, and is particularly insistent that neither she nor Moth intended to suggest that their travels were a miracle cure for his condition.The Salt Path tapped into anxieties about the loss of home and health, and countered them with a portrait of resilienceHowever, the book tapped into a strong desire among readers for narratives of healing through nature. For Melissa Harrison, author of novels for adults and children as well as nonfiction ranging from memoir to nature guides, these kinds of nature books represent “proxies through which we can relate to the natural world in a way that most of us don’t have the time or the inclination to in real life”. Reading about someone else’s deep dive into forest, field or water furnishes us with the sense that we’re participating in an environment that, for much of the time, is at arm’s length. “That mediated experience is reassuring: it tells us that we still have the capacity for a certain depth and intensity of feeling, and that one day, when whatever the circumstances are that prevent us from doing so currently are over, we can pick up our relationship with nature where we left off – most likely in adolescence – and find meaning and belonging again.”View image in fullscreen‘We put all our deepest human meanings into nature – we sort of force them in there’ … author Helen Macdonald.Photograph: Si BarberHarrison adds a cautionary note, however, about the “healing narrative” or “quest structure” in such nature writing. Having admired Dalton’s work, for example, she observes that “for every Raising Hare there are five books in which it seems the author simply wanted to write a nature memoir and cast about for some kind of experience to structure the book. Readers deserve better – and publishers should do better than this.”Harrison is not the only writer I speak with to bring up the issue of publishers’ responsibilities. Indeed, the post-Salt Path conversation has included criticism of Winn’s publisher, Penguin Random House, and its  perceived failure to carry out due diligence on her manuscript. While the more trenchant comments seem tinged with a post-hoc lack of realism – can editors really be expected to play detective and, for example, interview a prospective writer’s wider circle to establish veracity? – there is more justification for the feeling that the industry will publish relentlessly into an area it deems likely to achieve mainstream success, even if that means green-lighting repetitive or imitative work.Mo Hafeez, a commissioning editor at Faber, agrees that there has been a certain homogenisation of writing about the natural world, especially in work coming through after the pandemic. “People were engaging in nature more, purely by virtue of being in lockdown and not being able to see each other,” he says. “There was this surge of nature writing that came through, and often, instead of it being career-long naturalists or academics or people who had been writing in this area for a long time, it was everyday people’s engagements with nature. Which in a way was very lovely, and it democratised the genre quite a lot, but it got to a point where it was quite a saturated area of the market.”View image in fullscreenNature is ‘isn’t all butterflies, sunshine and healing’ … author James Rebanks.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverThe challenge, he thinks, is to resist expectations of what a nature memoir should look like, and remain open to work from unexpected angles – he has recently been reading the poet Jason Allen-Paisant’s nonfiction exploration of rural landscapes in the UK and in Jamaica, for example.There are numerous writers who sit within the genre but are writing according to their own imperative, rather than a notional market: an incomplete list might include Noreen Masud, whose book A Flat Place observes trauma through the lens of different landscapes; poet Polly Atkin, author of a biography of Dorothy Wordsworth and a memoir, Some of Us Just Fall, in which she contemplates her own chronic illness; and Natasha Carthew, writer and founder of the Nature Writing prize for working class writers.It’s likely that none of these writers will compete with Raynor Winn in terms of sales. Bestselling books become so because idea, execution, publishing knowhow and the zeitgeist combine in precisely the right way and at the right moment to capture readers’ imagination. One can certainly see what made The Salt Path successful: a compelling piece of storytelling in its own right, it tapped into deeply held anxieties about the sudden loss of home and health, and countered them with a portrait of resilience against the odds.It is the accusation that Winn misrepresented her husband’s illness, and that the books allowed, if not encouraged, readers to believe that the couple’s walks and wild camping had led to an improvement in his condition, that has provoked the most vehement negative reactions. That strength of feeling is telling.View image in fullscreenAuthor Amy Liptrot returned to the sheep farm on Orkney where she’d grown up in order to recover from addiction.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“What I’m interested in,” says Rachel Hewitt, author of In Her Nature, “is that use of physical illness as morally unambiguous. It’s a shield, isn’t it?” She argues that the full story – whatever the truth of it – would have made a more interesting narrative. But it is easier to market the more crafted tale, which is “actually very simple: a walk from illness to recovery, a walk from homelessness to finding a new concept of home. You know, all those things are quite simple, and there’s clearly something within publishing houses or within readers that really responds to that.”Writing about illness is an intensely personal and immensely delicate undertaking, both in terms of the challenges it holds for the writer and the impact it can have on the reader. Susan Sontag famously outlined the dangers in Illness As Metaphor; Hilary Mantel counselled that “illness strips you back to an authentic self, but not one you need to meet. Too much is claimed for authenticity. Painfully we learn to live in the world, and to be false.”Hewitt suggests that there might be an inherent smoothing over of complication in the stories that publishers find it easiest to present to the public; and that a woman in her 50s, with a necessarily involved past, constitutes a challenge to that narrative simplicity. Hewitt is currently contemplating writing about grief from the perspective of her own widowhood, and has become increasingly aware of “these sort of neat, linear narratives that have become such a staple of nature writing, but don’t represent human experience”.In terms of writing about the natural world, author Nic Wilson believes this approach is symptomatic of “much wider societal attitudes towards nature and the transactional way that quite a lot of our society goes into the relationship with nature”. Her debut book, Land Beneath the Waves, has been published recently, and she explains how she initially resisted the idea of writing about her family history and her own chronic illness in relation to nature, deterred partly by an awareness of the limitations of memory, and partly by a belief that her story was too “ordinary”.“I think perhaps even some of the books that are billed as healing narratives are more complex than that. It’s just that this becomes sort of a trope that’s talked about. And I think it simplifies things, and sets a precedent that other books are expected to follow, which is not helpful to [having] a diversity of voices within memoir, particularly within nature memoir, because the greater diversity of voices we have, the more people’s individual experiences are validated and spoken to.”Through all these conversations, there’s a clear insistence that we need to see “nature” not as a resource, but as a multifaceted and interdependent series of contexts and environments. “Let’s be honest, it’s full of death, isn’t it?” says James Rebanks, whose accounts of his life as a farmer in The Shepherd’s Life and English Pastoral have recently been joined by The Place of Tides, a memoir about time spent with a wild duck farmer on a Norwegian island. As he points out, nature is “full of death and disease and failure and decline. It isn’t all butterflies, sunshine and healing, is it? In my last book, I was trying to make it more complicated: nature can be lonely. Nature can be too quiet. It can be too isolated. It can lead to you not being in the right place. And nature itself is broken, so it can make you depressed. It’s falling apart around you. I find it more interesting when it’s less about personal redemption and more of a mirror on the big things that I care about: the politics, the economics, what’s actually really happening in the world.”View image in fullscreen‘We can’t write ourselves out of the narratives; we’re the ones telling the story’ … Jessica Lee.Rebanks, who loves Tolstoy and the American writer Wendell Berry and thinks of himself in the tradition of the agrarian radical, is an engaging presence, both off and on the page and, like the best writers on nature, is alive to the frequent contradictions in portraying it in either fiction or nonfiction. Helen Macdonald, too, whose prize-winning H Is for Hawk has been made into a film with Claire Foy and Brendan Gleeson, is acutely aware of the expectations we bring to the genre.“Nature is considered to be the one place free of human artifice, the place where deep universal truths can be uncovered that are not to do with us,” Macdonald says, “which, of course, is bullshit. That’s not the case. We put all our deepest human meanings into nature. We sort of force them in there, and then we use them to prove the veracity of our own concepts back at us, which is what nature writing does all the time.”Macdonald highlights a literary-critical tradition that is useful in understanding both the success of The Salt Path and the reaction to its alleged departures from fact. “Tramp” or “vagabonding” literature, which flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, was by its nature highly individualistic and accepted to contain fabrications; it encompassed writing by those who were marginalised from society, and those, like George Orwell, who put themselves in that position in order to analyse societal structures. It’s a world away from contemporary memoir and the idea that nature can be instrumental in making us feel better.So is the genre now facing an existential crisis? Is there still room in the market for stories of journeys into the wilderness, complete with a healing narrative? For Jessica Lee, author of books for both adults and children and the founder of The Willowherb Review, which ran from 2018 to 2022 and aimed to provide a platform for writers of colour, the issues raised by The Salt Path furore present us with an opportunity to explore innovative ways of writing about nature.“If we’re talking about wanting to write about the natural world,” Lee says, “we can’t get rid of ourselves. We can’t write ourselves out of the narratives; we’re the ones telling the story. But what we can do is allow the world to inform the shape that we take.” That means resisting the idea of linear progression, or redemptive arcs, in favour of the cyclical and the messy. “The personal, with us at the centre, can be the door that opens the story. But then we really need to be very proactively seeking to undo that the second we’ve opened that door.”Meanwhile, the fallout from such microscopic attention to a huge bestseller offers us a window into the realities of nature publishing, where experimentation and complexity persist, but often do so without the resources afforded to more commercially appealing narratives. A salutary lesson, perhaps, but not one likely to deter the most adventurous and committed of those attempting to survey our threatened environment and to capture both its wonders and its fragility.Explore more on these topicsPublishingAutobiography and memoirScience and nature booksBiography booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inside the high-stakes, secretive world of competitive spreadsheetingNew documentary Spreadsheet Champions follows six competitors as they head to the Microsoft Office Specialist world championship in FloridaGiselle Au-Nhien NguyenFri 1 Aug 2025 20.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Aug 2025 10.27 EDTShareSix years ago, Melbourne-based film-maker Kristina Kraskov read an article about an internationalMicrosoftExcel competition and had two thoughts. The first: “What the hell, that can’t be real.” The second: “There’s got to be a film about this – I want to watch it so badly.”There wasn’t a film about competitive spreadsheeting, so Kraskov decided to make it herself. The subject appealed to the director, whose work captures “different inner worlds that are a bit unusual on the outside”, including a short film titled Party in the Back, about a mullet festival.Spreadsheet Champions, which will screen at the Melbourne international film festival, follows six young competitors from around the world as they head to Florida for the 2023Microsoft Office Specialist world championshipto showcase their skills. It might sound silly, but Excel is an incredibly sophisticated application – according to the documentary, the average person uses only 10-15% of its capabilities, but would-be competitors are required to understand closer to 70% of what it can do.The competition is built and run by Certiport, a performance-based examination provider, and officially endorsed by Microsoft. It’s a two-parter: the first half tests proficiency in formulas, functions and features through a series of complex questions, graded on both accuracy and speed. The second section is a more creative application of this knowledge – as Kraskov puts it, “understanding the story of the data, or the soul of what it is actually telling you”.View image in fullscreen‘It helped me a lot’ … Carmina, the teenage competitor from Guatemala, in Spreadsheet Champions.Photograph: Supplied by Melbourne international film festivalThe championship has run since 2002 and is open to students between the ages of 13 and 22. Each competitor first has to qualify as the best in their home country. For such an esoteric endeavour, the stakes are oddly high – the MOS championship only allows competitors to enter once in their lives.“In most sporting competitions, you have your main players that come back every year and your very set rivalries – but for this competition, they can only compete once, so everyone that’s coming through can never come back,” Kraskov says.“They qualify in their home countries at vastly different times around the world, so it made it really challenging for us – but as soon as anyone qualified in a country that we could go to, we would talk to them on Zoom, and work our way down from there.”The six competitors in Spreadsheet Champions are Alkimini, 20, from Greece; Braydon, 16, from Australia; Carmina, 16, from Guatemala; De La Paix, 19, from Cameroon (who doesn’t have a laptop or wifi, so had to study at school); Mason, 15, from the US; and Nam, 21, from Vietnam. Each contestant has personality quirks which shine through in the film – from the camera-shy and stereotypically “nerdy” to the charismatic and boisterous. “Our intention is really about how amazing this competition is – we’re not here to make fun of or disparage anyone,” Kraskov says.View image in fullscreenDe La Paix, right, from Cameroon, doesn’t have a laptop or wifi, so had to prepare for the competition at school.Photograph: Supplied by Melbourne international film festivalKraskov and the film’s producer, Anna Charalambous, spent about a week with each competitor in their home country, observing their day-to-day lives, from home to school, and spending time with their family and friends.“People reveal themselves a lot if you just pay attention to how they live their lives,” Kraskov says. “Teenagers are not quite fully formed adults yet, so they don’t really connect things about themselves or their personalities – they just live their lives. The parents were so insightful and knowledgable about their kids – it gave us a lot of information about how they would potentially thrive or struggle, and who they really were.”Many of the contest’s specifics are shrouded in secrecy, which posed another challenge for the film-makers. The competition is overseen by a man named – in a wonderful example of nominative determinism – Bing.“It’s so high-level security,” Kraskov says. “Bing eventually trusted us and gave us questions that would be retired … At the end of the day, he has to deliver a hardcore, secure, world-expert level exam the next year, and our priority is to show the complexity of what it is and what they’re doing.”Participating in the MOS Championship can set these kids up for adult life. Carmina, the Guatemalan competitor, is now 18 and studying mechatronics engineering at university. In the film, she is shown as a bubbly, bright teenager who loves One Direction (she still does) and excels at, well, Excel.‘You didn’t just succeed, you Exceled’: Sydney man dubbed the ‘Annihilator’ wins spreadsheet world championshipRead moreWatching the documentary transported Carmina back to the competition and her younger self – and made her realise what she took from the experience. “I knew the results already, but watching it again [I felt] a little bit of suspense,” she says. “I tend to doubt a little bit of myself and with that experience [of competing] I learned to just go into it and try things out … It helped me a lot.”Spreadsheet Champions had its world premiere at SXSW in Texas earlier this year and five of the six students will be in Melbourne to attend Miff. Kraskov is proud to shine a light on them – everyday people doing something a little different with their lives.“Celebrities, musicians and models get plenty of attention,” she says. “But people that dedicate their lives to things that a lot of people don’t care about – I find that so much more fascinating.”Spreadsheet Champions airs at the Melbourne international film festival from 10-24 August;see here for all dates and locations.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsMicrosoftComputingMelbourne international film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We emerge like an amphibious invasion force – about 160 swimmers, making our way to the hotel pool bar where drinks await. So far, so civilised. But this is only a warm-up …View image in fullscreenOn 24 August 1875, Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim the Channel, slathered in animal fat to fend off the cold. At the time, it was heralded as a feat of near-superhuman endurance. One hundred and fifty years later, I signed up for a modern take on the 33.3km (21-mile) swim (the shortest distance across the Channel, although Webb was blown off course and ended up swimming something like 63km). This Croatian adaptation involves swimming between islands off the Dalmatian coast, is split across four days and includes a welcoming hotel (the three-star Places Hvar by Valamar) to recuperate in at the end of each day. And thankfully, neoprene has replaced tallow.Within minutes, I spot an octopus waving lazily from its underwater gardenThe trip is run byUltraSwim 33.3, a new company named after the Channel stretch, offering multiday swim challenges in spectacular locations – Croatia, Montenegro, Greece and Switzerland – with an emphasis on comfort and support.“The Channel is the Everest of swims,” says Mark Turner, UltraSwim 33.3’s co-founder. “But the window to do it is short, it’s expensive, and – let’s be honest – not a particularly appetising stretch of water. With us, you get the same distance in beautiful surroundings, without having to rough it.”View image in fullscreenThe writer, ‘trying not to think about how far I am from dry land’I’ve been on swimming holidays before with companies such as SwimTrek and StrelSwimmingAdventures, and I’ve swum up to 5km a day, but with breaks for drinks, lunch and soaking up the sun. UltraSwim takes a more structured, challenge-oriented approach. Each day begins early – we are in the water by 8am, before boat traffic picks up – and swimmers go up to 12km without pausing for more than a quick pit stop.A detailed training plan landed in my inbox after I’d signed up and I quickly realised I wasn’t fit enough, or perhaps was mentally unprepared, for the full 33.3km swim. Thankfully, there were two shorter options available: the 11.1km “Discovery” and the 22.2km “Build” packages, both nodding to the Channel challenge.On the first day, we set off from a jetty close to the hotel and, within minutes, I spot an octopus waving lazily from its underwater garden. I’d love to linger, but time and tide wait for no swimmer. Several kilometres later, I stumble out of the water on to the beach at Uvala Veli Dolac, exhausted but elated. We are greeted by a spread of high-energy snacks and a lot of talk about carb loading – a far cry from Webb’s fuelling strategy of beer, brandy and beef tea.I enjoy swimming across the sun-dappled kelp forests, the calm rhythm of stroke after strokeAccording to theChannel Swimming and Piloting Federation, Webb’s swim has now been repeated 3,250 times. The endurance trend is visible in other areas, too, from ultramarathons and multiday cycling tours to open-water relays. Increasingly, it seems, people want to return from holiday not rested but with a sense of accomplishment.On days two and three, we tackle some proper “Channel” swims across 2-3km stretches of open water, from the Kabal headland to Stiniva beach, and Cape Pelegrin to Palmižana. On the map these are marked as ferry routes, but the views I enjoyed from the deck when I arrived in Hvar – all pine-studded islands and turquoise waters – feel very different when in the water: a distant headland to aim for, choppy seas and the occasional jellyfish.I’ve never attempted anything quite like this before, and it’s not a challenge I relish. But I put my head down and try not to think about how far I am from dry land. There’s a GPS tracker in my tow float, kayakers on either side, and a clear course to follow – thankfully more straightforward than the one Webb swam, where strong tides dragged him way off course, turning a 21-mile crossing into a 39-mile slog.View image in fullscreenStari Grad on Hvar, one of the oldest towns in Europe.Photograph: Nathaniel Noir/AlamyAs I swim for just over two hours, I find it hard to fathom how he kept going for nearly 22. I distract myself by recalling snapshots from the trip: the 16th-century Tvrdalj Castle in Stari Grad, where the poet Petar Hektorović once lived; and the Diocletian’s Palace in Split, where I spent a relaxed day exploring its golden alleyways and multiple layers of history, from the Roman and Venetian empires to Yugoslavia and the past 30 years of an independent Croatia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The name “Pakleni” comes frompaklina, a pine resin once used for boat building.Our 160-strong group is made up of swimmers from across the globe, from as far and wide as Brazil, Dubai and Australia. There are almost equal numbers of men and women, with ages ranging from 20 to 73. Some are training for an actual Channel crossing, others just want a challenge.“It’s type-two fun,” Joe from Dublin tells me. “The kind that’s only fun after it’s over.” I think I’m more of a type-one (enjoying things at the time) person, but I do enjoy swimming across the sun-dappled kelp forests, the calm rhythm of stroke after stroke, and the quiet pride of finishing each day’s swim.View image in fullscreenThe Pakleni archipelago, off the southwest coast of Hvar island.Photograph: Ivan Coric/Alamy“We find that people surprise themselves,” says Turner. “The way we structure it with pacing and support, swimmers who’ve never gone beyond a few kilometres leave feeling they’ve done something extraordinary.”Non-swimming partners aren’t left out. They can follow by boat, cheer from the shore or explore Stari Grad and Hvar. One non-swimmer told me he’d racked up a fair few kilometres on an ebike, visiting lavender farms, vineyards and sleepy fishing villages. “Other than a brief dip, swimming’s not really my thing,” he shrugged. “But my girlfriend loves it, so we’re both happy.”On the final day, we aim for the bell tower of St Stephen’s Cathedral and swim the last few kilometres into Hvar’s harbour, emerging beside the Venetian arsenal to a glass of champagne, handed to us after we pass the finishing posts, to bemused stares from regular tourists.A few hours later, after a soothing massage in a spa hotel, I’m wandering Hvar’s labyrinthine streets, stopping to enjoy fresh fish and Croatian wine, with no more talk of carb loading. I didn’t win anything. I didn’t swim the full 33.3km. But I completed the 11.1km course and tasted something akin to what Captain Webb must have felt: the slow, steady triumph of body over distance, albeit without the freezing water of the Channel, or the beef tea. And, instead of the pale grey cliffs of Cap Gris-Nez to signal the end, the golden limestone of Hvar.The trip was provided byUltraSwim 33.3.

We visited both during Victoria’s fifth Covid lockdown in 2021.Henbury is a site where a nickel-iron meteor about the size of a garden shed disintegrated before striking the land to carve out over a dozen impact craters, just 4,500 years ago – so recently that the site has significant cultural meaning as a sorry place for the Luritja people, whose sacred songs and oral histories tell of this devastating event.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningScientific models suggest the meteorites hit Earth at 40,000km/h in an explosion akin to the Hiroshima blast.View image in fullscreenA chunk of meteor found in 1931 at Henbury.Photograph: Matteo Chinellato/AlamyThe site’s 12 craters are best viewed when the sunlight’s low angle reveals the smaller, heavily eroded examples. Among the youngest of Earth’s known impact sites, Henbury’s pits have been scoured by wind and rare deluges down the Finke River flood plain. Extreme temperatures do the rest.The largest crater is 180m across, the smallest the size of a back yard spa. The explosion sprayed out tonnes of pulverised rock in a distinctive rayed pattern still visible around Crater No.3 – the only known terrestrial example. Temptingly, specimens of the actual meteorite hurled out with this ejecta may still be found. The 45kg chunk in the Museum of Central Australia is one example of 680kg collected so far, though digging or damaging the site without a permit is illegal. We don’t find any meteorite fragments, but we leave with memories of a humming sunrise and night with a billion almost touchable stars.View image in fullscreenAt night, the sky above the MacDonnell Ranges is dazzling – unmarred by urban light pollution.Photograph: burroblando/Getty ImagesFrom Tylers Pass lookout, two hours west along the Namatjira Drive from Alice Springs, Tnorala (Gosse Bluff) appears as a mountain range thrusting incongruously from the endless western plains. In fact, these peaks were created in seconds when an object up to 1km wide hit the Earth at about 250,000km/h, 142m years ago, with an explosive force at least 20 times more powerful than all the world’s nuclear weapons.No trace of that object has been found, so it was likely an icy comet that vaporised on impact. Erosion has since reduced the crater from its original 22km diameter. Satellite images uncannily resemble a staring eye under a sunburnt brow.View image in fullscreenThe Larapinta trail is known for its stunning desert scenery, ancient rock formations, and diverse flora and fauna.Photograph: Andrew Herrick/The GuardianSpecimens in the Museum of Central Australia show that early Cretaceous central Australia was wetter and cooler than it is now, with abundant dinosaurs. Locally, they would have been vaporised, and anything living within 100km killed by the massive shock wave and extreme heat. The sound of the explosion likely travelled around the world. The Tnorala bolide event was a prelude to the big one, Chicxulub on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula, which wiped out the dinosaurs 77m years later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A group of star woman were dancing in a corroboree in the Milky Way when one woman placed her baby in a turna (wooden cradle). The dancing shook the galaxy and the turna slipped, with the baby falling to Earth as a blazing star, striking the ground to create the crater’s distinctive bowl shape.These days “awesome” is a word debased by glib use. It’s apt driving into the 5km-wide Tnorala crater, surrounded by cliffs 180 metres high, formed in a blink by a literally Earth-shattering event as our planet’s crust rebounded to form the crater’s inner ring. The rock strata in these peaks show that some were lifted from a depth of 4km by incredible explosive force, and are now inverted.View image in fullscreenThe view over Tnorala (Gosse Bluff), a crater created by a meteor.Photograph: Genevieve Vallee/AlamyIt’s not just awareness of this ancient violence that marks Tnorala as a sorry place. Local information boards describe it as a pre-colonial massacre site. So it’s doubly proper that camping is forbidden.It’s an unwelcoming place, where an object large enough to be classified as a city-killer fell from the sky. This kind of comet is now thankfully detectable by telescopes such as the new Vera C Rubin observatory in Chile, and also proven asfeasible to steer off course.So forget Mars. Cancel that ticket. Instead, visit awesome central Australia – where the mountains are upside down, the stars greet your fingertips and the dawns are so silent you can hear the sun sing.Need to knowTheMuseum of Central Australiais hosting aHenbury Meteorite reserve discovery dayon 10 August as part of National Science week.Henbury: Day trips to theHenbury Meteorites conservation reserverequire aNorthern Territory parks passand the site can be reached by 2WD vehicles, however 4WDs are recommended.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.‘What I’ve learned today,” says my friend Lucy, stepping firmly away from the crisp buffet, “is that you can have too much of a good thing.” My volunteer testers and I were enthusiastic about the prospect of tasting our way through 10 types of lightly salted, crisply fried potato, but we all agreed, once they were laid out side by side in anonymous bowls, that it was surprisingly hard to differentiate between them. That said, good news: every single one had its cheerleaders, so there were no real duds in this sample.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To outline what I’m looking for from a salted crisp, it should be crisp, obviously. To this end, all the bags were opened at the same time, just before the blind tasting. Salt levels are a matter of personal preference, though it should be upfront rather than a mere seasoning, while, in an ideal world, the potatoes themselves would be the primary flavour, rather than a mere texture. They should be cooked long enough that they crunch, rather than melt between the teeth, but it’s a delicate balance: too long in the oil and they’ll be bitter. And that oil – if you can taste it at all – should be pleasant: too strong a flavour, even of the best fat, will overpower the spuds. Last, crisps should be dangerously moreish: if you can eat one and stop, they’re not good crisps.The best salted crispsBest overall:San Nicasio Himalayan pink salt potato chipsView image in fullscreen£3.25 for 150g at Waitrose (£2.17/100g)£74.36 for 14 x 150g at Amazon (£3.54/100g)★★★★☆The most divisive crisps of the day, with marks ranging from one (Rose, seven, and representing the youth vote) to five (me). Noticeably yellow, thanks to the extra-virgin olive oil they’re cooked in (which, unlike the Himalayan pinkness of the salt, comes through in the flavour, hence, perhaps, the loss of the kid vote), they prompt the demand: “Serve me these with an aperitivo immediately: crunch, salt, good oil – YES.” Sadly, these Andalusian crisps have a far higher fat content than any of the others tested. One for picking at elegantly over a chilled glass of sherry.Best bargain:Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference lightly sea salted hand-cooked crispsView image in fullscreen£1.25 for 150g at Sainsbury’s (83p/100g)★★★★☆Though some find them a little undersalted, these chunky crisps’ “classic flavour” finds favour, with several testers noting with excitement that they “actually taste of potato!” While the comments section attracts several variations on “mid-range” (Rose judges them merely “OK”), the decent flavour and excellent crunch make this a great value choice.And the rest …M&S hand-cooked lightly sea salted crispsView image in fullscreen£1.80 for 150g at Ocado (£1.20/100g)★★★☆☆Rose finds these too crunchy, but that very quality appeals to the person who says they’d be perfect for a hangover. “Nice enough,” someone else says, “but surprised not to find one I like more.” That sums these up – a decent, aggressively crunchy crisp with a high salt content, but missing that elusive potatoey flavour.Waitrose sea salt hand-cooked crispsView image in fullscreen£1.50 for 150g at Waitrose (£1/100g)★★★☆☆“Perfectly fine,” one tester finds, before admitting: “Actually quite moreish.” Someone else judges them “generic”. Thin and crisp, which divides opinion, from “nothing to them” to “better – lighter!”, Rose judges them “too spicy”, but I rather like their saltiness and the fact that – hurrah! – they taste of baked potato. I’d buy these again.Co-op Irresistible hand-cooked lightly sea salted crispsView image in fullscreen£1.70 for 150g at Co-op (£1.13/100g)★★★☆☆Cooked skin on, which gives them a decent potatoey flavour. There are a few slightly sweet, caramelised ones in here, suggesting an older potato, but in general these are crunchy, well-balanced crisps that would perform well in most situations, from festival pre-drinks to family picnics. “Middle of the road,” as Rob observes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

They’re not my favourite, though, even when cooked by the pros – I find these a bit greasy, while other testers judge them “blah” and “cardboardy … does not break when you bite in”. Several testers say they “need more salt”, but I’ll let them off, given they’re described only as lightly salted (always a red flag for me).Tyrrell’s lightly sea salted crispsView image in fullscreen£2 for 150g at Ocado (£1.33/100g)£2.50 for 150g at Tesco (£1.67/100g)★★☆☆☆“Bang average” sums up the response to these. “Wouldn’t put out for guests.” Rose finds them “too bitey” (they are, it must be said,verycrisp), someone else finds them “bland”, and several tasters say they feel “cheap” and “basic”, which is not reflected in the price. Disappointing.Morrisons The Best hand-cooked skin-on sea salt crispsView image in fullscreen£1.30 for 125g at Morrisons (£1.04/100g)★★☆☆☆These apparently taste as if “they were opened last night”. “A bit stale,” someone else agrees. “Wrong texture, dense.” Personally, I like a thicker crisp, but these are a little too chewy and even I find them a touch salty, though, checking the labels afterwards, they contain less salt than some of the others, so maybe it’s just that the flavour is more intense. Might be better served with a creamy dip to balance this out.Aldi Specially Selected lightly salted hand-cooked crispsView image in fullscreen£1.09 for 150g at Aldi (73p/100g)★★☆☆☆“Too thick, like eating greasy batter out of the bottom of the chip paper, and not in a good way,” one tester says, and although I love a thicker crisp, I’m inclined to agree – these are a bit tough, rather than snappy, and taste, as Rose notes, “too oily”.Walkers ready salted crispsView image in fullscreen£1.50 for 150g at Sainsbury’s (£1/100g)£1.48 for 150g at Asda (99p/100g)★★☆☆☆Rose, who confides in me that these are the only crisps she knows, picks them out from the lineup in seconds – they’re far paler and more uniform than the others – but even she’s not that enthusiastic. “Not crunchy enough” is a common complaint, while someone else thinks they’re so light, they’re almost “a health snack”. The final damning verdict comes from Claire: “An anaemic pub crisp. Fine with a cold pint, otherwise lacking.”Explore more on these topicsSnacksThe FilterFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hot days spent camping with friends, impromptu picnics in the park, afternoons watching the tennis, reading in the garden with Test Match Special on in the background.Foodhas had to fit around summer life and, of all the meals, this has been one of the best. It has summer etched into the heart of it in that it’s fresh, flavourful and good for feeding a crowd. It’s a (very) wild take on Laotian crispy rice salad and is abundant with herbs, garden vegetables and, crucially, there’s barely any “cooking” involved at all.Summer crispy rice salad with tofu, lime and herbsIf you want to get ahead, cook the rice earlier or even the day before, and refrigerate. Not all vegan fish sauces are equal: Thai Taste makesa good one.Prep15 minCook1 hrServes4, or 6 as a side350g jasmine rice, or 1kg leftover cooked rice5 tbsp rapeseed oil280g extra-firm tofu, drained2-3 red bird’s eye chillies, to taste, stalks discarded, flesh finely sliced7½ tbsp vegan fish sauce7½ tbsp lime juice(from 4-5 limes)1½ tbsp light muscovado sugar1 large cucumber(300g), halved lengthways, seeds scooped out and flesh cut into julienne strips3 round shallots, peeled, halved and cut into very thin half-moons300g cherry tomatoes, halved40g coriander, roughly chopped40g mint, leaves picked50g roasted salted peanuts, choppedIf you’re cooking the rice from scratch, put it in a sieve and rinse under the cold tap until the water runs clear. Tip the rice into a pan, add 600ml just-boiled water and bring back to a boil. Cover, turn down the heat to a whisper and leave to cook for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the rice to steam, still with the lid on, for another five minutes. Spread the rice on your largest oven tray and leave to cool completely.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Stir three tablespoons of oil through the cooled rice, then bake, turning occasionally, for 45 minutes, until golden and crisp at the edges.Put the drained tofu on a board and crumble it with your fingers (or use the back of a knife to break it up). Tip on to a second oven tray, drizzle over the remaining two tablespoons of oil and bake for the last 20 minutes of the rice cooking time.Take out the rice and tofu trays and leave to cool slightly. In a bowl, whisk the chilli, fish sauce, lime juice and sugar until the sugar dissolves.In a large bowl, combine the cucumber, shallot, tomatoes, herbs, tofu and peanuts, add the crisp rice, then pour the dressing over the top. Toss gently to coat everything evenly, then serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegan food and drinkSaladRiceVegetarian food and drinkSummer food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

This means I’ve never walked into a cafe, fresh-faced and sober at 9am, with the intention of raving.But this is 2025, not the late 1990s, and people are possiblymore questioning of the cost of partyingon their bodies than they once were. So, coffee raves have become a thing.They’re all over the world and come in many shapes and sizes, tending towards the bijou. Inevitably, they’re big in Los Angeles and on social media, and are often the territory of young people, athleisurewear and brand collaborations.The rise of booze-free backpacking: why gen Z are choosing to travel soberRead moreThey’re so popular, they’ve also become fair game. In a TikTok rant last week, musician Keli Holiday said what I might have been thinking: “Call me old, call me jaded, but enough is enough, no more coffee raves … If you want to get your rave on … go to a rave or go to a club.”But on a rainy Saturday morning in central Sydney, I try one out – dubbed Maple Social Club – approaching with caution. I’m not a leisurewear wearer or an Instagrammer or indeed a coffee drinker.My young adult life was, rightly or wrongly, given to maximum nights out and minimum responsibility – and my weekends now are generally about children and sleep. If there’s a cafe involved, it’s usually peaceful.View image in fullscreenMaple Social Club is less than a year old. The morning rave suits a city such as Sydney, where residents are among the world’s earliest to bed and earliest risers.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/The GuardianOrganiser Taylor Gwyther, 25, tells me morning raves are an add-on to the night-time variety, not instead of. “But, there’s definitely a trend away from alcohol that I think encourages events like this to be popular,” she says as the first arrivals begin to enter the warehouse space behind Wilson cafe in Surry Hills.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningMaple Social Club, which Gwyther founded with Connor Cameron, 23, is less than a year old and was inspired by run clubs and LA’s AM radio morning DJ sets. Their free events provide an alibi, Gwyther says, in the same way a run club is a little bit about running and a lot about meeting people.“Covid shut down a lot of social life and created lonely adjacent habits, and people are looking to revitalise how they spend their time,” she says. “We spend so much time online for work and now play, I think people are looking for places and spaces to spend offline. We’re trying to make it easier to find those things.”Morning raves also make sense on another, more local, level. Sydney residents are among the world’s earliest to bed and earliest risers. In a city whose nightlife sits well below its beaches, wealth and wellness reputations, mornings are sacrosanct.The music’s not quite loud enough, or bassy enough, to lose myself – but, by about 10.30am, I think I might be dancing.Daisy DumasPlus, it’s expensive to party the normal way in a city with a famously stratospheric cost of living. A beer is about $12 in the pubs nearby. Here, a coffee is about $5 – and there’s no need to buy a drink at all. Because, as Bronte, a 30-year-old nurse tells me later on the dancefloor, “Who’s got money these days, really?”Michael Pung, 39, a property valuer from Sydney, saw the event advertised on Instagram.“I thought I’d check it out. I’ve been single for a while and I thought I might as well just come out and meet people,” he says, queueing in the long and slow-moving coffee line – which, handily for him, doubles as another opportunity to meet people.Like me, he’s not normally a coffee drinker but, given he was out late last night Latin dancing, he says “probably today’s the day”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s already busy and I feel too exposed, too daylit, too close to too many raised phones. But, everyone – and I really mean everyone – is smiling.View image in fullscreenDaisy Dumas (left) talks to Maple Social Club co-founder Taylor Gwyther.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/The GuardianBy 10am, the dancefloor is heaving with what feels like a roughly 50/50 mix of men and women. There are some older people, but generally the crowd is aged 20 to 35 – and as Gwyther predicted, “super diverse”. Some have made a morning of it and are wearing what I would consider proper going-out attire with high heels; others are grungy, and most are in baggy jeans.Bronte, who lives locally, is here with friends. She says her evening and night shifts as a nurse mean she is often socially “removed from the night”. She’s sweaty and happy and hard to hear above the music. “I’ve done all my walking for the day,” she says, referring to another thing that didn’t used to be a thing:step count.Like Pung, she also goes out at night-time, but having the option to dance her working week away come Saturday morning is, as she puts it, “very nice”.My petty gripe: I don’t begrudge your coffee addiction – but do you have to be such a bore about it?Read moreThe music’s not quite loud enough, or bassy enough, to lose myself – but, by about 10.30am, I think I might be dancing. People near me are drinking iced matcha lattes, which I’ll never condone, but as the DJ drops a relative banger, I admit to my colleague, who is photographing this road test, that I’m having quite an uplifting start to my weekend. The day is still young and there’s an afterparty at a pub nearby and yet another planned for the afternoon.Before I leave (it’s approaching 11am after all) I turn to talk to a man who is watching on from close to the DJ area. Liam, 25, is almost-but-not-quite dancing, and it turns out he works for Red Bull events. He’s here professionally: might Maple’s coffee raves be worth bringing into the energy drink’s gargantuan sponsorship embrace?“We see just as much relevance for Red Bull in an occasion like this [as] a music festival or the F1,” he says with no small amount of enthusiasm.Stepping around some spilt milk, it strikes me there is no alcohol-edged aggro, argy bargy at the bar or intimidating bouncers. Just music and broad daylight – plus caffeine, in hot, cold and increasingly corporatised modes.View image in fullscreenThis is 2025, not the late-1990s.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsCoffeeAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"
