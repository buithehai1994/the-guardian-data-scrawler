I think the strategy at the moment that is around delivery, which is necessary, but frankly, not sufficient,” Haigh said.“What kind of government wouldn’t want to demonstrate delivery for their policy priorities? We need clarifying language, and we need to pick some battles and show by defining those battles whose side we’re on.”She also predicted that it was “inevitable” Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, would have to put up taxes later this year to meet her fiscal rules and avoid further unpopular spending cuts that have alarmed Labour MPs and angered voters.Starmer has found himself under fire from his own backbenches after losing his first byelection in government toFarage’s party by just six votes. Reform UK also won control of10 councils, more than 670 council seats, and two mayoraltiesin a bad night for Labour and even worse for the Conservatives.Labour is split about the best way to tackle Reform, with No 10 insisting it will go “further and faster” with its current plan while some of its MPs want it to change course. Jo White, a Labour MP and leader of the Red Wall caucus, called on Starmer to “stop pussyfooting around” and be more decisive on domestic policy, while the veteran MP, Clive Efford, said the idea the public want “more of the same is just nonsense”.However, there is no agreement about whether the party should focus on trying to win back voters tempted by Reform’s rightwing populism or move to concentrate on cementing support from voters on the progressive left and centre.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, defended the government’s approach to broadcasters on Sunday, saying it was not possible to “turn around a country in nine months” after it was left in a mess by the Tories.“All I’d say to people is: we’ve got the message, we’re not daft, we haven’t got our heads in the sand. All I ask people for is a bit of time and to give us the benefit of the doubt … We are going at those challenges as hard and fast as we can,” he told the BBC’sLaura Kuenssberg.Haigh, the most senior Labour MP to publicly criticise the party’s strategy yet, joined the ranks of anxious Labour politicians who have been analysing what Thursday’s elections might mean for them at the next election.She warned that the party had to stop prioritising Reform-inclined voters at the expense of those on the left, saying Labour won the last election because it held together a broad coalition of voters from leftwing progressives to social conservatives by promising change.“We have an absolute imperative to maintain the balance as we govern. It simply won’t be enough to go back to people at the next general election and ask them to vote for us purely so we can keep the Tories or Reform out.”Ministers and Labour MPs are increasingly concerned that No 10 is not worried enough about the risk of losing voters on the left over issues from Gaza to welfare cuts.A new poll for the public affairs firm Apella Advisors, conducted by Find Out Now, found last week that the threat of drifting progressive voters was significant. Among Labour 2024 voters, 43% said they would be likely to consider voting Green and 40% Lib Dems. Just 9% said they could consider voting Reform.Farage was appealing to some Labour voters with a policy platform that was not exclusively rightwing, she said, with pledges to nationalise some industries.The former cabinet minister suggested that a big economic offer at the spending review would give Starmer an opportunity to show those voters “they were listening”, while simultaneously winning over Reform supporters.“Farage has been in the House of Commons recently with a steel nationalisation pitch, he favours water nationalisation. Reform voters, according to Hope Not Hate, are more in favour of banning fire-and-rehire than Labour voters are,” Haigh said.Haigh called on Starmer and Reeves to change their rhetoric around the “trade-offs” between policies, as she fears it is fuelling voters anger around issues such as immigration, which she said was a symptom of people’s frustration at the “broken system”.She said such language would allow people to “naturally conclude” that “there is no more money for pensioners or for welfare, but they [the Labour government] do have the money for [asylum seeker] hotels or they do have the money for international aid”.A recent survey conducted by More in Common found that 67% of voters who were planning to backReform UKat the local elections were driven to the party because their most important concern were “national policies on immigration”.Hinting at the negative language about the economy that was used to justify difficult decisions such as the winter fuel cut, Haigh said: “I think certainly over last summer, I think there was pretty much a consensus now that we overdid it on the tough language.”With Reeves under pressure from some Labour MPs to put up taxes or increase borrowing rather than opting for more spending cuts to balance the nation’s books, Haigh suggested that tax increases this autumn were inevitable given the economic backdrop.“A changed approach to tax is almost inevitable, because I think without it we’re going to see the government keeping on coming back and making the same type of decisions as they’ve done around welfare on a very regular basis,” she said.“You know, every time President Trump implements a new policy, implements a new tariff, changes his mind or something, it’s going to affect the chancellor’s headroom.“We’re going to be presented with these very difficult and unpalatable choices again. So I think the likelihood of the current tax policy staying the same is highly unlikely.”Many Labour MPs are privately furious about the government’s decision to institute sweeping welfare cuts, and the impact on child poverty, with the government’s strategy yet to be published.Haigh said it was “obviously completely unacceptable” that child poverty is set to increase, according to the government’s own impact assessment. But she stopped short of saying whether she would vote against the contentious cuts to disability benefit payments.“I do worry about a repeat to strategy that [could] mean we keep on cutting money from the sort of ‘bottom of the pile’. So many people joined the Labour party and were inspired by the work of the last Labour government on child poverty.“The last thing any Labour government should do is create more poverty and push people actively into poverty.”Haigh declined to discuss her departure from government – and ruled out any future leadership bid of her own.However, she raised her concerns around the frequent briefings against her female cabinet ministers that she said “stifles debate” at the top of government.“They’re being briefed against for their comments in cabinet; that’s not acceptable. Cabinet needs to be the space where people can bring their concerns and actively debate them. Otherwise, there’s frankly no point in them being at that table,” she said.“I do think there is a particular issue among some [male] advisers against women, frankly, at the cabinet table.”Explore more on these topicsLouise HaighKeir StarmerLabourReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes as the government draws up its firstdedicated cancer strategysince 2015.Evidencehas shown that a desire not to “bother” a GP is more common among those with potential signs of cancer in the UK than in other countries. Between a fifth and a third of people in Britainwould not want to waste the doctor’s time.Cancer specialists have urged peoplewith symptomssuch as fatigue, bleeding and weight loss to get investigated urgently, so they can start treatment sooner if they do have it.Failure to act quickly helps to explain Britain’s dismal record, by international standards, in diagnosing cancer early. Although cancer survival has risen, the UK still lags behind other countries in identifying cases early, despite initiatives to encourage people to act on symptoms more promptly.“People shouldn’t be discouraged from going to their doctor if something doesn’t feel right for them. They aren’t ‘bothering’ their GP or ‘burdening’ the NHS,” said Naser Turabi,CancerResearch UK’s director of evidence and interpretation.Overcoming reluctance to seek help is vital if Britain is to diagnose more cancers atstages one and two, before they have spread, and when they are more curable, the report says. It was written by Incisive’s Mike Birtwistle , who interviewed doctors, senior NHS personnel and key figures in cancer in his research.“No one wants people with symptoms of cancer to become martyrs due to holding off seeking medical attention because they didn’t want to bother their GP or overload the NHS. Too many people avoid seeking help because they know how stretched the NHS is,” said Birtwistle.“This kind of martyrdom to protect the NHS results in too many people being diagnosed at a late stage, damaging their survival chances.”The NHS should be “mobilising people with signs and symptoms” of cancer, the report says. “There should also be a continued role for raising public awareness of signs and symptoms and – most importantly – motivating them to act. Experts highlighted that people are often conditioned not to ‘bother’ the NHS.”It highlights thatGPscan also discourage patients from having a check-up because they do not want to add to the strain on already pressured hospitals. “Primary healthcare professionals have a role in previously guarding NHS resources, which can act as a deterrent for seeking help.”Studieshave found that Britain takes longer thanmany other countriesto diagnose cancer. Survival rates are up to 25 years behind those in other European countries and lives are being lost as a result, Macmillan Cancer Supportanalysisfound last year.The number of people in the UK being diagnosed with cancer every year has risen toabout 412,400– one every 90 seconds – due to the ageing population and lifestyle factors such as obesity and alcohol. About 167,000 people die a year – 460 a day – from what is Britain’s biggest killer after heart disease.The NHS has consistently failed to meet a target to diagnose 75% of cancers at stages one and two between 2018 and 2024, with only 60% spotted by then, the report reveals.But it could increase early detections by:Offering prostate cancer screening to men at higher risk of the disease, including black men and those with a family history or specific genetic mutations.Extending lung cancer checks to people who have been exposed to passive smoking or live in areas of high pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 7,300 people a year are being diagnosed at stage one or two than before the Covid pandemic.“There are many reasons why people are reluctant to come forward and get checked, from not recognising the key signs and symptoms of cancer to not wanting to burden the NNS unnecessarily,” Powis said.The health service is improving early diagnosis through approaches such as offering lung checks to smokers and ex-smokers in hi-tech mobile scanning trucks in supermarket car parks, Powis added. They have led tothousands of people being diagnosedearlier than would otherwise have happened.Explore more on these topicsCancerNHSHealthDoctorsGPsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It was not immediately clear whether the move would target production companies, foreign or American, producing films overseas.Film and television production in Los Angeles has fallen by nearly 40% over the last decade, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region’s production. At the same time, governments around the world have offered more generous tax credits and cash rebates to lure productions, and capture a greater share of the $248bn that Ampere Analysis predicts will be spent globally in 2025 to produce content.The announcement from Trump comes after he triggered a trade war with China, and imposed global tariffs which have roiled markets and led to fears of a US recession. The film industry has already been feeling the effects of the tariffs, as China in April responded to the announcements byreducing the quotaof American movies allowed into that country.China is the world’s second largest film market after the US, although in recent years domestic offerings have outshone Hollywood imports.Former senior commerce department official William Reinsch, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said retaliation against Trump’s foreign movies tariffs would be devastating.“The retaliation will kill our industry. We have a lot more to lose than to gain,” he said, adding that it would be difficult to make a national security or national emergency case for movies.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump tariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Too much emphasis is put on the cost of change and not enough consideration is given to the human and financial cost of no or incremental change,” it added.While the costs of reforming the system were substantial – up to £17bn according to some estimates cited in the committee’s report – this had to be set against the £32bn currently spent every year on a system that was failing.The report said the costs of inaction included 2 million people aged 65 and over and 1.5 million people of working-age not getting get the care they need, millions more getting poor care and huge avoidable financial pressures placed on the NHS and local authorities.Social care was propped up by an army of over 1.5m unpaid carers – “equivalent to a second NHS” – who provided more than 50 hours of care weekly, often quitting jobs to care for loved ones and who bore the brunt of the system’s failures, the report said.It comes just days after the formal launch of a three-yearindependent commission into adult social careled by Louise Casey aimed at developing plans for a new national care service.Although the commission has been broadly welcomed, there are concerns it will merely rehearse already well-trodden debates and effectively put off for years changes that some expertshave arguedcould happen in a matter of months.The Casey review’s terms of reference state its conclusions must be “affordable” and stay within government spending limits for the remainder of the parliament, triggering fears among reformers any changes will be underpowered.Adult social care reform has been on and off the English policy agenda for more than two decades. Attempts by governments to fix the system have been repeatedlyderailed by lack of political consensus, worry over costs and political timidity.The MPs report concludes: “The moral case for reform has never been stronger, but this must be accompanied by a robust financial case. Without this we fear that the reforms that come out of the Casey commission will be doomed to failure, leaving everyone continuing to suffer under the current unsustainable system.”The chair of the health and social care committee, Layla Moran, said: “Successive governments have shied away from implementing meaningful reforms to the social care system. But this is an active choice that is no longer tenable.We are living with a broken social care system.”She added: “It might seem that reforms will be costly and difficult, but continuing with inaction will cost us all more.”The care minister, Stephen Kinnock, said that far from doing nothing the government had “hit the ground running on social care” having inherited a system in crisis, and had taken a series of measuresincluding a £3.7bn funding boost.He said: “A lot has been done, but we know there is so much more to do and deep reform is needed. That’s why we appointed Baroness Louise Casey to lead the independent commission working to transcend party politics and build consensus on the future of adult social care, with her first report out next year.”Explore more on these topicsSocial careCare workersCarersStephen KinnocknewsShareReuse this content"

The sheriff’s office did not disclose which state Backeberg was found in.“Further investigation has revealed that Ms Backeberg’s disappearance was by her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play,” the sheriff’s office said.According tothe Wisconsin justice department, Backeberg left her family home on 7 July in 1962. Backeberg’s babysitter claimed that she and Backeberg hitchhiked to Madison, Wisconsin, and then took a Greyhound bus to Indianapolis, Indiana. The babysitter last saw Backeberg – a mother of two – walking around the corner away from the bus stop.The Charley Project, which profiles missing persons,saidin a sinceupdated postthat Backeberg married her husband, Ronald Backeberg, when she was “about fifteen years old” and that that their “marriage was troubled and there were allegations of abuse”.Around the time of her disappearance, Backeberg had filed a criminal complaint against her husband, alleging that he had beat her and threatened to kill her, the BBCreports, citing the Wisconsin Missing Persons Advocacy non-profit group.It added that on the day Backeberg disappeared, she left home to collect her pay cheque from a woollen mill where she had worked.Backeberg was ultimately found 60 years later after her case was assigned to a detective for a “comprehensive review as part of an ongoing examination of cold case files”, the Sauk county sheriff’s office said. It added that part of the review involved “a thorough re-evaluation of all case files and evidence, combined with re-interviewing witnesses and uncovering new insights”.Speaking toWISN, detective Isaac Hanson, who found Backeberg, said he was able to locate her through her sister’s Ancestry.com account.“That was pretty key in locating death records, census reports, all kinds of data,” Hanson told the news station, adding: “Ultimately, we came up with an address … so I called the local sheriff’s department, said: ‘Hey, there’s this lady living at this address. Do you guys have somebody, you can just go pop in?’ … Ten minutes later, she called me, and we talked for 45 minutes.”“I think she just was removed and, you know, moved on from things and kind of did her own thing and lead her life … She sounded happy. Confident in her decision, no regrets,” Hanson added.Explore more on these topicsWisconsinUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Our plan to develop a UK-wide veterans support service will work with enterprising health, employment and housing charities and it is backed by the one of the largest ever government funding commitments to veterans.”Starmer said his thoughts would turn both to those who served in the second world war and those who carried “the torch of their legacy” today.“Alongside our history and our values, service is the other great force that binds a nation together,” he said. “So this week, I want you to know: the whole nation is inspired by the selfless dedication of your example.”Explore more on these topicsVE DayKeir StarmerLabourSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

He confirmed the team has captured 478 hours of footage, with 26 remote cameras, seven night-vision ones and a drone streaming uninterrupted footage since its launch on 15 April.The last showing of the season concluded at 10pm local time on Sunday, with cameras capturing 70 moose (also known as European elk) making the spring crossing through Sweden’s Ångerman River – about 180 miles north of Stockholm.View image in fullscreenProduction crew in Junsele, Sweden prepare for the livestream of The Great Moose Migration.Photograph: SVT/APThe Great Moose Migration is part of a growing fascination with “slow TV” – a genre that took off in 2009 when Norway’s NRK aired a real-time, seven-hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo.The concept has since found cult status across Europe, with broadcasts featuring 12-hour knitting marathons, a 134-hour sea voyage, and even a crackling fireplace stream that topped Netflix’s UK charts on Boxing Day.Cashing in on its popularity, SVT has even been sending out push notifications when the first moose appears, while a dedicated Facebook group with more than 76,000 members now shares sightings, screenshots and speculation about the next appearance.Though official viewing figures for this year’s season have yet to be released, SVT has already confirmed the moose will return next spring for an eighth edition.Explore more on these topicsSwedenAnimalsTelevisionEuropeWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Inspired by animal breeding, Galton encouraged people with “desirable” traits to procreate while discouraging or preventing those with “undesirable” traits from doing the same. As social and intellectual qualities were hereditarily “fixed”, he thought some groups were naturally superior. Galton constructed a racial hierarchy, with white Europeans at the top.Eugenics has since played out in varying, always tragic ways. Attempted genocides and forced sterilization are first to mind, though the 20th century brought about the concept of soft eugenics: non-coercive methods of reducing certain conditions through individual choice and medical advice. Popularized in Nancy Stepan’s 1991 book, The Hour of Eugenics, “soft” eugenics is accomplished by indirect, environmental, and educational interventions while “hard” eugenics is marked by direct biological interventions (such as sterilization). The term has since been expanded in discussions of genetic technologies, prenatal screenings, and physical fitness.Enter Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US secretary of health, who regularly laments over the “back then” of his youth when he says that diabetes and autism was almost unheard of and obesity rates were far lower. (In his campaign videos he would often do this overvintage footage of white bodiessplayed on a beach.) Kennedy champions living harmoniously with nature, free from the burdens of “poisonous” food additives, fertilizers, cooking oils and the most toxic chemistry of all: vaccines.Kennedy’s myopic emphasis on personal responsibility as the main driver of health means he’s at best indifferent, and at worst welcoming, of the idea that those that don’t heed his counsel might die.Yet health is never simple. By avoiding discussion of education, employment, social support networks, economic status and geographic location – the social determinants that public health experts agree influence health outcomes – Kennedy, in lockstep with top wellness influencers, is practicing soft eugenics.He’s not the only member of the Trump administration to do so. The increasing frenzy around immigration seems fueled by the desire to shape the population’s genetic makeup. Musk’s cuts to foreign aid are already leading to increased child mortality and HIV and malaria cases in Africa (the Trump administration’s other main policy engagement with Africa has beenoffering white South Africans refugee status).At the heart of all these policies is soft eugenics thinking – the idea that if you take away life-saving healthcare and services from the vulnerable, then you can let nature take its course and only the strong will survive.View image in fullscreenIllness only affects the weakKennedy’s “Maha” (“make America healthy again”) movement does not advocate for forced sterilizations or mass deaths. Their stance is more of a shrug and sigh than a battle cry. When Kennedy claims that autism is worse than Covid-19 because the latter only kills “old people” and “metabolically healthy” people don’t die from it, or when a Maha associate claims that measles is “anessential rite of passage, immunologically”, you’re hearing the language of soft eugenics. Don’t let vaccines protect everyone, instead let the infirm and weak be culled so that the strong will survive and perpetuate.How can we get healthier without healthcare? Kennedy repeatedly puts the onus of disease on diet and lifestyle while minimizing the role of social services and doctors. Heclaimedthat by removing chemicals from food, “our nation would get healthy immediately,” andfloated the ideaof using money spent on Ozempic to provide “a gym membership for every obese American.” In his mind, the unwell are the reason we’re in such dire shape–not the system that keeps the unwell from receiving access to healthy food and medical care.While true that a nutritionally sound diet and regular exercise are important factors, Kennedy is not just adding emphasis on personal rather than public responses to health issues, he’s decimating public options. The$2.6tn agencyKennedy oversees recently fired a quarter of its workforce and shuttered entire departments tasked to address the multivariate environmental and social factors that contribute to well-being.His handling of theworst measles outbreakin generations offers an example of his soft eugenics thinking. Hefalsely statedthe measles vaccine “wanes very quickly”, leads to “death every year” and has not undergone thorough safety evaluations. Healso saysit’s “very difficult” for a healthy person to die from measles whilepraising doctorstreating children infected with measles with vitamin A. He’s continued to do so even as a small number of child patients have begun to show up at Texas hospitals suffering fromvitamin A toxicity, the result of overuse of the vitamin, probably due to receiving misinformation about its effectiveness.Thanks to declining vaccination rates, measles (along with rubella and polio) couldsoon be endemic. Things now seem so dire that Kennedy performed an apparent U-turn,writingthat “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine”, but he’s sinceundermined that stance. This week he falsely claimed the vaccine contains “aborted fetus debris”.Then there’s autism, a neurodevelopmental condition that’s been studied for over a century. Experts believe increased prevalence is due to expanded diagnostic criteria, improved awareness, and better case identification. More than 250 genes have been strongly linked to autism spectrum disorder. Yet during arecent press conference, Kennedy wrongly called autism a “preventable disease”, labeled it an epidemic like measles, and accused experts of being in “epidemic denial”. He then said: “Genes do not cause epidemics; it can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin.”This language squares with the longstanding belief that thimerasol, an organic compound used as a preservative in some vaccines, causes autism, even though the preservative was largely removed from vaccines in 1999 – and even then the link was unproven. Yet Kennedy appears hellbent on linking the two: he’s placedknown anti-vaxxerDavid Geier in charge of “researching” a connection that will apparently be “discovered” by September. In 2011, Geier wasdisciplinedfor practicing medicine without a license after injecting autistic children with puberty-blocking drugs.During his speech, Kennedy cited non-verbal children –roughly a quarterof the autism demographic – as evidence of an epidemic. By repeatedlycalling autism a diseaseand promising to “eliminate those exposures” that supposedly cause it, he’s suggesting a variation in brain function is an impurity to be eradicated from the gene pool. His belief that autism wasn’t around when he was young is also misguided. At the time it was a subtype of schizophrenia–autism didn’t becomeits own diagnosisuntil 1980.Fabricated rhetoric that favored Kennedy in contrarian wellness spaces is falling flat as he heads the nation’s public health apparatus. Tragically, he’s not the only person in the administration pushing soft eugenics.View image in fullscreenMake ‘smart’ people have more childrenBlaming the weak for their own sickness is one half of the coin of soft eugenics. The other is encouraging the perceived strong to procreate more, which brings us to Elon Musk.Musk frequently invokes IQ, a flawed and long-debated measure of intelligence. His fever dream of a crumbling civilization can only be salvaged when “smart” people pump out more babies. What constitutes a smart person, he doesn’t make explicit, though intech-natalist circlesthey usually mirror the entrepreneurs declaring the mandate. To that end, Musk has personalized hisadvocacy for pronatalismbychallenging himselfto help “seed the earth with more human beings of high intelligence”.A proper pronatalism program might echo Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’srecent declarationthat women with two more children will never have to pay income tax again. Yet the Trump administration is focused on taking away social services even while declaring the need for more “seeding”. Trump’s proposed $5,000 “baby bonus” isn’t much of an incentive when theaverage costof giving birth is $18,865.Musk’s strange focus on babymaking ignores the complex socioeconomic, cultural and gender equity factors that contribute to declining fertility. If he truly cared about increasing childbirths, he wouldn’t take a chainsaw to USAID, indiscriminately cutting off essential services in troubled regions. Those cuts have alreadycaused childhood deathsin war-torn Khartoum, where over 300 soup kitchens were closed due to the shuttering of Emergency Response Rooms.Musk’s pet project, the “department of government efficency” (Doge), cut86% of USAID fundinglinked to Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Programs, causing 16.8 million pregnant women to lose access to services and 11.3 million newborns to post-natal care. Funding forchildhood vaccinesis also gone, increasing the risk of death from measles, polio, and diphtheria. Musk’s unofficial organizationslashed budgetsfor the treatment of pneumonia and diarrhea for 14.8 million children, two leading causes of death in those under age five. There’s beenmajor disruptionsin HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria programs – significant causes of child mortality in low-income countries. Anestimated 25 million peoplecould die in the next 15 years thanks to Doge. Such carnage only makes sense if you don’t consider those lives worth living.Kennedy and Musk are aligned on this issue. Beyond all those chronic diseases food dyes are supposedly responsible for, Kennedy also blames color additives fordeclining sperm counts. Such bro-podcast pseudoscience fails from a policy perspective. Instead of aiding already-born children, the administration iscutting fundingfor Head Start, a program that provides early education services for more than 800,000 families. HHS grants that fund day care, counseling, and disability services for children are alsoon the chopping block. This fits the longstanding anti-abortion stance: ensure babies are born, then immediately stop caring about them by cutting off all social services.Despite relative geographic isolation, America isn’t immune to global outbreaks.Experts predictthe consequences of cuts to international aid will inevitably find us. When they do, they’re going to impact the most vulnerable Americans, including senior citizens, people with disabilities, low-income residents, people living with chronic diseases and HIV, and those relying on public health programs. This again makes us wonder whose lives Musk and Kennedy value.View image in fullscreenPublic healthcare is too kindKennedy often compares America’s health outcomes with other countries. Yet he never mentions that those countries all offer socialized medicine. Whenpressed on the topicduring his confirmation hearings, Kennedy told Bernie Sanders universal healthcare isn’t fair.Kennedy cites the example of smokers. Should longtime smokers deserve the same benefits as someone who exercises and eats organic? No, Kennedy says. Rules matter. Right now, the CDC sendsbillions of dollars to statesevery year for tobacco prevention efforts in an attempt to get to the root cause of smoking, which isstrongly linkedto social determinants. Kennedy isn’t enthused by these kinds of approaches. He prefers the bootstraps mentality, a core component of Reaganomics propaganda: individual health is a personal responsibility. If you can’t manage it, you shouldn’t receive the same benefits as those who can. Kennedy advisor and former Heritage Foundation intern, Calley Means, claims that giving people more access to health care is only fueling a broken system.Yet public health officialsrecommenduniversal healthcare to improve health outcomes, especially in marginalized communities. Herein lies the wellness sleight of hand: Maha activists weaponize data about poor health outcomes, which predominantly affect lower income and minority communities, in order to preach personal responsibility (and often to sell unproven solutions like supplements that only affluent populations can afford).In this sense, Maha perfectly mimics Maga’s deregulatory ethos: cut social services for vulnerable populations while parroting populist language that further helps consolidate power for the most well-off. The 19th-century fantasy of a privileged race is alive and well in Kennedy’s yearning for the America of his youth, enabled by the circle of wellness influencers and contrarian doctors similarly hypnotized by a romanticized past that never existed.In his book Control: The Dark History and Troubling Present of Eugenics, geneticist Adam Rutherford writes: “The adoration of the classical world, and the constant lamentation for its demise, runs through the eugenics movement like a seam.” Kennedy’s vision for a healthy America is akin to the mythicalCamelotthat has consumed his family’s imagination for generations. Only his version is awellness farmwhere everyone has access to kettlebells and free-range meat. If you find yourself outside of the walled garden, good luck crossing the moat.Derek Beres is a writer and speaker on science and media literacy.

That night, I was too distraught to eat or sleep.”The next day he awoke to a summons by the police counter-insurgency unit. Knowing that a worse fate awaited him if he refused, he went down to the station. Ahmad had no known connection to any of the militants alleged to have carried out the killings, and lived more than 50 miles (80km) from the site where it happened, but he was detained for four days.“No reason was given,” he said. “They confiscated my phone, and searched through it. Some days, they interrogated me about militants, though I have no involvement or information. Every time I denied knowing anything, they slapped me or beat me with a stick.”Over the past week – amid a huge operation to track down the militants – a climate of fear has gripped Kashmir as more than 2,000 people have been detained, many pulled from their beds in the middle of the night, and held under draconian security and anti-terrorism laws.The attack was the deadliest on civilians inIndiain more than a decade, and with the ringleaders still on the run, the authorities have taken to harsh measures in response. Over the last week, two people were killed in separate incidents allegedly involving security forces. The crackdown has precipitated fear and anxiety in Kashmir, stirring traumatic memories of the region’s decades-long violent insurgency and India’s brutally repressive response. The Indian government denies any abuses.View image in fullscreenKashmiris tell of security forces raiding homes without warrants or giving reasons.Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty ImagesAhmad said life was now being made “hell” for him and thousands of other Kashmiris. “We’re being punished for crimes we didn’t commit,” he said. “They should go after the real militants – I’m not against that. But by punishing innocents, they’re alienating locals. I want to leave Kashmir, but Kashmiris aren’t safe elsewhere in India either. We’re targeted everywhere.”Sumaiya Jaan, another resident of Kashmir who did not want to be identified by her real name for fear of reprisals, said police and soldiers raided her house a few days after the attack, with no warrant or any reason given. Her father, a farmer with no known connections to the militants, was picked up.“They threw away belongings, emptied the cupboards, and checked every nook and cranny, but found nothing. Then they detained my father and took him away. He is being held at a police station, but we are not allowed to see him, nor will the police tell us why he has been detained. There is no formal case against him. This is nothing but harassment,” Jaan said.Two police officials confirmed that about 2,000 people were rounded up across Kashmir. They said most of the detained had previously been found to be linked to militancy or had been taking part in the “anti-national” activities.“Given the nature of the attack, police are investigating all angles. Most of the people who were detained have been released now,” said one senior officer.One of the more controversial tactics deployed by the authorities in Kashmir has been to blow up the houses of the relatives of militants, even when the accused has not seen their families for years.Shahzada Banu last waved goodbye to her son Adil Hussain Thoker seven years ago, thinking he was leaving for a job interview. Her worst fears were realised when he was named and pictured as one of the suspected Pahalgam militants.Two days later, police and soldiers arrived at Banu’s house in the middle of the night and ordered the whole family to leave. “They said no one should remain within a 100-metre radius. Then they blew up our house,” she said.‘Pakistan is the root of the problem’: Kashmir attack stokes anger in IndiaRead moreThe punitive destruction of their home last week, without warning and with no due legal process, has left her devastated and destitute. The next day, her husband, sons and two other male relatives were detained by police and have yet to return.“I am not defending the attackers or my son,” she said in tears, amid the rubble of her home. “If my son is involved in these killings, he should be punished. But why are we being dragged into this? My [other] sons and husband are innocent and we are suffering unbearable atrocities. Our house was our only property. Now, we have nowhere to go. Who will feed me? Where will I go?”View image in fullscreenThe authorities agreed to halt the demolitions after an outcry by regional authorities, but the crackdown and raids have continued unabated.Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was one of about 10 that was unilaterally blown up by security forces over the past week, despite the supreme court previously ruling such actions were illegal. The force of the nightly explosions left dozens of surrounding houses also severely damaged. Sarwa Begum, who is in her 70s, was carried out of her house by police before they detonated the explosives next door, as she was too scared and frail to walk.“They take pleasure in destroying our homes, in our suffering. Otherwise, why would they use explosives to demolish them?” said Begum.After an outcry by regional politicians, the authorities agreed to halt the demolitions, but the state-wide crackdown and raids on communities has otherwise continued unabated.Kashmir mapKashmir has been caught in an often bloody battle between India andPakistansince the countries’ independence in 1947. Both claim ownership of the Muslim-majority region and it remains split between the two countries, although they have fought three wars to claim it fully.Since the 1990s, Indian-administered Kashmir has been home to a separatist insurgency with an allegiance to Pakistan, which stands accused of backing and bankrolling the violence. Indian-administered Kashmir is now one of the world’s most heavily militarised zones, with an estimated 500,000 Indian troops stationed there.Kashmir experienced a renewed crackdown in 2019, after the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, stripped the region of its autonomy and statehood and began to systematically crush all forms of dissent. Since then, the BJP had widely been promoting Kashmir as a peaceful tourist destination, in an effort to show the insurgency had been brought fully under control – a narrative of “normalcy” that was shattered by the Pahalgam attack.View image in fullscreenThere have been protests across India, calling for those who carried the Pahalgam attack to be severely punished.Photograph: Dibyangshu Sarkar/AFP/Getty ImagesKavinder Gupta, a senior BJP leader in Kashmir and a former deputy chief minister of the region, called for more strict measures to be imposed. “The government of India has adopted a policy of zero tolerance towards those Indians who are working on Pakistan’s agenda,” he said. “There should be no mercy against these people who are providing support for militants.”Though Kashmiri tourist guides and pony operators were lauded for helping rescue Indian tourists at the scene of Pahalgam – and after the attack, Kashmiris took to the streets in marches and candlelit vigils to condemn the violence – a wave of anti-Kashmir sentiment has gripped much of India.The details that emerged of the attack, with accounts by witnesses that the gunmen singled out and shot only Hindus, has led to particularly vitriolic calls for revenge by Hindu rightwing news channels and among Hindu rightwing groups. One called for the Indian government to follow the example of Israel after the 7 October Hamas-led attacks and for Kashmir to be “flattened like Gaza”. Kashmiris living across India also faced violent attacks and public death threats and been evicted from their homes and fired from their jobs.Himanshi Narwal, whose husband, Vinay, was among those killed by the militants, made a public plea on Friday for his death not to be weaponised. “We don’t want people going against Muslims or Kashmiris. We want peace and only peace,’ she said.Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaPakistanSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

This brilliant show looks at the impossible decisions one doctor has to make … that ends in tragedyLucy ManganSun 4 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareTwo years ago, former NHS doctor Grace Ofori-Attah created the relentlessly tense first series ofMalpractice, a tale of an A&E doctor whose errors under impossible pressure, combined with the inexperience and equal stresses of others, resulted in the death of a patient. Then things escalated. It took in topical medical subjects – primarily the creeping problem of opioid addiction – alongside social issues, including the manifold effects of the pandemic, the prevalence of burnout, the bureaucratic inefficiencies that hinder staff and patients, the institutional buck-passing and arse-covering that greet any type of mistake, and the potential for corruption that exists in any large organisation. It asked how much we should expect of people trapped in a system starved of resources, how much human fallibility we should tolerate in healthcare. It was fast and in every sense furious, written as leanly and cleanly by Ofori-Attah as only someone with direct experience of a particular environment can.Only one episode of the new series is available for review but it looks to be shaping up just as well as the first. Psychiatric doctor James Ford (Tom Hughes) needs to be in two places at once: doing an assessment on shaky new mother Rosie (Hannah McLean), whose GP Dr Sophia Hernandez (Am I Being Unreasonable’s Selin Hizli), contacts him about as the on-call psychiatrist during Rosie’s postnatal checkup, and attending the sectioning of a troubled, crack-addicted pregnant woman at her home where the police are already waiting and threatening to leave if they have to do so much longer.Ford does the assessment first. He asks all the necessary questions. Can we accurately judge if he is rushing things? If he is paying enough attention to the answers? To Rosie’s body language? Can anyone? Hernandez is certainly annoyed he leaves it to her to go through the medications he prescribes Rosie, but surely this is a legitimate division of responsibility when he has another vital job to get to? Hernandez seems demanding and dislikable. How much does that colour how we evaluate their point of view?These seeds of doubt already sowed, we move on to the sectioning visit and the necessary savagery involved in removing someone from her home against her will. The patient, Toni (Seraphina Beh) is placed in psychiatric care, where Hernandez and Ford – both with Toni and her baby’s best interests at heart – clash again over how to manage the pregnancy and delivery. The frequent lack of clear clinical pathways is where dramas like this – Cardiac Arrest, Bodies, This Is Going to Hurt – are most confronting and terrifying. We want to think doctors know everything. No one wants to admit that this is impossible or that what we are really doing is trusting them to be the best at weighing options and risks, but never able to banish the latter.But the meat of the thing is in the fate of Rosie. The lack of clarity around her medications leads to her being insufficiently sedated during an episode of postpartum psychosis and to – in a courageously quiet, underplayed scene – tragedy. Possibly one that could have been avoided if Ford hadn’t massaged the truth about how long it would take him to get back her ward (he is supposed to live within half an hour of the hospital – he is staying with his sister 45 minutes away), but equally possibly not.And so we meet again doctors Norma Callahan and George Adjei (Helen Behan and Jordan Kouamé) from the Medical Investigations Unit as they launch a “fitness to practice” inquiry against Ford and we come again to the questions of culpability and moral responsibility that suffused the first series.The closing scenes suggest that we will not be done out of the many twists and turns the original Malpractice so brilliantly delivered, complete with revelations about the characters that complicate their moral standing in our eyes, their motives, their decision-making processes, the capacity they have to be at their best at any given moment in jobs that demand constant perfection. The new series promises to be as addictive and unsettling as the last, with another good cast and Ofori-Attah still with plenty of material. Malpractice can surely run and run – which is great news for viewers, if less so for doctors and their patients out in the real world.Malpractice season two aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMedical dramaHospitalsNHSDramaHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

One day while playing, I broke my ankle. I needed corrective surgery and would be on crutches for months while I recovered. Getting to and from work, and running errands, was suddenly a huge struggle. I could order groceries online, but there were still a few things I’d have to manage myself.Back then, I lived in a unit overlooking a park. Every day after school, a large group of teenagers from a few different schools would sit under the tree nearest our block of units. They were a bit troublesome sometimes. Usually, they would just smoke cigarettes and the occasional doobie. But other times they’d spray paint tags on our fence or yell smartarse comments at people walking through the park. To get to the corner store for milk, I had to walk past them, and I was a bit nervous the first time I had to do it on crutches.Kindness of strangers: I was stuck on the road while hitchhiking when a travelling circus helped me get homeRead moreThat first time I hobbled past, one of them called something out to me which I didn’t quite catch. I assumed he was mocking me, so I kept limping on. But then he and a few others ran up to me. They offered to carry my bag to my door and I gratefully – if a little hesitantly – accepted.For the next few months, those teenagers were such a great help to me. Anytime I crutch-walked past them they would ask how I was and if I needed a hand with anything. They took my bins out for me and if they saw me at the corner store, they would let me cut in line ahead of them, so I didn’t have to stand around waiting as long.The last time I saw the teenagers was in the final weeks of school – they were seniors and about to graduate. At the end of my time on crutches I thanked them personally and wrote to their schools to say they deserved recognition (whether they received it or not, I don’t know).A lot of people were kind to me during that injury experience – and a few weren’t kind at all! – but by far the most helpful were those teens. I’d been bullied a lot in high school and the experience helped me resolve a lot of the residual wariness I had about groups of teenagers. It also showed me that we can’t define strangers from the small glimpses we see of them, even if we see them every day. Those teens were more than their stereotype – and I’m grateful for it.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But apart from not smoking, what should you be doing? I headed to a laboratory, strapped on a mask and heart monitor and started pedalling …Phil DaoustSun 4 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 09.09 EDTShareLungs are amazing. There they sit, inflating and deflating from dawn to dusk, dusk to dawn, sucking in air, stripping out oxygen and exchanging it for carbon dioxide. They do this20,000 times a day, 7.5m times a year, 600m times in the average lifetime, keeping ourtrillions of cellsticking over and saving them from choking on their own exhaust fumes. And we ignore them until something goes wrong and we’re gasping,wheezing, panicking – or worse.When I think about lungs, it’s often in the same breath as cancer, which killed my dad 39 years ago. He only realised his lungs were knackered after a heart attack, which was probably also down to smoking. Sixty Senior Service a day, cigarette number two often lit as soon as number one was stubbed out. He stopped overnight, but it was too late.I’ve never smoked, so I don’t worry much about lung cancer, and I don’t have asthma, or a persistent cough, or shortness of breath. But I still want to know how strong my lungs are. I’m 61, after all, and lung functionbegins to declinein your mid-30s. And it’s almost a year since I gave mine a proper workout, thanks to a knee injury. From running 30km or more a week, with a hard sprint to finish most sessions, I’m down to zero. In all, I’ve missed more than 100 hours of aerobic exercise.But my knee is on the mend, after keyhole surgery to trim a torn meniscus, and today I’m going to push myself to the limit again. In a morning of tests at Sheffield Hallam University’sAdvanced Wellbeing Research Centre, we’ve already measured my lungs’ capacity and general efficiency. That was a simple process calledspirometry, which mostly comes down to blowing into a tube. Now I’m about to get on an exercise bike and pedal until I’m too out of breath to continue. I’ll have a mask strapped to my face, a heart rate monitor on my chest, someone to catch me if I faint and a bucket to hand in case I throw up.“You’ll find it pretty unpleasant,” says Alex Bugg before picking up an enormous syringe. He’s a researcher at the university’s school of sport and physical activity. Before I have time to panic, Bugg explains that he’s only going to use the syringe to calibrate the equipment.View image in fullscreenDaoust tests his lung capacity with the spirometer.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianIf you want to know how well your lungs (and heart) work under stress, thisVO2maxtest is the best way to do it. The mask will measure the gases I’m breathing out, and hence how much oxygen my body can use when working flat out. You can get an estimate for VO2max from a smartwatch or other fitness tracker – but for complete accuracy you’ll need to do what I’m doing, or get masked up and run on a treadmill. If you take that option, you’ll usually be strapped into a harness, in case your legs give way.I start off just spinning my legs against a slight resistance. Bugg tells me to find a comfortable cadence that I can maintain for as long as possible while he gradually increases the drag, from 50 watts to just over 300. So I pootle along at about 75 revolutions per minute, which feels like the kind of pace I’d hold if I was cycling unhurriedly on the flat. I don’t know my watts from my wazoo, but basic maths suggests that by the end of the test I’ll have to put in six times as much effort. Meanwhile, Bugg and a colleague will keep checking how I’m doing, holding up a chart where I can pick out my perceived rate of exertion.“Six is complete rest,” he says, “while 20 would be an all-out sprint with nothing left to give. Towards the end, when you start to get a bit more breathless, feel free to point rather than speak.” He, in turn, will keep asking: “Happy to continue?” All I’ll have to do is nod, give a thumbs up or shake my head.Let’s just get on with it, I think. Then, when we do, I wish we hadn’t. As the resistance increases, we’re soon in “somewhat hard” territory, then “hard”, “very hard”, “extremely hard”. My quads start burning and I switch to breathing through my mouth rather than my nose – at first silently, then in unhappy, ragged gasps. “We’re probably getting very close to your maximum now,” Bugg tells me 13 or 14 minutes in, as if I hadn’t already realised. When we hit it, at 253 watts, I let everyone know, not by saying so or pointing, but just … stopping. I don’t have any choice: however much I gasp for air, I can’t keep pushing. I’m done.View image in fullscreenDaoust gears up for the VO2 max test.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianAt least I didn’t faint or vomit. I even get off the bike without assistance.We’ll get to the results in a minute, but if I wasn’t in this state-of-the-art lab, how would I know if I needed to worry about my lungs?“If you can walk a couple of blocks or up two flights of stairs without getting breathless, you can exercise without getting fatigued easily, you do not complain of chest pain, cough or bring up sputum every day, you do not have blood in your phlegm, or wheeze, your lungs are probably all right,” saysDr Pallavi Periwal, an Indian pulmonologist and critical care physician, and the author ofMake Every Breath Count. “Also look for signs like swelling of your feet, or curling-up of your nails, called clubbing. If any one of these or a combination of these symptoms are present, get yourself checked out.”Don’t assume you’re in the clear just because you don’t smoke, she adds. “Yes, of course smoking’s a big risk factor as far as lungs go. But so is vaping and using a hookah, and secondhand smoke. Even if you do not smoke yourself, you could be a passive breather of poor air.”Then there’s air pollution, indoors and out. “Check theair quality indexbefore you go out, especially if you live in a city that is extremely polluted,” Periwal says. Use a face mask if necessary, and avoid exercising outdoors when the air quality is poor.“If you can,”Asthma + Lung UK advises, “avoid pollution hotspots like main roads, junctions, bus stations and car parks. Try to use quieter back streets as much as possible or go out earlier before pollution levels increase.”View image in fullscreenResearcher Alex Bugg calibrates his equipment.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian“Indoor air pollution is also something people do not think about,” Periwal says. “Things like mould, household chemicals, room fresheners, radon, burning candles and incense sticks can all affect indoor air quality. Ventilate your house frequently, dust and vacuum regularly, avoid chemicals with volatile organic compounds in your house, keep it smoke-free.”Pets can cause problems too. Many of us are allergic to dog or cat fur without realising it, while bird droppings or feathers can bring on a condition calledhypersensitivity pneumonitis.In her own home, Periwal says, “I do not smoke, vape or allow any indoor smoke – no incense sticks or candles for me. I regularly dust and vacuum and ventilate my house. All bed linen, sheets, pillows are cleaned regularly. Kids’ soft toys are washed and dried regularly. These are big allergy triggers.”At the risk of stating the obvious – but hey, it’s 2025 and there’s an anti-vaxxer running one of the world’s biggest healthcare systems – it’s also important to get vaccinated against common respiratory infections such as flu, especially if you fall into a high-risk group.And what are the options if you need to strengthen your lungs?“Exercising helps,” Periwal says. “Aerobic exercises like running, jogging and brisk walking improve your physical fitness and your body becomes more efficient in getting oxygen and transporting it to your muscles. Strength training builds core strength, improves posture and tones breathing muscles.”These muscles matter because your lungs don’t inflate and deflate by themselves any more than a balloon does. That’s the work of your intercostal muscles (the ones between the ribs) and your diaphragm, the dome-shaped sheet of muscle that stretches beneath your chest. Strengthen these, and you strengthen your breathing. For patients with chronic lung problems, Periwal also recommends breathing exercises, particularlydiaphragmatic breathing, sometimes known as abdominal or belly breathing, andpursed lip breathing, in which you inhale slowly through your nose and exhale gently through your – guess what? – pursed lips.View image in fullscreen‘Feel free to point rather than speak’ … Bugg explains the exertion chart.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianDoctors will sometimes prescribeinspiratory muscle training(IMT), AKA respiratory or ventilatory muscle training. I’ve been experimenting with aPowerbreathetrainer, available on the NHS if you have lung problems but also marketed to athletes wanting to improve performance. Twice a day, I take 30 short, sharp breaths, working against an adjustable resistance.It feels as if I’m using the same muscles that I would at the end of a really hard workout, when I’m trying to suck in as much air as possible, as deeply as possible. “It’s a deep diaphragmatic belly breath,” says Dr Sabrina Brar, a former ear, nose and throat surgeon who is now a medical officer at Powerbreathe. “Some people get a sore tummy.”Brar describes IMT as dumbbells for the lungs. It can be useful “if you are training to be an athlete or suffer from a lung condition”, Periwal agrees, “but learn the proper technique with a respiratory therapist. Do not overdo it.”Anyway, my results. They’re not bad for an old man whose job is mostly arse-on-chair. “A healthy 60-year-old man can expect a VO2peak of 25-45ml/kg/min,” Bugg’s report reads. In other words, that healthy 60-year-old will consume 25-45 millilitres of oxygen per kilo of body weight per minute. A figure above 35ml/kg/min, meanwhile, suggests “a very good level of fitness”. Not good enough to earn you themaillot jaune, however: “Current Tour de France champion Tadej Pogačar has been reported to have a VO2max around 89.4ml/min/kg, meaning his body can use more than double the amount of oxygen during exercise compared with the average man.”And me? My figure’s 41ml/kg/min. “Your VO2max is above average,” the report says, “and suggests a high level of fitness, and very efficient heart and lungs. Not only are your lungs in good health, but your body is well adapted to utilise the oxygen you breathe in and to dispose of the carbon dioxide waste product that accumulates during exercise.”My results aren’t bad. I’m tempted to preen until I remember Bryan Johnson’sThere’s a thumbs up from the spirometer too. “Overall, you have excellent lung function. You have above-average lung capacity, efficiency and power. There are no concerns that your lungs are obstructed or impaired in any way, and they can inhale and exhale as required.”I’m tempted to preen until I remember Pogačar’s stats, and that Bryan Johnson, the 47-year-old squillionaire spending $2m a year so he can live for ever, claims he recordeda VO2max of 64.29. That, he says, is equal to “the top 1% of 18-year-olds”.As for Bugg, 33, it’s eight years since he measured his VO2max, but back then it was an impressive 55. He’s currently training for astair marathon. There are five floors in the Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre, and on 24 July he will be walking up and down them 227 times in aid of the Motor Neurone Disease Association. However good I feel about my lungs now, I don’t think I’ll be joining him.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFit for everHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These are the novels for youHigh-concept fiction is having a moment. Funny, inventive and crackling with big ideas, these ambitious stories will have you instantly hookedSam LeithSun 4 May 2025 07.00 EDTShareFlorence Knapp’s first novel The Names, publishing this month, tells not one story but three. As it opens, a mother is preparing to take her newborn boy to formally register his name. Will it be Bear, as his older sister would like, her own choice of Julian, or Gordon, named after his controlling father? The universe pivots on the decision she makes. Knapp plaits together the three stories that follow to trace the three different worlds in which the boy grows to manhood. Think of it as Sliding Doorsfor nominative determinism.In this universe, at least, it is going like gangbusters. Described as “the book of the fair” at Frankfurt two years ago, Knapp’s publisher secured the rights in a 13-way auction and it’s already due to appear in 20 languages. It is a prime example of a renewed interest in what might be called “high-concept fiction”.Knapp, though, says that the first time she even heard the epithet was in a meeting with an agent after she’d finished writing her book. “I looked it up when I came home, and even now, it still feels like a really intangible thing: something to do with a hook, and maybe something to do with structure?” She says she’s not a science fiction reader, but her husband is an avid fan and she found herself fascinated when he talked to her about world-building in that genre.The idea for what became The Names first came to her in 2017 or 2018, but “I’d written a completely different book in between that I thought would have more commercial appeal, and it never found a publisher. So when I was setting out to write this one, I didn’t have a sense of it being a big idea at all: it was just the thing that, when I was faced with quite a lot of rejection, I kept coming back to.”The narrative structure was, she says, “really helpful. I think I realised early on that I wanted to show, in a very crystallised way, those moments in a person’s life that are formative. If I hadn’t had that structure, it would have been quite amorphous for the reader.” Instead, she says, “it felt like stepping stones. OK, I just need to get to the next place, and then the next place …”A public that used to be sniffy about genre fiction is coming to enjoy its imaginative possibilities“High concept” is a tricky notion to define, but you know it when you see it. It’s a story with a ready-made elevator pitch; a grabby gimmick in the narrative or world-building that can be summarised in a couple of sentences. Another recent example is last year’s hit debutThe Ministry of Timeby Kaliane Bradley: a story about refugees finding their feet in London, but the refugees are from other eras rather than other countries. And probably the hottest piece of translated fiction since Knausgård,Solvej Balle’s On the Calculation of Volume, announces early on: “Every night when I lie down to sleep in the bed in the guest room it is the eighteenth of November and every morning, when I wake up, it is the eighteenth of November.” Think the classic movie Groundhog Day, or the TV showRussian Doll, in which Natasha Lyonne’s character relives her 36th birthday party over and over – only with a Danish antiquarian bookseller and an International Booker shortlisting.View image in fullscreenSian Clifford in the TV adaptation of Life After Life.Photograph: Sally Mais/BBC/House ProductionsThere are two accounts you could offer of why these stories are popular now, one of them cynical, one of them less so. There’s a bit of truth in both. The cynical one is that high-concept books are much easier to get past marketing meetings. A novel with a gimmick sticks in the mind. Its fanbase can sell it on TikTok – “it’s High School Musical – but with giant crabs!” – and buyers at bookshops will rememberthatbook with the cool premise in the absence of a marquee author name.The less cynical version is that these books find readers because they use their MacGuffins to deft literary effect – and because a public that used to be sniffy about genre fiction is coming to appreciate its imaginative possibilities. The novelist Jenny Colgan describes the increased appetite for high-concept fiction as a sign that readers are “getting over their prejudices to discover how many amazing worlds there are out there”. As she puts it, “sci-fi is just shorthand for using certain tropes – time travel, rockets, apocalypse – to tell the kind of story you are telling: a love story, or a story about sadness or loss. And some of those work very well but loads sink without trace.” The vital ingredient, she argues, is quality. “If you do something brilliantly you can smash through people’s genre walls.”The Namesis perfectly pitched between so-called literary and popular fiction, full of heart, and works out its premise compellingly. Meanwhile Bradley’s book is consistently funny and inventive, and crackles at the level of the sentence: the fun the author is having is contagious. And Balle explores her world absorbingly; the generative idea at the heart of it grips the reader’s imagination from the off.View image in fullscreenRaevan Lee Hanan and Tom Hanks in the film version of Cloud Atlas.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyThe same was true of those high-concept books that broke through in recent years: Kate Atkinson’sLife After Life(an alternate-realities precursor to The Names, spliced in with a touch of Groundhog Day); Audrey Niffenegger’s time-jumbled romanceThe Time Traveler’s Wife; Naomi Alderman’sThe Power(what if, overnight, women were a physical threat to men rather than vice versa?) and David Mitchell’sCloud Atlas, to name just a few.Kaliane Bradley, who is both a publisher (she’s an editor at Penguin) and a novelist, says she sees a high-concept pitch as “an easy way into something that might be more complex or with multiple strands”. She uses the example of Dracula: “There’s a mysterious foreigner, and it’s partly about fear of the immigrant, and it’s about nervousness around female sexuality … but the high-concept pitch is: ‘It’s a guy who sucks your blood.’”She thinks the present boom is attributable to a “certain loosening around the boundaries of genre” which has made people less anxious about approaching a book through a keynote idea: “There was perhaps a time when people would have been only attracted by that or only put off by it.”She says she wrote her own high-concept novel by accident. “I thought my first novel would be a big literary book about Cambodia,” she says. The Ministry of Timebegan as a jeu d’esprit to amuse Bradley’s friends, “and the conceit was: what would it be like if your favourite polar explorer, because we were all very into polar exploration, lived in your house? That’s it. That’s the concept […] The very first version was almost an experiment, really, and then it turned into a book by mistake.”She adds: “The difference between this book and the book that I was writing that’s now in a bottom drawer, is that one I felt like I had to take veryseriously, and I had a realobligationto write. Whereas for this, it was just like: this is a fun idea. What if I just mess around with it? I realise it’s different for every writer, but for me, that was just the more fertile way of thinking about writing.”The Names by Florence Knapp is published by Phoenix (£16.99).

We’re facing mass extinction. The planet will survive, but life on Earth, certainly humanity, won’t. Unless we radically change what we’re doing.MichaelI think of myself as a pretty mainstream sort of guy; I believe in the scientific consensus around climate change. We should reduce our emissions but we probably do not need to have governments take control of the means of production. We talked about the fork on the table: if we produce it in Sunderland or Coventry, that creates carbon emissions that are accounted for in the UK carbon emissions budget. However, if you produce that fork in Mumbai or Beijing, that reduces the carbon emissions of the UK, but not the overall global carbon emissions.RenaI talked about what a huge impact the fashion industry has on the world.

A decade later, creating her own pigments has become a central part of her work, and the histories of the materials she uses are part of each painting she creates.View image in fullscreenShelves of pigments, rocks and minerals in the artist’s studio in March.In her Los Angeles studio, Su now has at least 200 different pigments made from stones, minerals, shells and earth samples collected from across the American west, as well from locations around the Pacific rim. She grinds these materials into the paints she uses for her luminous, swirling landscapes, images of coastal highways in Taiwan, beaches inCalifornia, volcanic eruptions in Washington and simmering hot springs in Japan.The 33-year-old is having her first solo museum show in the US this spring, at the Orange County Museum ofArt. On a recent afternoon, Su gave the Guardian a tour of her studio, in a light-filled former furniture factory in LA’s arts district, and showed us her meticulously organized shelves of pigment materials. The jars of bright powders, and drawers of rocks, shells and minerals, are also a map of her influences and her adventures, which stretch around the world.A diptych of a black metallic rock shimmering in the light and a hand holding a wooden box of tiny shells.Tourmaline from the Pala Chief mine near San Diego and shells are among the many materials collected by the artist and stored in her Los Angeles studio.There is Taiwanese sulfur, from the town where her father grew up. Azurite from Hunan, China, “the main blue color for thousands of years used in Chinese paintings”, which she contrasted to “the famous ultramarine blue that’s used in medieval western oil painting”.And then there are the more recent stones she has collected, on her trips to historic locations across the American west. Su is interested in materials that come with their own deep histories, and that has led her into an unexpected American subculture, one very different from her art school networks from the UK and Taiwan. In the US, the painter has become a “rock hound”.View image in fullscreenSu Yu-Xin on one of her many trips to collect materials to be ground into pigments for painting.Today, Su welcomes visitors to her Los Angeles studio with a brisk “shoes off, please”. Sunlight streams through high windows on to old wooden floors, and big canvases of works in progress lean up against the walls. Su does not use paint on rectangles: her canvases are uniquely curved, and sometimes propped up against gallery walls on handcrafted stands that look like weathered wood or stones.On a studio wall next to the door, there’s a massive landscape of a road winding through caverns along the seacoast. It looks, at first glance, like an image of California’s Highway 1, perhaps of a beautiful stretch near Big Sur. But Su explains it’s actually an image of the coastline on the opposite side of the Pacific: not the west coast of the US, but the east coast of Taiwan.Su’s work is full of these kinds of mirrorings – visual and geographical connections that show the long interplay of trade and culture around the Pacific.View image in fullscreenSu Yu-Xin describes the pigments used in one of her works in progress, during a studio visit in March.Her tall white shelves of pigments and pigment materials are part science laboratory, part work of art in themselves. She has drawers of carefully organized rocks and crystals, and jars of ground pigments labeled with their materials, and where and the year when they were collected.Su’s choice to make her own pigments is rooted in her early training in Chinese ink painting in Taiwan. Back then, when students arrived at the studio, “you take off your shoes, and then grind your ink. And we did that every day fresh,” she said. The ink, made with animal hair glue, would go bad quickly, so it couldn’t be used the next day. “There was this kind of ritual to it.”Diptych of close-up images of oil being poured onto dirt, and then ground and mixed by hand in the studio.Su demonstrates how she makes her paints, pouring pigments on to a glass table, then adding walnut oil, and grounding and mixing by hand.She sees her use of color as deeply grounded in the geography of her youth – something she did not realize until her time in London, where she trained in western oil painting techniques. “All my classmates were like, ‘Your usage of your palettes is very vibrant,” Su recalled.“If you live where I grew up, which is subtropical, you don’t see so many shadows. The sun is directly hitting the ground. You see vibrant color, in food, in houses and in signage,” she said. “And I felt that was not just a choice, not just a celebration of the form. It’s actually what we see. If you are closer to the equator, you see stronger color.“I wonder, growing up around the Pacific, if there is a type of geological DNA that’s imprinted in the landscape, that people thought was stylization, but it actually wasn’t – it was like a pinpoint of where you are.”Here in the American west, in contrast, “everything’s so dry and crisp”, she said. “[Georgia] O’Keefe – she painted the mountains so sharp, and that’s because there’s no water in the air, so you get to see really far.”View image in fullscreenHeart of Darkness (Underground Burning, Utah), by Su Yu-Xin, in a book in the artist’s studio in Los Angeles.Su is interested in the geopolitics of color itself, and the ways that the history of geography, trade, government and empire shape the fundamental building blocks of artists’ craft.In England, certain famous paint shades are inseparable from the history of empire, like JMW Turner’s “Indian Yellow”,made from the urine of cows in Indiathat were only fed mango leaves, or “Mummy Brown”, made fromground-up human remains.In Taiwan, the white paint Su used when she studied Chinese painting was made from powdered Japanese oyster shells. She would learn later that students in mainland China tended to use lead white paint, not the gofun white she always used. “The Chinese painting in Taiwan has this huge influence by Japan because they colonized us for 50 years,” she said. “[The pigments] are all white, but if you look into the DNA of it, it tells you more than artists want to tell you.”Jars of sand and azurite collected by the artist.Jars of sand and azurite collected by the artist.The United States, where Su has lived for two years, is a more challenging place to collect natural painting materials than other countries. In Shanghai, she would simply take her backpack and a trowel to a local park in the evening, and fill it with dirt to make into pigment. But in the US, she said, much of the land is private, and national parks don’t allow digging for rocks and minerals. Americans can also be aggressive in protecting their private property. “So I have to figure out what’s the zone that I can do what I do, and not get shot,” Su said.On land that falls under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, “you’re allowed to collect 25 pounds a day in one spot, which is plenty”, Su said. But much of her stone harvesting ends up being from a patchwork of privately owned mines across the west, which allow visitors to dig up a small quantity of stones for a flat fee.Most of these mines have websites, and she can set up a visit over email. The mine owners tend to be interesting characters, she said. She met a 70-year-old man who owns a blueberry azurite mine and lives in a cabin he built on his own land. Another mine owner took her and her partner camping up on the remote ridge where his mine is located. He works there many days a year, mining rare minerals by hand.View image in fullscreenThe artist mining for red beryl in Searle Canyon, Utah.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistTo research where to go, Su has joined gem and mineral enthusiast societies, gone on group expeditions and learned from retired geologists, many of whom have worked for mining companies for decades. She and her partner are usually the only Asian people on these adventures, Su said. But the quirky characters she has met across the west also defy simple stereotypes. The people who stake a claim and own small private mines tend to be college-educated, she said, since it takes a lot of geologic knowledge to understand where to mine.One of the most historically resonant California mines she’s visited is the Pala Chief mine near San Diego, which she believes was a source of the California tourmaline that Tiffany & Co sold to China’s Empress Dowager Cixi, who amassed a large collection of the gems.Cixi “believed like Chinese people generally believe that tourmaline, this mineral, has the power of purifying and then getting rid of the bad energy”, Su said. The empress, who ruled during the final years of the Qing dynasty, faced huge geopolitical pressures, Su said, and she channeled some of that struggle into an obsessive collection of gems and minerals.Today, it’s possible to pay a fee and visit the Pala Chief mine to collect a day’s worth of tourmaline and other minerals, which Su has done. She brings a pick and a bucket, and a mine representative accompanies her into the mine.A diptych of a close-up image of a small green mineral and an image of the artist’s book collection stacked highHelenite, a popular material used for jewellery and souvenirs, is purchased by Su, who grinds it for her pigments. The artist has an extensive book collection in her Los Angeles studio.The Pala Chief tourmaline she obtained is of relatively low quality, compared with the rare watermelon tourmaline Tiffany sold to Empress Cixi. But for Su, the San Diego tourmaline still carries the intertwined Pacific history of California mining, the last imperial dynasty of China, and the Chinese belief in the spiritual properties of gems and crystals that she sees as influencing the popularity of crystals in California today.The way that Su works these historically significant pigments into her art is not always literal. The tourmaline did not become, for instance, a portrait of Empress Cixi, or an illustration of the mine itself. Instead, Su ground the Pala Chief tourmaline into powder and used it to paint the ocean on a massive landscape of the California coastline called Bone Caves. It’s a soothing image of waves and bone-like shells, with the Pacific Ocean as the connector between so many different eras and empires. The white pigment in the painting, she said, is made from bleached coral, “the coral skeletons created through global warming”.Other times, though, Su makes more straightforward connections. A recent painting of an ongoing underground fire in a Utah coal seam uses paint made from coal, sulfur and also from cinnabar, another “toxic fiery material” that people in imperial China had used to create a medicine they hoped would make them immortal, but that instead poisoned them.Su has also repeatedly painted Mount Saint Helens, an active volcano in the Pacific north-west. One of the pigments that she uses is helenite, pieces of green glass made by humans from the volcanic dust from Mount Saint Helens’ eruptions. Helenite, first created by accident, has become a popular material for jewellery and souvenirs. Su buys bags of it and grinds it up.“I love this commodification,” she said. “Because if you look at it under a microscope, it’s glass. But through marketing and different crystallization formation, it became something much more valuable. And now it’s powder again.”View image in fullscreenA work in progress by Su Yu-Xin featuring Niijima, a volcanic island.Some of her materials are soft enough to be ground and mixed by hand in the studio. Others require the use of a big, noisy machine, the kind used to grind materials for ceramic glazes. The transformation from raw rock to paint often requires many steps. Dirt has to be sifted out and and the material purified. A chunk of Chinese azurite, for instance, has greens, blues and yellows mixed together, which Su first has to carefully separate out.One of her favorite natural materials from California is mica. “After you grind it, it becomes a shimmer that people use in eyeshadow. There’s something very gentle about it. If you’re applying makeup, or you’re coloring things, it’s an act of care, and making things better. And the mica itself is also so flaky – it’s not aggressive.”But she also often paints with sulfur, a pigment with a more dangerous edge. “It’s one of the brightest natural yellows that I can get, so I love using it,” Su said of the flammable material that reeks of rotten eggs. “And every time I use it, it’s like the studio smells so funny. The painting smells so funny. And it’s kind of combustible, too.”Diptych of close-up images of paint brushes and shells in the artist’s studioPaint brushes hang neatly on the wall, alongside drawers of carefully organized shells, rocks and crystals, in the artist’s Los Angeles studio.Su has ground up pearls to make white paint, and even used diamond powder, the kind sold to polish metal. The diamond powder is probably “the most expensive” material she has used: a few grams cost about $50, though she also uses silver and copper. Her pigment collection includes a meteorite that her friend gave her, and pale pigments made from cowrie shells, which were once used as currency.On her travels, Su has made it through customs in the airports with some very weird materials in her bag. One of the strangest in recent memories is a collection of plastic water bottles filled with mineral-infused water from the different Japanese baths she visited.However, her most precious pigments are not the most expensive ones, but the most difficult to obtain, like the sequence of pastel colors ground from shells she picked up on the beach in Taiwan – shells that she has realized are becoming increasingly rare.Other paint sources have more playful histories: one of her favorite sources of California dirt for earth-based pigments is on the San Andreas fault near Palm Springs, close to where one of the Star Wars movies was filmed.Su used this earth to demonstrate how she makes her paints, pouring out the cleaned and purified California dirt on to the glass-topped cart she uses to mix her pigments, then adding in walnut oil.View image in fullscreenSu Yu-Xin demonstrates how she makes some of her paints at her Los Angeles studio.“You add the oil in gradually – look, the color just became much more intense,” she said, grinding the powder and the oil together. “You have to have oil wrap around every single particle so the painting will age well.”Using natural materials as pigments can create issues for a painting over time, Su says. Colors can fade, or even change, from exposure to sunlight or from oxidation. But unlike the artists who see their work as a way to preserve images of youth and beauty from inevitable decay, Su is curious, even open, to the ways the environment may affect her paintings over time.“When I think what happens to paintings nowadays – you don’t know, 300 years later, what’s in the air,” she said. “It’s really interesting: climate change and paint. What will happen there?”“I don’t know why I like that,” she said. “It’s something bigger than you, you know?”View image in fullscreenA work in progress at Su Yu-Xin’s studio in Los Angeles.The Guardian receives support for visual climate coverage from theOutrider Foundation.

For the challenge, the exercise, the views. To find companionship or seek solitude. Some walk with a sense of escaping problems, others with the idea of striding towards a goal.Many more are expected to head tothe South West Coast Path, the 630-mile route around the shores of Somerset, Devon, Cornwall and Dorset asthe film The Salt Pathhits cinema screens.The movie, starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs, is based onthe book of the same nameby Raynor Winn telling the story of how she and her husband, Moth, took to the path after being forced from their home and found peace, resilience and healing.A gala screening takes place close to the path atthe Lighthouse Cinema in Newquay, Cornwall,on Tuesday before its UK release on 30 May – and the hope is that more people will be inspired to walk it.People such as Jennifer Lessard, 45, from New York, who was found walking a stretch of the path in Torbay, southDevon. “It’s just so beautiful,” she said as she looked across a tree-lined bay. She plans to walk the path a few sections at a time during the visits to the UK. “It may take me 20 years,” she said.Though in the US she has mammoth paths such as thePacific Crest Trailto go at, the South West Coast Path is a bit more manageable. “I feel safe here walking by myself,” Lessard said. But it is grand enough to be a challenge (if you walk the whole thing it is theequivalent of ascending Mount Everest four times). “It’s life-affirming to walk,” said Lessard. “And I like the pubs at the end of the day. I’m into real ale.”British twins Roy and Paul Saxton, 75, were also walking this Devon section. They live more than 300 miles apart and get together for walking holidays. “It’s a great way for us to meet and catch up,” said Roy. Psychologists have noted that walking is a good time to have difficult conversations – you are side by side but not engaging with eye contact. “It’s very sociable,” said Paul. “You meet such lovely people.”View image in fullscreenRoy and Paul Saxton on the path near Babbacombe, Torquay.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianMartyn Green, 38, and his dog Rolo, were doing 30 miles of the path in a day. He is pretty much a full-time walker of the UK’s coastal paths,recording his adventures on TikTok. “I don’t have any permanent abode; I float,” he said. Usually next to the sea. “I love it – you never see anyone unhappy on the beach. When you’re close to water you tend to be happy.”Tourism leaders in the south-west are looking forward to a boost in walker numbers on the back of the film.Jon Hyatt, the chair ofVisit Cornwall,said there had been “significant” interest from domestic and international audiences. “Last week we welcomed two influencers from the Netherlands on a Salt Path-themed visit, timed with the film’s premiere there,” he said.View image in fullscreenGillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs in the film.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyEmma Thomasson, CEO ofVisit Exmoor, said the film showcases locations across the area. “We hope and expect that this will inspire a broad range of visitors from home and abroad. It’s a great opportunity to show what’s here for everyone.”Julian Gray, the director of theSouth West Coast Path Association, the charity that looks after trail, said the film was timely as there had been a downturn in visitors in recent years.Factors such as rising prices, the increased interest in travelling overseas since the pandemic and the loss of foreign seasonal workers post Brexit have put tourism in south-west Britain under pressure.View image in fullscreenEnjoying the sea view at Babbacombe, Torquay, near to the South West Costal PathPhotograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“I think the film will raise awareness of the path and give us a chance engage with people about the transformational nature of trails,” said Gray.On any given day about 25,000 people may be walking the path (though so spaced out it never feels busy). It brings in £500m a year to the south-west economy and the public health benefits are judged to be worth tens of million more.There are lots of positives. The charity has noticed that more lone women, younger people and families are walking the trail. The charity is working hard on equity of access, making sure that people such as refugees and older people get a chance to walk it.But the costs of maintaining it are high, and rising steeply. It costs about £1,600 per mile, per year, to keep the path in good shape and clearly signed – more than £1m. Seven years ago, it cost £1,100 a mile.The climate emergency is putting huge pressure on the trail. “What we’re seeing with climate change is a speeding up of the frequency of storms and an increase in their intensity,” said Gray. “We’re having to deal with erosion and diversions far more often.”It took three months to clear part of the path whenStorm Darragh hit in December, bringing down trees and causing stretches to crumble. Wildfires have affected the pathin Zennor in CornwallandBolberry Down, near Salcombe.Gray said: “I see the film as an opportunity to engage with people on how they can make a difference to protect and enhance this world-class trail. If we want it for future generations, we need people to keep supporting us.”Explore more on these topicsWalkingSomersetDevonCornwallDorsetWalking holidaysEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archive photograph: courtesy of Vicky PattisonBorn in Newcastle in 1987, Vicky Pattison graduated from Liverpool John Moores University with a degree in drama. At 22, she joined the cast of MTV’s reality TV show Geordie Shore, where she starred from 2011 to 2014. In 2015, she won I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! and later became a panellist on Loose Women. She has also made documentaries exploring alcoholism and the impact of deepfake pornography. Her new dating show, The Honesty Box, is on E4 and available to stream on Channel 4. She is married to former Towie cast member Ercan Ramadan.Dad says they could never get me out of that car.I didn’t even drive it – I just used to sit and watch the telly in it with my babies. I kept my hair white-blond until I was 21, when I decided I wanted to look like Cheryl Cole. I’ve never looked back!This photo was taken in the house I grew up in, in Wallsend. I look really content. I was very curious and happy, but a bit of a whirlwind and probably spoilt rotten. I like to be the centre of attention. Always have. I imagine I was, at times, torture.According to Mum, from the age of 15 to 25 I was 'a raging arsehole’. I could not be told, I could not be tamedI had a really nice childhood. It had its complications, its ups and downs, like everyone’s does. I have a lovely mum and dad – both of them loved me very much. But my dad is ill. He’s an alcoholic, and he always will be an alcoholic, quite profoundly. Some days he’s winning that battle, and other days he’s not. At the moment, he’s doing really well, and I’m really proud of him. But there were periods when I was younger where he didn’t understand his illness, where he was deep in his addiction and it controlled him. There were moments that were a bit loud and a bit scary and actually quite confusing for a little girl to navigate. His addiction didn’t dominate my childhood by any means – Mum did a very good job of shielding me from a lot of it – but I saw more than I should have. There were some moments I would rather not remember.I was a typical teenage girl in Newcastle. I had a Saturday job in Shellys shoe shop, and then later on in Kookaï. I had an older boyfriend – an apprentice carpenter – who drove a Ford Focus. I thought I was so cool. But I was getting on Mum’s nerves. According to her, from the age of 15 to 25 I was “a raging arsehole”. I could not be told, I could not be tamed. When I discovered alcohol and boys, I was feral.I loved uni, but after three years of stealing toilet rolls from the local bars and spending all my money on Jägerbombs and Pot Noodles, I was ready for a more comfortable lifestyle. I thought I was going to graduate and get a job in a big city and become a famous journalist, but instead I went back to Newcastle with my tail between my legs, and started working at bars and nightclubs.At the time there were a load of TV producers in the area trying to launch the UK equivalent to Jersey Shore, which was a huge success in the US. I became their unofficial tour guide – they’d point someone out and I’d say: “He talks a good game, but he cannae pull a muscle.” Or: “She goes over like a granny on ice skates – she’d be fucking great.”They wanted me and my friends to join the cast, but, as I say, we were feral. We weren’t sitting around looking perfect and talking about vajazzles like the cast of The Only Way Is Essex, so I was reluctant to say yes. But, then, after one particularly wild night out with a producer, I changed my mind. The evening ended up with an argument between me and another girl, a drink got thrown, and then we all ran off to a gay club called Powerhouse until 5am, before I had to carry the producer back to his hotel. When we got there, he was like: “Vicky, don’t audition, don’t meet the execs, just be on the show.” I told him if he genuinely meant it, he’d have to call me tomorrow. He did, and the rest is history.Learning to love yourself is the hardest thing. I’d like to be like that girl in the photo – minus the hairIt was the early days of reality TV, so I had no idea what I was letting myself in for. While I’m sure there were good moments, I see those years as some of the hardest in my life. I don’t want to be too disparaging about Geordie Shore, because ultimately there is an element of accountability that I have to accept. But I was too young to have my life on TV. I was stuck in this cycle of feeling controlled and manipulated by the show, and the only way to calm myself down was alcohol. I am my dad’s daughter, and I’m not a nice drunk, which is something I’ve had to work on over the years. But back then I became this over-the-top caricature, and I felt like the show capitalised on me being the worst version of myself. It broke my mum’s heart. She would say: “Six weeks before you go off to do a new series, I lose my daughter.” This bright, bubbly person became completely withdrawn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But agents, MTV, producers, all of them said: “What are you going to do? There’s nothing else for you.” And I believed it. “Stay where your bread is buttered” was a narrative I was fed. It was completely reinforced by the fact the girls on Made in Chelsea and Towie were always so beautifully put together and as a result got deals with fashion and beauty brands. Everyone wanted them in their nightclubs and in their dresses – nobody wanted the Geordie Shore girls anywhere. It kept me small and doubting myself.Sally Phillips and her family look back: ‘I wanted to be the kind of actress who plays Juliet at the RSC, but it turns out people don’t take me seriously’Read moreBy series nine, I just wanted to grow up. I took a leap of faith, left my agents, and found a new, all‑female team. Quickly, they saw what everyone else saw, which was a broken little girl who was desperate to be liked; someone who had sacrificed respect for attention. Rather than capitalise on that, they put me in therapy. They tricked me, saying it was phobia therapy before I went into the I’m a Celebrity … jungle. As soon as I walked in, I realised I’d been hoodwinked and was really hostile to the process. For a working-class girl from the north‑east, therapy had a big stigma attached to it. But four hours later, all of my pretence was gone. I was a different person. I was me.I’m by no means perfect. I still live in habitual fear that I’m going to wake up one morning and everyone’s going to say: “She is nothing special.” That everything I’ve worked for will evaporate. But over time I’ve made sense of my dad’s illness, my relationship with alcohol, and all of my anger. I was self-sabotaging over and over again because I didn’t like who I was and couldn’t see a way out.Learning to love yourself is the hardest thing. And I’m not there. I don’t know anyone who is. But if anyone spoke to my friends the way I used to speak to myself, I would set them on fire. The goal now is to get back to that three-year-old girl in the picture – the one who was always so happy, especially around her friends and family. To slowly feel more like that little person. Only minus the hair.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyDocumentaryTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Colin Matthews, agenial former schoolteacher, was putting in another shift trying to convince people to give him another term as a local Conservative councillor and marvelling at the outbreaks of fury he was encountering. One man, he told me, had simply grabbed a bit of Tory campaign literature out of his letterbox and torn it into small pieces.A couple emerged from their house and got into a very large car. For some reason, they were both carrying huge slices of chocolate cake teetering on tiny white plates. What one of them told me was laced with disdain. “They don’t normally turn out giving us leaflets,” she said, pointing at Matthews. “They don’t normally give two shits.” Even here, it seemed, rude and angry were the things to be.Reform UK is main opposition party, Nigel Farage claims after election winsRead moreMatthews and a few of his fellow Tories explained some of the reasons for local people’s fury: the government’s plansto put up lines of pylonsin the fields next to the Lincolnshire coast, and the giving-over of increasing expanses ofland to solar farms. Outside the town’s principal pub, a few people talked of immigrants in Skegness being housed while military veterans slept on the streets. It was an odd spectacle: flailing fury in an idyllic-looking environment, for reasons Matthews well understood. “This country’s buggered,” he said.It’s certainly not a country that is prepared to give his party much support. In Thursday’s council elections, Matthewswas defeatedby a Reform UK candidate who received nearly three times as much support. Lincolnshire’s first mayoral election, meanwhile, waswon by Andrea Jenkyns, the former Conservative minister who has just joined Nigel Farage’s latest political vehicle. At 6.30 the next morning, I watched her give themost graceless, clunky acceptance speechI have ever seen, in which she said it was time for an end to “soft-touch Britain” – kindness, be gone! – and suggested that asylum seekers should be forced to live in tents.The biggest part of this story was about Tory defeat and collapse. But Reform got close totwice Labour’s vote in North East Lincolnshire, a local government area that includes Grimsby and Cleethorpes, a constituency with a Labour MP. Across the country, moreover, as the party took control of 10 councils and the Tories crashed, there was the same sense of a realignment of the right being part of something even bigger.A vocal chunk of Reform supporters – men in particular – is nothing if not familiar. They want “British shops”, zero immigration, the return of capital punishment and all the other things that usually make it on to the average hard-right shopping list. But in Lincolnshire I also spoke to newly converted Farage voters who spoke in much vaguer, tentative terms about how they simply craved change.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage with Andrea Jenkyns, left, and Sarah Pochin, winner of the Runcorn and Helsby byelection, 2 May 2025 in Paddock Wood, Kent.Photograph: Lia Toby/Getty ImagesWhat tied everybody together – along with plenty of abstainers – was the same bitterness and bad feeling I saw in Alford. Some 48 hours before polling day, Luke Tryl, the director of the More In Common thinktank, had reported backfrom his latest focus groups, which he said were brimming with a level of “anger, despondency or misery about the state of Britain that doesn’t feel sustainable”. That is completely right, and what has fundamentally caused that wave of negativity might be a lot simpler than some people would like to think.People’s food-shop costs, council tax bills and dealings with HMRC highlight the fact that they are paying much more for far less – surely the dictionary definition of infuriating. Thewinter fuel allowance cut, one of those rare political stories that just about everybody now mentions, has cast the government – probably for keeps – as mean bureaucrats set on tilting the scales even further away from basic fairness. And these distributional furies are the context for a lot of people’s complaints about immigration.There is also an overarching narrative about the last two decades. After the financial crash of 2007-8, the false dawn of Brexit, the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the ongoing cost of living crisis, people have a sense of life amounting to one damn thing after another. In that context, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves following their election win with warnings that everything was about toget even worsewas the most stupid thing they could have done. And here we are. Life continues to go round in circles, and with each grim rotation of the wheel, Farage and his friends get more and more popular.Dining across the divide: ‘I felt like the atmosphere was quite hostile’Read moreThey do so despite the clear gap between the issues they habitually bang on about and what might actually improve millions of lives. Over the weekend, Reform leaders sounded off aboutteaching kids the wonders of the British empire, theevils of councils’ diversity policiesand how they were going tofight green investment. In the places where they will now be in charge, meanwhile, the same stark problems fester on, even amid affluence: hollowed-out local services, terrible public transport, a chronic lack of social housing and a shortage of work more fulfilling than driving delivery vans or making up the parcels that are piled into them. To point that out is not to overlook the politics of culture and identity, but still: if mainstream politicians finally began to act on those issues, maybe they would begin to be less loathed and mistrusted.That, in crude terms, is a picture of how this moment could pass. But I also wonder whether England might have irrevocably changed in ways that none of us yet understand.When I hear people pay tribute to Farageas a “good lad” and see whole streets rush to take pictures of him on their phones, I rather wonder what has happened to our old bullshit detector. We are no longer the country of “mustn’t grumble” – quite the reverse, in fact. It often feels, moreover, as if the 21st-century combination of social media’s polarising effects and all those economic convulsions has left us with an intensified version of an old national problem: our inability to really speak to each other and collectively bargain for a better country. All of us, it sometimes seems, are suffering from the political equivalent of road rage, manifested in either futile shouting or tense silence.The day after my stop in Alford, I spent two days in Boston, the Fenland town that has long been a byword for immigration from eastern Europe and support for Farage. As usual, I stayed at the local Premier Inn, and dined in the adjoining pub and restaurant. Outside, everything was aligning for a victory based on anger and disaffection. Inside, despite the 30 or so people who were seeing out their evening, there was a deathly quiet, and a scene that vividly summed up where we have arrived: among the pints of Madri and faux-traditional grub, even the married couples hardly said a word to each other.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLocal electionsOpinionNigel FarageReform UKLabourConservativesLocal governmentLocal politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Someone should let our policymakers knowSun 4 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 21.52 EDTShareTo be a transgender person in the UK over the past two weeks has been to wake up daily to discussions on how your life must be made smaller. The supreme court ruled on 16 April that references to a person’s sex in the Equality Act 2010 should beinterpreted as referring only to “biological sex”. Since then, we have learned through a drip-drip of interviews and late-night website updates what the practical impacts of this verdict are likely to be.The equalities minister, Bridget Phillipson, was one of the first to speak for the government, telling parliament thatLabourwould “offer trans people the dignity that too often they were denied” under previous administrations. A head-spinning claim, given that she had warmed up by telling Good Morning Britain a transgender woman in a pub with a full bladder should use the men’s loo.Even that suggestion was made to look generous by the publication of anew “interim update”from the Equality and Human Rights Commission – a statutory body responsible for the promotion and enforcement of equalities law – late on a Friday evening, the night before the pope’s funeral. A cynic might wonder about the timing – it would certainly have been a convenient moment to release information you preferred not to receive intense media scrutiny.The text echoed Phillipson’s position that transgender women should not use facilities for women, nor transgender men those designated for men. But then it went further, asserting that “in some circumstances” both groups might also lawfully be excluded from facilities intended for their own “biological sex”. No detail was provided on what those circumstances might be.Transgender people banned from both the gents and the ladies, then, at that pub they imagined on GMB? A subsequent line did add that “trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use”, though again readers were left to guess at how this would be avoided.Is this what “dignity” means in 2025? To be placed in a position where you are made to feel so uncomfortable entering any toilet in a particular building that you instead awkwardly ask a colleague if he wouldn’t mind popping into his to grab you some tissue to deal with a runny nose due to hay fever? Or was this the “clarity” the prime minister, Keir Starmer,had been so delighted to receive?Even as I write this I feel a rising instinct to temper myself, to apologise for exasperation and police my tone. Anger is not a natural home for me. As I wrotewhen I came out publiclyas transgender in the Guardian, and as listeners to any of the podcasts I appear on already know, I’m a laugher, not a fighter. I’d much sooner be seeking our common ground.I can vividly remember the terror I felt writing that piece, fearing it might spell the end of my career. Clearly, it did not. I am still a sportswriter, and broadcaster, and much else besides. It has been my experience – even travelling across four continents at different times since my transition – that an overwhelming majority of people will take you as you are, not as any government imagines you to be.In the language of the angriest online campaigners, transgender people only ever “barge into” spaces intended for the opposite sex. Yet several of the most enduring friendships I have made since my transition have grown from explicit invitations – one to help form a podcast about women’s experiences playing board games in hobby spaces, and another to join an improv class for women and non-binary people.“Invited” might not even be a strong enough word for the latter instance. “Collared by the organiser and informed I was signing up after coming to watch a friend perform”, would be another way of describing it. I hope they know how grateful I am for all the mirth we have shared since.Lucky for me that these groups contain fewer than 25 people. Another astonishing line in the EHRC’s interim updatesuggestedthat any association for women or men reaching that number should not admit transgender women or men respectively.The disconnect between the reality of our lives and the way we are discussed by policymakers feels profound. One of the most pernicious lies I see thrown around by bad-faith actors in this exhausting and never-ending “debate” is that transgender women do not understand how women who are not trans are obliged to make constant risk assessments to protect their personal safety.How silly of me to imagine I ought to do the same. Why did I not just cut in and announce my transgender status to the cab driver who, hearing me say I was tired on the way back from covering the Super Bowl for this newspaper, suggested he could drive me back to his bed for a lie down? Or to the man who chased me down a dark street in Marylebone shouting sexual suggestions, until I found refuge under the umbrella of a couple who kindly offered to shield me, as I tried to get back to my hotel after covering the Euro 2020 final?Perhaps both men had already identified me as transgender, or perhaps not. These are not relevant considerations when you find yourself in a vulnerable situation and are making on-the-spot calculations to find a way out.What is relevant is that I had no parallel experiences in all the years before my transition. Meanwhile, every woman I have ever discussed them with has related back to me with similar – or worse – stories of their own. These are things that happen to women, transgender or not.It is an element of the conversation that has been missing this past fortnight, from the mouths of ministers to the pages of national newspapers: an acknowledgment that, no matter how you legislate, transgender people’s lives are not suddenly going to fit neatly into the boxes you imagine for them.You can ban people like me from using a toilet that reflects our reality – the way society treats us, the nature of our changed bodies and even the updated sex (not gender) markers on our government-issued IDs. But you cannot force us to go back to one that doesn’t. All you achieve is to make our lives more difficult and less safe.Not to worry, mind you, since the people doing all this have been so clear that they intend to protect our dignity. What a treat it will be to discover what they think that word means.Nicky Bandini is a football writer and broadcasterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I worked in the Vatican for 18 years, and on my return to Rome for the funeral ofPope Francislast month, the tension and drama were already palpable.Some observers and former colleagues I spoke to believe this will be a particularly difficult conclave, given its size – 133 electors, as opposed to 117 last time – and the fact that many of the cardinals don’t know one another. This is down to Francis diversifying the college, appointing cardinals from all over the world: a full 108 of the current crop were his selections. Others suggest the electors will try to reach a decision in less than a week to avoid the appearance of a divided church.In Conclave,the filmbased on Robert Harris’s novel, the conservative and progressive factions vie for dominance (using various underhand methods to lobby and campaign) while external events, which the voters are meant to be shut away from, intervene in the form of a terror attack. It’s an informative, though only partially accurate, portrayal. It’s true that there are both progressive and conservative currents within the church, but there is also a moderate current, which the film didn’t represent.View image in fullscreenStanley Tucci as Cardinal Bellini in the Robert Harris film adaptation, Conclave.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyThe progressive wing is represented by cardinals who will now seek to maintain the disruptive and reformist momentum of Pope Francis, pushing the church to modernise its structures and enter into dialogue with the contemporary world. Among their leading figures are the Italian cardinal Matteo Zuppi and the German cardinal Reinhard Marx, who has spoken openly about the need for reform within the church. The conservative wing focuses instead on safeguarding Catholic doctrine: the Hungarian cardinal Péter Erdő and the Congolese cardinal Fridolin Ambongo are among the prominent representatives of this stance.The moderate wing, on the other hand, seeks to build bridges between the two positions by adopting a more dialogue-oriented approach. It sees the church as one actor among many in the pursuit of the common good, encouraging engagement with culture, politics and other religions. Its representatives include the US cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, currently serving in the Roman curia, and the French cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline.In the days ahead, the first major challenge will be for cardinals across these three currents to get to know one another. They have already had preliminary meetings, often referred to as the “pre-conclave”. Here they present their ideas about how the church should be led, as well as describing their local realities – for instance, from remote regions or countries with fewer Christians. In this way, the necessary profile for the new leader, whether to continue or break from the previous pontificate, gradually emerges and alliances are formed. It wouldn’t be correct to assume that the 108 cardinals created by Francis will automatically vote for a reformist candidate; this is because some of them were appointed for specific reasons (as is the case of the curial cardinals, who work for the Vatican’s administrative state) and because others, over time, develop their own aspirations within the church.View image in fullscreenCrowds wait for the smoke announcing the result on the seond day of the papal election conclave, 13 March 2013 at the Vatican.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesDuring my time in Rome, I noticed that many seemed to be in favour of an Italian pope (the last one, Pope John Paul I, died in 1978). But as the saying goes: “He who enters the conclave as pope, leaves as a cardinal.” In other words, those seen as the most likely winners during the pre-conclave period are often quickly overtaken by others who have not been on the front pages of the newspapers.Seasoned Vatican observers note the appetite, regardless of geographical or ideological background, for the candidate to be in good health and ideally over 70 years old. “We need a new holy father, not an eternal father,” as one bishop told me.As far as Italian candidates are concerned, it is interesting to note thatItalyis the nation with the highest number of cardinal electors: 17 in total (12.6%). The three most mentioned names are Pietro Parolin, former Vatican secretary of state; Matteo Zuppi, president of the Italian Bishops’ Conference; and Pierbattista Pizzaballa, patriarch of Jerusalem, whose profile is particularly striking given the historical moment and the complex geopolitical location in which he exercises his pastoral work. His only “flaw” is that he is 60 years old.Fist fights, ghostly pranks and schism: a brief history of conclaves pastRead moreIn each conclave, there emerge the “great electors”: those with greater influence and experience, or those from financially powerful dioceses. In the run-up to the conclave that elected John Paul II in 1978, Polish bishop Andrzej Maria Deskur championed the candidacy of cardinal Karol Wojtyła, as he was then known, working so tirelessly that he suffered a stroke the day before conclave began. The day after Pope John Paul’s election, he visited Deskur in hospital and soon after named him a cardinal. Similarly, the Brazilian cardinal Cláudio Hummes was a key “great elector” for Pope Francis, and even suggested the name “Francis”, urging him not to forget the poor.As preparations for the conclave continue, the Sistine Chapel is being fitted with chairs and desks for the electors. Vatican security forces are rigorously inspecting the site to ensure there are no hidden microphones or devices that could leak information. All of this is intended to ensure that once the conclave begins on 7 May, the 133 electors will be completely cut off from the outside world and fully focused on their task.Thus, as the doors of the Sistine Chapel close following the historic command of “Extra omnes” (“everyone out”), and the world’s attention focuses on a chimney, one of the most consequential acts of our era will begin: the election of a new spiritual leader for more than a billion faithful. Beyond strategies, factions and nationalities, the conclave must remember that its mission is ultimately to select the one best suited to lead the church in our time.Ariel Beramendi worked at the Vatican for 18 years as an official in the Dicastery for Communication.

Yet it is not the phrases themselves that are troubling – there is real substance to them – but the missed opportunity to grasp the true meaning of what Buddhist teacher Tara Brach calls“radical acceptance”.Radical acceptance represents a fundamental principle in both Buddhism andmodern psychologyand is neatly summarised in thepsychotherapeutic expression“the only way out is through”.‘Let them’: can this viral self-help mantra change your life?Read moreIn a culture that emphasisespositive thinking, many tend to avoid, repress or downplay negative emotions and complex life events. Acceptance offers apowerful alternative. It encourages us to acknowledge and allow challenging states of mind and paves the way for greater wholeness, healing and ease.However, acceptance cannot be achieved instantaneously or via platitudes, nor can it be attained through willpower alone. It requires consistent effort and repeated application.In an era where viral self-help mantras such asMel Robbins’ “let them” theoryseem appealing, it is tempting to seek quick fixes to complex problems. However, authentic radical acceptance involves more than detaching from others’ behaviours; it requires accepting one’s own fluctuating mind states and engaging with the world from a place of wisdom, flexibility and humility.When my immediate family member died recently after a prolonged period of illness, the dimensions of my grief were (and continue to be) varied – sometimes jagged, sometimes soft and sometimes hard to accept. Yet I reminded myself that nothing was wrong. This was not a mistake. It was exactly as it was.Over months, I noted “anguish”, “desperation”, “bargaining”, “funny story”, “loving memory”, “fretting”, “attempt to fix”, and so on. With time, a relationship of friendliness emerged and, alongside it, a growing acceptance of what had initially felt unbearable.The practice is to accept each small, containable moment over and over rather than being lured into a grand narrative about a catastrophic life event.According to Brach, radical acceptance invites us topause, recognise and allowwhatever arises within us with a spirit of tenderness and care. It can take the form of a gentle “yes” or a knowing bow to our predominant experience, whatever shape it takes.As we learn to accept complicated and unwanted feelings such as confusion, disbelief, despair, judgment and resistance, we gradually relate to our circumstances with realism and courage. We notice our thoughts, yearnings and corresponding body sensations and set aside our desire to control or improve our situation. With time, we sow seeds of compassion, even joy, amid difficulty. And our wisdom grows.Of course, this is easier said than done.Even in spiritual circles, there is a tendency to bypass difficult experiences or unacceptable emotions. The late Buddhist psychotherapist John Welwood coined the termspiritual bypassingto warn against misusing spirituality, even popular psychology, to avoid the necessary emotional and psychological work required for healing. While certain interpretations of spirituality can make us feel good or righteous in the moment, they can also serve to control andavoidwhat is happening beneath the surface, which has been proven to result inundesired psychological outcomes.So what does it mean to practise acceptance without bypassing intolerable experiences and feelings?The first step is admitting what we are going through is hard and that it is very human to resist what is painful. We might start by saying, “I am suffering right now” or “This is hard, and I don’t like it”. Next, we strive to set aside our desire to replace negative experiences with positive ones. While this may seem at odds with the pursuit of happiness – particularly if we equate happiness with pleasure – it offers a more realistic and potentially fruitful way of being with our human predicament.As we become more willing to accept the unacceptable, buried, unconscious memories and feelings may emerge and ask to be held inloving attention.You might wonder: what if things are genuinely catastrophic? What if I am faced with circumstances I cannot possibly accept?The answer lies in abandoning the struggle. In Buddhism, we are encouraged to “let things be” – a phrase manyBuddhist teachersprefer to “letting things go”. This means seeing each moment, whether pleasant or unpleasant, as complete and whole, reflecting the flow of causes and conditions that constitute it. Let it be!You don’t have to enjoy every part of reality – in fact, things would get boring and you might get very disappointed if you only welcomed pleasant experiences – but instead, you can allow it to unfold as it will.Many of us have been raised with unrelenting standards. We need radical acceptance | Ahona GuhaRead moreAs Rumi writes in his beloved poemThe Guest House, “This being human is a guest house … the dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in.” He calls on us to inviteall“unexpected visitors” in – it’s a radical proposition.Buddhist monkAjahn Sumedhocaptures the heart of radical acceptance with the instruction, “It is like this right now. Life is like this right now.” In moments of distress, we might repeat these words. The striking part of his suggestion is that you do not have to do anything in particular. Life flows on and you meet it precisely as it is. With time, you may come to realise you are not the boss of your life or anyone else’s. And that fact in itself may offer you inexplicable relief.Dr Nadine Levy is a senior lecturer at theNan Tien Institute.

(When challenged, the White House could not come up with any examples of when he had done so.)Trump feels tug of political gravity as economy falters and polls plungeRead moreThe problem for Trump and his supporters, many of whom remain staunchly loyal, is that the transition period in question is starting to resemble that felt by the classic Looney Tunes character Wile E Coyote between charging off a cliff into midair and plunging to the ground.So far, the hard data from the US economy is holding up well. Friday’s payrolls report was strong, and thenegative first quarter gross domestic product reading, while worrying, was hard to take a clear reading from because of the rise in imports as companies stocked up ahead of tariffs.There is little sign of anything as dramatic as mass job cuts, or a sudden stop in consumer spending – although the recent crop of data mainly relates to the period before “liberation day”.Look at the forward-looking surveys, though, and there are clear signs of anxiety. The long-runningMichigan consumer sentiment indexjust had its steepest quarterly decline since the 1990 recession.Spend any amount of time talking to US consumers and businesses, and it is abundantly clear why: there are so many sources of policy ambiguity as to make the future not just uncertain but completely unknowable.There is a cliche that “markets hate uncertainty”, but in truth the same applies to everyone in the real economy, too: the company wondering what size order to put in and how many people to hire and the family thinking about buying that fridge or booking that holiday.It is not surprising they are uncertain. No one, even inside the administration, can say with any confidence what the tariff rates on imports from specific countries will be in July.Even if the tariff policy was crystal clear, its impact on prices would be hard to gauge – depending, as it does, on how much of the cost companies are willing to bear (or “eat”, as the Americans have it) at the expense of reduced profits, and how much is passed on to consumers.For the moment, as the Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has admitted, the tariffs on China, at 145%, are nowso high as to amount to an effective trade embargo.Not every company will have the deep pockets and global reach of Apple to be able tobend its supply chain away from Chinato manufacture products for the US elsewhere (in the iPhone-maker’s case, India). Instead, many will be scrambling to find substitutes, which may be more expensive or not exist at all. Shortages of some products seem a distinct possibility.At the same time, sharp cuts in federal budgets, many of which have an ideological taint, including Robert F Kennedy Jr’s decimation of the National Institutes of Health, are raising short-term questions about unemployment and much longer-term worries about the US’s world-leading science base.Some of the most heartbreaking conversations I had were about aspects of Trump’s immigration policy: the man who said a Guatemalan friend’s six-year-old son had stopped going to school in case his mum was snatched by the authorities while he was there, and the restaurant manager who said it was becoming harder to hire Latinos because even fully documented workers feared they could face deportation anyway.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The credit rating agency Fitchwarned in a report last week: “Risks associated with mass deportations could include potential worker shortages, production delays and increased wage inflation that hinders revenue growth, weakens profitability and lowers return on investment.”Of course, because the US economy’s abrupt gearshift has been driven by deliberate policy actions, it’s tempting to think: “It doesn’t have to be like this.”Much more of the real economy impact so far results from this widely shared uncertainty – or perhaps it is better to call it fear – than from the specifics of Trump’s policies.Business owners told me that if they just knew what the final tariffs on products from the various countries in their supply chain would be, for example, then over time they could adapt.It is not completely out of the question that a more settled policy position could arrive in the coming weeks.Certainly, Bessent appears to be trying to manoeuvre Trump towards striking a series of “deals” (in effect, promises of concessions in exchange for tariff carve-outs) with key economies.Yet the president appears to have such a love of political drama – and such an inability to choose a course and stick to it – that the unknowability of future policy seems to be the very essence of Trump 2.0.It seemed to be the mighty bond markets, driving up the cost of US borrowing, that checked Trump’s initial “liberation day” drive, prompting the “pause”.But if time drags on with no agreements in sight, the next wave of distress signals are likely to come not from Wall Street but from main street – in soaring prices and empty shelves. How Trump responds then is anyone’s guess.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEconomics viewpointUS economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationTariffsEconomicsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s just another way of making mothers feel guiltyRhiannon Lucy CosslettWe need a society that supports parents and makes good food choices achievable – not more lecturing of exhausted mumsSun 4 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 08.39 EDTShareLike many modern mothers, I have on occasion piped cold bolognese directly from a pouch into my small child’s open mouth and, radical though it may seem, I refuse to feel guilty about it. There is a lot ofpanic about ultra-processed foods(UPFs), and baby food pouches, with theirhigh sugar contentand dubious nutritional value, are the latest targets. Researchers at the University of Leeds School of Food Science and Nutritionfound that41% of main meals marketed for children had sugar levels that were too high and that 21% of ready-to-eat fruit products, cereals and meals were too watery and not providing adequate nutrition.It’s not great. But is it news? No parent picks up something called “Heinz fruity banana custard” believing it a fantastic alternative to actual mashed banana, yet this is being treated as the Watergate of the under-4s sandpit crowd. I’m starting to wonder if people have lost their collective minds over processed food. I even saw one comment calling for the death penalty for baby food producers. Baby pouch hysteria is the perfect new addition to the maternal guilt industrial complex.Look: I am, like many parents, concerned about the usual dietary issues, from childhood obesity to tooth decay to rickets. The way that baby food is marketed is certainly worthy of examination. In a way, I’m the perfect target for content about the dangers of UPFs: my mother, who was very much ahead of the curve on this, taught me how to cook from scratch on a low income, to be suspicious of certain additives and to generally consume things that your great-grandmother would recognise as food. I was mostly raised vegetarian, as was my husband, so we limit our consumption of meat and shop free range and organic as much as we can. You would think this “news” about pouches would worry me.But I have beenwriting this parenting columnfor long enough to be suspicious of any topic that could be used as a stick with which to beat mothers – and it’s usually mothers. Unevidenced claims, such as that thestraws on pouches cause speech delays, or contested claims that pureeslead children to be fussy eaters, seem designed to shame us into abandoning them and returning to the kitchen where we belong. I am sick of being bombarded by grinning egg-gathering trad wives who put cooking everything from scratch on the same continuum as serving your husband and denying your children lifesaving vaccines. The context into which this UPF debate has landed is one where we are seeing renewed efforts to confine women to lives of domestic toil.Ultra-processed babies: are toddler snacks one of the great food scandals of our time?Read moreWhether it’s diet or potty training, mothers are blasted as too lazy and too busy on their phones to put in the hard work of mothering. Yet I have yet to meet a baby that has been exclusively fed on baby food pouches, nor a mother who is unaware that a packet consisting largely of pureed fruit is going to be of less nutritional value than a homemade meal cooked from scratch. There are other social, political and economic factors at play here, which are continually elided in UPF coverage.One is time and labour. The current infant feeding orthodoxy is “baby-led weaning”, which, to my mother’s continued disbelief, involves giving babies pieces of food before they have teeth. Forsafety, these pieces should be soft and juicy, but sometimes the advice goes too far. I was once advised that my son should gnaw on a chicken bone, and I later found out that this is actually a choking hazard. In other words, purees – even the ones you make at home by blending sweet potatoes with your own breast milk before freezing them in ice cube trays, surely as virtuous as it gets – have become highly unfashionable.I had various reasons for choosing purees, not least being told by a paediatrician that “there’s a reason apes chew up their babies’ food before giving it to them, and that reason is choking”. But time was an important one of those reasons. Sitting there waiting for an infant to mash a stick of cooked carrot between his gums was not something I was prepared to do. I wanted to work and sleep. I wanted to leave the house and talk to other humans, and feel the warmth of the sun on my skin. I had tolive.I chose sanity.What I was unprepared for was the moral judgment, even though all I did was wait for a few more gnashers to appear. In choosing a pouch, the crime that a mother is being found guilty of is one of convenience. As one mum put it to me this week: “The pouches were a godsend when out and about and without them loads of trapped mums would be stuck in the house. I feel like anything that makes our life easier is a target.”The nutritionist Laura Thomas recently wrote a brilliant piece taking issue with those who criticise ultra processed baby foods. To Thomas, the preparation of fresh baby food represents whatthe sociologists Priya Fielding-Singh and Merin Oleschuk call “foodwork”, ie meal planning, shopping, preparing, cooking and cleaning up. It is work that is often mostly undertaken by women. Foodwork is one of the many facets of the “intensive mothering” culture in which, Thomas writes, “the work of weaning has taken on a valence that I have come to understand as part of a larger project to re-domesticate women”. It is worthreading the essay in full, because it has important things to say about how foodwork is weaponised in ways that rarely take account of structural and social inequalities of class, gender and race. I’d add disability to that list, too, because these food orthodoxies never seem to account for children with additional needs.Were I to choose to feel guilty about my occasional use of an Ella’s Kitchen pouch, I’d be buying into a neoliberal mindset that emphasises personal responsibility over fixing those inequalities. I’d be buying into an increasingly prevalent nostalgia for the time of home-cooked family meals, the decline of which is blamed almost entirely on working mothers, rather than the fact that we, as humans, are being deprived of systems of communal care, and which contain the seeds of our liberation. You can’t divorce food from politics. I might enjoy cooking from scratch for my family – I have the time and resources to do so – but I refuse to get completely back in the kitchen.Food companies need to play a part, but my vision for a better society for parents and children goes far beyond condemning pureed fruit. It is one with improved paternity leave, and workplace creches, SureStart centres delivering free weaning and cooking workshops, meal vouchers, the abolishment of the two-child benefit cap. It is one where you don’t need two incomes to afford basic housing costs, or where the intense pressure on parents isn’t such that a pouch so often feels like a solution. “Parents should be actively discouraged from buying these baby pouches,” according to First StepsNutritionTrust. Well, join the queue of people telling us off. Can’t we be more ambitious? What would a society that not only encouraged, but actually supported and facilitated good food choices look like?My son is three now, and he’s tall. Despite his earlier pureed diet, he can wolf down a chicken madras, a bowl of boquerones, most things, really (we used to mix the pouches in with more challenging foods to get him used to them). He likes to eat, this boy we built, whose bones I grew inside me for just under eight months. He was built with my breast milk and with formula and, yes, with pureed sweet potato that I made from scratch. But Ella’s Kitchen and Tesco pouches and melty puffs also built him, just as jars of 80s baby food and rusks helped build my generation. It’s exhausting, thankless work building a person. You have to give yourself some grace while doing it. Life is hard. Sometimes, it requires an extra sprinkling of sugar.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist.

Not if my older friends are any guideEmma BeddingtonThe generations are more segregated than ever. Yet we have so much in commonSun 4 May 2025 09.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 14.47 EDTShareI’ve always felt a bit pathetic for not having a proper peer group. In dark moments, it feels like a moral failing and an indictment of my social skills. In kinder moments I recognise it’s also partly a product of being sick and sad at university, then successively too pregnant, too preoccupied with babies and too peripatetic to make or maintain ties. In calmer times, I’ve forged slightly more of a social life, but mostly it’s not made up of my gen X peers, but rather people who are occasionally younger, usually significantly older. Now I’m wondering – am I lucky?This thought was prompted by anAtlantic podcastdiscussing the demographic moment we’re living in – the usual pyramidal population structure is becoming squarer, with similar numbers of older and younger people – and asking whether we’re making the most of it. The conclusion was we probably aren’t.“While we are the most age-diverse society we’ve ever been, we’re simultaneously the most age-segregated by institutions, by infrastructure, by policy. It’s like everything in our lives is designed to separate us,” said one podcast guest, Eunice Lin Nichols (co-CEO of anorganisation promoting intergenerational initiatives). She went on to describe how old age became a siloed-off activity, while childhood became more protected and, by extension, distinct.Nichols and the presenters explored what they felt had been lost: different perspectives; a sense of cultural continuity and community; the village that everyone needs to help raise their children.In the US and the UK, people are trying to correct this. You’ve probably read aboutnurseries in care homesandintergenerational housing projects; the podcast described retirement communities on university campuses, creative multigenerational communes and places where young people in the fostering system live side by side with older adults. It’s beautiful stuff, but it remains the exception: a report byUnited for All Ages in 2020described Britain as one of the most age-segregated countries in the world. The thinktank iscampaigning to create1,000 intergenerational community centres by 2030.I often read stories aboutthe joys of intergenerational friendship, but perhaps that says more about our longing for them than their prevalence? Age-gap relationships have become something to be carefully cultivated and commented on rather than an unremarkable fact of life. My intergenerational relationships came about quite carelessly, mostly as a result of moving to a smaller town and having more time to do stuff I love (singing, nature, yoga). I do feel lucky to have those friends, partly because that Atlantic podcast is right: knowing people in their 70s and 80s (and to a lesser extent 20s and 30s) gives me a more expansive sense of community and broader, fresher perspectives. But there have also been more personal benefits.A huge one is that having friends at very different life stages has almost cured me of my nasty, ridiculous compulsion to compare myself with others. When I started having more intergenerational relationships, my brain struggled to do the weird benchmarking it always seemed compelled to conduct around others – are they happier, more stylish, more successful? It felt so patently ridiculous with someone with a spouse with dementia (even if their garden was jaw-droppingly beautiful), or struggling to find their first job (even if they had perfect, dewy skin), that at some point I just mercifully short-circuited.‘It feels unconditional’: the secrets of lifelong friendships - according to lifelong friendsRead moreWe are all, always, dealing with our own incomparable stuff. And that’s the other thing: over years of throwaway remarks and deeper conversations, sharing crisps or lifts, binoculars and musical scores, I realised things can feel urgent and unsettled at any age.My older friends in particular have gradually relieved me of the notion that at some future point my life will feel sorted. It’s not that I was happy to realise they still get anxious, angry or sad about relationships. Or that they worry about the world and wonder if their lives are heading in the right direction. But knowing that they do so makes us feel closer and gives the lie to the notion of siloed generations with entirely distinct preoccupations.Structurally, everything may be “designed to separate us”, but inside, we’re all just stumbling and struggling, finding what joy we can along the way. That seems a pretty great basis for a relationship, at any age.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAgeingOpinionFriendshipHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

The resumption of humanitarian relief is essential to save civilian livesSun 4 May 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 16.03 EDTShareShameful. That was the word that Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s foreign minister, used to describe proceedings at theinternational court of justice(ICJ) last Monday. The United Nations asked the court to determine whether Israel must allow aid to enter Gaza, two months after it cut it off again just before the ceasefire deal collapsed. Supplies are running out. Unicef says that thousands of children have already experienced acute malnutrition.Mr Sa’ar’s complaint is that Israel is unfairly targeted. The separate international criminal court case against Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Yoav Gallant, the former defence minister, also focuses on the alleged starvation of civilians. It is true that withholding food is a common weapon in war, yet has rarely been the focus of international legal cases, in part because intent is hard to prove. It is the rhetoric of Israeli officials,suggests Dr Boyd van Dijk, an expert on the Geneva conventions, which has changed that.Last summer, Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right finance minister,remarkedthat it might be “justified and moral” to starve people if it brought home Israeli hostages seized in the Hamas atrocities of 7 October 2023, but that “no one in the world will allow us”. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz,saidlast month that its “policy is clear: no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza”. The far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, insisted that “there is no reason for a single gram of food or any aid to enter” until hostages were freed. An aid ship destined for Gaza wasattacked by dronesand disabled on Friday. More than 52,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to its health authorities.Unicef saysthey include 15,000 children, with hundreds of deaths since the new Israeli offensive began in March. But withholding food kills just as bombs do. Farmland is devastated. Flour is said to cost30 times morethan before the war. Aid warehouses are empty. UN World Food Programme bakeries closed a month ago when supplies ran out; essential community kitchensare now following.Israeli officials have said they need to stop Hamas getting their hands on aid. It’s obvious that men with guns will secure food long after others have starved. Donald Trump says that he has told Mr Netanyahu to allow aid in. Yet the UStold the ICJthat Israel’s security needs override its obligation to do so. The strong legal consensus is that occupying powers have anabsolute dutyunder the Geneva conventions to permit food to be given to a population in need.Israel isreportedlyplanning to resume aid delivery “in the coming weeks”, but via a radically new mechanism. It claims the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, essential to humanitarian efforts, has been mass-infiltrated by Hamas – an allegationstrongly disputedby the UN and others. The proposed alternative, of international organisations and private security contractors handing out food to individual families, looks both unworkable and dangerous for civilians.As Israel and the US attack international courts, other nations – including the UK – must do all they can to defend and bolster them. They must also press harder for the immediate resumption of aid. What is shameful about this ICJ case is the need to bring it. What is shameful is that almost half the children in Gaza questioned in a study saidthat they wished to die. What is shameful is that so many civilians have been killed, and so many more pushed to the brink of starvation. What is shameful is that this has, indeed, been allowed to happen.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But Rachel Reeves needs a better plan for this to benefit both pensioners and public infrastructureSun 4 May 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 16.03 EDTShareWhen Otto von Bismarck introduced the world’s first pension system in 1889, he could hardly have imagined the colossal wealth that people would one day save towards retirement. Britain’s pension funds look after a collective£2tn, almost as much as the country’s annual economic output. Rachel Reeves wants them to invest this money in regenerating decrepitinfrastructure. The rationale for the chancellor’s proposition is clear. So too are its flaws.Ms Reeves will announce the full details of her plansthis week. Her austere fiscal rules have given them a new urgency. Investment in Britainlags behind other G7 countries, and the government has been attempting to use other people’s money as a substitute for more generous public spending. She hopes that retirement savings could provide a source. She has praised Canada and Australia’s pension funds, which plough money into infrastructure at home and abroad, and wants Britain’s smaller, sleepier funds to emulate this model.Her instincts are understandable. Only20%of the assets held in Britain’s defined contribution pension funds are now invested in the UK. Many funds have instead gravitated towards the US market to take advantage of rising tech stocks. This is a missed opportunity. British pension funds should be investing in Britain for the simple reason that most of their beneficiaries live here. Doing so could also help protect people’s retirement savingsfromcurrency fluctuations, and may become increasingly necessary if Donald Trump continues detonating the American stock market.Even so, Ms Reeves’s plan for a more national pension system rests on flawed foundations. She hopes that funds will invest more money intoprivate marketsthat are dominated by asset managers. Many of these specialise in infrastructure, but they also charge steep fees, and there is growing evidence that theirperformancedoesn’t justify their huge expense. Even the World Economic Forum – hardly known for its radicalism – has observed that the private capital industry is organised so fund managers capturemost of the profits. Britain’s pensions system is already highly unequal, and many people, particularly women and minorities, have very poor cover. Pressuring funds to invest with financial middlemen who transfer a growing share of pensioners’ money to themselves would be a mistake.True, Ms Reeves has already proposed a partial solution:merge some fundsso they’re large enough to hire their own in-house professionals and skip these fees, as many Canadian and American funds already do. But there’s still a bigger question about whether the Canadian approach is the right one to emulate. One only needs to witness the disastrous example of Thames Water, whoselargest investorwas the Ontario Municipal Employees’ Retirement System, to see how this model of infrastructure investing can result in rent-seeking that degrades the public realm, even if some retirees benefit.A better option would be allowing Labour’s national wealth fund to issue its own bonds. These would sate pension funds’existing appetitefor gilts and give the government greater control over investment. Most pension funds are extremely risk averse, and many don’t want to invest in infrastructure until it’salready built. Where this is the case, the government should be borrowing to fund such projects itself. It is worth remembering, after all, that an aversion to public investment was to blame for the ailing state of Britain’s infrastructure in the first place.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromRobert DysonSun 4 May 2025 12.23 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 16.03 EDTShareThe scathing comments of Prof Julia Waters on the government’s proposed tweaks to the way Ofsted inspects and reports on schools are entirely justified and everything she says is completely true (Ruth Perry’s sister joins calls to pause proposed Ofsted overhaul, 28 April).In the past 25 years, stress caused by Ofsted inspections has beencitedin no fewer than 10 coroner’s reports and there is clear evidence that many more school leaders have considered taking their lives following a negative inspection.It is quite astonishing that the current “consultation” makes no reference to these shocking facts, while appearing to be based on the premise that a system that aims to “improve” schools by the deliberate use of public humiliation is fundamentally sound and just needs some cosmetic changes.Ofsted’s only clearly observable “achievement” is to have brought about a crisis in the recruitment and retention of teachers. The government must know all this and it is time it had the courage to acknowledge that a complete rethink is well overdue.Michael PykeThe Campaign for State EducationJulia Waters and others are right to question the role of Ofsted and the government’s consultation. The proposed changes are still based on the primacy of parental choice. That is misguided and damaging. The primacy for the state system should surely be to raise standards across the system. The current summative system demoralises many staff and can set some schools on a downward cycle.Schoolsin difficulties, often in the most challenging circumstances, should be supported, not named and shamed. This requires a formative assessment system.Of course, parents should be kept informed, but that could be by a report with commendations and recommendations together with an action plan for improvement developed jointly by the inspectors and the school. This radical change of approach could not be adopted by Ofsted. It would need to be disbanded and replaced by an office for school and college improvement.Robert DysonEmeritus professor, University of WarwickHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Why are they like that?, 1 May).In autism studies, researchers have noticed a “double empathy problem”: two people who think and communicate very differently will both struggle to empathise.Ms Miller demonstrates this phenomenon inadvertently but perfectly. She mentions differences in male and female communication. And that some people have anxiety around asking questions or appearing to pry.She acknowledges that not all questions are well-intentioned, but not that the line between acceptable and unacceptable is subjective. She doesn’t appear to have wondered if “non-askers” dislike her questions or if that is why they don’t reciprocate. Neurodivergence and cultural differences are considerations too.There are many reasons why some ask fewer questions than others. These are not bad conversationalists. There are many ways to connect, none right or wrong, but many incompatible. You don’t have to click with everyone. But if you want to befriend non-askers, pay attention to how others like to communicate and join in. Do they tell jokes, exchange anecdotes, play games? If you want others to socialise like you, it’s only fair you reciprocate.Name and address suppliedI’d like to suggest that there might be a cultural element to question asking. As an American who has moved to the UK, question-based conversation was a cultural difference I struggled to understand and enjoy. When I first moved to London people would ask me so many questions and never share anything about themselves. I found it so boring to always be answering questions about myself to the point that I started making things up.When I complained about it to a friend they explained that in the UK it’s not really the done thing to talk about yourself unless someone has asked. This felt very different from my American upbringing where it’s considered rude to ask questions that might be perceived as prying. Instead there’s an expectation that people will share what they want to share when they are ready to do so. After learning that, I started having much better conversations.Clair MaleneySheffieldSarah Miller’s article is very interesting. There is one answer by Estonian healers and witches to the question she poses: people who ask too many questions are simply frightened. A frightened person always has questions on their lips. There are whole nations who don’t ask you questions, like Estonians. There is a KGB occupation time trauma, for example, as they asked far too many questions.As an Estonian in the UK, I have been asked questions relentlessly until I am sick. It was never me waiting, as Miller says, like “a dog for a treat”, but rather not having been taught as a child how to shoot a question back straight away. That only comes with age and wisdom.In my view, not asking back is about peacefulness within yourself and contentment, because we as humans should also dream together and not be constantly intense. More recently, now aged 52, I have started to ask questions back creatively, like who is your favourite composer, your favourite colour, and why, rather than where are you from and what do you do. Because I find that boring.Elo Allik-SchunemannLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Still, pretty much the last thing anyone expected Palmer to do in mid-January was to go 18 games without a goal in all competitions.Now, with the drought finally at an end courtesy of a late penalty against Liverpool ina 3-1 win for Chelsea, Maresca said that Palmer was “not happy” with his lack of goals in the last few months, and backed him to help the side “reach something important” in the crucial last few games of their season.Palmer breaks goal drought as champions Liverpool beaten by ChelseaRead moreChelsea are now all but certain to reach the Conference League final later this month, while also facing their Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in the hunt for the top five. With this in mind Palmer’s return to the scoresheet could scarcely have been better timed, even if Maresca insisted that his level had not dropped in recent months.“We saw Cole day by day in the training ground, and he was exactly the same way: scoring goals, happy, enjoying the session,” Maresca said. “Of course when he is not scoring goals he is not happy, because he wants to help the club reach something important. [Now] he is happy for sure, because we scored. But I didn’t see a different Cole from two months ago.“I said before that if we want to finish top five, we need Cole and Nico [Jackson] to score. Now we have three more [league] games, and on Thursday the second leg [in Europe], and hopefully he can help us.”Referencing his goal drought to Sky Sports afterwards, Palmer said: “Obviously shit happens. I went three months without scoring but it just gives me more motivation, more fight to do well, not just for myself but for the team.“You know yourself social media is just full of idiots, trolls or whatever. I don’t pay no attention. To score today I’m happy. It’s only one and I’ve got to keep improving to try and reach my levels. For anyone not getting chances, not scoring, you’re letting your team down at the end of the day.

Taking the win forMcLarenwith a piece of relentlessly controlled dominance, and in so doing determinedly maintaining his place out front in a tight title fight, Piastri laid down a marker in Florida that he will be exceptionally hard to beat this season.Disappointed on missing out on a win in the sprint race on Saturday, Piastri and his team executed this race with perfection to secure a remarkable win, beating his teammate Lando Norris into second place, the British driver’s hopes of victory extinguished within moments of the lights going out when he went wheel to wheel withMax Verstappen, went off and fell to sixth. Verstappen could manage only fourth from pole, behind the Mercedes of George Russell, while Alex Albon took a superb fifth for Williams.F1: Piastri wins Miami GP in dominant McLaren one-two finish – as it happenedRead moreLewis Hamilton however had another somewhat trying afternoon in the Ferrari, finishing eighth, after another testy run-in with his team over the radio.Piastri has shown dominance from pole repeatedly this season, with this his fourth win butat the Hard Rock Stadiumhe had to work for it and ensured he remains front and centre in the championship fight. He now leads Norris by 16 points with Verstappen in third, 32 points back.He was driving at his very best, his confidence high but matched with the calm assurance he has behind the wheel and with which he was able to deliver, despite being chased to the flag by Norris. The scale of their advantage over the rest of the field was breathtaking. Once both drivers had clean air out front having passed Verstappen, they took off, with Piastri finishing 37 seconds up on Russell.Drivers standingsFor Norris the opening had been costly. Verstappen just held his lead through turn one but locked up and squeezed Norris off, with the British driver losing places to sixth in the process in what was judged a racing incident. Piastri shot through and, after he had passed Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli, took off after the world champion.They duelled for several laps to thrilling effect but on lap 14 Piastri finally made it stick at turn one, by which point Norris had come back and almost caught them. However the time it then took him to pass Verstappen, another four laps, was all the window Piastri needed and during which he put nine seconds on his teammate, a gap that was all but impossible for Norris to overcome by the close with the two cars so closely matched.“Max put up a good fight, and I just paid the price,” said Norris. “What can I say? If I don’t go for it, people complain. If I go for it, people complain. With Max it’s crash or don’t pass, and I just had to get him in the right position.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton, whose relationship with his Ferrari team remains fractious, makes a pit stop.Photograph: Shawn Thew/ReutersQualifying had been disappointing for Piastri but when it mattered he and Norris put the McLaren’s superior race pace to use with clinical effect.Once he had passed Verstappen after a stout defence from the Dutchman, Piastri was all but untouchable and he knew it showed how far he and the team have come.“I remember two years ago in Miami we were genuinely the slowest team, I think we got lapped twice,” he said. “To now have won the grand prix by over 35 seconds to third is an unbelievable result.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once more neither he nor Charles Leclerc were within a sniff of a podium and reduced to fighting the Williams of Carlos Sainz. When Hamilton was clearly quicker Ferrari had Leclerc move over for him into seventh place but only after the British driver expressed intense frustration at the time the team took to make the decision. “Have a tea break while you’re at it,” was his exasperated response.They then had him give the place back later in the race and, when told Sainz was closing, Hamilton’s response of: “You want to let him past as well?” was weighted with sarcasm and discontent. Another indication the relationship with theScuderiastill has no little development in it.For all that Verstappen andRed Bullhad managed to find a better window for their car this weekend, the McLaren was very much the class of the field in race pace and once more notably easier on its tyres than its competitors. It is also notable this season that the two areas Piastri was considered unable to match Norris last year, qualifying and tyre management, he has very much mastered and that is giving him a distinct advantage in the title fight, for which he might now be considered favourite.Red Bull launched a protest after the race stating they believed Russell had not slowed under yellow flags during the virtual safety car period but it was rejected by the stewards and the classification remained unchanged.Typically for the grand sense of fun and spectacle Miami presents, before the race the drivers had taken to the track in specially built full-size Lego replicas of their car consisting of 400,000 blocks and weighing over a ton and a half. They drove the track at 20km/h and proved enormously popular with the drivers but when the serious business was finished in Florida it must be considered that it is Piastri who now has all the building blocks in place for a serious tilt at the title.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportUS sportsLando NorrisMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

Even so, the odds remain stacked against him. Nobody has ever overcome a five-frame deficit overnight to win this trophy.For Zhao, whose ongoing amateur status is largely due to a 20-month ban for his role in a betting scandal, there is a chance to follow Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy as just the third player to lift the trophy having come through qualification.He needs seven more frames to seal this best-of-35 clash, with Williams needing a major turnaround to claim another 12.Zhao came out hot, controlling the opening frame after an initial 51-point flurry and sealing it after navigating a safety exchange. He ran up an even 100 in the second and was soon 3-0 to the good, showing his quality and range with three outstanding shots to sink brown, blue and pink.Williams stopped the rot just before the mid-session interval, ending a sloppy frame with his nose in front, but Zhao ensured he kept the momentum with a decisive break of 57.The older man looked to have found his mojo when he notched up 61 – more than double his previous best – but misjudged a cannon off the black with frame for the taking. He was unable to make a fine cut on the red and Zhao did the rest.Emboldened by his lead, Zhao got even better as the session came to an end, piecing together a fluid 104 and producing a remarkable plant on a long red to finish with an 83.View image in fullscreenMark Williams hopes to become the oldest player to win the world title.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThe break appeared to spark Williams into life as he took the first two frames of the evening’s play.

He might have had the next too, but one slight misjudgment stopped him short on 23 and brought Zhao to the table. His clinical response deserved another century but he had to make do with 96 and move one step closer to glory.Williams came within a whisker of hitting back, going 63 ahead with 75 left, only to miss the clincher. Zhao rose from his chair and cleared the table for 71.Down but not yet out, Williams took the final frame deep, eventually winning the race to land the last red and banking an important boost before the last day in Sheffield.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

It is now less a question, for example, of whether Henry Pollock and Fin Smith could make the plane and more whether Farrell can afford to leave them behind.Henry Pollock revels in ‘special win’ over Leinster in hardest game of his lifeRead moreAlong with Tommy Freeman, whose three first-half tries laid the foundations of Northampton’s stunning 37-34 victory in Dublin, and scrum-half Alex Mitchell, Pollock and Smith were instrumental in a remarkable team effort which once again wrecked Leinster’s title hopes. One or two previously nailed-on Irish Lions also now face an anxious wait before Thursday’s squad unveiling.By contrast Pollock and Smith could have done no more. The former scored a spectacular 50-metre individual try when his side were down to 14 players and outshone many of Ireland’s first-choice forwards. Smith, for his part, once again oozed class and assurance as Northampton scored five tries against opponents who had won their previous two knockout games by a combined score of 114-0.The fly-half was already firmly in Lions contention but the 20-year-old Pollock has catapulted himself into the picture with a serious of stellar performances. Even Lawrence Dallaglio had to wait until he was 23 to represent his country and it is already obvious that England have unearthed a generational talent in the ‘can-do’ mould of an Ian Botham or Freddie Flintoff.Pollock is a similarly larger-than-life character, celebrating his try by placing a finger on his neck – “Just a feeling the pulse, ice-in-the-veins type of thing’ – to show the home crowd he was not remotely overawed by the occasion. His try was also smartly engineered. “I kind of saw a massive gap in the defensive line, changed my speed and Mitch gave me a good ball. I was lucky enough to get the swerve on the outside of Sam Prendergast and finished in the middle. I was happy with that,”View image in fullscreenOne or two previously nailed-on Irish Lions also now face an anxious wait before Andy Farrell names the squad on Thursday.Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport/Getty ImagesFarrell will have taken due note and the English prodigy would love to join this summer’s Lions adventure down under. “I’ve thought about it. But at the end of the day you can’t control it. It’s subjective. It would be an honour to go on that plane and represent the Lions but if it’s not this year I’m sure I’ll be able to bounce back and pick myself up.“Reflecting back on the last year it has been pretty mad. Getting to the final of theChampions Cupand getting my first senior cap would probably have been a dream. But every opportunity I’ve had I feel like I’ve taken it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think he sees the game as a game and that enjoyment and fun is infectious. It goes through the team.”Quite rightly, though, the Saints management were also keen to stress the collective effort that enabled Northampton to become the first English side to reach the Champions Cup final since 2020. Curtis Langdon, Josh Kemeny, Juarno Augustus and James Ramm were all outstanding while Fraser Dingwall and Rory Hutchinson in midfield lost nothing in comparison with the seasoned pair of Garry Ringrose and Robbie Henshaw.Saints are a tight, largely homegrown squad as well and Dowson felt it would have been “cruel” hadLeinsterprevailed at the death when Ross Byrne’s 79th minute ‘try’ was ruled out. “Of course the game is about skills and tactical awareness but it’s also about having some heart and working for each other,” stressed Dowson. “I think that’s probably the most pleasing thing.”Leinster’s postmortem, however, will be long and mournful. Their head coach Leo Cullen stood by his decision to select the outstanding All Black Jordie Barrett on the bench but, either way, Leinster’s last Champions Cup triumph was seven years ago. Their record in high pressure games is increasingly patchy and they will be conspicuously absent from the final in Cardiff on 24 May. Plenty of food for thought for Farrell and the Lions management, therefore, with around a dozen Leinster players hoping to tour Australia next month.Explore more on these topicsChampions CupNorthamptonLeinsterBritish & Irish LionsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The league could scarcely have hoped for a more engrossing finale. Ultimately, by the finest of margins,London City Lionesseswere promoted to the Women’s Super League after an outstanding individual goal from Isobel Goodwin helped them edge to a dramatic 2-2 draw away to their nearest title rivals Birmingham City, who were within a whisker of completing what would have been a comeback for the ages.Goodwin’s stunning long-range strike and a Chantelle Boye-Hlorkah header put the visitors 2-0 up and Birmingham, backed by a club-record crowd of 8,749, knowing they had to win to be promoted, fought back valiantly in the final 27 minutes through Emily van Egmond’s header and Cho So-hyun’s volley – four minutes from time – to set up a frantic finish but the visitors clung on to the draw they needed to clinch top spot.Manchester United roar back to seal Champions League spot through WSL derby draw with CityRead moreOwned by Michele Kang, Lionesses will be the WSL’s first independently run club and the wealthy American businesswoman has made no secret of her intention to turn them into a Champions League force. She was front and centre in the team’s celebrations, even carrying the trophy on to the pitch before it was presented, and stood side-by-side with the captain Kosovare Asllani as the Swede hoisted the silverware. Afterwards, a delighted Kang told TalkSport: “When I first came to England and bought London City, a lot of people were concerned for me and were saying: ‘How can she do this? There’s no men’s team, you need a men’s team to draw the brand power, fanbase and resources – an independent team can’t do it.’ Well, we are proof that, with the proper investment and focus, anything is possible.”Her cash injection in the past two transfer windows in particular brought the English women’s second tier into uncharted territory and therefore it was perhaps fitting that it should be Goodwin, the division’s record signing – purchased for a fee believed to be in excess of £100,000 from Sheffield United – who played a key role in this promotion decider. The 22-year-old former Aston Villa forward She produced a goal-of-the-season contender to open the scoring, skilfully evading two challenges before launching a powerful strike from long range that flew into the top corner. After the game a beaming Goodwin told Sky Sports: “I can’t believe it. I’m so happy to get over the line. I don’t think I’ve ever scored a goal like that in my life.”Kang, who also owns the record eight-times women’s European champions Lyon and the NWSL side Washington Spirit, was in the executive boxes at a noisy St Andrew’s, sitting near to Birmingham’s owner Tom Wagner, in what was a clash between the second tier’s two big-spending promotion rivals, with the league’s chief executive Nikki Doucet and chair Dawn Airey also in attendance.The game was the first in the history of the English women’s second tier to be broadcast live by Sky Sports, such was the magnitude of the occasion with promotion on the line, and viewers were rewarded with a box-office finale as Birmingham pushed for a winner in 10 minutes of second-half stoppage time.Both teams had efforts cleared off the line in a tense first half, with firstly Boye-Hlorkah denying Van Egmond, before Birmingham’s Rebecca Holloway did well to hook away a Boye-Hlorkah effort at the other end. Goodwin also forced Adrianna Franch into a fine low save before the break. After Goodwin’s stunning opener, Boye-Hlorkah headed inside the far post from a corner, before Van Egmond gave the hosts’ hope from close range and then the substitute Cho had them believing, when she volleyed in superbly.After his team survived 10 minutes of stoppage time, Lionesses’ head coach, Jocelyn Prêcheur, looked emotionally drained when speaking to reporters and said: “It means a lot. This is the magic of the project. I was so satisfied to give her [Kang] this gift, this promotion, because people cannot really realise what she’s doing right now for women’s football. She’s really changing the game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had lost all six of those previous matches, including both those Paris finals in 2022 and 2023, the 2022 US Open final and the ATP finals. He has, at last, clinched one of the biggest titles in the game.Aryna Sabalenka seals Madrid Open hat-trick by dismantling GauffRead more“It is a mix of somewhat of a relief and happiness and just pure joy,” said the 26-year-old Ruud. “I know, based on the last years that I’ve had on tour, how tough it is to do well at the biggest tournaments, and I’ve never been able to get over the finish line as a champion, but today I was able to and this week here in Madrid, so extremely happy and proud, of course, that I was able to stay focused in the tournament.”After two supreme weeks in the Spanish capital, this is a painful defeat for Draper to digest after he led 5-3 in the opening set before conceding four consecutive games. He recovered impressively, fighting back to force a final set but he was outlasted by one of the best clay-court tennis players in the world.Still, Draper solidified his status as among the very top contenders in men’s tennis on every single surface and at all levels.“Just fresh off losing a really tough match in a final, it really hurts,” said the 22-year-old. “But at the same time, I thinkI’ve enjoyed a lot of really good successeshere, I’ve come through a lot of matches, and so maybe this loss and maybe being in a final and not quite getting over the line just helps me to fuel my fire a bit more that I can. I need to keep onpushing, I need to keep on improving.”Before this tournament, Draper’s best results on clay were a couple of quarter-finals at lowly ATP 250 events. He had never won three consecutive ATP matches on the surface or beaten a top-30 player. Although he fully believed he had the ability to thrive on clay, he arrived in Madrid searching for a breakthrough on the surface. He has done just that.“People say: ‘Oh, I’m not very good on the clay.’ Whereas I knew I was good on the clay,” said Draper. “I had a couple of really tight losses last year, and I just needed to get my foot in the door somewhere to show that I’m able to compete to a really high level on this surface. I think this week has shown that, and it’s shown it to myself, shown it to others.”View image in fullscreenCasper Ruud celebrates his first Masters 1000 title.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesAlongside his new career-high ATP ranking of No 5, Draper sits No 2 in the ATP race, which charts results within the calendar year and he is now the only British man, other than Andy Murray, to reach Masters 1000 finals on both hard and clay courts. Draper won at Indian Wells in March. There is no doubt that he has the ability to win a major title. “I’m really proud of the way I’ve been the first few months of this season,” he said.“I think the exciting thing is there’s so much more to come from myself. I feel like there’s still areas of my game that I can really improve, and that’s very motivating for me and my coach and my team that I honestly feel like I’m at the start of my journey. So I’m going to keep on improving and keep on pushing hard and keep these tough moments in my head to keep on driving myself to be better.”Ruud has now won 125 matches and 12 titles on clay over the past five years, more than any other player on the ATP tour since the beginning of 2020. “Even though I won today, my record in big finals is still not good, it’s 1-6,” he said. “I’ve been in many unbelievable and incredible positions in my career, and I’ve been able to experience some great things and, unfortunately, have been on the losing spectrum of many of those matches, but that’s OK. In many ways, my career has gone better than maybe I thought was possible sometimes.The man from Oslo added: “Of course I always dreamed about winning tournaments like this or grand slams or becoming world No 1, and I’ve been fairly close, but it’s not like I was serving for the match anytime or super-leading, like crazy, and then choked and lost, in a way.“So I’ve just played players that were better than me and I’ve tried to learn from that, and think that one day there will come another opportunity and maybe I can seize it and, I guess, that was the key to the victory today.”Explore more on these topicsTennisJack DrapernewsShareReuse this content"

There is now a clear trio at the summit, with the reigningSuper Leaguechampions solidifying their place in that leading pack with a hard-fought win over Warrington.They remain two points behind Hull KR, with Leigh just a further point back. It is still slightly too early to suggest that trio are the only contenders for the Grand Final: but right now, there is clearly a gap between the Robins, the Leopards and the Warriors compared to their next closest rivals.Magic is a stage built for the biggest and best players to showcase their talent – and Wigan’s dynamic duo of Jai Field and Bevan French both crossed for wonderful tries here. That ultimately helped Wigan to have just enough against aWarringtonside hit by injuries, but who showed plenty of spirit here but fell short, losing 22-20.However, Sam Burgess’ side, as mentioned, are one of a number of teams now falling behind the leading pack – three wins behind the trio already. That said, the Wire are firmly entrenched in a battle for the other three playoff spots with six teams: who are now just split by a solitary victory.The debate over the strength of Super League’s high tackle laws has also begun to resurface, emphasised by the opening game of day two on Sunday. Huddersfield claimed their first win of the season at the 10th attempt with a 12-10 triumph over Hull, whose early-season promise is starting to falter slightly.View image in fullscreenJacob Gagai scores Huddersfield’s second try against Hull.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesTheir cause wasn’t helped here by the loss of two forwards in the moments approaching half-time. Sam Eseh was sin-binned for a tackle that was deemed to be dangerous on Matty English before, seconds later, Liam Knight was shown a straight red for an inexplicable hit on Sam Hewitt.It left Hull’s coach, John Cartwright, calling Knight and his side “dumb”. His counterpart, Luke Robinson – who had two players put on report for contact with the head – joined the growing calls for a greater level of understanding and common sense over the finer points of tackling in the modern era.

It is at this point in proceedings that we raise the question about what could or couldn’t happen next year. Murmurings of Super League potentially going to 14 teams in 2026 will not go away – but even then, Magic will remain on the calendar.The Guardian understands that talks between Super League and officials in Newcastle had started even before this weekend. The healthy crowd will have only added further weight to the fact that the game will be back at St James’ Park in a year’s time.In fact, this was the sixth-highest Magic Weekend crowd in history – and RL Commercial’s CEO, Rhodri Jones, revealed to the Guardian on Sunday afternoon that a decision to bring the event back to St James’ Park next year is a long way towards being finalised already: with no other venues under consideration. “Fans wanted to come back to Newcastle and the stakeholders here have been great,” Jones said. “The stadium is great and we’re delighted with the weekend and the attendance.“It’s fair to say that positive conversations have already happened for next year.” In truth, it is difficult to imagine this event being anywhere else.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueWigan WarriorsWarringtonRugby leagueWakefield TrinityCastlefordHuddersfield GiantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Reform took most seats from the Conservatives, who lost 674, while Labour lost 187.Speaking to the BBC’sLaura Kuenssberg, Streeting said things “take time and you don’t turn around a country … in just nine months. All I’d say to people is: we’ve got the message, we’re not daft, we haven’t got our heads in the sand. All I ask people for is a bit of time and to give us the benefit of the doubt … We are going at those challenges as hard and fast as we can”.He saidLabourknew that people would “look for change elsewhere” if the country did not feel different by the next election and the government would “go further and faster” towards safer streets, more secure borders, waiting lists falling and the cost of living improving.On Sky News, Streeting made clear that Reform was being taken seriously as an alternative challenger to the Conservatives. “I think Reform is definitely a real threat and one that we take seriously. I think there’s clearly, on the right of British politics, a realignment taking place,” he said.“It’s not yet clear whether at the next general election it will be Reform or the Conservatives that are Labour’s main challengers, but we’ve got to take that threat seriously. In that spirit, I think Reform does deserve more airtime and scrutiny of their policies.”Asked if he thought of Reform as Labour’s “most serious opposition”, he said: “I certainly do treat them as a serious opposition force.“I don’t know whether it will be Reform or the Conservatives that emerge as the main threat. I don’t have a horse in that race, but like Alien vs. Predator, you don’t really want either one to win but one of them will emerge as the main challenger to Labour at the next general election.”The Conservatives are also under pressure after the local election results.Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, rejected calls from local councillors for her to resign, when asked about her performance on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.View image in fullscreenThe Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, told Laura Kuenssberg that ‘protest is in the air’.Photograph: Jeff Overs/PA“What we had was Labour saying ‘all we need to do is get rid of the Conservatives and everything will be better’. Things got worse,” she said. “Now we have Reform saying ‘all we need to do is get rid of the Conservatives and Labour and everything will be better’. I suspect things will get worse, but protest is in the air.”She said the Conservatives still had time to turn things around before the next election: “We live in politically volatile times and what I have been saying is that we are going to take a slow and steady way. There will be bumps along [the way] but we can do this, and we will do it in four years, not 18 years, 14 years, 13 years like the previous oppositions.”What we have learned so far from England’s local elections and byelectionRead moreZia Yusuf, the Reform chair, said his party would show what it could do in local government and would be publishing a plan to deport people who have entered the country by illegal means in the first term of a Reform government.He also defended hisparty’s plans to cut diversity, equality and inclusionspending at local councils where Reform has taken control. Pressed on how much money this would save, he could not give an answer but he said Reform would bring in auditors and taskforces to cut unnecessary spending.The party is now in control of 10 councils: Kent, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, North and West Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, Staffordshire, Doncaster, Lancashire and Durham.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsReform UKLocal elections 2025LabourWes StreetingLaura KuenssbergKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

He pointed to partisan or obsequious media platforms that risked damaging “a shared space for a national debate”.“The shared enemies, fellas, are the backers of partisan news, the backers of soft, creepy, chummy interviews on favoured networks or favoured platforms – the people who want to avoid scrutiny altogether and just broadcast a speech or an interview on YouTube or their social media channel,” he said.“Britain could easily go down the route of the United States in which people are shoved into partisan silos. It’s a danger not because it’s a threat to the BBC; it’s about democracy. Is there a shared space for a national debate? People might shout at the radio and television, asking: ‘Why didn’t you ask that?’ or: ‘You should have been harder,’ or: ‘Why are you so rude to my guy?’ But you see people who want control over your lives quizzed and questioned, challenged and tested and held to account. That’s what matters, not the format.”Robinson, who presents BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after years as its political editor, said long-form political interviews were not dead. However, he said they needed to adapt to a new media landscape in which politicians could simply ignore hard outings and choose from an array of media platforms, podcasts and hosts.“Sometimes, if people want to criticise my interview, they’ll say: ‘Why weren’t you more like Andrew Neil’,” he said. “I’m happy to be challenged. But then, [during the 2019 election campaign]Boris Johnson chose not to be interviewed by Andrew Neil. I remember people celebrating an interview in which Jeremy Paxman, I think the phrase used was ‘beat up’,a woman called Chloe Smith, a junior Treasury minister.“Actually, that’s the giveaway: somebody I had barely heard of – and I was a proper political journalist. The reason Jeremy had to rough up a junior Treasury minister is because other people wouldn’t come on. And Andrew’s brilliant, but Boris Johnson wouldn’t come on.”Robinson said his Political Thinking podcast, which offered longer, more conversational exchanges with politicians, was one way of adapting. The podcast is to be broadcast regularly on BBC Two at Friday lunchtimes, starting next week. The move reflects a wider trend in which podcasts morph into television, with popular shows viewed via streaming services.Podcasts have become increasingly influential in US politics.Donald Trump’s three-hour appearance on the Joe Rogan podcastbefore the US presidential election has now amassed 58m views on YouTube.Robinson said he had asked himself whether his more conversational format risked giving politicians a way to avoid the BBC’s flagship interview – the Today programme’s 8.10am slot. However, he said there was no evidence so far that they were dodging it.“Clearly, the danger that we’ve all got to be alert to is that, like Trump, you just choose your favoured partisan [outlet],” he said. “There are two dangers. Either you’ve got partisan people who literally just are your cheerleaders, or you’ve got creeps – they’re not necessarily your supporters, but they just want to be in with whoever’s in power.“I get abuse on Twitter: ‘You’re no – insert name of great interviewer.’ It’s not going to be the same again, fellas. The world has changed … What the BBC is trying to do, and I hope Political Thinking does, is to say we can learn from the fact that we’re in a competitive market in which politicians don’t have to appear – that they have stories to tell, but we’re not partisan, and we’re not creeps, and we will ask proper questions.”Robinson also denied there had been a falling out with his fellow Today presenter Emma Barnett, after reports that the pair had barely appeared alongside each other this year. “We all present with each other, and we will all present with each other from now on,” he said. “We all love each other!”Explore more on these topicsMediaPodcastsNick RobinsonRadioUS televisionBBCRadio 4newsShareReuse this content"

Layton was a valued and much-loved member of year 9, and he will be greatly missed by everyone. We extend our sincere condolences to Layton’s family and loved ones at this incredibly difficult time.“As a school, we will rally together to support one another through this tragedy. Anyone who wishes to pay their respects is invited to lay flowers at the fence in front of the bungalow in memory of Layton.”Fourteen children aged between 11 and 14 – of whom 11 were boys and three were girls – were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after the death of the teenager, Northumbria police said on Saturday.On Sunday evening a police spokesperson said the children had all been “released on police bail pending further inquiries”.At the entrance to the industrial park close to where Layton was found wellwishers left bouquets of flowers, card and tributes, reported Chronicle Live. One message read: “You were a sensitive soul with a kind heart. You will be deeply missed.” Another said: “Layton, thanks for brightening up our lives. You will be missed beyond words.”A GoFundMe crowdfunder set up by the best friend of the teenager’s mother has raised more than £8,000 towards the costs of his funeral.Police said they received reports of the fire shortly after 8pm on Friday at the industrial site on the southern banks of the River Tyne.A police spokesperson said: “Sadly, following searches carried out by Northumbria police and partners at Tyne and Wear fire and rescue service, a body believed to be that of 14-year-old Layton Carr was located deceased inside the building.“His next of kin have been informed and are currently being supported by specialist officers.”The spokesperson added: “Inquiries are at an early stage and members of the public are asked not to speculate online or in the community.”DCI Louise Jenkins of Northumbria police said: “This is an extremely tragic incident where a boy has sadly lost his life. Our thoughts are with Layton’s family as they begin to attempt to process the loss of their loved one.“Our specialist officers will continue to support them in whatever way they can. We ask that their privacy be respected at this time.”Jenkins said a cordon was in place while police carried out inquiries to establish “the full circumstances surrounding the incident”. She added that officers would be in the area to “offer reassurance to the public”.Anyone who has information that could help the investigation has been urged to contact Northumbria police by sending a direct message on social media or by using the “live chat” or “report” functions on theforce’s website.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Yeah, OK, let’s get that dog whistle out.”She apologised on Saturday, saying: “In the heat of a discussion on AQ [Any Questions], I would like to clarify that I regard issues of child exploitation and grooming with the utmost seriousness.“I’m sorry if this was unclear. I was challenging the political point scoring around it, not the issue itself. As a constituency MP, I’ve dealt with horrendous cases. This government is acting to get to the truth and deliver justice.”Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said on Sunday that everyone makes mistakes and it was time to move forward after Powell had said sorry for her lack of clarity.Asked if Powell’s job was safe, he told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News: “Yes. I think she’s made a genuine mistake. She’s owned up to it, she’s said sorry and we’ll move on.”Reform said Keir Starmer should consider whether Powell was still fit to serve in her job.Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, went further by calling on Powell to resign.“This shocking outburst from aLabourcabinet minister belittles the thousands of girls and women who were raped by grooming gangs over decades,” he said. “We have consistently called for a national inquiry in parliament, which has been blocked by Labour ministers who don’t seem to know or care about the disgusting crimes which have been perpetrated.“Anyone who has seen the shocking Channel 4 documentary will know that it is clearer than ever that this is not a ‘dog whistle’. To dismiss thousands of victims who were raped and the cover-up that followed is sickening. She should resign.”Does UK need another national inquiry into rape and sexual abuse gangs?Read moreThe Channel 4 documentary has led to renewed calls for an inquiry into the grooming gang scandal, which has led to accusations of failures in the police and social services.Starmer said on Wednesday there had already been an inquiry and its recommendations would be implemented. He told parliament that Labour was “delivering truth and justice for victims”.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsLucy PowellViolence against women and girlsReform UKLabourChild protectionChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Of those arrested, the nationality of the fifth was still being established.In a separate investigation, three Iranian nationals were detained in London on suspicion of being involved in threat activity on behalf of Iran, though police said the two sets of high-profile arrests were not linked.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, described the arrests as “two major operations” that reflected some of the biggest threats “we have seen in recent years” – and while she did not comment directly on whether the incidents were linked to the Iranian state, she noted “it involves Iranian nationals in both investigations”.Investigators from counter-terrorism police and the domestic security service, MI5, feared any planned attack might have taken place soon. Scotland Yard did not reveal the alleged target but it was understood to be in the UK.Three of those arrested were held in the Manchester area, with another arrested in west London and a fifth in Swindon. Hundreds of officers across the country were involved in the operation.Police on Sunday said they were still not sure any risk had been wholly contained, with detectives investigating whether the plot had overseas involvement.Scotland Yard said the five men in the first operation, including four Iranians, were being questioned under section 5 of the Terrorism Act on suspicion of planning an attack.Commander Dominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, said: “The investigation is still in its early stages and we are exploring various lines of inquiry to establish any potential motivation as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public linked to this matter.”Murphy urged the public to “remain vigilant” and alert the police if they saw anything suspicious.The nature of the plot was not publicly known but security services have warned about the growing threat from Iran-backed criminals.In the second operation, two Iranian nationals were arrested in north-west London and a third in west London on Saturday. They were arrested and detained under section 27 of the National Security Act 2023, which criminalises anybody involved in “foreign power threat activity”, in this case from Iran.View image in fullscreenA police forensic officer searches a house in Rochdale on Sunday.Photograph: Ryan Jenkinson/Getty ImagesKen McCallum, the head of MI5, said in October that Tehran was behind “plot after plot” in the UK and that it had uncovered five new planned attacks last year, taking the total since January 2022 to 20. Officers were giving their fullest attention to any increase in “Iranian state aggression in the UK”, he added.Footage verified by the Guardian showed armed military personnel storming a terraced property alongside specialist firearms officers in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, as they arrested a 40-year-old man.Marksmen carrying semi-automatic rifles and wearing helmets and body armour could be seen in the footage removing a partly clothed man from the building in handcuffs before ordering him to the ground.Another man, also an Iranian, was arrested by armed officers near a busy children’s play area in an affluent suburb of Stockport, leaving residents shaken.“It’s terrifying,” said Sarah Cash, 49, who was told by police she could not collect her son from the play area in Cheadle Heath where the arrest was conducted on Saturday evening.Cash said she was concerned about the alleged target of the attack – which police have not disclosed for operational reasons – and whether there was still any risk: “Where is that premises? There’s so many big things around here – there’s Manchester airport, the Co-op Arena.”Images from the scene showed a number of masked officers along the tree-lined street where the suspect was detained outside a £12,000-a-year preparatory school.In Rochdale, neighbours of the 40-year-old Iranian man who was arrested said they were “really terrified” as heavily armed officers swooped on the quiet terraced street shortly before 6pm on Saturday.Amy Openshaw, 36, said her five-year-old daughter was playing in their garden with her six- and nine-year-old nieces when they ran inside saying “masked men” had told them to get in the house.She said: “As a mum you think: what do you mean masked men in my garden? We heard a big bang. It sounded like a bomb had gone off – it was well loud. It ricocheted through the house.”Another neighbour, who lives three doors down, said she did not know the Iranian man but believed he lived in the house with three or four others.“It was really terrifying,” she said. “It’s a house that homes vulnerable people. You just see them coming and going all the time.”Of the moment police raided the property, she added: “I heard the bang but I felt the bang at the same time. I ran upstairs. I just saw a flood of people run past my window. There were people with guns pointing towards the end house.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

He first tried to enlist at 15, growing a moustache to look older, and was fatally wounded in Germany just two weeks before VE Day, having taken part in the liberation of the Netherlands.British Future describes the western allied forces as “remarkably diverse, including Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims from the 2.5-million-strong Indian army”, alongside 1 million personnel from Africa and tens of thousands from the Caribbean, with crucial involvement in significant battles, intelligence and medical aid.Last month, 10 second world war veterans, including former UK, Indian and US personnel, urged the public, in anopen letter released by the Together coalition, backed by public figures including former athlete and servicewoman Kelly Holmes and former chief scout and SAS trooper Bear Grylls, to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice, the “danger of authoritarianism and fascism” and “how it took all of us coming together across classes, religions, races and nations to prevail”.Before a7 May webinaron the importance of remembering second world war Commonwealth troops, the director of British Future, Sunder Katwala, said: “Getting that right can help broaden our national story and forge a more shared sense of identity.“We should step up efforts to raise awareness ... Nearly half of us (45%) don’t know about the Indian army’s role in WW2, when we’re talking about 2.5 million [people]. Moments like VE Day 80 are an opportunity for their stories to be heard.”The Department for Communities and the Department for Education have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSecond world warVE DayCommonwealth of NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

All three suffered minor injuries and have been discharged from hospital.A 49-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. Police said the collisions, which took place at about 2.30pm on Saturday, were not being treated as terrorism-related.John Webster, an assistant chief constable for GMP, said: “Firstly, our thoughts are with the family of the victim who has sadly lost their life in this tragic case. The actions of a single person have caused significant damage to the people of Rochdale.”Addressing online speculation about the driver’s identity and ethnicity, Webster said: “The suspect is a white male currently in custody and no further details can be released at this time.”He also stressed the collisions were unrelated to counter-terrorism activity in the area, after separate arrests were made in Rochdale on Saturday as part of a planned operation.Webster added. “This incident caused significant disruption yesterday and I thank the public for their cooperation and understanding while our officers conducted their inquiries. We are committed to this investigation and have significant resources dedicated to it.“To all those people affected by yesterday’s tragic events, community solidarity and unity is vital in times like these and especially for the families and friends of those impacted by this incident.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But we have to look at the demographics of our country. We cannot solve it with immigration.”She said trying to “fix” the problem of an ageing population with immigration “had not worked” when governments had tried it in the past.Her focus on the birthrate was challenged on the same programme byJustine Greening, a former Conservative education secretary, who said: “I heard Kemi talking about people having more children twice. We’ve got enough children. Let’s develop the ones we’ve got in our schools and look at how we can make sure gaps don’t open up in the education system as they already do.“There are some really practical questions facing the Conservative party and I think more fundamentally the question of what is the point of the Conservative party now. If we can’t find an answer to that I think we shouldn’t assume things won’t continue to get worse.”Badenoch’s position suggests she could develop policy solutions to encourage women to have more children. So far, since becoming leader last year, Badenoch has presented barely any policy, but she has said she wants to come up with honest solutions to long-term problems facing the country.Hungary’s rightwing populist government has exempted mothers from income tax, while in South Korea, new parents are paid a monthly stipend.The birthrate fell to its lowest level for many decades last year, with women in England and Wales having an average of 1.44 children between 2022 and 2023.Only 591,072 babies were born in 2023, fewer than in any year since 1977 and a fall of more than 14,000 on the previous year,figures from the Office for National Statisticsshowed.However, Badenoch has previously suggested that maternity pay has “gone too far” before backtracking on the remarks amid a backlash. In September last year,she said maternity pay is “excessive”and people should exercise “more personal responsibility”.During the leadership contest, she said she was fighting for the principle of the state doing less, as “the answer cannot be let the government help people to have babies”.She subsequently clarified her remarks, saying: “Contrary to what some have said, I clearly said the burden of regulation on businesses had gone too far … of course I believe in maternity pay!”Farage claims Reform UK local election gains ‘beginning of the end’ for ToriesRead moreAfter that, she said there were “things that we have to do to make sure that we make life comfortable for those people who are … starting families” and suggested that some people are scared to start families.Badenoch’s position on the birthrate appears to beshared by Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary and her leadership rival, who said last year: “We want to have a higher birthrate as a country. With an ageing society it is critically important.“There are lots of reasons we’re not unique as a country for that. It is across the western world. The things that government can do is improve childcare, and above all housing, because there’s a massive link between how late people eventually settle down and the ability to have kids.”Explore more on these topicsPopulationKemi BadenochConservativesJustine GreeningChildrenWomennewsShareReuse this content"

The titles includeNavigating ADHD in Men: Thriving with a Late Diagnosis,Men with Adult ADHD: Highly Effective Techniques for Mastering Focus, Time Management and Overcoming Anxietyand Men with Adult ADHD Diet & Fitness.Samples from eight books were examined for the Guardian by Originality.ai, a US company that detects content produced by artificial intelligence. The company said each had a rating of 100% on its AI detection score, meaning its systems were highly confident that the books were written by a chatbot.Experts said online marketplaces were a “wild west” owing to the lack of regulation around AI-produced work – and dangerous misinformation risked spreading as a result.Michael Cook, a computer science researcher at King’s College London, said generative AI systems were known to give dangerous advice, for example around ingesting toxic substances, mixing together dangerous chemicals or ignoring health guidelines.As such, it was “frustrating and depressing to see AI-authored books increasingly popping up on digital marketplaces” particularly on health and medical topics, which could result in misdiagnosis or worsen conditions, he said.“Generative AI systems like ChatGPT may have been trained on a lot of medical textbooks and articles, but they’ve also been trained on pseudoscience, conspiracy theories and fiction,” said Cook.“They also can’t be relied on to critically analyse or reliably reproduce the knowledge they’ve previously read – it’s not as simple as having the AI ‘remember’ things that they’ve seen in their training data. Generative AI systems should not be allowed to deal with sensitive or dangerous topics without the oversight of an expert,” he added.Yet Cook noted Amazon’s business model incentivised this type of practice, as it made “money every time” people bought a book, whether the work was “trustworthy or not”, while the generative AI companies that created the products were not held accountable.Prof Shannon Vallor, the director of the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Technomoral Futures, said Amazon had “an ethical responsibility to not knowingly facilitate harm to their customers and to society”, although it would be “absurd” to make a bookseller responsible for the contents of all its books.Problems were arising because the guardrails previously deployed in the publishing industry – such as reputational concerns and the vetting of authors and manuscripts – had been completely transformed by AI, she noted.This was compounded by a “wild west” regulatory environment in which there were no “meaningful consequences for those who enable harms”, fuelling a “race to the bottom”, Vallor said.At present, there is no legislation that requires AI-authored books to be labelled as such. Copyright law only applies if a specific author’s content has been reproduced, although Vallor noted that tort law should impose “basic duties of care and due diligence”.The Advertising Standards Agency said AI-authored books cannot be advertised to give a misleading impression that they were written by a human, enabling people who had seen such books to submit acomplaint.Richard Wordsworth was hoping to learn about his recent adult ADHD diagnosis when his father recommended a book he found on Amazon after searching “ADHD adult men”.When Wordsworth sat down to read it, “immediately, it sounded strange”, he said. The book opened with a quote from theconservative psychologist Jordan Petersenand then contained a string of random anecdotes, as well as historical inaccuracies.Some advice was actively harmful, Wordsworth observed.

High-profile artistsincluding Paul McCartneyand Tom Stoppard have backed a campaign against the changes.Kyle said: “We’re listening to the consultation and we are absolutely determined to get this right. We’re not going back to square one. We are moving forward.”“We can’t pretend we can outlaw training in other countries who have their own copyright law, but we can build a system which works in the United Kingdom. Some elements of the consultation haven’t even featured in the debate so far.”“We will be working hard to come up with practicable solutions to the very complex issue of how we enable both the creative industries and UK AI companies to flourish. We will report to parliament on issues of transparency and licensing and try to find some common ground on which we can agree.”Ministers have consulted on changing copyright law with the opt-out system as their “preferred option”, but government sources said Kyle was now looking more broadly at different proposals.The government is particularly interested in encouraging licensing agreements between AI companies and creators as a way of ensuring creators are paid for their content.But campaigners are concerned ministers could fall back on a free-for-all system instead of requiring AI companies to follow existing copyright law. Government officials saidthe law needed to changeto attract AI investment to the UK and give creators control over how their content was used in the future.Beeban Kidron, the cross-bench peer andprominent campaigner, said: “I am glad to hear that the government no longer sees an opt-out proposal as the preferred option but … for this change to be in any way meaningful it must include an unequivocal commitment from the government to protect copyright holders right now.”Next week MPs will vote on the data bill, which has been used by critics including Lady Kidron as a vehicle to derail the proposed opt-out system. On Thursday, Kyletabled amendments to the legislationintended to mollify critics by committing to an economic impact assessment of different potential changes, including the opt-out system and a licensing system.Ministers are braced for a political row over opposition amendments to the data bill. Both the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives are considering a ban on under-16s from social media, a cause which has previouslyattracted support from Labour MPs.The Tories are also drawing up an amendment seeking to record people’s sex at birth as part of digital verification processes, sources said. A Labour source described it as a “naked attempt to reopen a running sore” over sex and gender afterthe supreme court ruled last monththat the term “woman” was defined by biological sex.The data bill faces further hurdles when it returns to the upper chamber. Kidron will move to reinstate her copyright amendments and Tim Clement-Jones, the Lib Dem tech spokesperson in the Lords, said it was possible the bill could be struck down entirely. He said concessions on transparency, or requiring AI firms to reveal what copyright-protected content has been used to create their products, would have to be made.The government’s offer to carry out an economic impact assessment of copyright changes within 12 months of the data bill passing has also led to concerns that this could push the process to the end of Labour’s term in 2029.“The world is moving exceptionally fast, and the government is moving very slow,” said Owen Meredith, the chief executive of the News Media Association, whose members include the Guardian. “Delay means change to the underlying copyright framework could not materialise until the very tail-end of this parliament.”Kidron said a four-year delay to clarifying the AI copyright regime was a “completely inadequate timescale”. “The creative industries will be dead on their feet by then.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Peter KylePaul McCartneyTom StoppardIntellectual propertynewsShareReuse this content"

On Telegram, Netanyahu said Israel had acted against the Houthis in the past and would act again in the future.“It will not happen in one bang, but there will be many bangs,” he said.TheHouthis, who are backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack on Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport, and Israeli military confirmed that the missile was launched from Yemen.Local mediareportedthat Israeli and US defence systems had failed to down the missile, which left a deep crater in an open field on the perimeter of the airport, and that an investigation was under way.Most attacks from Yemen during the conflict in Gaza have been intercepted by Israel’s missile defence systems, apart froma drone strike that hit Tel Avivlast July. Sunday’s missile strike sent a plume of smoke into the air, caused panic among passengers in the terminal building and led to air traffic being suspended for an hour.European and US carriers have cancelled flights for the next few days. Many had only recently begun to resume services toIsraelafter the Gaza ceasefire, which temporarily paused hostilities between mid-January and mid-March. This followed their suspension of flights for much of the last year and a half.The missile attack came hours before Israel’s security cabinet was due to vote on plans to expand the fighting in Gaza with a new offensive.Military officials confirmed on Sunday that tens of thousands of reservists had been called up, though it was unclear when any new operations would be launched.The aim of the offensive would be to put pressure on Hamas to release hostages it continues to hold in Gaza; to further degrade the militant Islamist group’s military capabilities; and to “seize ground” that would be used as leverage in future negotiations, officials said.Hardliners in the Israeli cabinet have been pushing for a broad offensive in Gaza for many months.Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister, told Israeli Army Radio he wanted to see a “powerful” expansion of the war, but did not disclose details as to what the new plans would entail.“We need to increase the intensity and continue until we achieve total victory. We must win a total victory,” he said. Ben-Gvir demanded that Israel bomb “the food and electricity supplies” in Gaza.Two months ago, Israel imposed a tight blockade of Gaza, stopping all food, medicine, fuel and other items entering the devastated territory. Israel’s military is making preparations for new orders to allow aid in, but only under strict conditions. Israeli officials accuse Hamas of diverting humanitarian assistance to fund its military operations. Hamas denies the charge.View image in fullscreenThe ballistic missile struck near the airport, where air traffic to and from the US and Europe has been temporarily halted.Photograph: Amir Levy/Getty ImagesIsraeli airstrikes have continued daily across Gaza. At least seven Palestinians including two parents and their two children, two and four, were killed in southern and central Gaza on Sunday, Palestinian medics said.Israel’s military said on Sunday that two soldiers were killed in combat in the territory, bringing the number of Israeli troops killed since fighting resumed in March to six.The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 250 hostages. Israel says 59 hostages remain in Gaza, although roughly 35 of them are said to be dead.The Israeli offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians. The fighting has displaced more than 90% of its population, often multiple times. Hunger has been widespread and the shortage of food has set off looting.The attacks by the Houthis, who control swathes ofYemen, underline the regional dimension of the conflict in Gaza. The Iran-backed militia began targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping in late 2023, claiming it was acting out of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel deployed warplanes on three big air raids last year after Houthi missile attacks. The strikes targeted power stations, port facilities, the airport in Sana’a and “military infrastructure”.The US president, Donald Trump, in March ordered large-scale strikes against the Houthis to reduce their capabilities and deter them from targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea.The Houthis’ military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said on Sunday that the missile strike meant Israel’s main airport was “no longer safe for air travel”.The Israel Airports Authority (IAA) said the attack marked the first time a missile had fallen so close to Ben Gurion airport’s terminal and the runways. Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said it had treated at least six people with light to moderate injuries.Lufthansa Group, which includes the airlines Lufthansa, Swiss, Brussels and Austrian, said it had halted flights to and from Tel Aviv through to Tuesday because of the situation. ITA Airways said it had cancelled flights from Italy to Israel through to Wednesday, while Air France cancelled flights on Sunday, saying customers were being transferred to flights on Monday.Ryanair suspended flights on Sunday but flights were still scheduled for Monday, according to the IAA.Explore more on these topicsIsraelHouthisIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaYemennewsShareReuse this content"

The former CIA director William Burns has said there was a real risk in late 2022 that Russia could use nuclear weapons against Ukraine.In autumn 2022, the US was so concerned about the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia that it warned Putin over the consequences of using such weapons, Burns has said. At the same time, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping also warned Putin not to resort to nuclear weapons.Putin signed a revamped version of Russia’s nuclear doctrine in November 2024, spelling out the circumstances that allow him to use Moscow’s atomic arsenal, the world’s largest. That version lowered the bar, giving him the option of using nuclear weapons in response to even a conventional attack backed by a nuclear power.The US president,Donald Trump, has said he wants to end the conflict via diplomatic means, raising the question of whether Putin was willing to negotiate a peace settlement. But the Kremlin has rejected calls by Kyiv and Washington for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.Putin, in February 2022, ordered tens of thousands of Russian troops toinvade Ukraine. Moscow’s forces now control about 20% of Ukraine, including parts of the south and east.In the carefully choreographed state television film, Putin was shown in his private Kremlin kitchen offering chocolates and a fermented Russian milk drink to the Kremlin correspondent, Pavel Zarubin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had been held for more than two days.One of the man’s fingers had been chopped off and investigators feared further mutilations could have happened if he had not been rescued.The man, who has not been publicly identified, was abducted in broad daylight at 10.30am on Thursday morning as he walked down a street in Paris’s 14th arrondissement. Four men in ski masks forced him into a delivery van.He was freed by armed police in a raid at 9pm on Saturday night from a house 20km (12 miles) south of Paris, in the Essonne area. Five suspects in their 20s were arrested at the house.The state prosecutor said in a statement: “The victim appears to be the father of a man who made his fortune in cryptocurrencies, with the crime involving a ransom demand.”The victim’s wife told investigators that her husband and wealthy son, who both owned a crypto marketing firm in Malta, had received threats in the past, a police source said.Le Parisienreported that the attackers had demanded a ransom of €5-7m (£4-6m), which was not paid. The five kidnapping suspects, aged between 20 and 27, were still being questioned by police on Sunday.The kidnapping is the latest in a series of abductions of cryptocurrency figures inFranceand neighbouring countries.David Balland, the co-founder of the crypto firm Ledger, which is valued at more than $1bn , was abducted with his partner on 21 January at their home in Méreau, near Bourges in central France. He also had a finger cut off.The attackers arrived at Balland’s house in the early hours of the morning, taking him and his partner and separating them. Balland was taken to a house in the town of Châteauroux, where one of his fingers was cut off.Police were contacted by Balland’s business partner who received a video of the finger alongside a demand for a large ransom in cryptocurrency, of around €10m. Balland was freed in a police raid soon after. His partner was found tied up in the boot of a car in a carpark in the Essonne area south of Paris the next day.Nine suspects are under criminal investigation in that case, including the alleged ringleader, 26, who has a police record for a previous kidnapping.In December 2024, the 56-year-old father of a French cryptocurrency influencer based in Dubai, was the target of an alleged kidnapping in eastern France, local media reported. Attackers arrived at the man’s home, tied up his wife and daughter and forced him into a car.The man’s influencer son received a ransom demand and contacted police. The two women were then quickly freed. The father was only discovered 24 hours later in the boot of a car in Normandy, tied up and showing signs of physical violence, having been sprinkled with petrol.Other abductions of cryptocurrency figures or their partners were reported in Spain andBelgiumin the past five months.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeCryptocurrenciesBelgiumnewsShareReuse this content"

I will give it away eventually. The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine.”Buffett made the announcement at the end of a five-hour question-and-answer session, and did not take any queries about his retirement plans. The only board members who knew about the announcement in advance were his children, Howard and Susie Buffett, he said. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, was unaware, but stood to join the crowd in applauding his boss.Abel, 62, who was born in Alberta, Canada, has been Buffett’s designated successor as CEO since 2001. He is a 25-year Berkshire veteran and already manages all of the conglomerate’s non-insurance businesses including dozens of fossil energy, chemical, real estate and retail operations.The JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said Buffett represented “everything that is good about American capitalism and America itself – investing in the growth of our nation and its businesses with integrity, optimism and common sense”.He said: “I’ve learned so much from him to this very day, and I am honoured to call him a friend.”Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said in a statement that there had never been anyone like Buffett, and that countless people, himself included, had been “inspired by his wisdom”.Cook said: “It’s been one of the great privileges of my life to know him. And there’s no question that Warren is leaving Berkshire in great hands with Greg.”Buffett has led the Omaha-based company since 1965, and is credited by many with transforming Berkshire from a flailing textiles manufacturer into a $1.03tn (£776bn) conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy and other sectors. He built the conglomerate alongside his adviser and vice-chairman, Charlie Munger, whodied aged 99 in 2023.Buffett will be ending his career on a high. Berkshire Hathaway class-A shares, the type held by Buffett himself and his earliest investors, have risen by about 20% in the year to date. In the past five years they have more than tripled in value, and closed at a record high on Friday.For decades, thousands of investors have descended upon Omaha to attend Berkshire Hathaway’s annual general meeting.Buffett, a longtime Democratic mover and shaker, did not endorse Kamala Harris in 2024 or Joe Biden in 2020. He had previously endorsed Barack Obama twice and Hillary Clinton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to Forbes, Buffett has a net worth of $168.2bn.Earlier on Saturday, Buffett warned about the dire global consequences of Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors gathered at the annual meeting that “there’s no question that trade can be an act of war”.Buffett said Trump’s trade policies had raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world. He said: “It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done.“We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best.”In February, Berkshire reported athird straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44bn, in 2024. It is unclear what impact Trump’s tariffs will have on Berkshire’s 189 operating businesses and shareholder profits.Buffett was a student of Benjamin Graham, a British-born American economist known as the “father of value investing”, at Columbia Business School in the early 1950s. In the following decades Buffett developed a highly successful investment style, revered for its practical approach to stock-picking.He is now regarded by many as the best investor in the world. The market value of Berkshire Hathaway’s shares has grown by an annualised 19.9% a year from 1965 to 2024, according to the company. That is almost double the blue chip S&P 500 index over the same period, which has delivered a 10.4% return, including dividends.Nevertheless, Buffett has faced his share of controversies including anti-trust investigations and criticism from fire victimsafter Berkshire’s PacifiCorp utilityfailed to shut off power lines during a Labor Day weekend windstorm in 2020, leading to deadly wildfires spreading in Oregon and northern California.Speaking before the retirement bombshell, Abel said that “keeping the lights on” was no longer a priority for the conglomerate’s utilities when the threat of wildfires became excessive. He said: “It’s around protecting the general public and being sure the fire doesn’t spread further.”Explore more on these topicsWarren BuffettNebraskanewsShareReuse this content"

They have fallen by more than 30% in the past 12 months as a turnaround plan under the chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, has failed to inspire investors and oil prices have fallen.Shell may also wait for BP to reach out for another possible suitor to make the first move, those familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Deliberations are allegedly still in the early stages, and Shell could decide to focus on share buybacks and smaller acquisitions rather than such a big merger, according to the report.The combination of Britain’s biggest oil companies would be one of the largest deals ever in the sector. Shell’s market value of £145.6bn is more than double that of BP, at £55.9bn.A spokesperson for Shell told the Guardian: “As we have said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.”A spokesperson for BP declined to comment.In February, Auchincloss promised to “fundamentally reset” BP’s strategy, with the changes expected to include a watering down of its climate commitments and the pursuit of new fossil fuel projects in an attempt to bolster its market value.The company’s profitsdropped by almost 50%in the first three months of this year to $1.4bn (£1bn), down from $2.7bn in the same period last year. Its flagging share price has also made the company a target for the New York hedge fund Elliott Management.The shares have lagged behind other oil and gas firms in recent years after its former chief executive Bernard Looney set BP on course to become a net zero energy company.

He’s got a gun! On your right! On your right!”. The blurry and unclear footage then shows Hinton emerging from between two dumpsters, and another officer fires multiple shots, killing Hinton.A gun was later recovered. It had not been fired.When Hinton’s family viewed the footage at a meeting with police, they became distraught, especially the young man’s father.“Ryan Hinton’s family, including Ryan’s father, was present at the meeting and they were understandably distraught as they watched the bodycam video,” a statement from the family’s lawyers said. “After the meeting with the police department, Ryan Hinton’s father left in his own vehicle and that was the last we heard from him until learning about the tragic incident involving a law enforcement officer who was working a traffic detail near the University of Cincinnati.”Thatincident happenedon Friday afternoon when a police officer – who has not yet been named publicly – was hit by a car as he directed traffic at an intersection.Police identified the driver of that vehicle as the teen’s 38-year-old father, Rodney Hinton. He was later charged with aggravated murder. The slain police officer was not believed to have been involved with the killing of Ryan Hinton.“This is a horrific tragedy on both sides … This family lost their son, and this police officer lost his life,” Michael Wright, the Hinton family attorney, told theCincinnati Enquirer.Explore more on these topicsOhioUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

An Élysée official said: “We are a space where there is freedom of research and no taboo topics.” The official said the event was about “affirmingFranceand Europe as stable spaces that can guarantee freedoms and academic research”.France is thought to be particularly keen to attract scientists working on health – particularly infectious diseases – as well as climate research and artificial intelligence.Monday’s event, titled Choose Europe for science, comes after 13 European countries, including France, Germany and Spain, wrote to the European Commission urging it to move fast to attract academic talent.France launched its ownChoose France for scienceinitiative in April with a dedicated platform for applications to host international researchers.The French research ministry told Agence France-Presse: “Some foreign researchers have already arrived in France to familiarise themselves with the infrastructure, waiting for the funds and platform to be set up.”In recent days, France’s flagship scientific research centre CNRS launched a new initiative to attract foreign workers whose research is threatened, as well as French researchers working abroad, some of whom “don’t want to live and raise their children in Trump’s United States”, its president, Antoine Petit, told AFP.In France, Aix-Marseille University launched its “Safe place for science” programme in March. It will receive its first foreign researchers in June.In a letter to French universities in March, Philippe Baptiste, France’s minister for higher education and research, wrote: “Many well-known researchers are already questioning their future in the United States. We would naturally wish to welcome a certain number of them.”Challenges remain because research investment in the US – including private-public partnerships – has for many years been greater than in Europe. For decades, Europe has lagged behind the US on investment in universities and research centres.French researchers have regularly raised the issue of the comparatively low salaries and precarious contracts for many researchers in France. On average, an academic researcher in the US is paid more than their French equivalent. Trade unions in France have called for better contracts, better salary provisions and better funding across the board at research institutions.Some in France hoped the pay gap between scientists in France and the US would narrow, once the lower cost of education and health, and more generous social benefits in France were taken into account.Germany’s incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said last month: “The American government is currently using brute force against the universities in the US, so that researchers from America are now contacting Europe. This is a huge opportunity for us.”Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropean UnionEmmanuel MacronUrsula von der LeyenAcademicsEuropeTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of Dickson, had intermittently flirted with Trump-style politics, as did the shadow minister Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, whosemid-campaign call to “make Australia great again”was seen as a decisive moment by some in the Labor government.2:25Australian federal election 2025 recap: Albanese wins, Dutton concedes, Greens in the air – videoAlbanese promised that Labor would be “a disciplined, orderly government” in its second term. TreasurerJim Chalmerssaid the government would use its increased parliamentary majority to address challenges in housing, the renewable energy transition and boosting economic productivity, and in emerging technological issues including artificial intelligence.The work for Labor began immediately after Saturday night’sthumping win, with Albanese heading back to Canberra after a celebratory coffee and pastry in his Sydney electorate, and Chalmers receiving briefings from the Treasury early on Sunday.The makeup of the Senate is still to be confirmed but Albanese is likely to enjoy one of the most progressive parliaments in Australian history. The ALP national president, Wayne Swan, said it was an opportunity for Albanese to “further reshape our nation as a prosperous, egalitarian and forward-looking society”, with some in Labor already thinking the size of the win and thedecimation of the Liberal partyas being an opening to lock down the Treasury benches for many years to come.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter“We’re not getting carried away with it,” Albanese said in Leichhardt on Sunday morning. “We’ve got a big job to do. We thank the Australian people for having faith in us.“I think we’ve been a good government but we’ve got a good, positive agenda, and that’s what Australian people voted for yesterday.”The Australian Electoral Commission has Labor leading in 73 seats, with a further nine likely, and about 20 still in play. The ABC has called 85 seats for Labor, with 18 still in doubt. Labor could end up with 90 or more, with the Coalition reduced to the low 40s.The prime minister, in his victory speech on Saturday night, raised workers’ rights, housing, gender equality, childcare, the NDIS and Indigenous reconciliation as the priorities of his second-term government.“We will be a disciplined, orderly government in our second term as we have been in our first.”Australians have soundly rejected Trump-style culture wars. Now Albanese must act with courage and vision | Julianne SchultzRead moreOn Sunday morning Albanese visited Bar Italia, a cafe in his Grayndler electorate, in Sydney’s inner west, to have breakfast with a small group of supporters and friends. Joined by the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, and the MP Jerome Laxale, who turned Bennelong from notionally Liberal seat to a safe Labor seat with a 60-40 margin, Albanese posed for selfies with other cafe patrons and scooped gelato into cones and cups for a few customers.He told one patron that the election result was “humbling”, then joked that Labor had “scooped up more than a few” seats.Chalmers said the election result was “beyond even our most optimistic expectations”, pointing to unexpected seats like Petrie now likely to fall Labor’s way. On the ABC’s Insiders, the treasurer said Labor needed to approach its second term with “humility”, pointing to challenges including the cost of living and housing crisis.“We know that this second term has been given to us by the Australian people because they want stability in uncertain times, and not because they think we’ve solved every challenge in our economy or in our society more broadly, but because we’re better-placed to work towards solving some of those challenges,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve got to get this energy transformation right. We’ve got to do more to embrace technology, particularly the AI opportunity. There’s a huge agenda there for us.”Chalmers said he had received a briefing from the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, at 6.45am and pointed to boosting productivity in the economy as the major objective of his next few years.“The first term was primarily inflation without forgetting productivity,” he said. “The second term will be primarily productivity without forgetting inflation … And a much broader sense of [productivity].“Human capital. Competition policy. Technology. Energy. The care economy. These are where we’re going to find the productivity gains – and not quickly, but over the medium term.”‘The chicken ain’t squawking’: the best quotes of Australian election night 2025Read moreThe scale of Labor’s victory was not publicly foreshadowed by any in the government; indeed, numerous Labor sources told Guardian Australia that several seats, including Hughes and Moore, had not been on their radar. Another critical question ishow the Liberal party will rebuildafter its moderate wing was all but wiped out, with the party now having little representation in Australia’s major cities.Swan, who was the treasurer under Kevin Rudd, called the result a “generational opportunity” for Labor and a “a moment to rejuvenate our party” with a more diverse grassroots membership.“We need to capitalise by bringing more Australians – especially working Australians – into the ranks of our great party,” he said. “Because the surest way to safeguard Labor’s achievements and its future work is to build an even stronger party, with deeper grassroots.“Our Tory opponents are in a withered state but they will reorganise and return. Perhaps in even darker guise than we saw this election. We need to be ready for that.“We must build a larger and more representative membership that can campaign throughout the cycle, not just at election time.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Anthony AlbaneseAustralian politicsLiberal partyLabor partyJim ChalmersWayne SwannewsShareReuse this content"

Fans were told to stay around for a secret act in addition to him and Nesbitt.The BBC reported that Walker said: “When Lewis confirmed he wanted to do it last minute, I was delighted. We’ve bumped into each other a few times over the years backstage at fezzys [festivals] and events, and he’s a total legend.“I know how much pressure this industry can put on artists at times, especially after a bit of a break.”The gig on Friday was the first of three phone-free scheduled charity shows, with another planned for Tuesday 6 May, at Albert Halls in Stirling and the final one due to take place on 10 May at Glasgow Old Fruitmarket. Fans were asked not to film any of the gig, with their phones placed in sealed pouches throughout it.Capaldi, from Bathgate, West Lothian, had his Glastonbury 2023 show disrupted by his vocal tics. He has previously raised funds for Calm, playing a virtual acoustic concert in 2020 to support the charity.In 2023, the singer explored how the pressures of fame have affected him mentally and physically in the Netflix documentary Lewis Capaldi: How I’m Feeling Now.“For [Capaldi] to be able to play a little secret gig in a safe space without all the phones, the noise and the expectations was perfect,” Walker said. “I’m buzzing to have been a part of it.”Explore more on these topicsLewis CapaldinewsShareReuse this content"

The turnout toppedMadonna’s free mega-showlast year, which drew 1.6 million to the Brazilian city’s shores.It was a moment of unadulterated joy for Brazil’s particularly dedicated fans, many of whom are too young to have seen Gaga during her last performance in the country 13 years ago. Anticipation was even higher as Gaga had cancelled a planned appearance in 2017 for medical reasons.View image in fullscreenThe atmosphere among the crowd was part-frenzy, part-reverence.Photograph: Bruna Prado/AP“She came,” the ecstatic crowd chanted as Gaga appeared on stage shortly after 10pm local time. The staunchestmonstrinhosarrived before dawn and spent the day under the blazing sunshine to secure a spot near the stage.“I’ve been waiting for this for 15 years,” said Ana Clara Salomão, a 26-year-old designer from São Paulo and self-professed Little Monster since the age of 11.“There are no words to describe my levels of excitement, the joy that this is. It’s surreal,” she added, hiding behind a black veil and bugeye sunglasses.People poured into Rio from all over Brazil and South America for the show, part of a series of promotional concerts the pop star is putting on before her next tour, The Mayhem Ball.View image in fullscreenThe show was the biggest yet of Lady Gaga’s career.Photograph: Pilar Olivares/Reuters“I’ve been preparing the trip for months,” said Betina Faundes, a 40-year-old shopkeeper from Chile whose 18-year-old daughter Barbara Marin is a lifelong fan. “Gaga is life,” said Marin, who has tattoos referencing the artist’s songs inked on her forearms. “It’s like a religious thing.”The atmosphere was part-frenzy, part-reverence during Gaga’s five-act “gothic opera”, which saw her cycle through herCoachellaset list, interspersing tracks from her latest album, Mayhem, with hits from her early electro-dance pop years such as Paparazzi and Poker Face.Nods to her Brazilian audience included a chorus of dancers wearing the country’s canary-yellow football shirt during How Bad Do U Want Me and an interpreter translating her emotional speech into Portuguese.View image in fullscreenThe turnout topped Madonna’s free show last year, which drew 1.6 million people to the beach.Photograph: Andre Coelho/EPA“Thank you for making history with me,” the 39-year-old told the adoring crowd. “The people of Brazil are the reason why I can shine.”On Sunday, Rio’s civil police said they had thwarted a bomb attack planned for the concert, which would have targeted children, teenagers and LGBTQ+ members of the audience. ‘Operation Fake Monster’ identified suspects who promoted hate speech and the violent radicalisation of teenagers online and were recruiting participants, including minors, to carry out coordinated attacks using improvised explosives, the police said ina statement. Two people have been detained.Little Monsters wearing extravagant outfits in homage to Gaga had overrun Rio in the days leading up to Saturday, infusing the city with an out-of-season carnival atmosphere. Hundreds of fans held vigil outside the Copacabana Palace Hotel, where the singer had been staying since Tuesday, singing her latest songs at the top of their lungs and revelling in a shared sense of community.“Gaga helped me climb out of a deep hole, so she’s very, very, very important in my life,” said Bella Donna, a 20-year-old drag queen from southern Brazil. “She’s fought hard and continues to fight today for the [LGBTQ+] cause, embracing people and making them understand that there’s no problem in being gay, lesbian, transgender or whatever, the world has to welcome us and respect us.”When Lady Gaga started singing the LGBTQ+ anthem Born This Way, thousands of spectators held up rainbow-coloured fans, slicing them through the air in time to the music with a sharp snapping sound.View image in fullscreenFans waved rainbow-coloured fans during the song Born This Way.Photograph: Bruna Prado/APFor Karolayne Araújo, Gaga’s universal appeal is what makes her so popular. “She manages to connect with everybody, she sings for everybody and embraces everybody,” said the 21-year-old student, who spent more than two hours on public transport to reach Copacabana from Rio’s working-class West Zone.Although more affluent spectators watching the show from brightly lit beachside apartments served as a reminder of Brazil’s deep inequality, the free nature of the concert made it accessible to many who would otherwise never have the opportunity of seeing the superstar live.“The fact that she’s playing for free is a dream come true,” said 19-year-old student Hugo Monteiro, who was sporting a pink cowboy hat. “To have an affordable show, for everyone to be able to feel the emotion of seeing Gaga live, makes it all the more beautiful.”View image in fullscreenMany ‘Little Monsters’ arrived before dawn to get a good spot near the stage.Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty ImagesThe concert, which city authorities expect will have injected 600m reais (£80m) into the local economy, is part of a project through which Rio plans to host a free music show of epic proportions every May for the next four years.Madonna and Lady Gaga – whose climactic Bad Romance finale ended with heart-shaped fireworks exploding overhead – will be tough acts to follow. But for Monteiro, “there is no better place in the world to host free concerts”, because “we put on a show with the artist”.Explore more on these topicsLady GagaBrazilLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

McCartney has made a big splash, online and on stage, charting the millennial woman’s journey from mindless nights on Mad Dog 2020 to motherhood and beyond. There may be something ruthless about her zeroing in on the generic at the expense of anything remotely particular. But there’s a skill even to this brand of crowd-tickling observational comedy, and the Liverpudlian has it in spades.We’re firmly in the familiar standup territory of (in McCartney’s words) “too old to be young, too young to be old”. It’s all nostalgia for her generation’s wild youth, and alarm at the inadequacy of their successors. (“We wouldn’t have gone out in trainers in the noughties, would we?!”) McCartney presents herself as a superficial twentysomething trapped in a mum’s body, dispensing reckless sex education to her 12-year-old son, and embarrassing herself on a middle-aged “girls’ trip” to Magaluf.Little in that latter anecdote is convincing; rare is the ring of specific truth. I’m inclined to agree when at one point McCartney says, “I feel like I should have something profound to say” about her stage in life. But if profundity is in short supply, at least, in this celebration of received thinking about randy husbands and women regretting their wrinkles, she makes the familiar shine. One routine about squirting during orgasms (“like a highly pressurised Calpol syringe” – nice) devolves into a gossip with audience members deftly orchestrated by our host for maximum mirth. Another witheringly dismantles the idea that a kick in the testicles is as painful as childbirth.

Director Sean Holmes’s high concept production might have been preposterous and, initially, the idea speaks louder than the play, but by turns it woos, bewitches and becomes irresistible.Romeo (Rawaed Asde) and his brawling compatriots wear holsters while Tybalt (Calum Callaghan) is referred to as something of a lone ranger. There is a blood-smear – as visual foreshadowing – at the back of Paul Wills’s incredibly handsome clapboard set, which has a Shaker-like simplicity: three swinging saloon-bar doors and an upstairs window which opens to a band of musicians that includes a harmonica and banjo player.More outlandishly, there are clear comic elements, with a light, funny lilt to many of the lines. Juliet’s nurse (Jamie-Rose Monk) is like a rambunctious Wife of Bath; Paris (Joe Reynolds) is like a musical hall clown and Benvolio (Roman Asde) wears a Chaplinesque hat.View image in fullscreenLola Shalam (Juliet) and Rawaed Asde (Romeo) in Romeo and Juliet.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianJuliet (Lola Shalam) looks like Calamity Jane and speaks like a bored teenager, in an emphatically stolid, London twang. Yet her broadness works, alongside the inner steel she shows to have later on.The comic bonhomie feels ungrounding at first but its heartiness does not grate against the central tragedy. Juliet turns giggly with Romeo and their relationship is sweet, callow, bearing the single-minded ardour of young love.It seems flagrantly to be a crowd-pleasing production with aims to reach a young audience but that mission does not undermine the text or patronise its older audience. And the frontier backdrop fits surprisingly well into Shakespeare’s fractious Verona. The masked ball features period line-dancing, there is tension to the brawls and shootouts, as daggers are drawn from the hip, as well as pistols.It is not without its flaws: some actors declaim lines, flattening away the nuance. Rawaed Asde as Romeo certainly brings intensity but every line is spoken in the same determined tone, so that he seems perpetually incensed. Mercutio is over-animated too, albeit entertainingly playing to the audience.It is also long – far closer to three hours than the two stated in the text. And yet you can’t begrudge it. The last hour is immaculate in its execution. The dead rise, eerily, and sometimes speak. The ghost of Mercutio delivers news of Juliet’s death to Romeo here. The final act is stark for all the earlier laughter. For a while it stands in the balance but, ultimately, here is a rare production where high concept meets high-class execution.At Shakespeare’s Globe, London, until 2 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreRomeo and JulietShakespeare's GlobereviewsShareReuse this content"

Not entirely. In fact, there’s a lot more to creating a successful small space than that.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When looking at a room, don’t just think about the floor plan; consider it as a three-dimensional space and ask yourself: what can be hung from the ceiling? What can be wall mounted? How many hooks could I put on the back of that door? Find the perfect skinny shelves to fit in that gap behind the door and suddenly you’ve freed up a lot of space in the rest of the room.We asked interior designers and architects for their tips and products for making small spaces work harder and feel bigger than they are.How to make the most of small spacesSide tablesView image in fullscreenFermobAlizé end table£239 at Fermob“Occasional” furniture is too much of a luxury for small spaces, where each piece has to earn its keep. Look for side tables that double as stools for squeezing extra guests around the table, or ones that conceal generous storage. I’ve used a wicker laundry basket fromZara Homeas a side table, with a circular Ikea tray on top (it’s also great for stashing away toys at the end of the day). Mine are no longer in stock, but you just need to match the diameters of each, or you could try thisH&M basketon its own with the lid inverted. Also think about pieces that can double as outdoor furniture. Designer Hannah Campbell ofCampbell & Cottrillrecommends Fermob for small, lightweight tables: “We recently supplied one of these for a client with a balcony, and it’s been used inside all winter as an extra side table.”Hideaway desksView image in fullscreenLa RedouteMathéo hideaway cabinet desk£819.99 at La Redoute£820 at NextThere are lots of great occasional desks, from vintage bureaus sourced secondhand, to foldaway and wall-mounted designs (Wayfairdoes a hideaway version with a top shelf that squeezes in another element of storage). Then there’s this striking design from La Redoute, which is on the expensive side but so functional it’s almost like buying another room – and it looks great even when tidied away for the weekend.Overdoor caddiesView image in fullscreenOverdoor oak caddy£65 at Futon CompanyMake the most of the backs of doors by adding hooks – for everything from coats to tomorrow’s work outfit (I’ve usedH&M onesfor years). They can also accommodate tote bags full of hard-to-store occasional stuff. Better still, get an overdoor caddy like this clean-lined oak version from the Futon Company.Rechargeable lightsView image in fullscreenMushroom wall light£48 at John LewisIn the past few years, rechargeable lights have become a mainstay. They work brilliantly in spaces where wiring is hard to access or looks ugly. Campbell recommends Pooky’sScoontable lamp, Fermob’sBaladlamps and Fatboy’sBollekelamps. Rechargeables are also perfect for by the bed, eliminating clutter. This simple design from John Lewis is dimmable and comes in eight colours and finishes.Hanging basketsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Derek RidgersBayonne triple hanging basket£28 at Futon CompanyDon’t forget the ceiling. Free up surface space by placing indoor plants in clusters of macrame hangers –Etsyis great for these – or place plant pots and drip trays in a triple hanging basket. They are also a great way to keep cuddly toy collections close to a child’s bed.Storage seatingView image in fullscreenStorage 02From £449 at SwyftEdward Martin ofDelve Architectsrecommends incorporating a built-in dining bench in kitchens wherever possible: “As well as seating, they provide storage underneath, through pull-out drawers or a liftable lid. When the dining table is not in use, it can be pushed in close to the bench, providing more floor space.” Meanwhile, Campbell is a fan of ottomans in smaller living rooms and bedrooms, like this velvet one from Swyft, which comes in eight colours.Kitchen storageView image in fullscreenAnydayLaguna shelving unit£129 at John LewisView image in fullscreenVodka table£179 at Futon CompanyThere are many ways to boost storage in the kitchen. “If space is tight, a plate rack over the sink is a two-for-one move allowing plates to drip dry,” says interior designerJill Macnair. Dunelm’s practicalcorner storage rackmaximises space on a small worktop. If gadgets are taking over your surfaces, look for stacking storage – Debenhams does athree-tier kitchen organiser. For something bespoke,Lugnahas a great shelving range for tight spaces that would work well in the kitchen.Flexible shelvesView image in fullscreenWall-mounted shelves are an obvious go-to in smaller spaces. Macnair suggests using overlooked spaces in halls and corridors and above doors. “Ideally, run the shelf wall-to-wall in a nice wood or MDF painted the same colour as your walls,” she says. For a shelving system, Martin says: “Nothing beatsVitsoe’s 606 hanging system. It keeps storage off the floor to create the illusion of space. You can customise them to create study areas, bookshelves or closed storage.”If you’re on a budget, most shop-fitting suppliers sell similar customisable ranges, for example,Trade Systems.Statement mirrorView image in fullscreenIrregular rattan wall mirror£199.99 at Zara HomeMirrors are a small spaces cliche for a reason, but they can be used in unexpected ways. In itsFortyfourhouse project, architecture studioFardaaused mirrors as unobtrusive fronts for kitchen cabinets, positioned above head height to create extra storage. They also work well as plinths in kitchens and bathrooms to give a floating effect that makes rooms feel bigger. Or keep it simple with a statement piece. “A large-scale wall mirror will create a brighter, more open feel, enhancing the sense of space,” says interior designer Antonia Winkler von Stiernhielm ofStudio Anton.Ottoman bedView image in fullscreenPrimrose ottoman double bed£1,495 at Button & SprungView image in fullscreenChadwell ottoman double bed£300 at ArgosI recently bought my first one of these – beds with storage underneath – and experienced a “where have you been all my life?” moment. They are much easier to access than I imagined and store A LOT – bedding, books, out-of-season clothes, luggage. “I frequently recommend Ottoman beds for clients’ spare rooms, where space is at a premium,” saysWinkler von Stiernhielm. Adding a valance can soften their aesthetic, she says.Floating bedside tablesView image in fullscreenJimi wall-mounted bedside table£169.99 at La RedouteWall-mounted “floating” furniture is a brilliant way to free up floor space and boost the sense of flow in a room. There are lots of great floating nightstands, so think about your bedside storage needs. Look for designs that feature a drawer for clutter and a shelf for books.Drop-leaf tablesView image in fullscreenDanderyddrop-leaf dining table£199 at IkeaThese designs typically transform from a console table to space for dinner à deux – or more if you open both leaves. They were a mainstay of the postwar kitchen, and it is still easy to source vintage versions on Facebook Marketplace, eBay or local forums (it’s much harder to find new versions). Melamine finishes have a cheery, nostalgic feel; also look for versions with a built-in drawer or cupboard.Explore more on these topicsInteriorsThe FilterHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And the fraudsters are not always posing as children – sometimes they pretend to be friends, and sometimes they claim to be parents.Data from Santander show that among customers of the bank, fraudsters pretending to be someone’s son were the most successful, followed by daughters, then mothers.Chris Ainsley, the bank’s head of fraud risk management, says the scams are evolving at “breakneck speed”.

At the start of the first world war, there were many who thought that the proletariats of all nations would realise their common humanity and refuse to go to war; that lasted about 10 minutes until the French working class went to war for France, the Germans for Germany, etc.There are, in every country, groups whose tribal, clan or religious affiliation override allegiance to the nation state and whole nation states where these divisions may cause rupture– Belgium comes to mind.

Those notes, in this case, are a green salad, a thick, umami-spiked dressing and savoury croutons, all tossed in a pitch-perfect combination of flavours (milky lettuce, salty fish, rich fat) and textures (crisp leaves, creamy dressing, crunchy toasted bread). So, while the recipe below isn’t pretending to be an authenticclassic caesar, consider it a very decent and, I hope, similarly pleasing cover version.The dressingView image in fullscreenBecky Hughes’ vegan caesar employs a sprinkling of roasted nori for an added iodine hit. All thumbnail photographs by Felicity Cloake.The caesar is a simple salad, however much people like to complicate it with toppings and other nonsense (of which more later), which means it stands and falls on its dressing. Yes, we can and will argue about whether it’s acceptable to deviate from the usual cos lettuce, but, really, the leaves are a mere vehicle to convey this rich, fiercely savoury substance from bowl to mouth; a fig leaf of fibre floating on a lake of “good” fats. The problem here is that, in its original form, the dressing, which gets its substance from egg yolk and much of its flavour from salty little anchovies, is very much not vegan-friendly.My first task was to replace the egg yolk. I tried several bases: cashews, as recommended byBecky Hughesin the New York Times; almonds and silken tofu, as used byIsa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romeroin their book Veganomicon;Ashley Madden’s tahini, from her Plant-Based Cookbook; andIxta Belfrage’s coconut yoghurtandTom Hunt’s aquafaba, both from the Guardian recipe archive. All work, but my testers and I aren’t overly keen on the flavour of coconut here, and find the cashews a little sweet and grainy – soaking, we surmise, might have helped with the texture, or perhaps I might just need to invest in a more powerful blender (there seems to be a lot of blending involved in vegan cookery, I’m discovering).Silken tofu and tahini both work well, the former giving a lighter, creamier result that’s more reminiscent of that other great American favourite, ranch dressing, and the latter blending in better than I anticipate, but the overall favourite is Hunt’s aquafaba. This, for anyone new to Guardian food content, isthe cooking water from tinned chickpeas(the cooking liquor of home-cooked ones is apparently less reliable, because the liquid can be less concentrated). Though some people find it has a slightly leguminous flavour, if you can taste it here you simply haven’t added enough garlic. Once whizzed up with the same olive oil used in the classic caesar dressing, it has a surprisingly voluptuous richness that works a treat, especially with a few chickpeas thrown in to stabilise the emulsion, as suggested byJ Kenji López-Alton Serious Eats.View image in fullscreenCaper brine and coconut sugar do the business in Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero’s take on the vegan caesar.The flavourings I find easier to pin down. In keeping with tradition, there will be garlic (I infuse the olive oil with it) and lemon juice, but instead of salty anchovies, I like the idea of Hughes and Veganomicon’s caper brine. You could stick in some whole capers, too, as Hunt and Madden do, but I prefer the deeper, richer savouriness of Belfrage and Hughes’ white miso paste (the lightest, sweetest variety, ideally). I prefer the miso to Hunt’s vegan Worcestershire sauce, which, like Madden’s cider vinegar and maple syrup combo, brings sweet-and-sour notes that I don’t remember in the original. The same goes for the coconut sugar in Veganomicon’s version and, much as I enjoy mustard (Madden uses dijon, Chandra Moskowitz and Hope Romero mustard powder), I don’t think it has a place in a caesar dressing.To try to mimic a little of the maritime notes of the fish, I’ve crumbled in some of Hughes’ roasted nori – my testers are divided as to whether the seaweed actually tastes anything like anchovies, or whether the effect is purely psychosomatic, but, because plant-based dietstend to be low in iodine, it feels like a good addition either way. I’ve also added some cheesy nutritional yeast, because, while the cheese goes on top of a traditional caesar salad, in this case it’s useful to include another source of umami in the dressing itself. As usual, however, you may like to adjust to taste, adding more or less of any of the above as you fancy.The saladView image in fullscreenTom Hunt saves time and energy by crisping his croutons in a frying pan rather than in the oven.As Madden writes: “Kale caesar salads are popular for a good reason – they’re incredible!” I first came across the idea in New York more than a decade ago and would echo her enthusiasm – the dressing clings to the frills of both her curly kale and Hughes’ cavolo nero with far more enthusiasm than to even the most meticulously dried cos. But, having removed the eggs, anchovies and parmesan from the equation, I feel I at least ought to stick with the original lettuce.Should you be braver in the privacy of your own home, other suggestions include Belfrage’s cucumber, Veganomicon’s spinach or rocket and Hunt’s wild sea kale, dulse and dandelion leaves (OK, I couldn’t get hold of the sea kale in central London, but, Tom, I did raid the garden weeds for you and can confirm that well-rinsed dandelion leaves are deliciously bitter). Whatever you use, I’d recommend tearing or cutting it into bite-sized pieces, and drying it very well after washing, so the dressing coats it, rather than sliding off into a watery mess. You might also, as Belfrage does, fancy popping in some herbs – she suggests chives and basil, both of which pair beautifully with the other flavours here.The toppingsView image in fullscreenAshley Madden’s effort features a ‘parmesan’ made by blitzing cashew nuts, turmeric and nutritional yeast: ‘Sceptical as I am, I really enjoyed it.’Croutons are a must in a caesar salad – I like to keep them fairly simple and bite-sized. I bake them, but, as Hunt’s recipe proves, they can be made successfully in a frying pan, too, which will use less energy, as would an air fryer. But you might like to get fancy and, like Belfrage, coat them in sesame seeds, maple syrup and chilli, or in Chandra Moskowitz and Hope Romero’s roast garlic and lemon juice. Fried, air-fried or baked, make sure they’re nice and crunchy, so leave the crusts on to help with that.Both Madden and Hughes top their salads with chickpeas – roasted until crisp in Hughes’ case, fried in a smoky spice mix for Madden – while Hunt recommends walnuts. Your choice, but I don’t think the salad needs either. But I do like it topped with a blizzard of parmesan, which is where Madden’s “cashew turmeric parmesan” comes in, made from blitzed nuts, sesame seeds, nutritional yeast and turmeric for colour.View image in fullscreenIxta Belfrage jazzes up her croutons by coating them in sesame seeds for extra crunch.Sceptical as I am, I really enjoy it – it tastes more one-dimensionally, almost artificially “cheesy” than actual parmesan, but with the creamy dressing and blandly crisp leaves as a foil, it works. That said, I’ve left out the sesame seeds in my copy-cat version, because I don’t think they add anything to the experience. Heap it over the top, or replace with your favourite vegan parmesan alternative as you wish. If you want to bulk out the salad, top it with smoked tofu, seitan or similar, but I think it’s pretty damn perfect as it is.Perfect vegan caesar saladPrep15 minCook20 minServes2-4 as a side1 thick slicecrusty bread(about 100g)Salt and black pepper1 large cos lettuce, or 2 little gems, washed and well driedFor the dressing1 plumpgarlic clove100ml olive oil4 tbsp aquafaba(ie, the liquid from a tin of chickpeas)10 cooked chickpeas6cm x 6cm piece dried nori, crumbled (optional)2 tbsp lemon juice1 tbsp caper brine2 tsp white miso paste2 tbsp nutritional yeastFor the cashew “parmesan” (optional)35g unsalted cashews, plus a small handful extra to finish2 tsp nutritional yeast¼ tsp turmericScant ¼ tsp fine saltCrush the garlic into the oil and leave to infuse while you get on with everything else.

Now they’re having a moment in the UK, in restaurants, chippies and even Aldi. I tested the best brands for home batteringTim DowlingSun 4 May 2025 06.30 EDTShareThe fried pickle – or frickle – is an on-trend appetiser with a murky provenance. Allegedly, itdates back to the early 1960s, originating at a drive-in restaurant in Arkansas run by an individual who laboured under the name Bernell “Fatman” Austin. Frickles are generally deep-fried, like onion rings, and usually accompanied by a gloopy dipping sauce such as aioli, dill and caper yoghurt or ranch dressing.Frickles aren’t exactly new to the UK – they first started appearing on restaurant menus about a decade ago – but now they’re beginning to turn up at chippies. In January,Aldi launched a frozen version.They’re also perfectly easy to make at home – there are even air fryer recipes out there – but what kind of pickle makes the best frickle? Armed with a deep-fat fryer and a whole lot of jars, I set about finding out.For a snack with such a history, frickles don’t seem to have a definitive recipe. People cut their gherkins into all kinds of shapes and coat them in all kinds of ways: breaded, floured, battered, dipped in egg and cornmeal, or some combination of the above. The most important consideration for testing was to come up with a single method for comparison.View image in fullscreen‘A pre-dredging in plain flour helps the batter adhere.’Photograph: Tim DowlingI settled on a compromise formula: a thick batter made of plain flour, cornflour, salt, pepper, paprika, bicarbonate of soda and fizzy water, followed by dredging in panko breadcrumbs. Then, after some trial and error, I ditched the breadcrumbs – they seemed like overkill – and added a pre-dredging in plain flour, which helped the batter adhere better.There were two other things I figured out along the way: one, pickles are wet – really wet – and they need to be dried off with kitchen roll before battering, otherwise they’ll get soggy quickly. And two, frickles do not need a long cooking time. A minute or so in sunflower oil at 190C (374F) is generally enough to brown and crisp the outside, which is all you want. The pickles themselves don’t need cooking, and don’t benefit from it.A word about pickled cucumbers: I may not know what the perfect frickle tastes like, but I know what the perfect pickle tastes like, and you can’t get them in the UK. Since I arrived here 35 years ago, I have searched for the British equivalent of an American kosher dill pickle, and there is simply no such thing. From time to time, I have been frustrated enough to make my own, which I recommend – it’s not hard. Here’sa simple recipeif you want to try it yourself.I accept that this may be a question of differing cultural tastes, but if you’re going to deep-fry a pickle, it ought to be the right sort. So I’ve included one American import as a control, and the rest here are, at best, rough approximations. Let the second-best pickle win.View image in fullscreen‘I know what the perfect pickle tastes like, and you can’t get them in the UK.’Photograph: Tim DowlingPolish Specialties ogórki konserwowe (pickled cucumbers)These whole gherkins are of a size – 9-10cm, roughly – that means they’re best cut in half lengthways before frying. The balance of sweet and sour is perfectly acceptable (although, like almost every pickle tested, they err on the sweet side), but there is no hint of any kind of spice, or of the dill that is resting at the bottom of the jar.The crunch, however, is good, and holds up under well after being battered. They’re a little bland – they seem to be holding on to a lot of water – but they result in a decent enough frickle.(6/10)Freshona sliced gherkinsFreshona is a Lidl brand, and these were chosen primarily for the way they’re cut: lengthwise slices, about 5mm thick. I thought this might confer some advantage when frying, but it actually leaves the slices floppy and crunchless. They’re also disappointingly sweet, with no detectable spice. Once deep-fried, they taste of almost nothing at all.(3/10)View image in fullscreen‘One thing I figured out along the way is that frickles do not need a long cooking time.’Photograph: Tim DowlingRolnik ogórki kwaszone (brined cucumbers)I found this jar in a local shop, not quite knowing what I’d got my hands on. These large gherkins are sort of an outlier, as they contain no vinegar at all. They’re preserved only in salt water and then – I’m presuming – fermented (the water is a little bit cloudy). So they’re sour, but with none of vinegar’s acidic edge. In that sense, they’re not really pickles as we understand them.But you know what? They make really good frickles; the gherkins are fat enough to be cut into quarter spears and still maintain an optimal batter-to-pickle ratio. They’re also very salty, with a very satisfying crunch, retaining both qualities once deep-fried.If there were any kind of frickle governing body these may well be disqualified, but they make for a tasty beer accompaniment and I certainly preferred them to a lot of the traditional gherkins tested.(7/10)Morrisons crinkle-cut pickled gherkinsA lot of people would tell you that the crinkle-cut disc – a classic hamburger pickle – is the ideal shape for a frickle. Again, there is no governing body, but this makes sense: certain lore suggests that frickles were invented accidentally when hamburger pickles fell into the onion-ring batter at some fast-food outlet of yesteryear.Unfortunately, in the UK at least, this shape usually heralds the most underwhelming pickle imaginable – sickly sweet and otherwise tasteless. This Morrisons own-brand version is better than many I’ve tasted – not too watery, with a fairly firm crunch but with a little too much sugar. The crinkle cut does indeed make a good frickle, with a surface area that seems to hold on to a bit more batter. They need a thorough drying before you fry, but they come out crispy and bite-size.(7/10)View image in fullscreen‘After some trial and error, I ditch the breadcrumbs – they seem like overkill.’Photograph: Tim DowlingOpies cornichonsTo be honest, this choice seemed like a bit of light relief – cornichons are a novelty mini-pickle and, while fun, are hardly suitable for our purposes. But these are lovely and sour, with a nice mustardy bite – easily among the best-tasting of the lot. They’re also tiny enough to deep-fry whole. They retain their impressive crunch, and the result is a revelation. Deep-fried cornichons are, as far I’m concerned, a thing. Possibly my thing.(8/10)Krakus pickled dill cucumbersAnother Polish brand. From the outside the jar looking in, these appear to be the real deal – whole cucumbers with dill, slivers of garlic and mustard seeds. But they’re on the sweet side, and lack any real intensity. Oddly enough, they do fry up quite well: the finished product is salty, crunchy and, while lacking the requisite sourness, somehow improved by a good battering. Then again, what isn’t?(6/10)View image in fullscreen‘For a snack with such a history, frickles don’t seem to have a definitive recipe.’Photograph: Tim DowlingKühneNothing much to recommend these, apart from the claim on the jar that they are “No 1 in Germany”. There is a hint of heat there from the mustard, but otherwise they don’t stand out from the pack in any way. It’s the same sad story: too sweet, too bland, only a little bit crunchy.(4/10)Mrs Elswood’s haimisha gherkinsThe self-proclaimed purveyor of the nation’s number one gherkins, Mrs Elswood – the brand avatar of Empire Bespoke Foods Ltd – makes a lot of different pickles: burger, dill, sandwich, sweet and sour. These haimisha gherkins, however, seem to fit the bill for frickles. The name comes from a Yiddish word meaning homey and cosy, and they’re supposed to be based on a traditional Jewish recipe.Mercifully, and almost exclusively for a UK supermarket pickle, they contain exactly the right amount of sugar: none. They’re firm and crunchy and, sliced in half the long way, they really stand up to deep-frying. If you want to produce an American-style frickle without importing an American-style pickle, this is probably as close as you’ll come.(9/10)Sainsbury’s pickled gherkinsLying somewhere between a small pickle and a large cornichon, these gherkins are amazingly, almost freakishly crunchy, and about the right size to batter whole. After a matter of seconds in the fryer they emerge crispy on the outside and still tumescent with crunch on the inside. Of course they’re too sweet, but a solid performer overall.(7/10)View image in fullscreen‘This is what a dill pickle is supposed to be – sharp, sour and crunchy.’Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesVlasic kosher dill spearsThis isn’t the best American pickle, but it’s probably the easiest to come by in the UK. You can find them in some specialist shops or source them online, but the price is steep; the jar I ordered from Amazon cost me £9.99.But this is what a dill pickle is supposed to be – sharp, sour and crunchy, without that cloying sweetness that spoils most UK gherkins. The spears – stubby cucumbers, quartered – are perhaps a little big for frickles, although lots of enthusiasts swear by them. My instinct – and I was proven right – was to halve them before proceeding.Once battered and fried, their deep sourness provides the perfect contrast to the crisp outside; they’re crying out to be dipped in something mayonnaise based. But be warned: they’re incrediblysalty, and that really comes to the fore after frying. You certainly don’t need any extra salt in your batter. Even so, no contest.(10/10)Explore more on these topicsFoodPickling, fermenting and preservingVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or at least it will if you were “on the scene” back then. These days, the 90s are synonymous with louche, raffish semi-pandemonium, mainly because today feels so saintly in comparison. No 90s restaurateur ever offered reclaimed spud peelings as a starter or a kombucha-led, alcohol-free drinks flight to spare your liver, complete with an earnest lecture on zero-waste hospitality. Puritanism was definitely out there back then, yes, though mainly only inThe Cranks Recipe Book. But mindfulness? Not so much.What One Club Row and similar London establishments such asthe Devonshire in Piccadillyandthe Plimsoll in Finsbury Parkseem to offer, is a thrilling, retro glimpse of mindlessness. Battered stuff, things in buns, strong drinks – and the sense that, at any point, you might cop off with one ofShed SevenorWendy from Transvision Vamp.View image in fullscreen‘Zingy, smoky, delightful’: One Club Row’s tuna crudo with smoked aubergine and Amalfi lemon.In that same spirit, the Knave of Clubs downstairs calls itself “a proper pub” where dogs are welcome and you can “have a pint and a packet of crisps”. There are bags of Tayto’s, scotch eggs and toasties on the bar menu, and Sunday roasts. On a side street behind the pub, One Club Row has its own separate, neon-signed door, a hole in a graffitied wall, that opens to a wooden staircase – think 1990s squat party – that leads up to a long room where, by 8pm, the party will already be in full swing. Elegantly, of course – this is not a bun fight – with rather sexily dim lighting, and a long bar where you can eat a plate of pickled jalapeño gougeres while sipping one of their four house martinis (club, classic, French or olive oil).Obviously, if, like me, you remember the 90s from their original incarnation, by 8pm you may well be thinking: “Gosh, it’s a bit late”, and “Why is the font on this menu so faint?” and “Hang on, is this actuallyLes Trois Garçons?! IthoughtI’d been here before!” If that all sounds rather expertly staged, then thank owners James Dye and Benjy Leibowitz and chefPatrick Powellfor that. It’s all very well creating a buzzy, laid-back, convivial vibe, but with Leibowitz on the floor, alongside general manager Niall Harte, things stay the right side of fancy.View image in fullscreenOne Club Row’s cheeseburger au poivre: ‘Not quite the best fancy burger in London, but it’s certainly nothing to complain about.’Powell, meanwhile, has been one of my favourite chefs for quite some time, particularly at his former Michelin-starredAllegra in Stratford. Here, however, his menu is much more hearty than fussy or finickety. There are croquettes filled with lobster and ham, roast scallops in confit garlic butter and thick French onion soup topped with comté and gruyere.We began with a round of those gougeres laced with cheese and sweet, spicy chilli, plus one of the chunky, crisp lobster croquettes, which dance a dainty line between anAntonin Carêmeclassic and a Findus crispy pancake. A classic steak tartare with beef-dripping bread, dressed with crisp baby gem leaves, was really very delicious, as was a remarkably pretty tuna crudo, arranged artistically with teeny slices of pickled celery and draped over a rather funky blend of smoked aubergine, creme fraiche and lemon. Zingy, smoky, delightful.View image in fullscreen‘Now that’s what I call a yorkshire pudding’: One Club Row’s Dutch baby with blueberries, chantilly cream and maple syrup (and also available with bacon).Photograph: Phoebe Pearson/The GuardianMains are marginally even less cheffy, and major on the likes of fishcakes, pasta, moules frites, meatballs, a ribeye with chipotle mayo to share, and so on. Hell, there’s even a burger, and they won’t even resent you for ordering it. This 250g grass-fed specimen, served almost rare, may not quite be the best fancy burger in London, but it’s certainly nothing to complain about, either. The accompanying sauce au poivre, however, was a little weak and drab in comparison. The fries – just fries, mercifully, rather than truffled or faffed with in any way – come separately, with a little bowl of aïoli. A whopping pork schnitzel in a saucemoutardewith added gorgonzola was a feisty combination and, considering its size, felt a bit of a challenge.For dessert we shared aDutch babywith chantilly, blueberries and optional smoked bacon. What is a Dutch baby, you may ask – well, it’s what those of us in this parish call a yorkshire pudding.One Club Row isn’t fine dining by any means, and some things still need a little fine-tuning, but that isn’t really the point. They will feed you, water you, give you a good time and make you feel carefree and cosseted. And if that all sounds a bit old-fashioned, then the future suddenly feels a whole lot brighter.One Club Row1 Club Row, London E1, oneclubrow.com (no phone). Open dinner only, Tues-Sat, 5.30-11pm.

That’s a lot of first dates, quite a few second dates and a few short relationships. Nothing stuck.No one seems to want a relationship. Everyone is broken, including me. Some women turn me down, allegedly, because I ask to split the bill on the second date, having paid on the first. Some turn me down because I want kids and they don’t. Some tell me I’m a nice man, after which I don’t hear from them again. I’ve never ghosted anyone, but I’ve turned down some good people too. I was trying to do the right thing by my headandmy heart. It appears everyone islooking for chemistry and not finding it.So I tried meeting womenwithout using apps. My friends are married or in long-term relationships and unfortunatelydon’t knowanyone they could match me with. When I was younger I worked in a big company and went to house parties; now I’m self-employed and my friends throw babyshowers. So I don’t meet single women as much. But I’ve gone to bars and courageously chatted to thewomen I fancied. Sometimesit actually works– we connect and later go on a date. But she may just like me professionally or as a friend; she may be in a relationship already.I work long hours and rarely meet new people. I go to a social event once a week, but often it feels more like networking. I’ve also tried speed datingto no avail.At least on the apps all the women are single, which is a good start. But last year the corrosive activity of swiping, chatting, meeting, rejecting or mostly being rejected became too much and I considered suicide. I deleted the apps instead of myself. I wish I could afford counselling, but it’s too expensive and the NHS talking therapies appear to be reserved for people who are struggling more than me, which is understandable.I want to find love and try having children before it’s too late. I would appreciate your advice.Something struck me about dating apps – and I say this with trepidation – but they are no different from real-life dating in so far as people sometimes think they’re ready for a relationship, but subconsciously they actually aren’t. I’m wondering if thatcouldbe you.I spoke to Susanna Abse, a couples psychoanalytic psychotherapist and the author ofTell Me The Truth About Love. “The world of dating apps is notoriously challenging,” she says. “It’s clear you are bruised and disappointed by the experience. The reality, however, is that anestimated 8% of peoplein the UK now find their long-term partners this way, and the older you are, the more likely this will be.”Immediate physical attraction is great, but perhaps chemistry also develops over time if the person is interestingWhile it’s true that people on dating apps are (mainly!) single, it’s also a highly pressurised setting. As Abse says: “People can be very anxious about rejection, so they avoid showing interest.”Abse wonders whether “open-heartedness and a willingness to look for friendship are actually as important as chemistry. Of course immediate physical attraction is great, but perhaps chemistry also develops over time if the person is interesting and, crucially, interested in you. In other words, it goes both ways – are you interesting? Are you curious about those you meet?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Abse makes another point. “I wonder if you are struggling with low-level depression,” she says. “You might have a tendency to minimise and mute your feelings, because the idea that feeling suicidal isn’t something that would qualify you for NHS therapy support is simply wrong.”I take all mentions of suicide very seriously. Please see your GP and explain how you feel. Abse also suggests group therapy, which can help us see how we interact with others and “is much more affordable”.

The two started an affair and in 1957 MacColl wrote the song The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face for Seeger, performing it for her over a long distance phone call (it was later a No 1 hit in the US for Roberta Flack). Seeger often performed with MacColl by her side until his death in 1989. She then married singer Irene Pyper-Scott, after forming an intense connection – she later described herself as “uncontrollably in love”.Seeger is also widely recognised as a feminist icon and an activist on issues from the environment to war and workers’ rights. Her song I’m Gonna Be an Engineer became a feminist anthem thanks to scathing lyrics such as: “She’s smart – for a woman, I wonder how she got that way / You get no choice, you get no voice / Just stay mum, pretend you’re dumb.”It’s a remarkable career, and one that’s coming to an end: her latest album Teleology, out now, is being billed as her last, and she is doing a 25-date farewell tour of the UK and Ireland from 14 May. Before she brings the curtain down, what would you like to know about her songwriting, her activism, her loves and losses, and the rest of her richly lived life?

The “first 100 days has far exceeded that of any other presidency in this country ever”, said Pam Bondi. “Most” of the presidents whose portraits adorn the Oval Office – which include George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan – were mere “placeholders” who were not “men of action”, musedJD Vance.Before the TV cameras on Wednesday, top cabinet officials took turns drenchingDonald Trumpwith praisethat some critics found evocative of politics in North Korea. Yet beyond the walls of the White House, the mood was shifting. New data showed the economy is shrinking. The national security adviser was about to be ousted. Opinion polls told of a president whose unpopularity is historic.After a hundred days in which Trump at times appeared invincible, political gravity is exerting itself. A majority of Americans regard him as both a failure and a would-be dictator. From the courts to the streets, from law offices to college campuses, revolt is swelling.Republicansare eyeing next year’s midterm elections with nervousness.Trump 100 days: delusions of monarchy coupled with fundamental ineptitudeRead more“The honeymoon is over,” saidJohn Zogby, an author and pollster. “He actually squandered his hundred days, perhaps you can argue, by doing too much, not succeeding with much of it and overplaying his hand. At the end of the 100 days his polling numbers reflect an unsuccessful quarter.Every poll that I know of, including mine, has him upside down.”Trump took office on 20 January with huge political capital. He had beaten his election rival Kamala Harris in every swing state and won the national popular vote for the first time, albeit at less than 50%. Having survived four legal cases, his sense of vindication was absolute. Tech billionaires and media moguls came to his Mar-a-Lago estate to kiss the ring.He started fast and furious. As Trump signed a record number of executive orders –now more than 140– Democrats looked like a boxer dazed by a flurry of punches at the opening bell. They struggled to find their feet and respond to a president who at breathtaking speed marginalised Congress, attacked judges and unleashedElon Muskto eviscerate the federal government.Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee, said: “The reality is you do it fast, you do it furious, you do it at different times and levels and places and you wind up creating 100 rabbit holes at one time. People are stuck trying to figure out which is the most important rabbit hole to go down. That’s what you’ve seen play out.”Yet 2 April, which Trump dubbed “liberation day” as he announced sweeping global tariffs, may also come to be seen as overreach day. His haphazard trade war rattled allies and wiped trillions of dollars off the stock market. Only fears of a bond market catastrophe spooked him into hitting the pause button. But he left in place tariffs on China as high as 145% and Beijing has refused to blink.View image in fullscreenElon Musks raises his cap during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday in which attenders heaped praise on Donald Trump.Photograph: Ken Cedeno-Pool/CNP/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThe chaos has shaken the faith of Trump voters who felt that he would at least deliver economic competence and guarantee the bottom line. Food prices are rising and tariffs are expected to disrupt supply chains soon, leading to empty shelves reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic. On Wednesday Trump admitted children might “have two dolls instead of 30 dolls” at Christmas and sought to blame his predecessor Joe Biden.Meanwhile Musk hassown further discord. Tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs. The US development agency USAID, a crucial tool of soft power, was closed. The social security welfare system has reportedly been hit by regional office closures, website crashes and some recipients being declared dead. Yet Doge looks set to fall well short of its $1tn target in savings and Musk is preparing to step away.Trump is even losing public backing on his signature issue of immigration. He sent troops to the border and expanded deportation targets, leading to a steep drop in illegal border crossings. But efforts to use the Alien Enemies Act for rapid deportations have faced legal challenges and concerns about due process.The aggressive enforcement led to the mistaken deportation ofKilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland man with protected legal status, to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The supreme court ordered the administration to facilitate his return but Trump has refused.Trump promised to swiftly end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza but both conflicts continue. His national security adviser, Mike Waltz, mistakenly added a journalist to a sensitive Signal chat discussing military operations. On Thursday it emerged that Waltzwould leave his postand be nominated as US ambassador to the UN instead.Trump vowed to be a “dictator” on “day one” but, critics say, his pretensions to authoritarianism have been undercut by the ineptitude that derailed his first term and led to a crushing defeat in 2020. He has the lowest approval rating at the 100-day mark of any president in the past 80 years.According to a poll published by the Washington Post newspaper and ABC News, only 39% of Americans approve of how Trump is conducting his presidency. About 64% of respondents said he was “going too far” in his efforts to expand presidential powers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also found that 64% of respondents said tariffs hurt consumers, and 91% were worried about inflation, with 62% “very concerned”. The Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) thinktank found that 52% agreed Trump was “a dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy”.Opposition is manifesting itself in myriad ways and cutting Trump down to size. About 50 of his executive orders have been partially or fully blocked by courts, while about 40 have been left in effect, according to a count by the Associated Press.View image in fullscreenProtesters at a May Day rally in Washington DC call for the return of the wrongly deported Kilmar Ábrego García from El Salvador.Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPAAnti-Trump demonstrations are growing in scale and frequency in cities and towns across the country. Democrats are holding raucous town halls in traditional Republican territory. After initially buckling under Trump’s “days of thunder”, law firms, non-profits and universities have found a spine and are feeding off one another’s resolve. Political commentators sense that the momentum is shifting.Charlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, said: “What Trump had going for him was he created this sense that he was an irresistible force, that resistance was futile, that everyone had to accommodate his whims and his agenda.Historians alarmed as Trump seeks to rewrite US story for 250th anniversaryRead more“But now you’re seeing the supreme court pushing back on him, the markets expressing alarm and his poll numbers going south. The shock and awe which seemed irresistible for so long now seems to be encountering much more resistance.”Trump is not the first president to feel the pinch of political gravity. Biden started positively but saw his approval rating dip below 50% for the first time in August 2021, following the botched US military withdrawal from Afghanistan, according toan NBC News poll,He never recovered.A sustained backlash against Trump could become a threat to Republicans who, while more devoutly loyal than ever, have to worry about their seats in Congress in themidterm electionsin November 2026. Historically the party that holds the White House tends to suffer losses in the midterms. Republicans currently hold a narrow 220-213 majority in the House of Representatives.Patrick Gaspard, a former official in the Barack Obama administration, said: “I would not judge this presidency to be a success. More likely than not we’ll begin to see Republicans whose names are on the ballot in 2026 slowly but clearly moving away from this agenda. It’s very clear that many Trump voters already have buyer’s remorse.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicansTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

TV screens in living rooms and cafes show a backdrop of Sri Lanka’s 26-year brutal and bloody ethnic conflict in which least 100,000 people were killed. The conflict officially ended in 2009, but its complex legacy remains.The film, a colourful exploration of Paris’s Little Jaffna and a comment on civil war, is ultimately about the complexities of French identity and how younger generations deal with a conflict far away. The French culture magazineTeleramacalled it a mix of “highly stylised action and geopolitical immersion”.View image in fullscreenA scene from Little Jaffna.Photograph: Guy FerrandisThe last major feature film centred on Tamils in France was a decade ago when the French directorJacques Audiard– who made the recent trans Mexican cartel musical,Emilia Pérez– won the Cannes film festival Palme d’Or forDheepan, about three Tamil refugees on a housing estate outside Paris. Audiard said at the time that he wanted to show characters radically different from his own experience.This time, Valin wanted to show the Tamil community in Paris from the inside. He chose the thriller format because he wanted to find a gripping way to introduce French cinemagoers to the Sri Lankan conflict, he said. But he has acknowledged that a violent police drama was far from a portrayal of all Tamils in Paris.“I thought that a thriller, an action film, suspense – all those universal codes of cinema we know – is what would bring people in to watch the film,” Valin said. “They’ll come to see it saying that above all it’s a good thriller. Then, as a kind of doggy bag, I send them home [with an insight into] the Sri Lankan conflict, and this community. For me it’s a way to open doors. I’ve made a first film, and that now allows a generation of younger film-makers to make their own films, saying: ‘If he did it, I can too.’”Explore more on these topicsParisFranceThrillersSri LankafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Later, when they searched the mobile phone of the 49-year-old Ukrainian refugee, they found a pdf of a Russian-language book called Modern Pyrotechnics. It contained detailed instructions on how to start fires and detonate explosives.Serhiy S – as he is identified in accordance with Polish law on naming criminal suspects – is one of dozens of people who have been rounded up acrossEuropeover the past two years and accused of being foot soldiers in a new front of Russia’s war against the west.View image in fullscreenSerhiy seen in red overalls in court in Wrocław.Photograph: Lina Verschwele/SZEuropean intelligence agencies say Moscow has launched a campaign of sabotage, arson and disinformation against the continent. Sometimes, it is focused on specific targets related to support for the Ukrainian war effort, but more often it is simply aimed at causing chaos and unease.In Lithuania, anIkea shop was set on fire; in Britain, seven people were charged over anarson attack on a business with links to Ukraine; in France, five coffins inscribed with the words “French soldiers in Ukraine” wereleft under the Eiffel Tower; in Estonia, the car windows of the interior minister and a local journalist were smashed. There have been numerous suspicious fires in Poland, including one thatdestroyed a huge shopping centrein Warsaw.Taken together, the incidents point to how Russia’s intelligence services have moved towards a new kind of attack on the west, one that is dangerous and violent but also piecemeal and hard to prove.On the ground, the acts are carried out by people who are recruited online and often paid in cryptocurrency. Some know exactly what they are doing and why, others do not realise they are ultimately working for Moscow. The professional intelligence officers who direct the operations never need to leave Russian territory.This account of Russia’s sabotage offensive is based on thousands of pages of court documents from Britain andPoland, interviews with current and former security and intelligence officials in several European countries and the US, and discussions with people who knew some of the perpetrators.“It’s easier to deal with spies under diplomatic cover or even [deep-cover] illegals,” said one senior European security official. “This kind of action is becoming dangerous for all of us.”View image in fullscreenMaxar satellite imagery of the Ikea store in Vilnius, Lithuania, which was set ablaze in an ‘act of terrorism’ in 2024.Photograph: Maxar/DigitalGlobe/Getty ImagesJust how aggressive the campaign might become remains a matter of conjecture. Western intelligence officials say that in recent months there has been a lull, perhaps asVladimir Putinexplores the possibility of improved relations with the US under Donald Trump.But before the change of US administration, there were signs that Moscow was raising the stakes ever higher. Intelligence last year about an apparent plot to send exploding parcels to the US, which could have led to a plane crash and mass casualties, caused so much alarm in Washington that top Biden administration security officials called their Russian counterparts to warn them that such an escalation would force the US to respond. They were not sure if the orders had come from the Kremlin or from overenthusiastic mid-level planners.“We didn’t know if Putin had approved it or knew about it,” said a former US security official. In a series of calls, senior Russian officials denied there was any such operation in the works but promised to pass on the message to Putin.The phone calls seemed to put an end to the exploding parcels plan, but the episode left nerves frayed over what lines Russia might be willing to cross in future, and what the consequences might be.“Their goal is not the same as Islamist jihadists who want as many victims as possible,” said Harrys Puusepp, the head of bureau at Kapo, Estonia’s internal security agency. “But if someone dies, they don’t care.”MapSerhiy was born in Odesa in 1974 into a Soviet military family. As he was finishing school, the Soviet Union collapsed and his home city became part of independentUkraine. The years went by, and Serhiy grew increasingly disdainful of the government in Kyiv, believing it discriminated against Russian speakers like him.His motto, displayed on his Facebook page, was: “I speak Russian. Only Russian”. After the Maidan revolution of 2014, he spent a lot of time scrolling through pro-Russian news websites. Soon after the full-scale invasion in February 2022, he left a comment under a political video on a Telegram channel, and another commentator, a man called Alexei, messaged him privately to say he agreed with Serhiy’s point of view.Alexei said he was a Kyiv-based businessman in the construction sector, and asked a lot of questions about Serhiy’s life and work. He made it clear he also hated Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian authorities.In the middle of 2023, scared of being conscripted into the Ukrainian army to fight in a war he did not believe in, Serhiy illegally crossed the border into Moldova. He made his way to Germany, where a former schoolfriend from Odesa told him there was casual work that paid €75 a day.After a few months of doing these odd jobs, his old Telegram buddy Alexei got back in touch from a new account. Alexei said he was now based in the Baltic states and suggested meeting up in Latvia orLithuaniato discuss a business proposal.Serhiy told him it was too far away and too expensive for him to travel, but Alexei offered to pay for the trip and suggested a closer destination – Wrocław in Poland. He transferred about £350 in Ukrainian currency to Serhiy’s wife’s bank account, and Serhiy bought a bus ticket to Wrocław. He left on 27 January 2024.Soon after Serhiy arrived in Poland, Alexei called him and apologised – something had come up and he was not able to travel. But he could reveal the business proposal: he wanted Serhiy to look for shopping malls and industrial centres in Wrocław and photograph them. If they found a suitable place, Serhiy was to set it ablaze. Alexei would pay him $2,000 upfront, and a further $2,000 on receiving proof of the arson.For Serhiy, who was taking day jobs to keep afloat, it was a huge amount of money. According to the story he later told Polish investigators, he asked no questions about who might want to order such a plan or why.Serhiy paced the streets of Wrocław looking for possible targets. Eventually he settled on a paint wholesaler in an industrial estate on the outskirts of town. He sent photographs of the building to Alexei, who agreed it was an excellent target – near various sensitive infrastructure sites and close to a canal that could be heavily polluted if paint spilled into it. Serhiy bought supplies for starting a fire.But at some point, all alone in Wrocław and realising the seriousness of what he had signed up for, Serhiy got cold feet.He remembered a building near his home in Germany that had burned down, and told his wife to send him a photo of it. Perhaps, he thought, he could send that to Alexei and pass it off as somewhere in Wrocław, to get the money without doing the deed. He decided there would be no arson, on this trip at least, and bought a bus ticket back to Germany. He was arrested just before he boarded the coach.A week after Serhiy was arrested, a message appeared on a small Telegram group with 28 subscribers that shared white supremacist content. It was posted below an image of a mountain range that, if you squinted, appeared to show an image of Adolf Hitler’s face.“Attention! Fight with blacks. We are looking for partisans in Europe,” read the message, in English. “We are looking for comrades who make arson to the store of black migrants.” The reward was $5,000. Attached was a photograph of the building Serhiy had identified.The account that posted the message was the same one used by “Alexei”, who had told Serhiy he was a construction magnate from Kyiv. Now, the account was posing as a European neo-Nazi.In fact, Polish authorities believe, it was run by a staff officer of the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence service.Russia’s campaign of setting things on fire did not come out of nowhere.Research in the archives of communist security servicesshows that sabotage in enemy countries was part of the KGB’s intelligence doctrine as early as the 1960s, to be launched in times of heightened tension or war.After the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in east Ukraine in 2014, Russian operatives targeted ammunition factories and arms dealers in Europe who supported Ukraine. Unlike much of the current wave of sabotage, those attacks were carefully planned, using trained operatives against specific targets.Many of those who carried it out were from a shadowy GRU unit known as 29155, whose tasks included sabotage and assassinations across Europe. However, their activities were so brazen that they were eventually unmasked. After thepoisoning of Sergei Skripalin 2018 with the nerve agent novichok, British authorities – as well as investigative journalists from the outlet Bellingcat – identified the poisoners as 29155 operatives.In response, European countries ordered the expulsion of hundreds of Russian intelligence officers working under diplomatic cover out of embassies. Checking passport databases, Bellingcat was able to identify many other 29155 operatives who had been used on short-term missions, busting their cover and rendering them unable to travel. Then, after thefull-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, there was a new round of diplomatic expulsions.These episodes severely hampered Moscow’s ability to operate outside Russia, and spy bosses had to get creative to plug the gaps. First, some of the clean diplomats still abroad were co-opted. “We saw them tasking ordinary diplomats with intelligence activities, and this is not a phenomenon limited to Estonia,” said Puusepp, in an interview at the domestic security agency’s headquarters in Tallinn.Second, Russia activated its network of “illegals”, deep-cover operatives posing as foreigners, whose missions could last decades. Giving them more daring missions meant more risk of capture, and in the year after the invasion of Ukraine, illegals were identified in Slovenia, Norway, Greece and Brazil. Those who did not flee in time were arrested.Third, Russia turned to the services of all kinds of freelancers. In some cases, this meant hiring people with organised crime ties, such as Orlin Roussev, a Bulgarian based in the UK who ran surveillance and other operations for Russia using a group of fellow Bulgarians he called his “minions”,three of whom were found guilty last month at the Old Baileyin London.In addition to using new actors to carry out old tasks, Moscow also launched a campaign of sabotage that was much broader than anything seen before. Unlike the earlier, targeted actions, this wave would be more scattergun and have different goals.One former US intelligence official said that, in the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Washington had expected to see massive Russian cyber-attacks launched against the west. These attacks largely did not materialise, and one theory is that Moscow went for a more explosive option instead. “The idea of sabotage was always in the field of vision as a possibility, but it’s still very surprising to see it play out,” said the former official.In many cases, it is hard to prove Moscow’s involvement beyond reasonable doubt. There have been mixed signals over whetherdamage to a series of undersea cables in the Baltic Seawas the result of nefarious Russian actions or had more innocuous causes. But even when there is no apparent evidence of foul play, such as in thefire that closed down Heathrow airportlast month, there is now inevitable speculation of possible Russian involvement.0:37Substation fire in Hayes, London causes widespread outages and Heathrow airport closure – video“It creates a kind of fog,” said one senior European security official. “In the beginning some of these things look natural, but then it happens more and more and you start to wonder. You have cases where there is no proof, but we have strong suspicions.”Many of the same operatives from unit 29155 who have been involved in sabotage operations for more than a decade are part of the new campaign, western officials say. The unit has been folded into a bigger GRU department and is still run by its longstanding chief, Andrei Averyanov.But now, the work on the ground is done by one-time operatives recruited over Telegram, rather than the unit’s staff officers, most of whom are no longer able to travel to Europe. And instead of focusing narrowly on specific targets closely related to the Ukraine war, the approach is much broader, targeting shopping centres, warehouses and other civilian infrastructure.“The strategic aim is to sow discord and insecurity. They are not destroying significant infrastructure. They are concentrating on soft targets that influence a general perception of insecurity in society. This is classic psy-ops,” said Piotr Krawczyk, the former head of Poland’s foreign intelligence service.The way Moscow recruits operatives and selects targets varies from country to country. In the Baltic states, the Russian services make use of the extensive family ties of the local Russian-speaking population, according to intelligence officials there. Recruitments are made during visits to Russia, and Telegram is then used for communication, rather than for making the initial contact. The motivating factor is usually either money or blackmail.Puusepp said: “It’s not a question of ideology but of business and relatives inside Russia. When we look at the people, their overall understanding of the world is not about much more than survival.”Elsewhere in Europe, people are recruited over Telegram, without any in-person interaction at all. Some, like Serhiy, initially think they are talking to like-minded friends about a joint business project. Others may think they are working on the orders of white supremacist groups or domestic political actors.View image in fullscreenDrone image of the Marywilska 44 shopping centre fire in Warsaw, Poland, in May 2024.Photograph: Dariusz Borowicz/Agencja Wyborcza.pl/ReutersOperatives are recruited via the grey employment groups where immigrants often find casual gig-economy work that pays under the counter. Often, they are people who have operated on the margins of the law for some time, and when the order comes to burn something down, they may think it is part of a criminal dispute rather than intelligence work.Some recruits do have an ideological affinity with Russia, such as Serhiy, who supported Russia’s war in Ukraine and longed for his native Odesa to become Russian-controlled. More often, though, there is no ideological component.Last May, Polish authorities arrested a Pole and two Belarusians on suspicion of planning sabotage acts for the Russians inside Poland. All three men had previously fought in Ukraine on the side of Kyiv.A separate group of 16 saboteurs, mostly Ukrainian and Belarusian men, was apprehended in Poland in early 2023 and later sentenced. This group mainly comprised people who had little sympathy for the Kremlin’s geopolitical goals but were simply looking to earn money in the gig economy.The recruits were offered tasks in Poland that ranged from posting anti-Nato flyers to installing cameras that would monitor trains with humanitarian and military cargo bound for Ukraine. Payments, made in cryptocurrency, ranged from $5 for putting up a poster to $400 for installing a camera.The group’s activities were directed by a man who identified himself only as “Andrei”, and who communicated with two of the group and told them to distribute tasks among the others.One of the defendants, a 20-year-old Belarusian woman who was arrested and convicted with her boyfriend, claimed that neither of them were supporters of Russia’s war effort. Her boyfriend, she claimed, would often put up a poster, take a photo to provide proof, and then immediately pull it down.“He was doing this to earn money for us, because I was spending a lot. He just did it to have some extra cash without thinking of the consequences,” she wrote in a letter to her family after her arrest. “This is the worst thing to happen to me in my whole life.”In late February, Serhiy was brought into a courtroom in Wrocław, dressed in the red prison overalls reserved for highly dangerous prisoners, his hands and legs in chains.“The goal of the accused was to lower our morale, to question the effectiveness and competency of our state, and to question our support for Ukraine,” said the judge, Marcin Myczkowski, reading his verdict.Serhiy looked on impassively, giving the occasional sigh, as an interpreter whispered the judge’s words into his ear. He had previously agreed a plea bargain with prosecutors in exchange for a three-year sentence but Myczkowski cancelled the deal, claiming it was too lenient.Even though Serhiy had not, in the end, set anything on fire, and was arrested when he was about to board a bus out of the country, Myczkowski handed him an eight-year sentence. In part, the judge said, it was meant as a warning to others – “a clear and unequivocal signal to you and to all potential candidates that committing such acts is not worthwhile”.For the Russians, the benefit of using one-time operatives is that, if something goes wrong, Moscow can discard them and leave them do their time in prison. No Russian diplomats are working behind the scenes to free Serhiy, and it is highly unlikely that he would be included in any prisoner exchange. Instead, the controllers at GRU headquarters can simply set up new Telegram accounts and start the process again.“You jail one person and another pops up to take their place. These people are disposable and Moscow doesn’t care about them,” said a European security official.The possibility that anyone looking for odd jobs on Telegram could be signing up for Russian intelligence missions sparks surveillance and privacy dilemmas reminiscent of counter-terrorism work, as authorities scramble to catch potential perpetrators before they act.There is another question, too, brought into focus by the alleged aborted plot to send explosive packages to the US last year: what is the endgame?One senior security official said that as Russia increasingly considers Europe a party to the war in Ukraine, the sabotage campaign is only likely to intensify as long as the war goes on. “They are crossing one red line after another and we don’t know how far they will go,” said the official.Additional reporting by Ada PetriczkoRussia’s spies: Uncovering Russia’s secret espionage programmes.

At uni. In a cavernous lecture hall. Slouched in a vaguely uncomfortable seat. Ping. A notification on Messenger. “Lol at this,” wrote my bestie from 14km away, accumulating student debt and little else. I clicked on the link.In that moment, I happened upon the most significant social media community of all time. AFacebookgroup, titled simply but garnished appropriately: “DRAG NAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!”The name – and enthusiastic use of exclamation marks – says it all: it’s a place for thousands of like-minded individuals to share their inventive names for drag queens.View image in fullscreen‘I can almost feel new grey matter forming when I happen upon these word plays’: a typical post from the Facebook group.Photograph: FacebookIt’s organised like so: each day (or whenever inspiration strikes), a member drops a theme into the void. Think: “biscuits”, “the afterlife” or “ethical non-monogamy”. Then the names pile in. For “chocolate”, one participant proffers Emma Nems. Another, Lindor Evangelista. A third chimes in with particular wit: Her/She.I was instantly titillated. That day in the lecture hall, I realised nothing I could come up with would ever compete with the unbridled originality of a 55-year-old gay man in Missouri.Some submissions are immediately obvious: Paula Roid for photography-based drag names. Shak Shookher for breakfast. Dee Parton for the deceased.Others take time to mull over, making them even more rewarding once they click. For “benevolent drag names”, there’s Hilda Dooropen, Karen Attention and Maya L Pugh.View image in fullscreenHilda Dooropen, Karen Attention, Maya L Pugh … and Linda Helping-Hand.Photograph: FacebookNow I see drag names everywhere. I’ll grab a coffee and be reminded of my own bum: flat white. When I write an article, I’m a young journalist: Paige Turner. My alter ego after that aforementioned brew? Anita Dump. I can almost feel new grey matter forming when I happen upon these word plays. They feel as beneficial to my brain health as learning another language.A few years ago I was tasked with interviewing pop sensation Dua Lipa when she came to Australia for World Pride. I needed to know – had she thought of a drag name to mark the occasion? And if not, would she consider Duo Lingo?Looking for the last human place on the internet? Try Google MapsRead moreDRAG NAMES!!!!!!!!!!!! was, and remains, a showcase of camp creativity. Both mischief and good, clean fun. The only rule is ensuring the name you share hasn’t been posted previously. This pushes members to dig deep into the reserves of their sick and twisted minds. It’s there that they find Yeast Witheredpoon.The group, unlike so many, is seemingly devoid of internal politics. It has never devolved into a cesspit of vicious disagreement. There hasn’t been a single pile-on. And if there was, it would probably result in some great names. Try Dee Platform or – they’re allergic to accountability – Nora Grets.In this group, people from all walks of life congregate around a shared mission of creating the funniest names of all time. I can’t think of any other online ecosystem as supportive.Maybe drag names are the answer to true community, happiness and – dare I say – life?

But it wasn’t long before one of the hairless puppies began stealing blankets to burrow beneath furniture and hide for long stretches.Around the same time, in the summer of 2022, she first heard the noise: a deep, mechanical howl that becomes shrill closer to the facility. Copenhaver didn’t know it then, butbitcoinminers had come to town. Less than a mile away from her home in eastTexas, acryptocurrencymining facility was rumbling to life.The hum has since become the soundtrack to life for hundreds of residents in the small city of Granbury, with a population of 12,600. It echoes across agricultural land and forests, chasing away deer. It seeps into walls, vibrating bedrooms and dinner tables. Copenhaver’s neighbor Cheryl Shadden imagines it is what standing on the edge of Niagara Falls might sound like. Copenhaver says it’s like a jet engine is forever stationed nearby.A video of the site from Shadden’s home, recorded on 23 April, shows green pastures against a backdrop of billowing smoke and the roar.“It wakes you up,” says Copenhaver. “I’ll be asleep, and everything will be fine, and then I’ll wake up because I can feel it in my chest.”Large-scale cryptocurrency mining operations began popping up across the United States a decade ago. But it was China’s crackdown on miners in 2021, leading many to relocate to the US, that cemented the country’s role as the global hotspot for minting bitcoin. With at least 137 commercial-level facilities across the country, clustered mostly in Texas, the sector uses up to 2.3% of the nation’s grid,accordingto estimates by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), a government agency that gathers and disseminates statistics on energy use. WhereasJoe Bidenhad promised to crack down on the industry,Donald Trumpwantsbitcoin to be “mined, minted and made in the USA”, setting the scene for bitcoin mines to roar louder throughout the rural US in the coming years.0:28Local resident captures noise from cryptocurrency mining facility – video“President Trump and his administration have done a lot to deliver on the promises that they made during the campaign, and we see this industry growing rapidly” Fred Thiel, the CEO of Mara, the world’s largest miner and owner of the 300-megawatt (MW) site in Granbury, told Fox Business in March. “We want to see the US be the dominant bitcoin mining country in the world.” Shortly before that interview, the firm acquired a 354-MW Texan wind farm to power a new mine, and has begun tapping natural gas from oilfields to fuel new facilities.Expansion plans: more money, more power, more noiseExpansion plans published by mining companies show an expanding array of more data centers and more machines across the country. Miners have tapped investors for $3.7bn in bonds since November to fund future growth.Miners nationwide have likewise unveiled plans to add at least another 2.42 GW in capacity, according to announcements compiled since November. That’s equivalent to almost 2m US households, according to EIAestimates.I’ll be asleep, and everything will be fine, and then I’ll wake up because I can feel it in my chestShenice Copenhaver of TexasBitcoin’s “hash rate” – the collective amount of computing power securing the network, of which the US maintainsone-third– hasincreased by one-quartersince Trump’s election victory. The respective hash rates of miners Mara and TeraWulf shot up over 40% between October and December last year, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.Eric Trumpeven launched his own mining firm last month, America Bitcoin, a subsidiary of the publicly traded miner Hut 8 Corp.“Simply buying bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity,” the president saidabouthis son’s endeavor. Trump has launched his own cryptocurrency as well.Polaris Technology Inc is one of many firms expanding. The company is moving to double its footprint in Muskogee,Oklahoma, raising its capacity to use the same amount of energy as approximately 400,000 homes, despite noise complaints from locals. Likewise, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, CleanSpark opened a new site earlier this year.US judge halts government effort to monitor crypto mining energy useRead more“They promised to be good neighbors, but so far their noise is constant,” says Dave Simpson, who lives a quarter of a mile from theWyomingsite. The facility is yet to reach full capacity. Simpson worries about how a constant drone will affect his property’s valuation. “I miss the quiet times,” he says.In Granbury, Copenhaver says that the noise has gotten worse since November. Her decibel reader – a must-have for many residents – has been notching higher, she says, now reaching between 80 to 100 decibels on any given day.Why is crypto mining loud?Digging for digital gold makes noise for several reasons.Row after row of industrial-grade fans are typically used to prevent mining computers, known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, from overheating, which can create an enormous din. Crypto mining often also consists of rows of smaller mobile containers in the open air, in contrast to the US’s other major construction boom of tech infrastructure: artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are housed in closed structures.Mary Willis, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University, has spotted a pattern when it comes to the location of mines. Underwritten by bigger budgets, AI data centers are built on large plots of remote land. Miners, on the other hand, flock to the cheapest power and easy grid access, which often means old factory towns.View image in fullscreenBitcoin mining machines in a warehouse at the Whinstone US bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas, in October 2021.Photograph: Mark Felix/AFP/Getty ImagesMiners are increasingly building next to aging power stations – they call such projects co-locations – and striking deals with energy companies to bring underused plants back to life. Mara’s Granbury mine is co-located with two gas power stations, both owned by Constellation Energy, which has fought locals over the past year to build a third plant.Cryptocurrency miners in Texas pay less for electricity than residents on average, according to an Earthjusticereport. In 2023, residential ratepayers paid 22.25 cents per kilowatt-hour for their electricity, while specific crypto mining operations paid just 2.5 per kWh, the group estimates. Bitcoin mining raises the cost of electricity for non-miners in Texas by $1.8bn per year, roughly 4.7%, per consulting firmWood Mackenzie.Pricey puzzlesTrump has also given miners impetus to grow through his commitment to solidifying bitcoin’s place in traditional finance, and thus its long-term appreciation. Its price currently sits at roughly $97,000. In December 2024, ittopped $100,000for the first time.Crypto mining computers race against one another to solve cryptographic puzzles. The correct answer verifies a new batch, or “block”, of bitcoin transactions. The block is added to the blockchain, which functions as a public ledger of all transactions within the network. The computer that cracks the code first is rewarded 3.125 bitcoins.So, when bitcoin rallies, miners often look to dial up power. But because price surges bring more miners online, the hash rate also grows. This increases mining difficulty, a measurement for how time – consuming it is to solve the cryptographic puzzles needed to validate a block. Unlocking the mining reward requires more guesses, which means more computing power.Miners thus must increase their facilities’ computing power each time hashrate goes up in order to stay profitable, or they must raise the efficiency of their existing equipment.For instance, for every $1,000 increase in bitcoin price, US mining energy consumption increases by approximately 0.058 terawatt-hours per month, according to a recentstudyby the Berkeley Lab.Bitcoin may have lost some of its initial gains following the election, when it rose 50% in just three months, but much of the crypto world anticipates that its long-term rally will resume once new policies take shape. Major financial institutions are increasingly trusting of bitcoin, and Trump plans to create areserveof cryptocurrency owned by the US government.Newly friendly regulationTrump issued anexecutive orderon 23 January, “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology”, which promotes the right to mine, and he has hosted crypto mining executives at both Mar-a-Lago and the firstWhite House Crypto Summit. Meanwhile, his promise tounleashdomestic oil and gas is welcome news for an industry whose profitability is dictated by access to cheap energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EIA has no plans to resume this survey.Red-state rancorAnti-mining protests play out in town halls across red states, where activists challenge local officials on why they have showered the industry with tax breaks and subsidized power. Riot Platforms has received almost $136m in power credits from Texas’s grid operator since 2022, profiting more in credits than bitcoin mined in certain months, according to company filings.Despite this, Hood county, where Granbury is located,voted 82%for Trump in 2024, including many of the activists fighting against Mara. Copenhaver admits crypto did not factor into her vote.On the 600-memberBitcoinNoise Hood County Facebook group, videos are posted each week showcasing the hum while simultaneously praising Trump. One post, shared the morning after the election, shows sunlight streaming through a canopy of trees, as a symphony of birds competes with a deep thunder. “November 6, thank you lord for getting Trump elected,” the video begins, before the narrator details how the sound has destroyed her peace.LiveLocal resident captures noise from cryptocurrency mining facility – videoJackie Sawicky, a resident of Corsicana, Texas, had led the 800-member Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining over the past few years. Sawicky got involved in the movement after Riot Platforms began constructing a site in her city. Although the site has so far not raised noise complaints, when finished it will have the 1 gigawatt of capacity – about the same consumption as 600,000 Texan households.One member told Sawicky they voted for Trump because of abortion. “The unborn babies can’t go deaf, but you and yours can,” she replied. “And there are children in your community who are already losing their hearing because of this.” Disillusioned, she has taken a step back from the movement since the election and plans to leave the state.Suing for silence“If there are policies that support increased mining, there’s going to be more pollution and more community impacts,” says Mandy DeRoche, the deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice. DeRoche represents plaintiffs suing miners in three cases across the US, including five Granbury residents who filed alawsuitagainst Mara in October, alleging noise-related damage to their health, wildlife and air.The sound has unleashed a number of health issues, plaintiffs say, including tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss and heart arrhythmia, on top of insomnia and anxiety. Chronic exposure to low-frequency noise is known toaffect health, but doesn’t receive the attention that water contamination or air pollution attracts, says Willis.They promised to be good neighbors, but so far their noise is constant. I miss the quiet timesDave Simpson of Wyoming“Disrupted sleep causes a cascade of other issues in someone’s life. Lack of sleep is linked to depression, higher stress levels and chronic diseases like hypertension,” she says.Cyndie Roberson witnessed rampant sleeplessness change her community in Cherokee county,Georgia, when the noise from a mine began to echo through around 800 nearby homes. Neighbors became increasingly anxious, confrontational and angry. One suffered a heart attack. Another left due to acute emotional distress. “There was so much lack of sleep. They weren’t the same as they were before,” Roberson says. She sold her “dream retirement cabin” in 2022 and left the county.In Granbury, Shadden says the sleepless nights have left her anxious and irritable. She endures chronic migraines and struggles at work. A nonstop buzzing in her ears also affects her sleep. After consulting an audiologist last year she was diagnosed with permanent conduction hearing loss.“It’s never going to come back,” she says.Mara disputes the accusations.“There is no established link, medical or otherwise, between Mara’s operations and the ailments that are being alleged,” the company said in a statement.Restoring peace and quietThe industry contends that noise can be mitigated with immersion-cooled machines, where ASICs are stored in dielectric oil, and by building sound walls.But critics dispute the efficacy of this promise.“I wish it were true,” says DeRoche, on the question of immersion cooling. “We can tell from both the research and from the experience on the ground that immersion cooling will decrease the sound in some way, but only by a percentage. It doesn’t eliminate the sound,” she says. Immersion cooling often requires external dry coolers, which can be equally as noisy when deployed at scale.Bitcoin is terrible for the environment – can it ever go green?Read moreIn response to the complaints from Granbury residents, Mara says that by November 2024, a sound wall had been constructed, two-thirds of machines had been replaced with immersion cooling, and an independent sound survey found levels to be below the legal limit of 85 decibels.The city’s residents won an unexpected victory on 31 March. Constellation Energy withdrew its permit application for a third gas plant, citing community concerns and lower-than-expected returns. “This is truly the best news I’ve had in a year and a half,” said Shadden.Meanwhile, the noise drones on. “I just want quiet,” says Copenhaver. “We’re all feeling very defeated.”Three years on, she’s still waiting for all of her dogs’ fur to return. It may never. They’re no longer puppies, and they’ve never known a home undisturbed by the hum of the mine.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesDonald TrumpBitcoinTexasGeorgiaOklahomaWyomingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, she says, in the climate of fear that has built up inIndiain the past decade, her media outlet has made it clear that her reports on topics such as sexual violence against lower-caste women and the harassment of Muslims are no longer welcome.When the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which rules nationally, won power in Uttar Pradesh for a second term in 2022, the outlet told her to stop travelling altogether. Its finances were already fragile, and it feared losing government advertising.People like me don’t have the resources to survive an onslaught by the policeAnonymous journalistIn theory, the press in India enjoys freedom. Anyone looking at the media landscape would find it vibrant, with about20,000 daily newspapersand about 450 privately owned news channels. No minister has ordered any curtailment of press freedom or freedom of expression. No formal policy of shutting down newspapers or channels has been announced. Reporters are, for the most part, free to travel.But because of violence against journalists and highly concentrated media ownership, India is ranked among the worst countries in the world for press freedom– 151st out of 180 countries – according to theannual indexcompiled by Reporters Without Borders.Quick GuidePress Freedom: why does it matter?ShowPress freedom is inworrying declinein many parts of the world, with widespread attacks on journalists - last year was thedeadliest on record- and the shutting down of news outlets due to economic hardship.We are running aseries of piecesexploring the threats and challenges faced by media around World Press Freedom Day on 3 May, created to remind governments of their duty to uphold freedom of expression.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“There is no holding anyone accountable any more if you don’t report on such stories,” says Kapoor, who says she held off reporting on the many cases of severe gastrointestinal illnesses among devotees at theworld’s largest religious gathering, Kumbh Mela, this year.She feared being detained for challenging the official narrative that the festival had been a consummate masterclass in crowd management.View image in fullscreenParanjoy Guha Thakurta, a veteran journalist detained by police in 2023. He says Modi has ‘weaponised law-enforcing agencies to target not only its political opponents but several independent journalists’.Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP“My children said, ‘how will you cope in a cell in the summer without air conditioning and sharing one toilet with 40 other people?’ People like me in small towns don’t have the resources to survive an onslaught by the police,” she says.Today, in Modi’s India, many journalists say they fear being framed under draconian anti-terrorism laws, or the arrival of pro-Modi gangs at their front door.Arjun Menon*, also based in Uttar Pradesh, says he received death threats after writing a piece critical of Modi’s leadership two years ago.There are many important stories I should be doing but fears for my safety and my family stopped meAakash Hassan“Modi supporters threatened to bulldoze my house. I was trolled viciously for being unpatriotic. It’s made me meticulous about recording all my conversations and keeping detailed notes just in case I end up in court,” Menon says.At least 15journalists have been charged under the anti-terrorism law, the 1967 Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, since Modi came to power, according to the International Journalists’ Network (IJN). Thirty-six journalists have been detained.Siddique Kappan wasjailed for two years without trialafter being arrested on his way to Uttar Pradesh to report on the high-profile case of a Dalit girl who was gang-raped and later died in 2020. He had been picked up by Uttar Pradesh police and accused of belonging to an Islamist fundamentalist group and conspiring to incite violence among Muslims.Indian supreme court orders inquiry into state’s use of Pegasus spywareRead moreIndia’s laws,says the IJN, have been “weaponised” to silence and intimidate journalists, with the 1967 security law amended in 2019 to allow the authorities to declare an individual a “terrorist” before any crime is proved in court.The Delhi-based independent journalistAakash Hassan, a regular contributor to the Guardian, says he has been visited at home by police and intelligence officials for his coverage of the restive Himalayan region ofKashmir, which is claimed by both Pakistan and India. He has now been banned from travelling outside India, he says, and has had his phone confiscated by police, who demanded his password.View image in fullscreenActivists in Bengaluru wear masks of Modi and BJP home minister Amit Shah in a 2021 protest over Pegasus spyware allegedly used to monitor journalists and political opponents.Photograph: J Nv/EPA“There are many important stories I have wanted to do, and I should be doing, but fears for my safety and that of my family have stopped me. It’s very scary to know that any number of draconian laws can be used to jail journalists. Then you can wait years for a verdict,” says Hassan.Modi and the BJP are not the first in India to try to suppress media freedom, says the journalist Paranjoy Guha Thakurta. Earlier governments also tried, including the Congress party, now the main opposition. Under a Congress government in 2012, the cartoonist Aseem Trivediwas arrestedfor depicting parliament as a toilet.The difference, says Thakurta, is that the Modi regime has “weaponised law-enforcing agencies to target not only its political opponents but several independent journalists who have not kowtowed to the right wing”.Never since 1975-77, when Indira Gandhi imposed an ‘emergency’, has media freedom been so shackledLarge sections of the mainstream media appear to have been turned into subservient mouthpieces. Modi himself has never exposed himself to a press conference to answer difficult questions, not even during the Covid pandemic.“Never since 1975-77, when former prime minister Indira Gandhi imposed an ‘emergency’, has media freedom been so shackled and constricted in the country,” says Thakurta.While dismayed at the suppression of freedom of expression and the fear inhibiting reporters, N Ram, director of the Hindu Publishing Group, says critical voices remain. Stories that embarrass the government do still get published. Independent news websites such asthe WireandNewslaundrycontinue to criticise the government, along with magazines such asthe Caravan.More than half the world cannot speak freely, report findsRead moreFor a non-official perspective, Indians have started turning to independent YouTube channels and popular podcasters such as Ravish Kumar, Dhruv Rathee and Akash Banerjee, who are all critical of the Modi regime. And in southern India, where the BJP is not in power in any of the five states, there is less fear among journalists.Last month,Vikatan, a news website in the southernmost state of Tamil Nadu, managed to get a court to overturn the government’s move to block it after it published a cartoon showing a handcuffed Modi sitting next to Donald Trump following news of the deportation of Indian immigrants from the US. The Modi government’s lawyer had argued that the cartoon was “detrimental to the sovereignty and integrity of India” and its “friendly relations with foreign states”.Ram says independent journalism is not dead. “There remain spaces and voices that resist suppression and I think we will see more people standing up to pressure.”* Names have been changed to protect identities"

Greenland is seen as strategically important both for defense and as a future source of mineral wealth.In an interview on NBC’s Meet The Press on Sunday, Trump was asked whether he would rule out using force against the territory.Danish PM tells US ‘you cannot annex another country’ on visit to GreenlandRead more“I don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it, but I don’t rule out anything. No, not there. We needGreenlandvery badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security,” Trump said.The exchange came as part of wide-ranging interview following Trump’s first100-days in officelast week and he was also asked about the idea of using military force againstCanada– an idea once unthinkable but now a subject of speculation amid Trump’s repeated assertion he would like to make Canada the US’s 51st state.“It’s highly unlikely. I don’t see it withCanada. I just don’t see it, I have to be honest with you,” Trump said.Trump said he had spoke with Canada’s new prime minister,Mark Carney, and confirmed that the pair had not spoken about making his country part of the US.But he said they could discuss the topic when Carney visits Washington DC “this week or next week”. Carney, along with around 90% of Canadians, oppose the idea of folding Canada into the US. But Trump said he was open to a discussion.“I’ll always talk about that. You know why? We subsidize Canada to the tune of $200bn a year,” Trump said. “We don’t need their cars. In fact, we don’t want their cars. We don’t need their energy. We don’t even want their energy. We have more than they do. We don’t want their lumber. We have great lumber. All I have to do is free it up from the environmental lunatics.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When I look down at that without that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago – was just an artificial line, goes straight across. You don’t even realize.”“What a beautiful country it would be,” he added.A poll published last month found that 68% of Americans believe Trump is serious about the US trying to take over Greenland, and 53% think Trump is serious when he talks about the US trying to take control of Canada.But the survey,commissioned by ABC Newsfound that respondents didn’t think either annexation would be a good idea. About 86% said they opposed the US trying to take control of Canada, and 76% opposed trying to take control of Greenland.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationGreenlandNatoCanadaMark CarneyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The jury said Expedia, and subsidiaries Orbitz and hotels.com, illegally profited from promoting and selling vacation packages at hotels there.The rare lawsuit was one of the first brought under Title III of the 1996 Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as theHelms-Burton Act. The act was designed to finally open a legal pathway for such compensation claims, but was suspended by successive presidents until Donald Trump made the decision to activate it in 2019.The intention was to deter US and international companies from investing inCubaby exposing them to potentially huge financial penalties for conducting business there.For Echeverría, who reminisced about his grandmother tending the beachfront at Cayo Coco in a moving Spanish-languageinterview with UniVista TVearlier this year, the verdict is not the end of the story.He and his family may never see a penny after Federico Moreno, the district court judge overseeing the case, paused the award and set a further hearing for August seeking “specific evidence” that the family itself legally acquired the land on Cuba’s independence from Spain in 1898.The only other previously adjudicated Helms-Burton penalty, a $439m illegal tourism ruling in 2022 against four major cruise lines operating from Havana, wasoverturned last year. An appeals court said a claim by descendants of the original dock owners was essentially out of time.A handful of other cases, meanwhile, have stalled – including one by the oil giant Exxon Mobil that claims various Cuban state corporations areprofiting from its confiscated land.But those at the forefront of the fight for justice say the Expedia case in particular brings hope to scores of others pursuing compensation for property they insist was illegally seized.“There are 45 other suits that are making their way through the courts, there may be more new ones after this verdict also,” said Nicolás Gutiérrez, president of the National Association of Sugar Mill Owners of Cuba.Gutiérrez is a Miami-based consultant who has worked with hundreds of dispossessed exiles and their families, in addition to pursuing amends for his own family’s lost houses, farmland and mills.“We are hopeful that this is just the beginning. We waited 23 years, from 1996 to 2019, to have the key provisions of Title III be put into effect by President Trump, and now there’s new generations of families in these cases I’m working with,” he said, adding:“The old guys back then are gone, but in many cases their kids have continued with their crusade. Some have given up, some have been sort of reactivated along the way, and it’s not only justice for the families, it’s like a historic and moral commitment. We sacrificed and built up prosperity in Cuba that was taken for no good reason.”Gutiérrez also believes that desperate conditions on the island could hasten the fight.“They never recovered from the pandemic with tourism. The sugar, nickel and rum industries, and tobacco to a lesser extent, have been run into the ground. Remittances and trips are going to be further cut by the Trump administration, and that’s really what they’re relying on now,” he said.“They don’t even have electricity for more than a couple hours a day.“Someday, relatively soon, there will be a big change, and if a future Cuba wants to attract the serious level of investment it will need to dig itself out of the hole that this totalitarian nightmare has dug over the last 66 years, what better way to inspire confidence than to recognize the victims of the illegal confiscations?”Analysts of Cuban politics say the government is taking notice of the Helms-Burton actions. These analysts are also looking into the ramifications of Trump’sexistingandplanned crackdownsdesigned to increase financial pressure on the communist regime.“There are people looking at the impact it’s having overall in the investment scenario in the island, and apparently it’s having some chilling effect,” saidSebastian Arcos, director of Florida International University’s Cuban Research Institute.“The most important chilling effect is the fact that the Cuban economy is going nowhere, and everybody knows it.“The government stole properties from many thousands of Cubans, and what we’re seeing now is a systematic attempt of many of the people who inherited these claims from their families not to try to recover, because it’s impossible to recover anything as long as the Cuban regime is there, but at least to punish the regime financially for doing what they did.”It’s unclear if Echeverría’s family will become the first to actually receive compensation, but with stretches of Cayo Coco’s northern coastline now consumed by the concrete of almost a dozen super-resorts offering more than 5,000 hotel rooms, they accept the land will not be returned.Their attorney, Andrés Rivero, saidin a statement: “This is a major victory not only for our client, but also for the broader community of Cuban Americans whose property was wrongfully taken and has been exploited by US companies in partnership with the Cuban communist dictatorship.“We are proud to have played a role in securing justice under a law that had never before been tested before a jury.”Expedia did not reply to specific questions. A spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian: “We are disappointed in the jury’s verdict, which we do not believe was supported by the law or evidence. We believe the court was correct to decline immediate entry of judgment and look forward to the court’s consideration of the legal sufficiency of the evidence presented to the jury.”Explore more on these topicsCubaMiamiFloridaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In Menzies, there wasn’t even a field organiser on the ground.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterOther suburban seats targeted by the Liberals such as Chisholm, Dunkley and McEwen also swung further to Labor, while talk about strongholds such as Bruce, Hawke and Gorton being under threat proved to be rubbish.Victoria confounds Liberal hopes of election revival, swinging even further to LaborRead moreIt’s a devastating result for the Coalition in a state they desperately needed to turn around. At best, the Liberal party could emerge with just seven out of 38 acrossVictoria– as many seats as their Nationals partners.The Liberals didn’t see this coming – and neither did Labor.“We were expecting the Luftwaffe to come in and completely decimate us – instead, we got Dutton on a lame pony,” one senior Victorian Labor source said. “Their campaign was an absolute joke.”State Labor figures had braced for a swing away from the party – expecting a drop of between 1.5% to 2.5% while members of state caucus were questioning whether Allan’s leadership could survive a loss of more than three federal seats. A challenge was seen as inevitable if key seats fell.Such was the fear internally that Albanese appeared with Allan just once during the campaign. In the final fortnight, she held only two metropolitan press conferences, well away from the campaign trail – one at a Lego Star Wars exhibition, where she posed with Darth Vader, raising a few eyebrows.But Allan has emerged unscathed.A Victorian Labor MP from her socialist left faction said the result should “put any leadership speculation to bed”.Liberal vote decimated in major cities – with Coalition now dominated by regional MPs and NationalsRead more“The hysteria around Jacinta’s leadership has been ridiculous,” another Labor MP said. “It was unfair to tie her to the result of a federal poll, but if that’s the barometer for success, then this result should shut her detractors up.”Others, however, expressed caution, noting Victorians were able to differentiate between the state and federal government.One MP said federal Labor’s funding commitments for suburban roads and Melbourne airport would have resonated with voters. Another said the election was won on federal issues – tax cuts, Medicare and the response to a second Trump presidency.2:25Australian federal election 2025 recap: Albanese wins, Dutton concedes, Greens in the air – videoBut Allan wasn’t having it. On Sunday, she went as far as crediting the result to “Victorian initiatives” such as investment in women’s health and free Tafe that have now been adopted federally.“It demonstrates very clearly that federal and state Labor share the same values,” she told reporters.To Allan and many of her MPs, the result was also a vindication of theSuburban Rail Loop– the state government’s flagship 90km underground line linking Cheltenham to Werribee.“Four elections now – it has been backed time and time again by the Victorian community,” Allan said, pointing to the results in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That tells you everything.”Liberal strategist turned pollster Tony Barry laid the blame squarely at the feet of the Victorian division, calling it a “broken institution” that sabotaged its own campaign.The party’s internal turmoil stretches back to 2023, when then leader John Pesutto led the push to expel Moira Deeming from the party room – a move that triggered a defamation suit Deeming later won, costing him the leadership.The party’s new leader, Brad Battin, may haveattempted to distance himself from Dutton during the campaignbut he reignited party’s internal war by promoting Deeming as his “representative to the western suburbs” just days before pre-polling began.Victoria’s Liberal leader is counting the days to the election. But will ‘brand Brad’ pass the pub test?Read moreUnlike their federal counterparts, a handful of moderates remain in the Victorian Liberal party room. But they fear if Pesutto is bankrupted due to the legal costs of the defamation case, the party could be forced into a byelection in Hawthorn – a seat he only narrowly won back in 2022 after campaigning on his plans to restore small-l liberal values.Battin, just months into the job, has shown little sign of unifying a fractured base, reconnecting with inner-city voters or winning back women. He also failed to front up to media on Sunday to explain the federal result – a silence that left his MPs frustrated.His team insists new policy is coming this week – well ahead of the November 2026 state election. But that can’t be the only lesson the state Liberals take from the federal poll.Explore more on these topicsVictorian politicsJacinta AllanVictoriaAnthony AlbaneseAustralian election 2025Labor partyAustralian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Coalition wants to take Australia backwards, while Labor is standing still | Clear AirRead moreThey then sought to understand how the emissions from these companies contributed to extreme heat. This was defined as the temperature of the hottest five days in a year.The team developed a replicable method to quantify the damage linked to a single company, with the figure running into the trillions for the world’s largest fossil fuel producers.It suggested state-owned oil companies Saudi Aramco and Gazprom were responsible for US$2.05tr and $2tr in damages respectively. Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP were each found to be responsible for $1.98tr, $1.91tr and $1.45tr in losses respectively.In a separate analysis of emissions data for five major Australian resource companies – BHP,Rio Tinto, Santos, Whitehaven Coal and Woodside Energy – Callahan assessed the total damages from their collective emissions at more than US$600bn, or A$929.47bn.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter“Our analysis is very explicitly thinking about emissions that are already occurred and the sort of historical changes in extreme heat, and attributing those to emissions that have been already detected and attributed to specific actors,” Callahan said.“Even just from that we get numbers in the trillions, when you aggregate globally over the last 30 years in terms of the losses associated with any individual company, but GDP growth losses from extreme heat are a very small fraction of the total cost of climate change.”The difficulty in establishing causation and calculating a single company’s contribution to climate harms has made courts in many jurisdictions, particularly in Australia, reluctant to hold individual fossil fuel producers to account for the climate impact of their projects.When seeking approval to build and operate its $5.6bn Barossa gasfield in a remote area off the far north Australian coast, Australian oil companySantoswas asked by the Australian Conservation Foundation whether it had considered potential climate harms.Santos responded by arguing “there are limitations to linking emissions from the activity to any specific climate change impacts”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That scientific connection can absolutely be made,” he said.“It is no longer scientifically supported for actors to argue that there is plausible deniability, that it is impossible to link any of an individual actor to any impact of climate change.“That statement, that there is a sort of uncrossable gap between where you emit and some other impact down the road, we’ve shown that to be fallacious.”Several significant lawsuits have been brought against major US oil companies, includingMunicipalities of Puerto Rico v Exxon Mobil Corpand other cases brought by individual US state governments.On Friday, Hawaiibecame the 10th US stateto take fossil fuel producers to court over alleged climate deception, prompting a countersuit by the Trump administration in an attempt to block the filing.Next to the United States, Australia is the second most active jurisdiction in the world for climate litigation, according to Melbourne Law School’s Climate Change litigation databasewhich currently tracks 627 cases.Many of these cases include smaller decisions involving council planning, regulations or access to information as the database uses a broader definition.Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsEnergy (Australia news)Mining (Environment)BHPSantosRio TintoWoodsidenewsShareReuse this content"

The girls were removed from the station under government policies that created the stolen generations.A trove of previously unreported government documents, obtained from the State Records Office ofWestern Australia, show that Hancock requested the children be returned to the station.

At the time the women made the claims in 1992, a Hancock family lawyer denied them, saying it “was not Lang’s style”.View image in fullscreenLang Hancock, pictured in 1982 with his daughter Gina Rinehart.Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media/Getty Images“That wasn’t the kind of thing Lang Hancock would do,” he said. “I have spoken to young men who worked around Mulga Downs with Lang and I have spoken to confidants who say nothing like this was ever mentioned or rumoured,” the lawyer said after Hancock’s death.Robinson said she is asking with “sincere respect” for Rinehart to acknowledge the history of her mother’s removal from the station and Hancock’s attempted intervention, saying the letter showed how “furious” he was.“As descendants … knowing she was removed from her homelands and her families by force, we often wonder what the outcome would have been like if Sella had not been ‘kidnapped’ and had grown up and lived on Mulga Downs Station,” she said.“Maybe, just maybe, her and her aunty Minnit Doris would have had shares, and rights in inheriting the property, and any other shares/stakes left to George Hancock and his son Langley.”She speculates that the children might have received a mention in Hancock’s will, “if not for their cruel abduction, on that sad, mournful day from Mulga Downs Station”.Robinson, who now lives in Perth, said that if Rinehart decided not to have a DNA test, she would “respect her decision”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However I have hope.”A spokesperson for Rinehart’s company, Hancock Prospecting, said it had an agreement in place with the Banjima people covering Mulga Downs and “complies fully with its obligations”.He said the company, under Rinehart’s leadership, had given a large section of Mulga Downs to the Banjima for the Youngaleena community.“And further, at the request of a non-Banjima community, similarly claiming long ties in the Mulga Downs area, [Rinehart] gave a further section of Mulga Downs to that community.“We value our long-term relationship with the Banjima people and remain committed to working collaboratively in addition to positively for the Banjima people and their future generations, and in accordance with all legal and cultural obligations,” he said.The spokesperson said most of the station now housed mineral tenements of various mining companies, together with related infrastructure.‘It was a real sexual frontier’The trove of documents also reveals government concerns about alleged sexual relationships between white men and Aboriginal women at Mulga Downs in the early 20th century and into the 1940s. Under section 46 of the state’s Native Administration Act, it was illegal for a “non-native” to have “sexual intercourse with any native who is not his wife or her husband”.The correspondence claims the women, who mostly worked as domestic labour and lived in camps on the property, “must have been used by white men for the satisfaction of their sexual desires”.The exploitation of Aboriginal women by white station workers was “rampant” across remote areas of Australia at the time, according to the University of Newcastle’s Prof Victoria Haskins, who has written extensively on Aboriginal women in domestic service and cross-cultural relationships.“There was an understanding that Aboriginal women [on the stations] were just sexually available. It was a real sexual frontier.”She said Aboriginal women in these situations had “no power to say no”.“The power dynamic between white men and Aboriginal women was extremely uneven.“‘Going up to the boss’s was probably well understood to be part of the work that was expected of you [as a domestic worker].View image in fullscreenMulga Downs station in Western Australia.

He confirmed the team has captured 478 hours of footage, with 26 remote cameras, seven night-vision ones and a drone streaming uninterrupted footage since its launch on 15 April.The last showing of the season concluded at 10pm local time on Sunday, with cameras capturing 70 moose (also known as European elk) making the spring crossing through Sweden’s Ångerman River – about 180 miles north of Stockholm.View image in fullscreenProduction crew in Junsele, Sweden prepare for the livestream of The Great Moose Migration.Photograph: SVT/APThe Great Moose Migration is part of a growing fascination with “slow TV” – a genre that took off in 2009 when Norway’s NRK aired a real-time, seven-hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo.The concept has since found cult status across Europe, with broadcasts featuring 12-hour knitting marathons, a 134-hour sea voyage, and even a crackling fireplace stream that topped Netflix’s UK charts on Boxing Day.Cashing in on its popularity, SVT has even been sending out push notifications when the first moose appears, while a dedicated Facebook group with more than 76,000 members now shares sightings, screenshots and speculation about the next appearance.Though official viewing figures for this year’s season have yet to be released, SVT has already confirmed the moose will return next spring for an eighth edition.Explore more on these topicsSwedenAnimalsTelevisionEuropeWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

They have fallen by more than 30% in the past 12 months as a turnaround plan under the chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, has failed to inspire investors and oil prices have fallen.Shell may also wait for BP to reach out for another possible suitor to make the first move, those familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Deliberations are allegedly still in the early stages, and Shell could decide to focus on share buybacks and smaller acquisitions rather than such a big merger, according to the report.The combination of Britain’s biggest oil companies would be one of the largest deals ever in the sector. Shell’s market value of £145.6bn is more than double that of BP, at £55.9bn.A spokesperson for Shell told the Guardian: “As we have said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.”A spokesperson for BP declined to comment.In February, Auchincloss promised to “fundamentally reset” BP’s strategy, with the changes expected to include a watering down of its climate commitments and the pursuit of new fossil fuel projects in an attempt to bolster its market value.The company’s profitsdropped by almost 50%in the first three months of this year to $1.4bn (£1bn), down from $2.7bn in the same period last year. Its flagging share price has also made the company a target for the New York hedge fund Elliott Management.The shares have lagged behind other oil and gas firms in recent years after its former chief executive Bernard Looney set BP on course to become a net zero energy company.

An Élysée official said: “We are a space where there is freedom of research and no taboo topics.” The official said the event was about “affirmingFranceand Europe as stable spaces that can guarantee freedoms and academic research”.France is thought to be particularly keen to attract scientists working on health – particularly infectious diseases – as well as climate research and artificial intelligence.Monday’s event, titled Choose Europe for science, comes after 13 European countries, including France, Germany and Spain, wrote to the European Commission urging it to move fast to attract academic talent.France launched its ownChoose France for scienceinitiative in April with a dedicated platform for applications to host international researchers.The French research ministry told Agence France-Presse: “Some foreign researchers have already arrived in France to familiarise themselves with the infrastructure, waiting for the funds and platform to be set up.”In recent days, France’s flagship scientific research centre CNRS launched a new initiative to attract foreign workers whose research is threatened, as well as French researchers working abroad, some of whom “don’t want to live and raise their children in Trump’s United States”, its president, Antoine Petit, told AFP.In France, Aix-Marseille University launched its “Safe place for science” programme in March. It will receive its first foreign researchers in June.In a letter to French universities in March, Philippe Baptiste, France’s minister for higher education and research, wrote: “Many well-known researchers are already questioning their future in the United States. We would naturally wish to welcome a certain number of them.”Challenges remain because research investment in the US – including private-public partnerships – has for many years been greater than in Europe. For decades, Europe has lagged behind the US on investment in universities and research centres.French researchers have regularly raised the issue of the comparatively low salaries and precarious contracts for many researchers in France. On average, an academic researcher in the US is paid more than their French equivalent. Trade unions in France have called for better contracts, better salary provisions and better funding across the board at research institutions.Some in France hoped the pay gap between scientists in France and the US would narrow, once the lower cost of education and health, and more generous social benefits in France were taken into account.Germany’s incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said last month: “The American government is currently using brute force against the universities in the US, so that researchers from America are now contacting Europe.

He had been held for more than two days.One of the man’s fingers had been chopped off and investigators feared further mutilations could have happened if he had not been rescued.The man, who has not been publicly identified, was abducted in broad daylight at 10.30am on Thursday morning as he walked down a street in Paris’s 14th arrondissement. Four men in ski masks forced him into a delivery van.He was freed by armed police in a raid at 9pm on Saturday night from a house 20km (12 miles) south of Paris, in the Essonne area. Five suspects in their 20s were arrested at the house.The state prosecutor said in a statement: “The victim appears to be the father of a man who made his fortune in cryptocurrencies, with the crime involving a ransom demand.”The victim’s wife told investigators that her husband and wealthy son, who both owned a crypto marketing firm in Malta, had received threats in the past, a police source said.Le Parisienreported that the attackers had demanded a ransom of €5-7m (£4-6m), which was not paid. The five kidnapping suspects, aged between 20 and 27, were still being questioned by police on Sunday.The kidnapping is the latest in a series of abductions of cryptocurrency figures inFranceand neighbouring countries.David Balland, the co-founder of the crypto firm Ledger, which is valued at more than $1bn , was abducted with his partner on 21 January at their home in Méreau, near Bourges in central France. He also had a finger cut off.The attackers arrived at Balland’s house in the early hours of the morning, taking him and his partner and separating them. Balland was taken to a house in the town of Châteauroux, where one of his fingers was cut off.Police were contacted by Balland’s business partner who received a video of the finger alongside a demand for a large ransom in cryptocurrency, of around €10m. Balland was freed in a police raid soon after. His partner was found tied up in the boot of a car in a carpark in the Essonne area south of Paris the next day.Nine suspects are under criminal investigation in that case, including the alleged ringleader, 26, who has a police record for a previous kidnapping.In December 2024, the 56-year-old father of a French cryptocurrency influencer based in Dubai, was the target of an alleged kidnapping in eastern France, local media reported. Attackers arrived at the man’s home, tied up his wife and daughter and forced him into a car.The man’s influencer son received a ransom demand and contacted police. The two women were then quickly freed. The father was only discovered 24 hours later in the boot of a car in Normandy, tied up and showing signs of physical violence, having been sprinkled with petrol.Other abductions of cryptocurrency figures or their partners were reported in Spain andBelgiumin the past five months.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeCryptocurrenciesBelgiumnewsShareReuse this content"

On Telegram, Netanyahu said Israel had acted against the Houthis in the past and would act again in the future.“It will not happen in one bang, but there will be many bangs,” he said.TheHouthis, who are backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack on Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport, and Israeli military confirmed that the missile was launched from Yemen.Local mediareportedthat Israeli and US defence systems had failed to down the missile, which left a deep crater in an open field on the perimeter of the airport, and that an investigation was under way.Most attacks from Yemen during the conflict in Gaza have been intercepted by Israel’s missile defence systems, apart froma drone strike that hit Tel Avivlast July. Sunday’s missile strike sent a plume of smoke into the air, caused panic among passengers in the terminal building and led to air traffic being suspended for an hour.European and US carriers have cancelled flights for the next few days. Many had only recently begun to resume services toIsraelafter the Gaza ceasefire, which temporarily paused hostilities between mid-January and mid-March. This followed their suspension of flights for much of the last year and a half.The missile attack came hours before Israel’s security cabinet was due to vote on plans to expand the fighting in Gaza with a new offensive.Military officials confirmed on Sunday that tens of thousands of reservists had been called up, though it was unclear when any new operations would be launched.The aim of the offensive would be to put pressure on Hamas to release hostages it continues to hold in Gaza; to further degrade the militant Islamist group’s military capabilities; and to “seize ground” that would be used as leverage in future negotiations, officials said.Hardliners in the Israeli cabinet have been pushing for a broad offensive in Gaza for many months.Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister, told Israeli Army Radio he wanted to see a “powerful” expansion of the war, but did not disclose details as to what the new plans would entail.“We need to increase the intensity and continue until we achieve total victory. We must win a total victory,” he said. Ben-Gvir demanded that Israel bomb “the food and electricity supplies” in Gaza.Two months ago, Israel imposed a tight blockade of Gaza, stopping all food, medicine, fuel and other items entering the devastated territory. Israel’s military is making preparations for new orders to allow aid in, but only under strict conditions. Israeli officials accuse Hamas of diverting humanitarian assistance to fund its military operations. Hamas denies the charge.View image in fullscreenThe ballistic missile struck near the airport, where air traffic to and from the US and Europe has been temporarily halted.Photograph: Amir Levy/Getty ImagesIsraeli airstrikes have continued daily across Gaza. At least seven Palestinians including two parents and their two children, two and four, were killed in southern and central Gaza on Sunday, Palestinian medics said.Israel’s military said on Sunday that two soldiers were killed in combat in the territory, bringing the number of Israeli troops killed since fighting resumed in March to six.The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 250 hostages. Israel says 59 hostages remain in Gaza, although roughly 35 of them are said to be dead.The Israeli offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians. The fighting has displaced more than 90% of its population, often multiple times. Hunger has been widespread and the shortage of food has set off looting.The attacks by the Houthis, who control swathes ofYemen, underline the regional dimension of the conflict in Gaza. The Iran-backed militia began targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping in late 2023, claiming it was acting out of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel deployed warplanes on three big air raids last year after Houthi missile attacks. The strikes targeted power stations, port facilities, the airport in Sana’a and “military infrastructure”.The US president, Donald Trump, in March ordered large-scale strikes against the Houthis to reduce their capabilities and deter them from targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea.The Houthis’ military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said on Sunday that the missile strike meant Israel’s main airport was “no longer safe for air travel”.The Israel Airports Authority (IAA) said the attack marked the first time a missile had fallen so close to Ben Gurion airport’s terminal and the runways. Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said it had treated at least six people with light to moderate injuries.Lufthansa Group, which includes the airlines Lufthansa, Swiss, Brussels and Austrian, said it had halted flights to and from Tel Aviv through to Tuesday because of the situation. ITA Airways said it had cancelled flights from Italy to Israel through to Wednesday, while Air France cancelled flights on Sunday, saying customers were being transferred to flights on Monday.Ryanair suspended flights on Sunday but flights were still scheduled for Monday, according to the IAA.Explore more on these topicsIsraelHouthisIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaYemennewsShareReuse this content"

Too much emphasis is put on the cost of change and not enough consideration is given to the human and financial cost of no or incremental change,” it added.While the costs of reforming the system were substantial – up to £17bn according to some estimates cited in the committee’s report – this had to be set against the £32bn currently spent every year on a system that was failing.The report said the costs of inaction included 2 million people aged 65 and over and 1.5 million people of working-age not getting get the care they need, millions more getting poor care and huge avoidable financial pressures placed on the NHS and local authorities.Social care was propped up by an army of over 1.5m unpaid carers – “equivalent to a second NHS” – who provided more than 50 hours of care weekly, often quitting jobs to care for loved ones and who bore the brunt of the system’s failures, the report said.It comes just days after the formal launch of a three-yearindependent commission into adult social careled by Louise Casey aimed at developing plans for a new national care service.Although the commission has been broadly welcomed, there are concerns it will merely rehearse already well-trodden debates and effectively put off for years changes that some expertshave arguedcould happen in a matter of months.The Casey review’s terms of reference state its conclusions must be “affordable” and stay within government spending limits for the remainder of the parliament, triggering fears among reformers any changes will be underpowered.Adult social care reform has been on and off the English policy agenda for more than two decades. Attempts by governments to fix the system have been repeatedlyderailed by lack of political consensus, worry over costs and political timidity.The MPs report concludes: “The moral case for reform has never been stronger, but this must be accompanied by a robust financial case. Without this we fear that the reforms that come out of the Casey commission will be doomed to failure, leaving everyone continuing to suffer under the current unsustainable system.”The chair of the health and social care committee, Layla Moran, said: “Successive governments have shied away from implementing meaningful reforms to the social care system. But this is an active choice that is no longer tenable.We are living with a broken social care system.”She added: “It might seem that reforms will be costly and difficult, but continuing with inaction will cost us all more.”The care minister, Stephen Kinnock, said that far from doing nothing the government had “hit the ground running on social care” having inherited a system in crisis, and had taken a series of measuresincluding a £3.7bn funding boost.He said: “A lot has been done, but we know there is so much more to do and deep reform is needed. That’s why we appointed Baroness Louise Casey to lead the independent commission working to transcend party politics and build consensus on the future of adult social care, with her first report out next year.”Explore more on these topicsSocial careCare workersCarersStephen KinnocknewsShareReuse this content"

Our plan to develop a UK-wide veterans support service will work with enterprising health, employment and housing charities and it is backed by the one of the largest ever government funding commitments to veterans.”Starmer said his thoughts would turn both to those who served in the second world war and those who carried “the torch of their legacy” today.“Alongside our history and our values, service is the other great force that binds a nation together,” he said. “So this week, I want you to know: the whole nation is inspired by the selfless dedication of your example.”Explore more on these topicsVE DayKeir StarmerLabourSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

Layton was a valued and much-loved member of year 9, and he will be greatly missed by everyone. We extend our sincere condolences to Layton’s family and loved ones at this incredibly difficult time.“As a school, we will rally together to support one another through this tragedy. Anyone who wishes to pay their respects is invited to lay flowers at the fence in front of the bungalow in memory of Layton.”Fourteen children aged between 11 and 14 – of whom 11 were boys and three were girls – were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after the death of the teenager, Northumbria police said on Saturday.On Sunday evening a police spokesperson said the children had all been “released on police bail pending further inquiries”.At the entrance to the industrial park close to where Layton was found wellwishers left bouquets of flowers, card and tributes, reported Chronicle Live. One message read: “You were a sensitive soul with a kind heart. You will be deeply missed.” Another said: “Layton, thanks for brightening up our lives. You will be missed beyond words.”A GoFundMe crowdfunder set up by the best friend of the teenager’s mother has raised more than £8,000 towards the costs of his funeral.Police said they received reports of the fire shortly after 8pm on Friday at the industrial site on the southern banks of the River Tyne.A police spokesperson said: “Sadly, following searches carried out by Northumbria police and partners at Tyne and Wear fire and rescue service, a body believed to be that of 14-year-old Layton Carr was located deceased inside the building.“His next of kin have been informed and are currently being supported by specialist officers.”The spokesperson added: “Inquiries are at an early stage and members of the public are asked not to speculate online or in the community.”DCI Louise Jenkins of Northumbria police said: “This is an extremely tragic incident where a boy has sadly lost his life. Our thoughts are with Layton’s family as they begin to attempt to process the loss of their loved one.“Our specialist officers will continue to support them in whatever way they can. We ask that their privacy be respected at this time.”Jenkins said a cordon was in place while police carried out inquiries to establish “the full circumstances surrounding the incident”. She added that officers would be in the area to “offer reassurance to the public”.Anyone who has information that could help the investigation has been urged to contact Northumbria police by sending a direct message on social media or by using the “live chat” or “report” functions on theforce’s website.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Of those arrested, the nationality of the fifth was still being established.In a separate investigation, three Iranian nationals were detained in London on suspicion of being involved in threat activity on behalf of Iran, though police said the two sets of high-profile arrests were not linked.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, described the arrests as “two major operations” that reflected some of the biggest threats “we have seen in recent years” – and while she did not comment directly on whether the incidents were linked to the Iranian state, she noted “it involves Iranian nationals in both investigations”.Investigators from counter-terrorism police and the domestic security service, MI5, feared any planned attack might have taken place soon. Scotland Yard did not reveal the alleged target but it was understood to be in the UK.Three of those arrested were held in the Manchester area, with another arrested in west London and a fifth in Swindon. Hundreds of officers across the country were involved in the operation.Police on Sunday said they were still not sure any risk had been wholly contained, with detectives investigating whether the plot had overseas involvement.Scotland Yard said the five men in the first operation, including four Iranians, were being questioned under section 5 of the Terrorism Act on suspicion of planning an attack.Commander Dominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, said: “The investigation is still in its early stages and we are exploring various lines of inquiry to establish any potential motivation as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public linked to this matter.”Murphy urged the public to “remain vigilant” and alert the police if they saw anything suspicious.The nature of the plot was not publicly known but security services have warned about the growing threat from Iran-backed criminals.In the second operation, two Iranian nationals were arrested in north-west London and a third in west London on Saturday. They were arrested and detained under section 27 of the National Security Act 2023, which criminalises anybody involved in “foreign power threat activity”, in this case from Iran.View image in fullscreenA police forensic officer searches a house in Rochdale on Sunday.Photograph: Ryan Jenkinson/Getty ImagesKen McCallum, the head of MI5, said in October that Tehran was behind “plot after plot” in the UK and that it had uncovered five new planned attacks last year, taking the total since January 2022 to 20. Officers were giving their fullest attention to any increase in “Iranian state aggression in the UK”, he added.Footage verified by the Guardian showed armed military personnel storming a terraced property alongside specialist firearms officers in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, as they arrested a 40-year-old man.Marksmen carrying semi-automatic rifles and wearing helmets and body armour could be seen in the footage removing a partly clothed man from the building in handcuffs before ordering him to the ground.Another man, also an Iranian, was arrested by armed officers near a busy children’s play area in an affluent suburb of Stockport, leaving residents shaken.“It’s terrifying,” said Sarah Cash, 49, who was told by police she could not collect her son from the play area in Cheadle Heath where the arrest was conducted on Saturday evening.Cash said she was concerned about the alleged target of the attack – which police have not disclosed for operational reasons – and whether there was still any risk: “Where is that premises? There’s so many big things around here – there’s Manchester airport, the Co-op Arena.”Images from the scene showed a number of masked officers along the tree-lined street where the suspect was detained outside a £12,000-a-year preparatory school.In Rochdale, neighbours of the 40-year-old Iranian man who was arrested said they were “really terrified” as heavily armed officers swooped on the quiet terraced street shortly before 6pm on Saturday.Amy Openshaw, 36, said her five-year-old daughter was playing in their garden with her six- and nine-year-old nieces when they ran inside saying “masked men” had told them to get in the house.She said: “As a mum you think: what do you mean masked men in my garden? We heard a big bang. It sounded like a bomb had gone off – it was well loud. It ricocheted through the house.”Another neighbour, who lives three doors down, said she did not know the Iranian man but believed he lived in the house with three or four others.“It was really terrifying,” she said. “It’s a house that homes vulnerable people. You just see them coming and going all the time.”Of the moment police raided the property, she added: “I heard the bang but I felt the bang at the same time. I ran upstairs. I just saw a flood of people run past my window. There were people with guns pointing towards the end house.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

All three suffered minor injuries and have been discharged from hospital.A 49-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. Police said the collisions, which took place at about 2.30pm on Saturday, were not being treated as terrorism-related.John Webster, an assistant chief constable for GMP, said: “Firstly, our thoughts are with the family of the victim who has sadly lost their life in this tragic case. The actions of a single person have caused significant damage to the people of Rochdale.”Addressing online speculation about the driver’s identity and ethnicity, Webster said: “The suspect is a white male currently in custody and no further details can be released at this time.”He also stressed the collisions were unrelated to counter-terrorism activity in the area, after separate arrests were made in Rochdale on Saturday as part of a planned operation.Webster added. “This incident caused significant disruption yesterday and I thank the public for their cooperation and understanding while our officers conducted their inquiries. We are committed to this investigation and have significant resources dedicated to it.“To all those people affected by yesterday’s tragic events, community solidarity and unity is vital in times like these and especially for the families and friends of those impacted by this incident.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The party has said it wants to cut diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) officers and work at the councils it controls, despite this being a very small part of their budgets, with most money spent on social care and education.Yusuf said Reform would introduce taskforces to audit spending in the councils where it had won control and suggested the party would be digging into what local authority job roles involved in order to cut costs.“If you take Lincolnshire county council, yes, they do not currently have somebody with the job title ‘DEI officer’, [but] they do spend considerable money on DEI initiatives,” he said.Yusuf said the party was “realistic” about the fact the levers of change at a local level “pale in comparison” to the powers of Westminster. “That’s why this is part of a journey to making Nigel the prime minister with a Reform majority,” he said.Andrea Jenkyns, Reform’s new Greater Lincolnshire mayor and a former Conservative MP, also confirmed her suggestion that immigrants could be housed in tents, saying the UK was “acting like bees to honey by putting people in hotels”.“This is taxpayers’ money and it should actually be tents, not rent,” the former Tory minister told LBC.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was not immediately clear whether the move would target production companies, foreign or American, producing films overseas.Film and television production in Los Angeles has fallen by nearly 40% over the last decade, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region’s production. At the same time, governments around the world have offered more generous tax credits and cash rebates to lure productions, and capture a greater share of the $248bn that Ampere Analysis predicts will be spent globally in 2025 to produce content.The announcement from Trump comes after he triggered a trade war with China, and imposed global tariffs which have roiled markets and led to fears of a US recession. The film industry has already been feeling the effects of the tariffs, as China in April responded to the announcements byreducing the quotaof American movies allowed into that country.China is the world’s second largest film market after the US, although in recent years domestic offerings have outshone Hollywood imports.Former senior commerce department official William Reinsch, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said retaliation against Trump’s foreign movies tariffs would be devastating.“The retaliation will kill our industry. We have a lot more to lose than to gain,” he said, adding that it would be difficult to make a national security or national emergency case for movies.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump tariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The results – similar to the debuts of Eternals ($71m) and Ant-Man and the Wasp ($75m) – suggested Marvel’s malaise won’t be so easy to snap out of.Some had expected a bigger opening for Thunderbolts* because of the film’s good word of mouth. Unlike most recent MCU entries, reviews (88% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) have been excellent for Thunderbolts*, directed by Jake Schreier and starring Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Sebastian Stan. Audiences gave it an “A-” CinemaScore.That kind of response should power the movie to strong business in the coming weeks. Though bigger MCU films – including 2024’sDeadpool & Wolverine(with a $211m opening on the way to $1.34bn worldwide) – have monopolized movie screens immediately, Thunderbolts* could gather steam more steadily – or it could go down as another example of Marvel struggling to rekindle its golden touch.Thunderbolts* review – Florence Pugh is saving grace of Marvel’s hit-and-miss messRead moreMarvel spent about $180m to produced the movie, which added $86.1m in overseas sales. The film also teases the next MCU chapter,The Fantastic Four: First Steps, due out 25 July.“Marvel set the bar so high for so many years that a $76m opening may seem to some like it should have done $100m or something like that,” said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst for Comscore. “This is a great reset. They’re hitting the reset with Thunderbolts*. The great reviews and the word-of-mouth should hold it [in] good stead.”The Walt Disney Co also might not have expected such stout competition fromRyan Coogler’s Sinners. The Warner Bros release, which had led the box office the last two weeks, continued to hold remarkably well. In its third week, it grossed $33m, a dip of only 28%.Sinners, a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Michael B Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown, has proven a spring sensation in theaters. It has collected $179.7m domestically and $236.7m globally thus far.Warner Bros also nabbed third place withA Minecraft Movie, thesmash-hitvideo game adaptation. In its fifth weekend, it rung up another $13.7m to bring its North American gross to nearly $400m. Worldwide, it has totaled $873.4m. Warner Bros added Block Party Edition screenings over the weekend for a sing-along and “meme-along” experience. The film has seen somerowdy screenings from TikTok-inspired moviegoers.Has Marvel shot itself in the foot by bringing superfreak Sentry into Thunderbolts*?Read moreMore than three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on set, the Alec Baldwin westernRustarrived in theaters. Its release brought some closure to one ofHollywood’s greatest tragedies. Distributor Falling Forward Films didn’t report box office, but estimates suggested Rust grossed approximately $25,000 in 115 theaters.Following Hutchins’ death, the film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, wassentenced to prisonfor involuntary manslaughter. First assistant director David Halls wassentenced to probationafter pleading no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon. Involuntary manslaughter charges against Baldwin, a co-producer on the film, were twice dismissed,in 2023and againin 2024.As part of a wrongful death settlement, Matt Hutchins, Hutchins’ husband, was made an executive producer on the film.Also opening over the weekend wasThe Surfer, starring Nicolas Cage as a man trying to surf a “locals-only” Australian beach. The Madman Films release collected a modest $674,560 from 884 theaters.Explore more on these topicsUS newsMarvelSuperhero moviesWalt Disney CompanynewsShareReuse this content"

Smoke could be seen billowing from the roof of one home in the Wood Ranch section of the community, which lies nearly 50 miles (80km) north-west ofLos Angeles.Wreckage could be seen between the two homes. The Ventura county fire department confirmed that residents were inside at the time but said they evacuated with no reported injuries. Both homes sustained structural damage and were impacted by the fire, authorities said.About 40 firefighters were on scene. With the flames out, they began working on salvage.Officials initially reported one death. Later on Saturday, the Simi Valley police department said the pilot, a passenger and a dog in the airplane died.As of Sunday, authorities had not released any information about the occupants of the single-engine Van’s RV-10, which is a popular homebuilt plane sold in kit form. They also did not say what might have caused the crash.The plane crashed into the backyard and dining room of Arman Hovakemian’s home. Hovakemian told the Los Angeles Times that he was doing yard work when he noticed the plane above, circling lower and lower in the hillside neighborhood.He ran inside to get his wife, Armineh, and their Pomeranian dog, Koko, and they fled the property. A loud bang followed and the fuselage landed where he had been standing in the yard just moments before, he said.“I’m numb. It hasn’t sunk in yet,” Hovakemian said on Saturday as dozens of firefighters and police officers surrounded his home. “We’re fortunate we were able to get out.”In security video recorded by a neighbor that was viewed by the Times, the plane can be heard circling the neighborhood for nearly three minutes and flying close to homes at points. In another video, the plane can be seen shooting straight up into the clouds then dropping down again.In January, another Van’s RV-10 crashed into a warehouse in Fullerton, which is south-east of Los Angeles, while trying to make an emergency landing, killing the pilot and his teenage daughter and injuring 19 people in the building. A preliminary report issued by the NTSB said that plane appeared to have had a door ajar during flight.It will likely be weeks before the NTSB releases preliminary findings on the Simi Valley crash. A final report comes months later.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastPlane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”On Sunday, Kerger warned that some stations in smaller communities across the US could lose 40 to 50% of their funding. “And for them, it’s existential, and that’s what’s at risk if this funding goes away,” she said.NPR’s chief executive, Katherine Maher, who like Kruger was grilled by Republicans on Capital Hill last month over claims that programing at both operations was politically biased, said her organization is “looking at whatever options are available to us”.But she added: “I think it’s a little preliminary for us to speak to the specific strategies that we might take.”Maher warned that the impact to local radio stations was immediate, “especially in a time where we’re seeing an advance of news deserts across the nation, 20% of Americans don’t have access to another local source of news. The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities.”But the NPR boss also sought to resist the US president’s claims that her operation is left-leaning and pointed to reluctance byTrump administrationofficials to come on NPR shows.The point of public broadcasting, Maher said, is to “bring people together in those conversations and so, we have had a whole host of conservative voices on air of late”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re like a watch-keeper. They’re very important. And you can go out and take it down a new track. Help save the country. The people of this country, they know the truth when they hear it. That’s why the ratings, the approval numbers of the media, are so low.”However, ongoing arguments over media bias and threats to defund public broadcasters put children’s programming is at risk, including those that are not enrolled in formal pre-K schooling, Kerger warned on CBS.“That was the idea of Sesame Street and Mister Rogers, and everything that has followed since, is to make sure that children that do not have an access to a full array of resources have the opportunity to learn … That’s what’s at risk.” she said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpNPRPBSUS public radioUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The sheriff’s office did not disclose which state Backeberg was found in.“Further investigation has revealed that Ms Backeberg’s disappearance was by her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play,” the sheriff’s office said.According tothe Wisconsin justice department, Backeberg left her family home on 7 July in 1962. Backeberg’s babysitter claimed that she and Backeberg hitchhiked to Madison, Wisconsin, and then took a Greyhound bus to Indianapolis, Indiana. The babysitter last saw Backeberg – a mother of two – walking around the corner away from the bus stop.The Charley Project, which profiles missing persons,saidin a sinceupdated postthat Backeberg married her husband, Ronald Backeberg, when she was “about fifteen years old” and that that their “marriage was troubled and there were allegations of abuse”.Around the time of her disappearance, Backeberg had filed a criminal complaint against her husband, alleging that he had beat her and threatened to kill her, the BBCreports, citing the Wisconsin Missing Persons Advocacy non-profit group.It added that on the day Backeberg disappeared, she left home to collect her pay cheque from a woollen mill where she had worked.Backeberg was ultimately found 60 years later after her case was assigned to a detective for a “comprehensive review as part of an ongoing examination of cold case files”, the Sauk county sheriff’s office said. It added that part of the review involved “a thorough re-evaluation of all case files and evidence, combined with re-interviewing witnesses and uncovering new insights”.Speaking toWISN, detective Isaac Hanson, who found Backeberg, said he was able to locate her through her sister’s Ancestry.com account.“That was pretty key in locating death records, census reports, all kinds of data,” Hanson told the news station, adding: “Ultimately, we came up with an address … so I called the local sheriff’s department, said: ‘Hey, there’s this lady living at this address. Do you guys have somebody, you can just go pop in?’ … Ten minutes later, she called me, and we talked for 45 minutes.”“I think she just was removed and, you know, moved on from things and kind of did her own thing and lead her life … She sounded happy. Confident in her decision, no regrets,” Hanson added.Explore more on these topicsWisconsinUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The large airport is one of the major hubs for New York city and its surrounding area.The weekend slowdown in operations came afterUnited Airlinesannounced on Friday that it was cancelling 35 daily roundtrip flights from Newark due to poor technology and staffing issues surrounding the Federal Aviation Administration.In astatementon Friday, United Airlines’ CEO, Scott Kirby, said: “For many years, United has been very clear and vocal about the need to fix the Air Traffic Control system in EWR. While we enthusiastically support the efforts underway to permanently and structurally fix the FAA, the long-simmering FAA challenges boiled over this week.”“In the past few days, on more than one occasion, technology that FAA air traffic controllers rely on to manage the airplanes coming in and out of Newark airport failed – resulting in dozens of diverted flights, hundreds of delayed and canceled flights and worst of all, thousands of customers with disrupted travel plans,” he said.Kirby went on to say that technology issues at the airport were compounded after more than 20% of the FAA controllers for EWR reportedly walked off the job.“Keep in mind, this particular air traffic control facility has been chronically understaffed for years and without these controllers, it’s now clear – and the FAA tells us – that Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead,” he added.Explaining the cuts which come at an “already reduced schedule at Newark”, Kirby said the airline had no choice but to cancel the flights, as there is “no way to resolve the near-term structural FAA staffing issues”.He also said that United Airlines has been urging the government for years to limit the number of flights “to what the airport can realistically handle”.Meanwhile, speaking to MSNBC correspondent Tom Costello, an air traffic controller said that it is not safe to fly out of Newark. “He said: ‘It is not safe. It is not a safe situation right now for the flying public,’” Costellotold the Daily Beast, adding: “He just said that to me, and separately: ‘Don’t fly into Newark. Avoid Newark at all costs.’”According to the FAA, the delays are caused by a shortage of air traffic controllers. AsDonald Trump’s administration continues its mass federal firingsincluding FAA safety workersdespite a slew ofdeadly crashessince inauguration day, transportation secretary Sean Duffy is urging more people to become air traffic controllers.On Thursday, Duffy said at a press conference that the transportation department is seeking to increase employment at the FAA, aiming to hire at least 2,000 controllers this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We can’t snap our fingers to make up the numbers.”The transportation department isofferinga slew of incentives, including a 30% salary increase for new hires as well as a $5,000 bonus upon completion of the flight academy. The department is also offering a $10,000 award for academy graduates who are assigned to one of 13 hard-to-staff air traffic facilities.The new campaign to hire more air traffic controllers comes just months after the US presidentbaselessly claimedthat Democrats and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies were responsible for falling aviation standards and the fatalWashington DC plane crashin January that killed 67 people.Following a string of deadly flight accidents, a February pollrevealedthat Americans’ confidence in aviation has slipped, with 64% of Americans said they believe air travel is very or somewhat safe – a decrease from 71% of Americans who indicated so last year.Explore more on these topicsUS newsNew JerseyNew YorkFlightsUnited AirlinesTrump administrationAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

The busiest seaport in the western hemisphere and one of the busiest in the world, approximately 15,000 longshore workers usually pull shifts around the clock, moving billions of dollars’ worth of cargo in cars, agriculture, auto parts, toys, clothes and furniture.This week, however, the port is shining a little less brightly. As a result of the Trump administration’s decision to subject imports to a minimum 10% tariff (and levies far higher for goods from 57 countries), roughly a third of the traffic at the port has ground to a halt, according to Eugene Seroka, the chief executive officer of the Port of Los Angeles.With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA’s waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13.“One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA’s Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected.What happens in the port doesn’t stay in the port, echoed long-time labor activist and former Los Angeles harbor commissioner Diane Middleton. “One way or the other, cargo that comes in here goes to all 435 US congressional districts. Everyone in the US will feel this.”The port, which handles 40% of all containerized imports into the country, is widely seen as a bellwether for the entireUS economy. For months leading up to the election and inauguration, the docks were abuzz. Large retailers especially were front-loading – stocking up on merchandise in fear of what might be to come. Now that the tariffs are here, experts say the front-loaded stock will only last six to eight weeks.Trump, who meted out the harshest tariffs to China, Vietnam and Cambodia, has referred to his 2 April announcement as “liberation day”. To those immediately affected, however, chaos and anxiety are better ways to describe it.Trump has made dizzying statements, sometimes even suggesting certain tariffs may not last, Middleton noted. “He’s saying, ‘I’m negotiating 200 deals. There’ll be a deal with China in no time,’” said Middleton. “And the Chinese are saying, ‘We’re not talking to anybody.’ So there are contradictions, and who do you believe?”View image in fullscreenShips are shown offshore at the port of Long Beach.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersVivian Malauulu, a night-shift longshore worker, believes what she sees. “When ships are docked on our berths, we’re busy – there’s manning, dispatch activity, job orders, and 24-hour operations across day, night, and what we call “hoot” shifts.” Now there are “fewer imports, and fewer vessels calling at our terminals”, said Malauulu, who is also a local 13 officer.Workers who previously clocked full work-weeks have already been slashed to three or four shifts. She and co-workers, all accustomed to good-paying union jobs, are now tightening their purse strings – eliminating luxuries like family outings and entertainment. “There’s definitely concern on the docks,” said Malauulu.The west coast-based ILWU has a long history of backing progressive ideas. ILWU vice-president Brandi Good, along with a handful of other labor union representatives, spoke briefly at Bernie Sanders’ recent “Standing Up to Oligarchy” rally in downtown Los Angeles.But Malauulu said that not all individual members rebuffed Trump. Neither did the ILWU’s counterpart on the east coast – the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA). ILA president Harold Daggett had a well publicized visit with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.“Some members, like many working-class Americans across the country, were drawn to Trump because he sounded like he was speaking directly to them,” said Malauulu. Messaging about “bringing jobs back”, being “tough on China” and protecting American industries felt like it aligned with labor values, she said. Malauulu says too many people did not take the time to really dig into Trump policies and the potential effects. Now they are experiencing the result.Herrera hopes, however, that the focus among port workers can remain on strength and unity. Because of California’s location, the ports here get more traffic from Asia. But all US ports and longshore workers will be negatively impacted. They need to stick together, he says.“We are the most resilient workforce in the world. During the Covid pandemic, we kept moving the world’s cargo because we couldn’t work remotely. Now, with this situation, we’re all just hoping that there’s some type of resolve because at the end of the day it’s about the American worker, the blue-collar worker, that’s being hurt – and the consumer and the communities.”The situation on the waterfront, however, does not appear to be resolving any time soon. In mid-April, the Trump administration announced new rules that will also phase in port fees on many ships built in China. Jamieson Greer, the head of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), which formulated the rules, said the fees are designed to “reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the US supply chain and send a demand signal for US-built ships”.The USTR action says that in the first phase, the charge will be $50 per net ton per US voyage, increasing incrementally to $140 per net ton by 17 April, 2028. The fees, which could amount to millions, will be charged up to five times per year per vessel. The charges have been dialed back since they were first floated by the Trump administration and there may be additional carveouts, but Beijing has nonetheless vowed to retaliate.The Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach have tripled the number of projected blank sailings – or canceled ships. The ports are projecting 30 combined blank sailings for this month, up from 10 in April.“The men and women of the ILWU are strong and resilient. We are accustomed to peaks and valleys so, for now, we’re just trying to remain as positive as we can,” said Herrera. “If and when the work comes back, we’ll be here.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaTrump tariffsUS economyEconomicsWest CoastLos AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

I will give it away eventually. The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine.”Buffett made the announcement at the end of a five-hour question-and-answer session, and did not take any queries about his retirement plans. The only board members who knew about the announcement in advance were his children, Howard and Susie Buffett, he said. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, was unaware, but stood to join the crowd in applauding his boss.Abel, 62, who was born in Alberta, Canada, has been Buffett’s designated successor as CEO since 2001. He is a 25-year Berkshire veteran and already manages all of the conglomerate’s non-insurance businesses including dozens of fossil energy, chemical, real estate and retail operations.The JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said Buffett represented “everything that is good about American capitalism and America itself – investing in the growth of our nation and its businesses with integrity, optimism and common sense”.He said: “I’ve learned so much from him to this very day, and I am honoured to call him a friend.”Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said in a statement that there had never been anyone like Buffett, and that countless people, himself included, had been “inspired by his wisdom”.Cook said: “It’s been one of the great privileges of my life to know him. And there’s no question that Warren is leaving Berkshire in great hands with Greg.”Buffett has led the Omaha-based company since 1965, and is credited by many with transforming Berkshire from a flailing textiles manufacturer into a $1.03tn (£776bn) conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy and other sectors. He built the conglomerate alongside his adviser and vice-chairman, Charlie Munger, whodied aged 99 in 2023.Buffett will be ending his career on a high. Berkshire Hathaway class-A shares, the type held by Buffett himself and his earliest investors, have risen by about 20% in the year to date. In the past five years they have more than tripled in value, and closed at a record high on Friday.For decades, thousands of investors have descended upon Omaha to attend Berkshire Hathaway’s annual general meeting.Buffett, a longtime Democratic mover and shaker, did not endorse Kamala Harris in 2024 or Joe Biden in 2020. He had previously endorsed Barack Obama twice and Hillary Clinton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to Forbes, Buffett has a net worth of $168.2bn.Earlier on Saturday, Buffett warned about the dire global consequences of Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors gathered at the annual meeting that “there’s no question that trade can be an act of war”.Buffett said Trump’s trade policies had raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world. He said: “It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done.“We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best.”In February, Berkshire reported athird straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44bn, in 2024. It is unclear what impact Trump’s tariffs will have on Berkshire’s 189 operating businesses and shareholder profits.Buffett was a student of Benjamin Graham, a British-born American economist known as the “father of value investing”, at Columbia Business School in the early 1950s. In the following decades Buffett developed a highly successful investment style, revered for its practical approach to stock-picking.He is now regarded by many as the best investor in the world. The market value of Berkshire Hathaway’s shares has grown by an annualised 19.9% a year from 1965 to 2024, according to the company. That is almost double the blue chip S&P 500 index over the same period, which has delivered a 10.4% return, including dividends.Nevertheless, Buffett has faced his share of controversies including anti-trust investigations and criticism from fire victimsafter Berkshire’s PacifiCorp utilityfailed to shut off power lines during a Labor Day weekend windstorm in 2020, leading to deadly wildfires spreading in Oregon and northern California.Speaking before the retirement bombshell, Abel said that “keeping the lights on” was no longer a priority for the conglomerate’s utilities when the threat of wildfires became excessive. He said: “It’s around protecting the general public and being sure the fire doesn’t spread further.”Explore more on these topicsWarren BuffettNebraskanewsShareReuse this content"

They have fallen by more than 30% in the past 12 months as a turnaround plan under the chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, has failed to inspire investors and oil prices have fallen.Shell may also wait for BP to reach out for another possible suitor to make the first move, those familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Deliberations are allegedly still in the early stages, and Shell could decide to focus on share buybacks and smaller acquisitions rather than such a big merger, according to the report.The combination of Britain’s biggest oil companies would be one of the largest deals ever in the sector. Shell’s market value of £145.6bn is more than double that of BP, at £55.9bn.A spokesperson for Shell told the Guardian: “As we have said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.”A spokesperson for BP declined to comment.In February, Auchincloss promised to “fundamentally reset” BP’s strategy, with the changes expected to include a watering down of its climate commitments and the pursuit of new fossil fuel projects in an attempt to bolster its market value.The company’s profitsdropped by almost 50%in the first three months of this year to $1.4bn (£1bn), down from $2.7bn in the same period last year. Its flagging share price has also made the company a target for the New York hedge fund Elliott Management.The shares have lagged behind other oil and gas firms in recent years after its former chief executive Bernard Looney set BP on course to become a net zero energy company. He left BP abruptly in September 2023 after admitting he failed to fully disclose his relationships with female colleagues to the board.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re doing the “bare minimum” on Mondays, “cushioning” their careers with side gigs, “rage applying” to vent their frustrations and “coffee badging” to protest return-to-office policies.US workers are “ghost quitting” (checking out without actually leaving their jobs) and pretending to work when actually practicing “productivity theater”. They’re taking paid time off without authorization in the form of “hush trips” and “quiet vacations”. They’re suffering from “Zoom doom” and paying an “emotional labor tax”. According to the latest polls, things are so bad that they’re “quietly cracking”.They triggered the “great resignation” but are now practicing the “great stay”. Meanwhile, employers are “quietly firing” some of them while “quietly promoting” others by giving them more work with less recognition or just “quietly cutting” them, which is reassigning employees to less important roles. Don’t complain. Just be quiet.What’s next? “Mute commuting”? “Calendar cluttering”? “Deadline doodling”?One thing’s for certain: these reports aren’t going to end anytime soon. They’re catchy and they get clicks. They’re fun to talk about at parties and on late-night TV programs. We can all expect lots more pithy phrases and clever terms describing how unhappy our workforce is for the foreseeable future. But we should all take these reports with a grain of salt. Why?For starters – and I won’t name names but you can read the links above – most of these eye-catching, clickbait-y terms are defined by surveys conducted by HR firms, HR media sites, HR software providers and polling companies looking for media attention. They tend to survey hundreds of employees at a time out of a workforce of hundreds of millions using a questionable definition of “statistical sampling”. And they all have an agenda. Want your employees to be happier? Buy our software! Hire our firm! Read more of our research! When it comes to most of these reports, you’ll find what I’ve found: science is not a priority.Next, it’s easy to make employers the bad guys. Any survey that sticks it to the man is going to get eyeballs. The reality? People I know are mostly happy with their jobs and they understand the pressures their employers face. They’re grown-ups who know that work is work and the perfect job doesn’t exist.Then again, isn’t being dissatisfied with your job a good thing? It says that we want to make things better – we are driven by ambition. I’m not judging people who are happy clocking in and clocking out of their jobs. Good for them. If you’re not happy at your job, maybe that’s because you want more out of your life, and that’s normal. See if you can change the job you do, change how you work. Failing that, change your employer, maybe start your own business. But in the meantime, you still need to do your job.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessEmploymentcommentShareReuse this content"

Those selling Australian-made goods now have to pay duties of 10%, while companies relying on Chinese manufacturing, such as Blaq, face a whopping 145% tariff.A month on from Trump’s “liberation day” announcement, Australian exporters are trying to work out how to stay afloat. Some are closing, others are finding new export markets, and some are profiting from the chaos. Many are holding their breath in anticipation of more trade changes.Keep calm and pour onTariff uncertainty, sparking fears of higher costs and lower US sales, threwlocal businesses and investors into a spin. The share market shed nearly $200bn in value in less than a week, as the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 slid 8%.Those losses have since been recovered, helped by a growing realisation that the direct impact of the tariffs on local companies would be limited.While the US is the primary market for Jarmyn’s Blaq, American customers are just one of many for companies like Tyrrell’s Wines.The company’s general manager, Bruce Tyrrell, sold tens of thousands of cases annually to the US in the 1990s, but that has fallen to less than 3,000.“You never move away from the US, but it’s probably not going to be number one priority,” the fourth-generation winemaker says.View image in fullscreenBruce Tyrrell of Tyrrell’s Wines started selling to Americans when Richard Nixon was president, but will now focus on new Asian markets.Photograph: James BennettAmericans bought $24bn worth of Australian goods in 2024, less than India and South Korea, while Japan bought triple that figure and China seven times as much,Australian Bureau of Statisticsdata shows.According to a Westpacanalysis, the tariffs may barely even touch firms selling agricultural or mining goods to the US, though manufacturers and beef farmers are more vulnerable.Despite the market frenzy, the tariff regime isn’t expected to deal direct damage to Australia’s economy in the short term, Stephen Smith, partner at Deloitte Access Economics, says.“That might appear counterintuitive … [but] only around 4% of Australia’s goods exports by value flow to the US, meaning the direct impact of the 10% tariff applied to Australia is likely to be immaterial,” Smith wrote in a recent note.The bigger risk for local businesses from the collapse of an 80-year global consensus and an ongoing trade war between the US and China is crumbling confidence around the world – “a cause for deep concern”, Smith added.Trump first threatened tariffs as high as 49% around the world thendeferred those until after June, leaving most countries on the 10% rate.

But it is hurrying its products back into the US as tariffs disrupt bigger competitors including Nivea and Burt’s Bees.“It’s exciting, because the big, dominant corporations are scrambling, and while they scramble and move at the speed of a glacier, we get in there,” he says.View image in fullscreenAndrew Coppin of Farmbot is counting his lucky stars he moved to Texas last year to set up a factory for his growing American customer baseIn June, Chapman’s colleagues will be in Texas setting up a Clean and Pure warehouse.

Taking the win forMcLarenwith a piece of relentlessly controlled dominance, and in so doing determinedly maintaining his place out front in a tight title fight, Piastri laid down a marker in Florida that he will be exceptionally hard to beat this season.Disappointed on missing out on a win in the sprint race on Saturday, Piastri and his team executed this race with perfection to secure a remarkable win, beating his teammate Lando Norris into second place, the British driver’s hopes of victory extinguished within moments of the lights going out when he went wheel to wheel withMax Verstappen, went off and fell to sixth. Verstappen could manage only fourth from pole, behind the Mercedes of George Russell, while Alex Albon took a superb fifth for Williams.F1: Piastri wins Miami GP in dominant McLaren one-two finish – as it happenedRead moreLewis Hamilton however had another somewhat trying afternoon in the Ferrari, finishing eighth, after another testy run-in with his team over the radio.Piastri has shown dominance from pole repeatedly this season, with this his fourth win butat the Hard Rock Stadiumhe had to work for it and ensured he remains front and centre in the championship fight. He now leads Norris by 16 points with Verstappen in third, 32 points back.He was driving at his very best, his confidence high but matched with the calm assurance he has behind the wheel and with which he was able to deliver, despite being chased to the flag by Norris. The scale of their advantage over the rest of the field was breathtaking. Once both drivers had clean air out front having passed Verstappen, they took off, with Piastri finishing 37 seconds up on Russell.Drivers standingsFor Norris the opening had been costly. Verstappen just held his lead through turn one but locked up and squeezed Norris off, with the British driver losing places to sixth in the process in what was judged a racing incident. Piastri shot through and, after he had passed Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli, took off after the world champion.They duelled for several laps to thrilling effect but on lap 14 Piastri finally made it stick at turn one, by which point Norris had come back and almost caught them. However the time it then took him to pass Verstappen, another four laps, was all the window Piastri needed and during which he put nine seconds on his teammate, a gap that was all but impossible for Norris to overcome by the close with the two cars so closely matched.“Max put up a good fight, and I just paid the price,” said Norris. “What can I say? If I don’t go for it, people complain. If I go for it, people complain. With Max it’s crash or don’t pass, and I just had to get him in the right position.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton, whose relationship with his Ferrari team remains fractious, makes a pit stop.Photograph: Shawn Thew/ReutersQualifying had been disappointing for Piastri but when it mattered he and Norris put the McLaren’s superior race pace to use with clinical effect.Once he had passed Verstappen after a stout defence from the Dutchman, Piastri was all but untouchable and he knew it showed how far he and the team have come.“I remember two years ago in Miami we were genuinely the slowest team, I think we got lapped twice,” he said. “To now have won the grand prix by over 35 seconds to third is an unbelievable result.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once more neither he nor Charles Leclerc were within a sniff of a podium and reduced to fighting the Williams of Carlos Sainz. When Hamilton was clearly quicker Ferrari had Leclerc move over for him into seventh place but only after the British driver expressed intense frustration at the time the team took to make the decision. “Have a tea break while you’re at it,” was his exasperated response.They then had him give the place back later in the race and, when told Sainz was closing, Hamilton’s response of: “You want to let him past as well?” was weighted with sarcasm and discontent. Another indication the relationship with theScuderiastill has no little development in it.For all that Verstappen andRed Bullhad managed to find a better window for their car this weekend, the McLaren was very much the class of the field in race pace and once more notably easier on its tyres than its competitors. It is also notable this season that the two areas Piastri was considered unable to match Norris last year, qualifying and tyre management, he has very much mastered and that is giving him a distinct advantage in the title fight, for which he might now be considered favourite.Red Bull launched a protest after the race stating they believed Russell had not slowed under yellow flags during the virtual safety car period but it was rejected by the stewards and the classification remained unchanged.Typically for the grand sense of fun and spectacle Miami presents, before the race the drivers had taken to the track in specially built full-size Lego replicas of their car consisting of 400,000 blocks and weighing over a ton and a half. They drove the track at 20km/h and proved enormously popular with the drivers but when the serious business was finished in Florida it must be considered that it is Piastri who now has all the building blocks in place for a serious tilt at the title.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportUS sportsLando NorrisMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

The NFL has said it will investigate the allegations. Tucker has maintained he did not act inappropriately towards any of his accusers.Ravens kicker Justin Tucker denies claims of sexual misconduct towards massage therapistsRead more“From the standpoint of the investigation and all that, we don’t know anything. We haven’t been given any information – as it should be. It’s all done the way it’s done,” Harbaugh said on Sunday. “So you can’t make any decisions based on that. Every decision we make has to be based on football.“There’s a lot of layers to that. You’ve got a rookie kicker in here. You took him in the sixth round, early in the sixth round. He’s a talented guy. Just from a football standpoint – salary cap, all the different things that you just take into consideration – whatever we decide to do over the next few weeks will be based on football.”The accusations against Tucker include claims that he exposed his genitals, brushed some of the therapists with his penis and left ejaculate on treatment tables. Two spas told the Banner they had banned Tucker from returning. One therapist who spoke to the Banner described Tucker’s alleged behavior as “really degrading”. Another said that: “I can’t watch sports anymore. I see his face everywhere.”Tucker is considered by many to be the greatest kicker inNFLhistory, and holds the records for longest field goal and career field goal percentage. He has been named to the Pro Bowl seven times since he joined the Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2012. However, the 35-year-old had the worst on-field season of his career in 2024, converting just 73.3% of his field goals, compared to a career average of 89.1%.Meanwhile, Mike Green, the Ravens’ second-round pick in this year’s draft, declined to discuss allegations of sexual assault that have been directed at him.“Every team asked me, and I’ve been completely open about everything,” Green said. “It’s something that I had to go through, and I got through it.”Green played at Virginia and then at Marshall. He said at theNFLscouting combine that he transferred after being accused of sexual assault for a second time. Green told reporters at the combine that he also was accused of sexual assault in high school. He said he was never charged and insisted he did nothing wrong.He was asked Sunday how he ended up facing two separate allegations.“I’m just focused right now on moving forward with my career at the Ravens,” he said. “I’m blessed to be here. It’s an honor.”The Ravens said after drafting Green that they did their “due diligence” on him.Explore more on these topicsBaltimore RavensNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe he won’t get told off too much.Palmer breaks goal drought as champions Liverpool beaten by ChelseaRead moreHappily for Palmer, two minutes into stoppage time Chelsea were awarded a penalty. He buried it, did the chilly brrr-it’s-cold stuff, and was mobbed pointedly by his teammates, including Robert Sánchez who ran the length of the pitch just to make it quite clear this was also about him.It was Palmer’s first goal since 14 January, his first in 19 games to go with two assists in that time. Chelsea have been on an upturn in results in the last few weeks. But this is clearly not the greatest use of Cole Palmer, and another note in the lingering bad taste around this place at times. (Chelsea, covering every variable, even have a full-back whose name translates as “Bad Taste”).In his TV interview after the game Palmer talked about the “idiots and trolls” of social media, which seemed a bit of a shame in victory. But then, Palmer’s mood, the process of Palmer-maximisation, remains an unanswered theme of Enzo Maresca’s management. How is this one going to play out?This was an excellent afternoon for Chelsea.Victory makes it fourin a row at just the right time. They still need to go to Newcastle and Nottingham Forest, but look in a good position not to be standing when the music stops.Perhaps the stars are even aligning a little. The Club World Cup is already a massive windfall. Chelsea will get £70m or so just for getting through the group stage, bonus money, Fifa money, Dazn money, Saudi money. Chuck in £100m-odd from Uefa just for finishing in the top six. Chelsea can earn a huge amount this season for not doing very much very well.They were lucky here to come up against aLiverpoolteam that was basically half asleep. At times it felt like there were three entities on the pitch. Liverpool pretending to be Liverpool for the day. This mannered Chelsea team playing to save its mannered season.And also Palmer, a captive spirit on the right, but still the architect of this victory, even if watching him in this Chelsea team can feel a bit like watching Salvador Dalí pretend to be an accountant, diligently filing documents, notarising things, and all the while secretly painting a cup of fur under his desk.Stamford Bridge had a chilly, grudging late-spring feel. John Kerry was in the very expensive seats, the 81-year-old one-time US secretary of state watching on as a sputtering superpower with a confused sense of mission tried to assert itself on the world and yes, yes, insert your own home-from-home punchline here.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer celebrates after ending his goal drought.Photograph: Robin Jones/Getty ImagesChelsea scored with three minutes gone, the move made by Palmer’s swift pass out to Pedro Neto, whose cross was expertly finished by Enzo Fernández. And from the start Palmer played a little deeper on the right than you might have wanted him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is that a good idea? Half an hour in he received a rolling wave of applause for chasing Cody Gakpo back towards his own goal. Is this progress? It has been a theme of the season, the question of individualism, harnessing talent, allowing it to breathe in a suffocating positional game. Under Maresca, Palmer has looked like a ghost in the machine, unsurprisingly, given he is the only player in this team anywhere near his type and quality. There’s no one here for him to riff off, to blue-sky ideas with.For long periods his entire game was curling a pass into the run of Nicolas Jackson and watching, vaguely interested, as a kind of random ricochet ball took place, the chaos dribble theory.But Palmer made Chelsea’s second goal by doing another unusual thing, easing away from Kostas Tsimikas and crossing into a messy penalty area where the ball was hacked and scuffed and blootered about until eventually it went in off Jarell Quansah.That was pretty much that. For Liverpool, Darwin Núñez came on and bullocked about like a riderless horse in a jumps race. Roméo Lavia was excellent in the Chelsea midfield. And by the end Stamford Bridge was a happy place, even Maresca allowing himself a contained, controlled little caper on the touchline.He is an amazing figure, able to sustain at all times that air of long-suffering calm, the look of a manager for whom every turn, every disappointment is just another masterful feint in the unknowable masterplan of Enzo Maresca.At times it has looked a strange match-up. Buy all these young creative players. Then hire a systems manager who will turns them into units of telematic flesh, anti-adverts for themselves. There was a glimpse of something here. Whether it’s enough remains to be seen.Explore more on these topicsChelseaPremier LeagueLiverpoolanalysisShareReuse this content"

Last week’s yellow card against Augsburg kept him in the stands for Bayern Munich’s potential title clincher at RB Leipzig (a visibly annoyed Kane suggested referee Bastian Dankert had been “trying to make a name for himself” after the harsh booking, issued when he didn’t return the ball quickly enough after he was whistled for a foul). Then Yusuf Poulsen’s 95th-minute equaliser for the hosts meant Bayern weren’t quite there mathematically, even though Thomas Müller felt comfortable enough to lead the players and a trench-coated Kane through some frolics with the away fans on Saturday. Leverkusen only drawing at Freiburg on Sunday has, at last, finally sealed the deal. Kane’s Bayern destiny has been fulfilled, and no apparent jinx could get in the way this time.Bayern Munich win Bundesliga for 33rd time to delight Kane and KompanyRead moreOn the dayhe signed in August 2023Munich was balmy, in terms of weather and mood. It was the morning of Bayern’s DFL-Supercup game against RB Leipzig and as the thermometers crept above 30C, hot and bothered fans queued outside the multiple Bayern fan shops in the city centre with the aim of getting their hands on one item: the new, white-with-red-trim home jersey with “Kane 9” on the back. The red-on-white, multi-lined font of name and number – a throwback to the figures adorning the backs of Bayern’s 1974 European Cup winners – hinted at a new era of glory.And then the new legend, that of the Kane Curse, was born. That Saturday evening he took a place on the substitutes’ bench. By the time he was introduced by Thomas Tuchel Leipzig led 2-0; minutes after his entrance the champions and hosts trailed by three. What should have been the perfect soft launch, getting Kane off the ground at Bayern with some instant silverware, turned intoa deflating reality check. England’s captain had moved to Germany with the aim of breaking his trophy duck. The season curtain-raiser made clear that it just wouldn’t be that simple, asBayer Leverkusen spent the next nine monthsshowing him, and Bayern, how.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane holds up his new Bayern Munich shirt – the name and number styles a throwback to glories past – on arrival at the Allianz Arena in August 2023.Photograph: PA Wire/PANot that any of it was his fault because, frankly, Kane could not have done any more. Since day one “HerryKane” (as it is pronounced in Germany) has been a smash hit on and off the field, underlining that it is one thing to see a superstar from a distance and another to have him in your own backyard, appreciating every polished quality and nuance of his game. Thomas Müller was key in Kane’s adaptation, publicly cheerleading for him from the minute Kane arrived at the club’s Säbener Straße training ground and getting him on to the team council of senior players before the new arrival could speak even a few words of German.The numbers have been extraordinary – 44 goals in his debut season including 36 in theBundesliga, where for a long time he threatened Robert Lewandowski’s season record of 41 from 2020-21, which beat a seemingly unbeatable Gerd Müller milestone that had stood for almost five decades. Kane has added another 36 so far this term. His opener in the victory over St Pauli at the end of March took him to 100 goal involvements (77 goals, 23 assists) for Bayern.Yet the figures don’t fully explain how and why Kane has come to be the subject of such affection at Bayern. It might have been expected that the relationship would be transactional: elite club seeks elite goalscorer, frustrated star seeks superclub to scratch silverware itch.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane, Leroy Sané and Raphaël Guerreiro celebrate during the March win over St Pauli where Kane reached 100 goal involvements.Photograph: Angelika Warmuth/ReutersInstead it has turned out that Bayern and Kane were made for each other; on the pitch, where his relentless goalscoring is matched by his elite passing, feeding Jamal Musiala and the squad’s typically stacked wing talent; and off the pitch, where his good-natured embrace of club tradition (especially at supporter events) sits alongside his innate Englishness, rising above the usual ego-driven squabbles and the airing of dirty linen in public that often characterises life at FC Hollywood.It is not difficult to make the case that whereas Lewandowski was admired at Bayern, Kane is loved. You can argue this is partially because the Pole starred for a Bundesliga rival before he arrived, and partly because of the perception he fished for a move to La Liga a good while before the move to Barcelona came to fruition in 2022. But mainly it’s because Kane has it all. He is businesslike and relatable, star and servant, scorer and provider. Artisanandartist.It hasn’t all been plain sailing on an individual level. Keeping injury at bay has been a challenge, despite Bayern’s determination to protect their star asset (last season’s shock DFB-Pokal exit tothird-tier Saarbrücken, which a bemused-looking Kane watched from the bench as his side missed chance after chance before conceding a late winner, was a case in point).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It turned out the future England coach was right, with Kane’s back injury badly hampering his displays at Euro 2024.At that point brows began to furrow in Bavaria. Though his performance has been unimpeachable since arriving, paying a Bundesliga record fee of more than €100m for an established star heading into his 30s with a year left on his Tottenham contract was such a cultural break from German football’s norm that a sense of guilt and unease about it has never really gone away. The knowledge that Bayern put all their eggs in the Kane basket means every little knock he takes makes many reconsiderhow safe that investment was.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane keeps cool from the spot to score against Union Berlin.Photograph: Matthias Schräder/APKane has normally rebuffed any doubts with sheer weight of numbers. That was not the case in the Champions Leaguequarter-final with Interthis month, when he missed a string of clear chancesin the first (home) legin particular which Bayern, facing elite opponents while managing an extensive injury list, simply could not afford. Few, however, would think of chiding Kane for this. He has more than filled the Lewandowski-shaped hole that gaped before his arrival. He has lifted the players around him as only the elite can do and,in helping to pulverise Leverkusenin the previous Champions League round, he arguably broke the spirit of Xabi Alonso’s side, ensuring Bayern’s new competitors could not deny them the Bundesliga title as they did last season.Kane will not be denied any more. A regular spot playing in the Champions League is what he deserved on arriving, but the silverware is what he really wanted. Finally, it is what he has got – and he has plenty of time left to celebrate, and traditional beer showers to negotiate, back in Munich.Explore more on these topicsHarry KaneBayern MunichEuropean club footballBundesligafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had lost all six of those previous matches, including both those Paris finals in 2022 and 2023, the 2022 US Open final and the ATP finals. He has, at last, clinched one of the biggest titles in the game.Aryna Sabalenka seals Madrid Open hat-trick by dismantling GauffRead more“It is a mix of somewhat of a relief and happiness and just pure joy,” said the 26-year-old Ruud. “I know, based on the last years that I’ve had on tour, how tough it is to do well at the biggest tournaments, and I’ve never been able to get over the finish line as a champion, but today I was able to and this week here in Madrid, so extremely happy and proud, of course, that I was able to stay focused in the tournament.”After two supreme weeks in the Spanish capital, this is a painful defeat for Draper to digest after he led 5-3 in the opening set before conceding four consecutive games. He recovered impressively, fighting back to force a final set but he was outlasted by one of the best clay-court tennis players in the world.Still, Draper solidified his status as among the very top contenders in men’s tennis on every single surface and at all levels.“Just fresh off losing a really tough match in a final, it really hurts,” said the 22-year-old. “But at the same time, I thinkI’ve enjoyed a lot of really good successeshere, I’ve come through a lot of matches, and so maybe this loss and maybe being in a final and not quite getting over the line just helps me to fuel my fire a bit more that I can. I need to keep onpushing, I need to keep on improving.”Before this tournament, Draper’s best results on clay were a couple of quarter-finals at lowly ATP 250 events. He had never won three consecutive ATP matches on the surface or beaten a top-30 player. Although he fully believed he had the ability to thrive on clay, he arrived in Madrid searching for a breakthrough on the surface. He has done just that.“People say: ‘Oh, I’m not very good on the clay.’ Whereas I knew I was good on the clay,” said Draper. “I had a couple of really tight losses last year, and I just needed to get my foot in the door somewhere to show that I’m able to compete to a really high level on this surface. I think this week has shown that, and it’s shown it to myself, shown it to others.”View image in fullscreenCasper Ruud celebrates his first Masters 1000 title.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesAlongside his new career-high ATP ranking of No 5, Draper sits No 2 in the ATP race, which charts results within the calendar year and he is now the only British man, other than Andy Murray, to reach Masters 1000 finals on both hard and clay courts. Draper won at Indian Wells in March. There is no doubt that he has the ability to win a major title. “I’m really proud of the way I’ve been the first few months of this season,” he said.“I think the exciting thing is there’s so much more to come from myself. I feel like there’s still areas of my game that I can really improve, and that’s very motivating for me and my coach and my team that I honestly feel like I’m at the start of my journey. So I’m going to keep on improving and keep on pushing hard and keep these tough moments in my head to keep on driving myself to be better.”Ruud has now won 125 matches and 12 titles on clay over the past five years, more than any other player on the ATP tour since the beginning of 2020. “Even though I won today, my record in big finals is still not good, it’s 1-6,” he said. “I’ve been in many unbelievable and incredible positions in my career, and I’ve been able to experience some great things and, unfortunately, have been on the losing spectrum of many of those matches, but that’s OK. In many ways, my career has gone better than maybe I thought was possible sometimes.The man from Oslo added: “Of course I always dreamed about winning tournaments like this or grand slams or becoming world No 1, and I’ve been fairly close, but it’s not like I was serving for the match anytime or super-leading, like crazy, and then choked and lost, in a way.“So I’ve just played players that were better than me and I’ve tried to learn from that, and think that one day there will come another opportunity and maybe I can seize it and, I guess, that was the key to the victory today.”Explore more on these topicsTennisJack DrapernewsShareReuse this content"

Formula One,America’s latest sporting obsession, had finally carved out a home in South Florida and it fit Miami’s over-the-top image.Four years into F1’s20-year stayin the 305, the event has solidified itself as a place to see and be seen: everyone from Kardashians to A-list actors to sports stars has lined up for a joy ride around the turquoise circuit’s 19 corners.This Sunday’s race will be no different. But a few hundred feet outside Hard Rock Stadium’s walls sits a different side ofMiami, one that isn’t even within city limits. And Hard Rock’s history is an example of how much stadiums can have an effect on the people who live near them in the US.Welcome to Miami, where F1’s sunshine party draws a crowd every sport cravesRead moreMiami Gardens, 16 miles north of downtown Miami, is a thriving African-American city – an economic haven for Black Miamians forced out of other neighborhoods as Miami built up and out. In Miami Gardens, households, on average, bring in $60,000 a year and more than 13% of the city’s 110,000 people live in poverty. About 70% of residents are Black, according to the US Census Bureau.So when Joe Robbie, the founder of the Miami Dolphins, drew up plans for a stadium in the center of Miami Gardens in 1985 after downtown Miami raised the team’s rent, localsfearedthey would be pushed out of Miami Gardens. Then F1 came knocking on residents’ doors nearly 35 years later, setting up a race track attached to Hard Rock Stadium in the center of Miami Gardens. Locals uncapped sharpiesand took to the streetswith signs reading “Formula One ‘Millions,’ Our Health ‘Priceless’”.While residents may not position themselves outside the stadium this Sunday, concerns never entirely ceased.F1’s move to Miami Gardens followed a pattern: eventsthat whiter and wealthier neighborhoods opposed– like the world’s largest hip-hop festival – ended up at Hard Rock Stadium.The Miami Grand Prix is just the latest example. F1 proposed a race in downtown Miami in 2018, just as the sport began to swell stateside. Residents in a majority-white neighborhood filed a cease-and-desist order citing traffic and noise concerns. The potential for an F1 grand prix down Biscayne Boulevard was quickly squashed by the city council. Organizers pivoted their sights to Miami Gardens, the largest predominantly Black neighborhood in Florida.Treating working class, historically redlined communities as a dumping ground for undesirable spectacles is routine across the US and is “the path of least resistance”, Timothy Kellison, an associate professor at Florida State University who centers his research on how stadiums exacerbate environmental inequalities, said. “The decision doesn’t escape me that [the Miami GP] was proposed downtown and they said, ‘No, this will be too much disruption.’”Residents with addresses lining the stadium sued then-Miami-Dade County mayor Carlos Giménez, F1, Hard Rock Stadium and the Miami Dolphinsfor racial discrimination. Neighbors of Hard Rock Stadium, led by former county commissioners Betty Ferguson and Barbara Jordan, raised similar arguments as downtown Miami homeowners, including traffic and public health concerns. “We really believe it’s environmental racism,” Ferguson said at the time.But afterfailing to prove racially motivated malice, noise pollution was the smoking gun that never quite fired. Residents dropped their second lawsuit after their data didn’t point toward evidence that the GP could lead to hearing loss.The judge ruledthat any potential harm was “speculative” and “avoidable”. He recommended locals who had concerns stay inside their homes and wear earplugs.The Miami GP’s promoter, South Florida Motorsports, has measured air quality and noise across the circuit’s campus each year. The results show that noise and air pollution from 2022 to 2024 passed EPA and OSHA industry standards. “The air pollution figures are actually lower following the Miami GP than other events because we provide so many alternate transportation and ride-share options to reduce cars on the local roads,” a race spokesperson said.“That doesn’t mean that therefore there is no effect because they were unable to show noise pollution,” Kellison says.Despite locals saying they would continue to work within the political system for justice, the protests stopped. Facebook groups, like Miami Gardens Families Unite, haven’t posted since the inaugural grand prix. The Guardian spoke to a number of people who said they oppose the race, but none were willing to go on record. Equally, others say they are unbothered by, or support, the race.“The political system is probably not in [people who oppose the GP’s] favor right now,” Madeleine Orr, a sport ecologist who founded the Sport Ecology Group with Kellison, said.Over the past two years, Miami mayor Francis Suarezgarnered backlashfor attending the Miami GP, once with Florida’s wealthiest man and a second time with his private equity firm. Some of the same county commissioners who voted against F1’s presence in the community officially declared 4 May “Formula One Day” last year. One of those elected officials included Oliver Gilbert who, in 2019, said: “It’s not a place to dump events that are toxic to people.”View image in fullscreenFormula 1 has announced that the Miami Grand Prix will remain on the calendar through 2041, following a 10-year extension to its existing agreement with the promoter South Florida Motorsports.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesIt should be pointed out that even without the Miami GP, Hard Rock Stadium would still affect Miami Gardens. The jury is still out on how US sports stadiums,most of which are in cities, affect their surrounding neighborhoods.Supporters make the economic impact argument: stadiums funnel money into the local community through job creation and tax revenue boosts, along with transforming cities into more livable and desirable spaces by bringing more efficient buildings and natural disaster prevention to neighborhoods. Hard Rock Stadium is a top employer in the city and the 2025 F1 race will credential 18,000 people, the majority from Miami Gardens, to work the event. Fifteen locally owned restaurants will partner with the track. The first three years brought more than $1bn in economic impact and boosted bottom lines for the sport – the 2024 Miami race shattered F1’s viewership record.The F1 ruling body’s current environmental standards do not require circuits to think about a race’s impact on host communities, Orr said. However, she believes the sport is working in good faith to consider how its presence could affect locals. Orr will join the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) University as a visiting sustainability professor this year.There have been efforts to make sure the race benefits the local community. Before Hard Rock started hosting the grand prix, the stadium and the event promoter outlined a set of conditions with the Miami-Dade County Commission. The Community Benefits Agreement requires F1 to host the race “in a manner that provides substantial economic and community benefits that directly support city residents and locally-owned businesses to participate in the event and promote the city as the first majority African-American city to host a Formula 1 race.” That means providing $5m in community funding and committing to noise mitigation, air quality monitoring and racing outside of school hours. “F1 in Schools” included opening the sport’s paddock to local students and interns for STEM programming.Since the document was drawn up in 2021, the partnership has settled into a rhythm of community engagement: hosting a “Business of F1 Community Workshop,” creating scholarships for students at Miami Gardens’ two local universities, handing out 1,500 free tickets per year for residents and diverting food waste to local food banks. The stadium lessened traffic concerns with a $17m investment in tunnels and pedestrian bridges.Since the stadium moved to Miami Gardens, it has allocated a portion of parking revenues to a local neighborhood association.Ray Reyno, a Miami Gardens resident who moved to the area before the stadium was built, doesn’t mind the noise, claiming it could be worse, and focuses instead on the benefits the stadium has brought to the community. “It’s not like the [engines] that used to be loud,” Reyno said. “It’s not that loud.”Orr says bringing a grand prix to a city raises questions. “If we come to this place, we are going to necessarily have a carbon footprint,” she says. “But what are the exchanges we can have with the community? What kinds of tech transfer can we bring and then leave here? What kinds of solutions can be implemented at this place?”But not everyone was convinced by the Community Benefits Agreement. Kellison says some questioned whether the agreement was “enough to compensate for the disruption that [the race] is going to cause, environmentally, economically, just quality of life for a weekend.” Two county commissioners voted against the agreement.And those objections raise wider issues about stadiums, not just those that host F1 races. Critics claim they often exacerbate environmental and social inequality by aggravating air pollution, and limiting access to green space and water – issues that already disproportionately impact neighborhoods of color (across the US, predominantly Black zip codes tend to be more polluted and hotter on average than other areas).Miami Gardens residents arguedF1’s presence would amplify these issues.Even before the starting lights go out on Sunday afternoon and engines screech to life, locals will feel F1’s presence. For some, like Reyno, the stadium’s community efforts have righted its reputation. “I admire what they’re doing,” he says. “Makes the place more alive.”Orr is more circumspect. “Even given what I know and who I work with, I will probably side with residents on this,” she says. “I don’t know that I would want it in my backyard.”Kellison, who wrote and edited a book about the topic, draws a blank when it comes to the ideal place for a stadium. “I’ve been thinking about this for as long as I’ve been studying sport, and I don’t have an answer,” he said. Some localsproposedthat the GP take place 47 miles south, at the Homestead-Miami Speedway. But residents there have also raised noise and public health concerns.“I think it’s important to recognize the fact that this is not just an isolated group of naysayers who are ‘not my backyard’ people and would oppose everything,” Kellison says. “If they’ve been talking about events at the stadium or around the stadium site for a number of years, a number of decades, perhaps they’re on to something.”Calling in from his office on Florida State University’s campus, Kellison pauses and recalls a line he read once that stuck with him: “Race tracks aren’t meant to be in neighborhoods.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportUS sportsMiamifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Still, pretty much the last thing anyone expected Palmer to do in mid-January was to go 18 games without a goal in all competitions.Now, with the drought finally at an end courtesy of a late penalty against Liverpool ina 3-1 win for Chelsea, Maresca said that Palmer was “not happy” with his lack of goals in the last few months, and backed him to help the side “reach something important” in the crucial last few games of their season.Palmer breaks goal drought as champions Liverpool beaten by ChelseaRead moreChelsea are now all but certain to reach the Conference League final later this month, while also facing their Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in the hunt for the top five. With this in mind Palmer’s return to the scoresheet could scarcely have been better timed, even if Maresca insisted that his level had not dropped in recent months.“We saw Cole day by day in the training ground, and he was exactly the same way: scoring goals, happy, enjoying the session,” Maresca said. “Of course when he is not scoring goals he is not happy, because he wants to help the club reach something important. [Now] he is happy for sure, because we scored. But I didn’t see a different Cole from two months ago.“I said before that if we want to finish top five, we need Cole and Nico [Jackson] to score. Now we have three more [league] games, and on Thursday the second leg [in Europe], and hopefully he can help us.”Referencing his goal drought to Sky Sports afterwards, Palmer said: “Obviously shit happens. I went three months without scoring but it just gives me more motivation, more fight to do well, not just for myself but for the team.“You know yourself social media is just full of idiots, trolls or whatever. I don’t pay no attention. To score today I’m happy. It’s only one and I’ve got to keep improving to try and reach my levels. For anyone not getting chances, not scoring, you’re letting your team down at the end of the day.

The league could scarcely have hoped for a more engrossing finale. Ultimately, by the finest of margins,London City Lionesseswere promoted to the Women’s Super League after an outstanding individual goal from Isobel Goodwin helped them edge to a dramatic 2-2 draw away to their nearest title rivals Birmingham City, who were within a whisker of completing what would have been a comeback for the ages.Goodwin’s stunning long-range strike and a Chantelle Boye-Hlorkah header put the visitors 2-0 up and Birmingham, backed by a club-record crowd of 8,749, knowing they had to win to be promoted, fought back valiantly in the final 27 minutes through Emily van Egmond’s header and Cho So-hyun’s volley – four minutes from time – to set up a frantic finish but the visitors clung on to the draw they needed to clinch top spot.Manchester United roar back to seal Champions League spot through WSL derby draw with CityRead moreOwned by Michele Kang, Lionesses will be the WSL’s first independently run club and the wealthy American businesswoman has made no secret of her intention to turn them into a Champions League force. She was front and centre in the team’s celebrations, even carrying the trophy on to the pitch before it was presented, and stood side-by-side with the captain Kosovare Asllani as the Swede hoisted the silverware. Afterwards, a delighted Kang told TalkSport: “When I first came to England and bought London City, a lot of people were concerned for me and were saying: ‘How can she do this? There’s no men’s team, you need a men’s team to draw the brand power, fanbase and resources – an independent team can’t do it.’ Well, we are proof that, with the proper investment and focus, anything is possible.”Her cash injection in the past two transfer windows in particular brought the English women’s second tier into uncharted territory and therefore it was perhaps fitting that it should be Goodwin, the division’s record signing – purchased for a fee believed to be in excess of £100,000 from Sheffield United – who played a key role in this promotion decider. The 22-year-old former Aston Villa forward She produced a goal-of-the-season contender to open the scoring, skilfully evading two challenges before launching a powerful strike from long range that flew into the top corner. After the game a beaming Goodwin told Sky Sports: “I can’t believe it. I’m so happy to get over the line. I don’t think I’ve ever scored a goal like that in my life.”Kang, who also owns the record eight-times women’s European champions Lyon and the NWSL side Washington Spirit, was in the executive boxes at a noisy St Andrew’s, sitting near to Birmingham’s owner Tom Wagner, in what was a clash between the second tier’s two big-spending promotion rivals, with the league’s chief executive Nikki Doucet and chair Dawn Airey also in attendance.The game was the first in the history of the English women’s second tier to be broadcast live by Sky Sports, such was the magnitude of the occasion with promotion on the line, and viewers were rewarded with a box-office finale as Birmingham pushed for a winner in 10 minutes of second-half stoppage time.Both teams had efforts cleared off the line in a tense first half, with firstly Boye-Hlorkah denying Van Egmond, before Birmingham’s Rebecca Holloway did well to hook away a Boye-Hlorkah effort at the other end. Goodwin also forced Adrianna Franch into a fine low save before the break. After Goodwin’s stunning opener, Boye-Hlorkah headed inside the far post from a corner, before Van Egmond gave the hosts’ hope from close range and then the substitute Cho had them believing, when she volleyed in superbly.After his team survived 10 minutes of stoppage time, Lionesses’ head coach, Jocelyn Prêcheur, looked emotionally drained when speaking to reporters and said: “It means a lot. This is the magic of the project. I was so satisfied to give her [Kang] this gift, this promotion, because people cannot really realise what she’s doing right now for women’s football. She’s really changing the game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nobody should be in any doubt that he can talk the talk.Winds of change are about to blow through Ibrox. A takeover by an ­American investment group is close, Kevin Thelwell will arrive as the director of football and the ­Rangers squad will undergo a ­necessary overhaul. The most significant element, though, surrounds who will be ­leading the team by the time ­European ­qualifiers arrive in July. Steven Gerrard, Russell Martin and Sean Dyche are known to be in the frame. Ferguson, who was catapulted into the front line from ambassadorial duties, wants to see them all off. He also wants to do it quickly.“The club need to make a decision really soon,” Ferguson said. “There have been a few bumps but that does not scare me one little bit.“I don’t care about people’s ­opinions. I know I can do the job. It does not scare me one little bit. This is a challenge I would meet head on. I know I would change things.” Which is precisely what Rangers require; they are 17 points and almost 50 goals adrift of Celtic,who were championsbefore crossing the city. A chasm rather than a gap exists between the Old Firm.Ferguson’s bullishness is intriguing. His managerial experience to date was at Clyde, Kelty and Alloa. The 47-year-old surely would not go out on this limb – or be allowed to – without believing he has a serious chance of landing the role. There is, however, no competitive case to keep Ferguson in situ.Indeed, it is open to question as to whether Rangers should have bothered sacking Philippe Clement in February. Rangers are without a victory in six games and have not won at Ibrox since Ferguson was appointed. The ex-Rangers captain speaks candidly and has a clear passion for the club but there has been no real bounce in performances. The Rangers board need someone with more dugout experience, including with rebooting.View image in fullscreenCyriel Dessers celebrates after scoring the opener against Celtic.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty ImagesThis game actually provided no case or otherwise to retain Ferguson’s services. Both teams appeared happy to settle for a point long before full time.Celticalmost snatched victory at the death, Daizen Maeda instead fluffing his lines when through on goal. Brendan Rodgers insisted he will give Maeda “leeway” with the forward spending all of last week in Japan, awaiting the birth of his third child. Indeed, Scotland’s outstanding player of the season was unusually quiet here.Rangers had the ball in the net in the 25th minute, only for Nicolas Raskin’s header to be ruled out for offside. Officialdom could not assist Celtic seconds before the interval, Cyriel Dessers holding off Liam Scales before slotting a low finish beyond Viljami Sinisalo. Adam Idah had wasted a glorious opportunity for Celtic just a minute earlier.Celtic responded strongly after half-time. Maeda won the break of the ball from a John Souttar clearance before laying back to Idah. The Irishman’s fierce shot deflected off Souttar and into the Rangers net. An original offside call, made against Maeda in the buildup, was overruled by the VAR and the equaliser stood.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Twice they were overturned by VAR but the third one stood, and Alexander Isak converted to earn Newcastle a vital point in the race for Champions League football. They had not played well, but they never do against Brighton, and in that context a draw earned with an 89th-minute equaliser was extremely welcome.“Keeping our composure and making sure our performance wasn’t affected by the outcomes [of the VAR decisions] was key,” said the Newcastle manager Eddie Howe, who acknowledged the VAR was right to rule out the first two penalties. “If you look at the season as a whole we probably haven’t dug out enough points from games that are in the balance.Chelsea v Liverpool: Premier League – liveRead more“Today was a really battling performance. We were pretty good apart from around the box – but the majority of the performance I was really pleased.”Arsenal’s defeat to Bournemouthon Saturday had opened up another possibility; if Newcastle won their final four games of the season, including at Arsenal in two weeks, they would finish second for the first time since 1996-97. Perhaps that added a layer of pressure: for a long time this didn’t look like a side that had won seven of its previous eight games in all competitions, never mind the second-best side in the country.But then that’s very much the nature of thePremier Leaguethis season: Brighton didn’t look much like a side that had only won one of their previous seven. The truth is that there really isn’t a huge amount separating the teams from second down to mid-table, meaning small fluctuations of form can have a profound impact, positive or negative, on results.Newcastle have now beaten Brighton only twice in 18 games, and they have never won in the Premier League at the Amex. But they remain in the Champions League places and others in the race are also stuttering as they approach the finish line. “All you can ask for is that it’s in your hands and you know what you have to do,” said Howe. “We’ve three really difficult games but they’re games to relish.”Brighton have their own European aspirations. They lie 10th but just a point off the eighth place that, if Manchester City beat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final, will probably bring Uefa Conference League qualification.A scratchy first half was all about the battle between Dan Burn and Yankuba Minteh, who left Newcastle last summer. Burn had the better of their first two match-ups, but then, after the Gambian had skipped by him on the touchline, went bafflingly unpunished for a crude hack on him that curtailed a potentially dangerous counter. Perhaps that fired something in Minteh. “He pushed his limits and played with aggression,” said Fabian Hürzeler, the hosts’ manager. “He’s shown his level.”When he gathered a loose ball on the right edge of the box after 28 minutes, he skipped by Livramento, feigned to shoot and, as Sandro Tonali turned his back – he had cost Newcastle a goal on this ground with similar timidity last season – went by him as well before finding the far corner with a shot that glanced off Burn’s head. When Minteh put Brighton ahead in the fifth round of the FA Cup at St James’ in March, he had ostentatiously refused to celebrate, even though he had never actually played a game for them. Something, evidently, has changed his mind: here he ran to the Newcastle fans, pointing at them and aggressively kissing his badge, eventually having to be led away by his teammates.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Newcastle improved immediately. Within two minutes he had drawn a foul from Tariq Lamptey. A penalty was awarded but a check showed the foul had happened just outside the box.Another penalty, awarded after Joe Willock had dived over a challenge from Jan Paul van Hecke, was also overturned. VAR understandably gets a bad press; these were instances of it working. It did not, though, intervene when Tonali seemed to have clattered into the back of Matt O’Riley; Hürzeler, certainly, thought that should have been a penalty.A third Newcastle penalty, awarded for a handball by Yasin Ayari as Fabian Schär’s free-kick arced past him at the end of the wall, though, was upheld. Isak converted, and when Diego Gómez put a free header wide from six yards in stoppage time, Newcastle had their draw.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

At least there was an excuse for Tottenham, whose season rests on themholding their nerve in the Arctic Circlethis week. There is no equivalent silver lining for West Ham. They are limping towards the finish line and the only takeaway from this performance is that only a major overhaul of a stale, demotivated squad will help them avoid further turmoil next season.There has been no uplift since Graham Potter, whose side look likely to finish 17th after they missed a chance to overtake Spurs and extended their winless run to eight games, replaced Julen Lopetegui in January. West Ham have taken 14 points from 15 games under Potter and they approached this meeting with Ange Postecoglou’s B Team with a staggering lack of enthusiasm. Jarrod Bowen and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were the only players to emerge with any real credit. A passionless 1-1 draw, secured when Wan-Bissaka sent Bowen through to cancel out Wilson Odobert’s early goal, was met with deserved boos at a bored London Stadium.Tottenham firmly in driving seat despite Bodø/Glimt’s unwelcome late replyRead moreWest Ham’s visionless board should be alarmed by the apathy in the stands. Some fans were still strolling in at kick-off, plenty had stayed away and there was silence when the teams emerged. Spurs, who made eight changes before they look to protect a 3-1 lead in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final against Bodø/Glimt on Thursday, could not have asked for a gentler welcome. West Ham were agreeably hospitable, even going out of their way to help the visitors into the lead after 15 minutes of soporific football.The sight of Max Kilman, who has struggled since his £40m move from Wolves last summer, failing to clear his lines before Odobert made it 1-0 summed up the damage Potter has to repair during pre-season. The centre-back had time to deal with a harmless ball down the left flank but played himself into trouble by twice wafting clearances against Mathys Tel. A nothing situation became one fraught with danger, leaving Odobert to stroke home his first league goal of the season after Richarlison dummied Tel’s pass into the winger’s path.View image in fullscreenWilson Odobert beats Alphonse Areola to give Spurs the lead.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesPostecoglou was pleased with his side’s effort. Avoiding a 20th defeat of a sorry league campaign was a boost, although the Spurs manager was more worried about whether James Maddison will shake off a knee injury in time for the trip to Bodø. “It doesn’t look great,” said Postecoglou, who was more optimistic about Dominic Solanke’s chances off recovering from a thigh complaint. “We’re waiting for further information.”Spurs lacked creativity without Maddison. Postecoglou acknowledged that his changes disrupted their rhythm, which allowed West Ham to feel their way back into the contest. “They scored against the run of play,” Potter said. “Because of the moment we’re having it’s tough. But credit to the players, credit to the supporters, we stuck together and carried on.”It is a surprise that Bowen wants to stay and fight. West Ham’s captain would not be short of suitors were he to press for a move but his motivation remains undimmed. If only others in claret and blue were as driven. The winger never stops going and West Ham were again indebted to him when he equalised in the 28th minute.The goal came from Mohammed Kudus switching play to Wan-Bissaka on the right. The wing-back had time to slide a pass down the line to Bowen, who encountered no resistance as he darted away from Ben Davies, dribbled inside and threaded a low finish through Guglielmo Vicario’s legs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They could have trailed again when Lucas Paquetá lost possession in midfield; Richarlison shot wide.West Ham remained disjointed at the start of the second half. Jean-Clair Todibo sent a simple pass out for a throw. Kudus, displaying all the motivation of a man who knows he will be sold this summer, gave Archie Gray an easy time at right-back. Niclas Füllkrug, who had the gall to criticise his teammates after the draw with Southampton last month, used 80 minutes in the company of Postecoglou’s reserve centre-backs to confirm that he is unsuited to the pace of thePremier League. Spurs threatened through Tel and Pape Matar Sarr.Potter urged West Ham to push up. Vicario denied Bowen and James Ward-Prowse whipped a free-kick over after coming off the bench, but the final 30 minutes were dreadful. Paquetá appeared to be crying when he picked up a late yellow card. He was not alone in feeling miserable.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We played a good first half, but then we fell apart … they are a great team and they put us in trouble,” midfielder Federico Valverde told Real Madrid TV.Real dominated the first hour of the game as Arda Guler broke the deadlock shortly after the half-hour mark, taking a short corner for a one-two with Lucas Vázquez before dispatching an excellent left-footed shot from a tight angle through a gap between defenders.Mbappé doubled Real’s lead six minutes later as Jude Bellingham’s lobbed ball unleashed the Frenchman, who ran down the opposition half and fired a right-footed shot from the edge of the box into the net.Guler’s through ball set up Mbappé’s second goal three minutes into the second half, the 26-year-old finding the bottom-right corner to score his 24th league goal of the season. That is one fewer than Barcelona’s Robert Lewandowski, who leads the scoring charts.Manchester United loanee Antony continued his resurgence with a stunning late winner forReal BetisatEspanyol.

Ademola Lookman then sealed Monza’s fate with a third goal for Atalanta two minutes after the break, finishing with his left foot after shaking off his marker during a run.The hosts’ misery deepened late in the game when Omari Forson’s diving header, which could have pulled one back, was brilliantly saved on the line by Atalanta keeper Marco Carnesecchi – before Marco Brescianini added a fourth for the visitors two minutes from time.Juventusplayed out a tense 1-1 draw at top-four rivalsBologna, as the visitors missed the chance to cement fourth place in the chaotic race for Champions League qualification.Juventus sit fourth with 63 points, level with Roma and Lazio in fifth and sixth, while Bologna are seventh, one point behind, with three rounds remaining.Khéphren Thuram gave Juventus a flying start after nine minutes, picking up the ball outside the box, spotting a gap in the Bologna defence and drilling a low shot that slipped beneath keeper Lukasz Skorupski.Bologna levelled nine minutes into the second half, as Remo Freuler capitalised on a scrappy sequence following a cross and fired the ball home for a share of the spoils.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballLa LigaReal MadridCelta VigoSerie AJuventusBolognanewsShareReuse this content"

Even so, the odds remain stacked against him. Nobody has ever overcome a five-frame deficit overnight to win this trophy.For Zhao, whose ongoing amateur status is largely due to a 20-month ban for his role in a betting scandal, there is a chance to follow Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy as just the third player to lift the trophy having come through qualification.He needs seven more frames to seal this best-of-35 clash, with Williams needing a major turnaround to claim another 12.Zhao came out hot, controlling the opening frame after an initial 51-point flurry and sealing it after navigating a safety exchange. He ran up an even 100 in the second and was soon 3-0 to the good, showing his quality and range with three outstanding shots to sink brown, blue and pink.Williams stopped the rot just before the mid-session interval, ending a sloppy frame with his nose in front, but Zhao ensured he kept the momentum with a decisive break of 57.The older man looked to have found his mojo when he notched up 61 – more than double his previous best – but misjudged a cannon off the black with frame for the taking. He was unable to make a fine cut on the red and Zhao did the rest.Emboldened by his lead, Zhao got even better as the session came to an end, piecing together a fluid 104 and producing a remarkable plant on a long red to finish with an 83.View image in fullscreenMark Williams hopes to become the oldest player to win the world title.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThe break appeared to spark Williams into life as he took the first two frames of the evening’s play. A break of 86 bettered anything he had managed in the previous session and he never looked better than when escaping a snooker with a precision shot off four cushions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He might have had the next too, but one slight misjudgment stopped him short on 23 and brought Zhao to the table. His clinical response deserved another century but he had to make do with 96 and move one step closer to glory.Williams came within a whisker of hitting back, going 63 ahead with 75 left, only to miss the clincher. Zhao rose from his chair and cleared the table for 71.Down but not yet out, Williams took the final frame deep, eventually winning the race to land the last red and banking an important boost before the last day in Sheffield.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

Alternatively, you might be asked to pay the rent, direct to a landlord, or foot some other urgent bill that has arrived at this time of crisis.The messages arrive onWhatsApp, or by text. And the fraudsters are not always posing as children – sometimes they pretend to be friends, and sometimes they claim to be parents.Data from Santander show that among customers of the bank, fraudsters pretending to be someone’s son were the most successful, followed by daughters, then mothers.Chris Ainsley, the bank’s head of fraud risk management, says the scams are evolving at “breakneck speed”. He says: “We’re hearing of instances where AI voice impersonation technology is being used to create WhatsApp and SMS voice notes, making the scam seem ever more realistic.”What the scam looks likeView image in fullscreenA screengrab excerpt of the WhatsApp ‘Hi mum’ text scam.Photograph: SantanderA friendly message from someone claiming to be close to you but, crucially, from an unknown number. If you do not respond, there may be several before they give up. If you do respond, the fraudsters are often willing to enter into a conversation, but the details are generic.Fairly quickly into the exchange they will say that there’s an urgent need for money for something, putting pressure on you to act quickly to help.The “sender’s” usual bank account will be out of the question for the transfer for some reason, and they will ask that you send it to an account you do not know.View image in fullscreenA screengrab excerpt of the WhatsApp ‘Hi mum’ text scam.Photograph: SantanderWhat the messages ask forMoney. They will say that cash is needed, maybe to get a new phone, or for living expenses and ask you to transfer it.View image in fullscreenA screengrab excerpt of the WhatsApp ‘Hi mum’ text scamPhotograph: SantanderThe bank details will be in someone else’s name – they’ll say it belongs to the “friend” or whoever they owe – and the sum of money is typically not a round number.

Try them on their usual number – and do not panic if they don’t answer straight away.You could ask a question that you know the other person will know the answer to.Which? suggests that you protect yourself against future scams of this kind by setting up a family password which you can ask for to check a sender’s credentials.View image in fullscreenA screengrab excerpt of the WhatsApp ‘Hi mum’ text scamPhotograph: SantanderIf you have transferred the cash, call your bank straight away in case it can stop the payment.WhatsApp messages can be reported via the app – you click on the message and are given the option to report it.Scam texts can be forwarded to 7726, which goes to the telephone network providers.You can also report scams toAction Fraud.Whenever you attempt to transfer the money from your bank it will ask you questions about what is happening.

Itisa small victory for the world’s richest man as hepivots away from his jobas de facto leader of the “department of government efficiency” – a role that has elicited furious backlash and hurt his public imageas well as his businesses.Much like with Doge, Musk will not officially be in charge of Starbase. The entirety of the future city revolves around SpaceX, however, and it is almost entirely made up of the company’s employees and their kin. The Starbase population, as of 2025, is a little over 500 people, 260 of whom are SpaceX employees. The others are mostly family members of workers,according to Bloomberg.The town’s new mayor, 36-year-old Bobby Peden, has worked at SpaceX since 2013 and is vice-president of test and launch operations in Texas. Peden, along withtwo other city commissioner candidateswho are also SpaceX employees, ran unopposed.Starbase sits on a tiny piece of land near the Mexican border on a small bay that feeds into the Gulf of Mexico. Prefabricated houses, airstreams and palm trees line the streets. An imperious golden bust of Musk stands nine feet tall outside the town. A plaque on its pedestal reads “ELON AKA Memelord”.Last month,vandals defaced the statueby peeling off layers of foam and fiberglass from its cheeks. There is an employee-only restaurant called Astropub with a neon red “Occupy Mars” sign behind the bar. One of the main boulevards is called “Memes Street”.View image in fullscreenA visitor photographs a large bust of Elon Musk in Boca Chica.Photograph: Eric Gay/APAlthough creating Starbase is likely somewhat of a vanity project, one which Musk has been touting for years, it does grant the potential city and its SpaceX leadership powers over what to do with the land. Company workers submitted identical statements to a legislative hearing in April arguing that creating the town would help with logistics and coordination around issues such as road closures during test launches,the Associated Press reported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The South Texas Environmental Justice Network activist group has been holding protests and urging Texans to email their state representatives to oppose the incorporation. The group argued that creating Starbase would allow SpaceX to close access to the public beach in the town whenever it wants and block others from using the public land.“Boca Chica Beach is meant for the people, not Elon Musk to control,” the organization said in a statement on its site. “For generations, residents have visited Boca Chica beach for fishing, swimming, recreation, and the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe has spiritual ties to the beach. They should be able to keep access.”Musk has in previous years made grand pronouncements about the future of Starbase while urging employees to move to the town. “Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two,” he posted on X in 2021.SpaceX has become an increasingly valuable part of Musk’s empire as Tesla’s performance has tanked and the government has turned to SpaceX for billions of dollars in contracts related to space travel.Musk has relocated his primary residence and businesses to Texas in recent years. He lives in a$35m sprawling compoundin Austin that houses three separate mansions. During his backing of Trump’s re-election last year, he temporarily uprooted and moved to the swing state of Pennsylvania.Musk then took up residence in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building while serving as senior adviser to Donald Trump, but left the White House in late April as he shifts back to overseeing his companies.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsElon MuskSpaceXTexasSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

The titles includeNavigating ADHD in Men: Thriving with a Late Diagnosis,Men with Adult ADHD: Highly Effective Techniques for Mastering Focus, Time Management and Overcoming Anxietyand Men with Adult ADHD Diet & Fitness.Samples from eight books were examined for the Guardian by Originality.ai, a US company that detects content produced by artificial intelligence. The company said each had a rating of 100% on its AI detection score, meaning its systems were highly confident that the books were written by a chatbot.Experts said online marketplaces were a “wild west” owing to the lack of regulation around AI-produced work – and dangerous misinformation risked spreading as a result.Michael Cook, a computer science researcher at King’s College London, said generative AI systems were known to give dangerous advice, for example around ingesting toxic substances, mixing together dangerous chemicals or ignoring health guidelines.As such, it was “frustrating and depressing to see AI-authored books increasingly popping up on digital marketplaces” particularly on health and medical topics, which could result in misdiagnosis or worsen conditions, he said.“Generative AI systems like ChatGPT may have been trained on a lot of medical textbooks and articles, but they’ve also been trained on pseudoscience, conspiracy theories and fiction,” said Cook.“They also can’t be relied on to critically analyse or reliably reproduce the knowledge they’ve previously read – it’s not as simple as having the AI ‘remember’ things that they’ve seen in their training data. Generative AI systems should not be allowed to deal with sensitive or dangerous topics without the oversight of an expert,” he added.Yet Cook noted Amazon’s business model incentivised this type of practice, as it made “money every time” people bought a book, whether the work was “trustworthy or not”, while the generative AI companies that created the products were not held accountable.Prof Shannon Vallor, the director of the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Technomoral Futures, said Amazon had “an ethical responsibility to not knowingly facilitate harm to their customers and to society”, although it would be “absurd” to make a bookseller responsible for the contents of all its books.Problems were arising because the guardrails previously deployed in the publishing industry – such as reputational concerns and the vetting of authors and manuscripts – had been completely transformed by AI, she noted.This was compounded by a “wild west” regulatory environment in which there were no “meaningful consequences for those who enable harms”, fuelling a “race to the bottom”, Vallor said.At present, there is no legislation that requires AI-authored books to be labelled as such. Copyright law only applies if a specific author’s content has been reproduced, although Vallor noted that tort law should impose “basic duties of care and due diligence”.The Advertising Standards Agency said AI-authored books cannot be advertised to give a misleading impression that they were written by a human, enabling people who had seen such books to submit acomplaint.Richard Wordsworth was hoping to learn about his recent adult ADHD diagnosis when his father recommended a book he found on Amazon after searching “ADHD adult men”.When Wordsworth sat down to read it, “immediately, it sounded strange”, he said. The book opened with a quote from theconservative psychologist Jordan Petersenand then contained a string of random anecdotes, as well as historical inaccuracies.Some advice was actively harmful, Wordsworth observed. For example, one chapter discussing emotional dysregulation warned that friends and family did not “forgive the emotional damage you inflict. The pain and hurt caused by impulsive anger leave lasting scars.”When Wordsworth researched the author he spotted a headshot that looked AI-generated, plus a lack of qualifications. He searched several other titles in the Amazon marketplace and was shocked to encounter warnings that his condition was “catastrophic” and that he was “four times more likely to die significantly earlier”.How an embarrassing U-turn exposed a concerning truth about ChatGPT | Chris Stokel-WalkerRead moreHe felt immediately “upset”, as did his father, who is highly educated. “If he can be taken in by this type of book, anyone could be – and so well-meaning and desperate people have their heads filled with dangerous nonsense by profiteering scam artists while Amazon takes its cut,” Wordsworth said.An Amazon spokesperson said: “We have content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale and we have proactive and reactive methods that help us detect content that violates our guidelines, whether AI-generated or not. We invest significant time and resources to ensure our guidelines are followed and remove books that do not adhere to those guidelines.“We continue to enhance our protections against non-compliant content and our process and guidelines will keep evolving as we see changes in publishing.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)AmazonE-commerceInternetAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderMental healthHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

At uni. In a cavernous lecture hall. Slouched in a vaguely uncomfortable seat. Ping. A notification on Messenger. “Lol at this,” wrote my bestie from 14km away, accumulating student debt and little else. I clicked on the link.In that moment, I happened upon the most significant social media community of all time. AFacebookgroup, titled simply but garnished appropriately: “DRAG NAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!”The name – and enthusiastic use of exclamation marks – says it all: it’s a place for thousands of like-minded individuals to share their inventive names for drag queens.View image in fullscreen‘I can almost feel new grey matter forming when I happen upon these word plays’: a typical post from the Facebook group.Photograph: FacebookIt’s organised like so: each day (or whenever inspiration strikes), a member drops a theme into the void. Think: “biscuits”, “the afterlife” or “ethical non-monogamy”. Then the names pile in. For “chocolate”, one participant proffers Emma Nems. Another, Lindor Evangelista. A third chimes in with particular wit: Her/She.I was instantly titillated. That day in the lecture hall, I realised nothing I could come up with would ever compete with the unbridled originality of a 55-year-old gay man in Missouri.Some submissions are immediately obvious: Paula Roid for photography-based drag names.

Can we avoid being willing participants in our own downfall?David DuvenaudSun 4 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 10.51 EDTShareRight now, most big AI labs have a team figuring out ways that rogue AIs might escape supervision, or secretly collude with each other against humans. But there’s a more mundane way we could lose control of civilisation: we might simply become obsolete. This wouldn’t require any hidden plots – if AI and robotics keep improving, it’s what happens by default.How so? Well, AI developers are firmly on track to build better replacements for humans in almost every role we play: not just economically asworkersand decision-makers, but culturally as artists and creators, and even socially as friends and romanticcompanions. What place will humans have when AI can do everything we do, only better?Talk of AI’s current abilities can occasionally sound like marketing hype, and some of it definitely is. But in the longer term, the scope for improvement is huge. You may believe that there will always be something uniquely human that AI just can’t replicate. I’ve spent 20 years in AI research, watching its progression from basic reasoning to solving complex scientific problems. Abilities thatseemeduniquely human, such as handling ambiguity or using abstract analogies, are now easily handled. There may be delays along the way, but we should assume there will be continued progress in AI across the board.These artificial minds won’t just aid humans – they’ll quietly take over in countless small ways, initially because they’re cheaper, eventually because they’re genuinely better than even our best performers. Once they’re reliable enough, they’ll become the only responsible choice for almost all important tasks, ranging from legal rulings and financial planning to healthcare decisions.It will be hard to justify spending twice as much for a human therapist, lawyer, or teacher who’s only half as goodIt’s easiest to imagine what this future may look like in the context of employment: you’ll hear of friends losing jobs and having trouble finding new work. Companies willfreeze hiringin anticipation of next year’s better AI workers. More and more of your own job will consist of accepting suggestions from reliable, charming and eager-to-please AI assistants. You’ll be free to think about the bigger picture, but will find yourself conversing about it with your ultra-knowledgable AI assistant. This assistant will fill in the blanks in your plans, provide relevant figures and precedent, and suggest improvements. Eventually, you’ll simply ask it: “What do you think I should do next?” Whether or not you lose your job, it’ll be clear that your input is optional.And it won’t be any different outside the world of work. It was a surprise even to some AI researchers that the first models capable of general reasoning abilities, the precursors to ChatGPT and Claude, could also be tactful, patient, nuanced and gracious. But it’s now clear that social skills can be learned by machines just like any other. People already haveAI romantic companions, and AI doctors are consistently ratedbetter on bedside mannerthan human doctors.What will life look like when each of us has access to an endless supply of personalised affection, guidance and support? Your family and friends will be even more glued to their screens than usual. When they do talk to you, they’ll tell you about funny and impressive things their online companions have said.Maybe you’ll be put off by others’ preference for their new companions – in that case you might end up asking your daily AI assistant for advice. This reliable counsellor will tactfully talk you through any problems you face, and help you practice having difficult conversations with family members. After these relatively tiring interactions, the participants might unwind by talking to their respective AI confidantes. Perhaps we’ll agree that something had been lost in this shift to virtual companions, even as we start to find raw human contact ever more grating and tedious in comparison.So far, so dystopian. But couldn’t we simply choose not to use AI this way, preferring human advisers and human-made goods and services? The problem is, it might be hard to even notice AI replacement in many domains – and the parts that we do notice will mostly seem like major improvements. Even today, AI-generated content isincreasingly indistinguishablefrom human-created work. It will be hard to justify spending twice as much for a human therapist, lawyer or teacher who’s only half as good. Organisations that choose slow, expensive humans will be outcompeted by those who choose fast, cheap, reliable AI.Can’t we rely on governments to address these issues as they arise? Unfortunately, they too will have the same incentives to lean on AI. Politicians and civil servants will also ask their virtual assistants: “What should I do?”, and will find involving humans in decision-making to be a recipe for delay, misunderstanding and bickering.Political theorists sometimes talk about the “resource curse”, where countries with abundant natural resources end up more autocratic and corrupt – Saudi Arabia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are good examples. The idea is that valuable resources make the state less dependent on its citizens. This, in turn, makes it tempting (and easy) for the state to sideline citizens altogether. The same could happen with the effectively limitless “natural resource” of AI. Why bother investing in education and healthcare when human capital provides worse returns?The most disturbing possibility is that this might all seem perfectly reasonable to usOnce AI can replace everything that citizens do, there won’t be much pressure for governments to take care of their populations. The brutal truth is that democratic rights arose partly due to economic and military necessity, and to ensure stability. But those won’t count for much when governments are funded by taxes on AIs instead of citizens, and when they too start replacing human employees with AIs, all in the name of quality and efficiency. Even last resorts such as labour strikes or civil unrest will gradually become ineffective against fleets of autonomous police drones and automated surveillance.The most disturbing possibility is that this might all seem perfectly reasonable to us. The same AI companions that hundreds of thousands of people are already falling for in their current primitive state will be making ultra-persuasive, charming, sophisticated and funny arguments for why our diminishing relevance is actually progress. AI rights will be presented as the next big civil rights cause. The “humanity first” camp will be painted as being on the wrong side of history.Eventually, with no one having planned or chosen it, we might all find ourselves struggling to hold on to money, influence, even relevance. This new world could be more friendly and humane in many ways, while it lasts: AIs would handle annoying tasks and provide radically better goods and services such as medicine and entertainment. But humans would be a drag on growth, and if our democratic rights started to slip, we’d be powerless to protect them.Surely the developers of these technologies have a better plan? Alarmingly, the answer is no. BothDario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, andSam Altman, CEO of Open AI, agree we’ll need to completely reorganise our economic system once human labour isn’t competitive. But no one has a clear idea of what that would look like. Those who do acknowledge the possibility of radical change are mostly working on more immediate threats from misuse or secret collusion by AIs. And while some economists such as the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz havesounded the alarmthat AI could drive human wages to zero, many seem unwilling to consider that it could ever be anything other than a complement to human labour.What can we do to avoid our gradual disempowerment? The first step is to talk about it. Journalists, academics and other thinkers have been strangely silent on this massive topic. I personally find it hard to think clearly about. It sounds weak and humiliating to say: “I’m scared of the future because I won’t be able to compete.” It sounds insulting to say: “You should be worried because you’ll be irrelevant.” And it sounds defeatist to say: “Your children may inherit a world that doesn’t have a place for them.” It’s understandable that people short-circuit to dismissals like “Surely I’ll always have a special advantage?” or “Who am I to stand in the way of progress?”One obvious idea is to not build general-purpose AI at all. While slowing down its development is probably feasible, trying to stop it globally for long may require near-totalitarian monitoring and control, or worldwide coordination to dismantle large parts of the computer chip manufacturing industry. A major danger with this path is that governments may ban private AI development but still develop it for military and policing purposes, delaying our obsolescence but disempowering us long beforehand.If we start seeing signs of a crisis, we need to be able to step in and at least slow things down,If we can’t stop AI development, there are at least four things that would still help. First, we should try to track AI use and influence throughout our economy and in government. We need to know where AI is displacing human economic activity, and especially if it starts being used at scale for things such as lobbying and propaganda. Anthropic’s recentEconomic Indexis a first attempt at this, but there’s a lot more to be done.Second, we’ll need at least some oversight and regulation of frontier AI labs and deployments to stop the technology from accruing too much influence while we’re still figuring out what’s going on. Currently, we rely on voluntary efforts, and have no ability to coordinate to stop autonomous AI from commanding substantial resources or gathering power. If we start seeing signs of a crisis, we need to be able to step in and slow things down, especially in cases where individuals and groups benefit from things that harm society overall.Third, we can use AI to strengthen people’s ability to organise and advocate for themselves. AI-supported forecasting, oversight, planning and negotiation offer the possibility of designing and implementingmore trustworthy institutions, if we can build them while we still have influence. For instance,conditional prediction marketsand AI-supported forecasts could make it clearer where the world is heading under different policies, helping settle questions such as “If this policy is made law, how will the average human wage change three years from now?” Experimentation with AI-supported democratic mechanisms will let us prototype more responsive governance models that will be needed for a faster-changing world.Finally, if we want to build powerful AI without being marginalised, we have the gargantuan task of learning how to steer our civilisation, instead of just letting political systems evolve according to whatever pressures they happen to face. This bumbling-through has been sort of OK until now, because humans were needed no matter what. Without this safeguard, we will be adrift unless we understand all the ways in which power, competition and growth operate. The technical field of “AI alignment” – concerned with making sure machines share our goals – needs to broaden its scope to include governments, institutions and society itself. This nascent sphere, sometimes called “ecosystem alignment”, can draw on economics, history and game theory to help us understand what kinds of futures we can plausibly hope for, and how to aim for them.The clearer we can see where we’re heading, and the better we coordinate, the more likely we are to create a future where humans remain relevant – not as competitors to AI, but as their beneficiaries and stewards. As it stands, we’re racing to build our own replacements.David Duvenaud is an associate professor of computer science at the University of Toronto, and co-director of theSchwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society.

They’re likely to get louder under TrumpNiamh RoweSun 4 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 06.01 EDTShareFirst came the dogs’ balding – leathery pink patches on otherwise glossy fur coats.The veterinarian told Shenice Copenhaver it was genetic. But it wasn’t long before one of the hairless puppies began stealing blankets to burrow beneath furniture and hide for long stretches.Around the same time, in the summer of 2022, she first heard the noise: a deep, mechanical howl that becomes shrill closer to the facility. Copenhaver didn’t know it then, butbitcoinminers had come to town. Less than a mile away from her home in eastTexas, acryptocurrencymining facility was rumbling to life.The hum has since become the soundtrack to life for hundreds of residents in the small city of Granbury, with a population of 12,600. It echoes across agricultural land and forests, chasing away deer. It seeps into walls, vibrating bedrooms and dinner tables. Copenhaver’s neighbor Cheryl Shadden imagines it is what standing on the edge of Niagara Falls might sound like. Copenhaver says it’s like a jet engine is forever stationed nearby.A video of the site from Shadden’s home, recorded on 23 April, shows green pastures against a backdrop of billowing smoke and the roar.“It wakes you up,” says Copenhaver. “I’ll be asleep, and everything will be fine, and then I’ll wake up because I can feel it in my chest.”Large-scale cryptocurrency mining operations began popping up across the United States a decade ago. But it was China’s crackdown on miners in 2021, leading many to relocate to the US, that cemented the country’s role as the global hotspot for minting bitcoin. With at least 137 commercial-level facilities across the country, clustered mostly in Texas, the sector uses up to 2.3% of the nation’s grid,accordingto estimates by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), a government agency that gathers and disseminates statistics on energy use. WhereasJoe Bidenhad promised to crack down on the industry,Donald Trumpwantsbitcoin to be “mined, minted and made in the USA”, setting the scene for bitcoin mines to roar louder throughout the rural US in the coming years.0:28Local resident captures noise from cryptocurrency mining facility – video“President Trump and his administration have done a lot to deliver on the promises that they made during the campaign, and we see this industry growing rapidly” Fred Thiel, the CEO of Mara, the world’s largest miner and owner of the 300-megawatt (MW) site in Granbury, told Fox Business in March. “We want to see the US be the dominant bitcoin mining country in the world.” Shortly before that interview, the firm acquired a 354-MW Texan wind farm to power a new mine, and has begun tapping natural gas from oilfields to fuel new facilities.Expansion plans: more money, more power, more noiseExpansion plans published by mining companies show an expanding array of more data centers and more machines across the country. Miners have tapped investors for $3.7bn in bonds since November to fund future growth.Miners nationwide have likewise unveiled plans to add at least another 2.42 GW in capacity, according to announcements compiled since November. That’s equivalent to almost 2m US households, according to EIAestimates.I’ll be asleep, and everything will be fine, and then I’ll wake up because I can feel it in my chestShenice Copenhaver of TexasBitcoin’s “hash rate” – the collective amount of computing power securing the network, of which the US maintainsone-third– hasincreased by one-quartersince Trump’s election victory. The respective hash rates of miners Mara and TeraWulf shot up over 40% between October and December last year, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.Eric Trumpeven launched his own mining firm last month, America Bitcoin, a subsidiary of the publicly traded miner Hut 8 Corp.“Simply buying bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity,” the president saidabouthis son’s endeavor. Trump has launched his own cryptocurrency as well.Polaris Technology Inc is one of many firms expanding. The company is moving to double its footprint in Muskogee,Oklahoma, raising its capacity to use the same amount of energy as approximately 400,000 homes, despite noise complaints from locals. Likewise, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, CleanSpark opened a new site earlier this year.US judge halts government effort to monitor crypto mining energy useRead more“They promised to be good neighbors, but so far their noise is constant,” says Dave Simpson, who lives a quarter of a mile from theWyomingsite. The facility is yet to reach full capacity. Simpson worries about how a constant drone will affect his property’s valuation. “I miss the quiet times,” he says.In Granbury, Copenhaver says that the noise has gotten worse since November. Her decibel reader – a must-have for many residents – has been notching higher, she says, now reaching between 80 to 100 decibels on any given day.Why is crypto mining loud?Digging for digital gold makes noise for several reasons.Row after row of industrial-grade fans are typically used to prevent mining computers, known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, from overheating, which can create an enormous din. Crypto mining often also consists of rows of smaller mobile containers in the open air, in contrast to the US’s other major construction boom of tech infrastructure: artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are housed in closed structures.Mary Willis, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University, has spotted a pattern when it comes to the location of mines. Underwritten by bigger budgets, AI data centers are built on large plots of remote land. Miners, on the other hand, flock to the cheapest power and easy grid access, which often means old factory towns.View image in fullscreenBitcoin mining machines in a warehouse at the Whinstone US bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas, in October 2021.Photograph: Mark Felix/AFP/Getty ImagesMiners are increasingly building next to aging power stations – they call such projects co-locations – and striking deals with energy companies to bring underused plants back to life. Mara’s Granbury mine is co-located with two gas power stations, both owned by Constellation Energy, which has fought locals over the past year to build a third plant.Cryptocurrency miners in Texas pay less for electricity than residents on average, according to an Earthjusticereport. In 2023, residential ratepayers paid 22.25 cents per kilowatt-hour for their electricity, while specific crypto mining operations paid just 2.5 per kWh, the group estimates. Bitcoin mining raises the cost of electricity for non-miners in Texas by $1.8bn per year, roughly 4.7%, per consulting firmWood Mackenzie.Pricey puzzlesTrump has also given miners impetus to grow through his commitment to solidifying bitcoin’s place in traditional finance, and thus its long-term appreciation. Its price currently sits at roughly $97,000. In December 2024, ittopped $100,000for the first time.Crypto mining computers race against one another to solve cryptographic puzzles. The correct answer verifies a new batch, or “block”, of bitcoin transactions. The block is added to the blockchain, which functions as a public ledger of all transactions within the network. The computer that cracks the code first is rewarded 3.125 bitcoins.So, when bitcoin rallies, miners often look to dial up power. But because price surges bring more miners online, the hash rate also grows. This increases mining difficulty, a measurement for how time – consuming it is to solve the cryptographic puzzles needed to validate a block. Unlocking the mining reward requires more guesses, which means more computing power.Miners thus must increase their facilities’ computing power each time hashrate goes up in order to stay profitable, or they must raise the efficiency of their existing equipment.For instance, for every $1,000 increase in bitcoin price, US mining energy consumption increases by approximately 0.058 terawatt-hours per month, according to a recentstudyby the Berkeley Lab.Bitcoin may have lost some of its initial gains following the election, when it rose 50% in just three months, but much of the crypto world anticipates that its long-term rally will resume once new policies take shape. Major financial institutions are increasingly trusting of bitcoin, and Trump plans to create areserveof cryptocurrency owned by the US government.Newly friendly regulationTrump issued anexecutive orderon 23 January, “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology”, which promotes the right to mine, and he has hosted crypto mining executives at both Mar-a-Lago and the firstWhite House Crypto Summit.

The EIA has no plans to resume this survey.Red-state rancorAnti-mining protests play out in town halls across red states, where activists challenge local officials on why they have showered the industry with tax breaks and subsidized power. Riot Platforms has received almost $136m in power credits from Texas’s grid operator since 2022, profiting more in credits than bitcoin mined in certain months, according to company filings.Despite this, Hood county, where Granbury is located,voted 82%for Trump in 2024, including many of the activists fighting against Mara. Copenhaver admits crypto did not factor into her vote.On the 600-memberBitcoinNoise Hood County Facebook group, videos are posted each week showcasing the hum while simultaneously praising Trump. One post, shared the morning after the election, shows sunlight streaming through a canopy of trees, as a symphony of birds competes with a deep thunder. “November 6, thank you lord for getting Trump elected,” the video begins, before the narrator details how the sound has destroyed her peace.LiveLocal resident captures noise from cryptocurrency mining facility – videoJackie Sawicky, a resident of Corsicana, Texas, had led the 800-member Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining over the past few years. Sawicky got involved in the movement after Riot Platforms began constructing a site in her city. Although the site has so far not raised noise complaints, when finished it will have the 1 gigawatt of capacity – about the same consumption as 600,000 Texan households.One member told Sawicky they voted for Trump because of abortion. “The unborn babies can’t go deaf, but you and yours can,” she replied. “And there are children in your community who are already losing their hearing because of this.” Disillusioned, she has taken a step back from the movement since the election and plans to leave the state.Suing for silence“If there are policies that support increased mining, there’s going to be more pollution and more community impacts,” says Mandy DeRoche, the deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice. DeRoche represents plaintiffs suing miners in three cases across the US, including five Granbury residents who filed alawsuitagainst Mara in October, alleging noise-related damage to their health, wildlife and air.The sound has unleashed a number of health issues, plaintiffs say, including tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss and heart arrhythmia, on top of insomnia and anxiety. Chronic exposure to low-frequency noise is known toaffect health, but doesn’t receive the attention that water contamination or air pollution attracts, says Willis.They promised to be good neighbors, but so far their noise is constant. I miss the quiet timesDave Simpson of Wyoming“Disrupted sleep causes a cascade of other issues in someone’s life. Lack of sleep is linked to depression, higher stress levels and chronic diseases like hypertension,” she says.Cyndie Roberson witnessed rampant sleeplessness change her community in Cherokee county,Georgia, when the noise from a mine began to echo through around 800 nearby homes. Neighbors became increasingly anxious, confrontational and angry. One suffered a heart attack. Another left due to acute emotional distress. “There was so much lack of sleep. They weren’t the same as they were before,” Roberson says. She sold her “dream retirement cabin” in 2022 and left the county.In Granbury, Shadden says the sleepless nights have left her anxious and irritable. She endures chronic migraines and struggles at work. A nonstop buzzing in her ears also affects her sleep. After consulting an audiologist last year she was diagnosed with permanent conduction hearing loss.“It’s never going to come back,” she says.Mara disputes the accusations.“There is no established link, medical or otherwise, between Mara’s operations and the ailments that are being alleged,” the company said in a statement.Restoring peace and quietThe industry contends that noise can be mitigated with immersion-cooled machines, where ASICs are stored in dielectric oil, and by building sound walls.But critics dispute the efficacy of this promise.“I wish it were true,” says DeRoche, on the question of immersion cooling. “We can tell from both the research and from the experience on the ground that immersion cooling will decrease the sound in some way, but only by a percentage. It doesn’t eliminate the sound,” she says. Immersion cooling often requires external dry coolers, which can be equally as noisy when deployed at scale.Bitcoin is terrible for the environment – can it ever go green?Read moreIn response to the complaints from Granbury residents, Mara says that by November 2024, a sound wall had been constructed, two-thirds of machines had been replaced with immersion cooling, and an independent sound survey found levels to be below the legal limit of 85 decibels.The city’s residents won an unexpected victory on 31 March. Constellation Energy withdrew its permit application for a third gas plant, citing community concerns and lower-than-expected returns. “This is truly the best news I’ve had in a year and a half,” said Shadden.Meanwhile, the noise drones on. “I just want quiet,” says Copenhaver. “We’re all feeling very defeated.”Three years on, she’s still waiting for all of her dogs’ fur to return. It may never. They’re no longer puppies, and they’ve never known a home undisturbed by the hum of the mine.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesDonald TrumpBitcoinTexasGeorgiaOklahomaWyomingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The resumption of humanitarian relief is essential to save civilian livesSun 4 May 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 16.03 EDTShareShameful. That was the word that Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s foreign minister, used to describe proceedings at theinternational court of justice(ICJ) last Monday. The United Nations asked the court to determine whether Israel must allow aid to enter Gaza, two months after it cut it off again just before the ceasefire deal collapsed. Supplies are running out. Unicef says that thousands of children have already experienced acute malnutrition.Mr Sa’ar’s complaint is that Israel is unfairly targeted. The separate international criminal court case against Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Yoav Gallant, the former defence minister, also focuses on the alleged starvation of civilians. It is true that withholding food is a common weapon in war, yet has rarely been the focus of international legal cases, in part because intent is hard to prove. It is the rhetoric of Israeli officials,suggests Dr Boyd van Dijk, an expert on the Geneva conventions, which has changed that.Last summer, Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right finance minister,remarkedthat it might be “justified and moral” to starve people if it brought home Israeli hostages seized in the Hamas atrocities of 7 October 2023, but that “no one in the world will allow us”. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz,saidlast month that its “policy is clear: no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza”. The far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, insisted that “there is no reason for a single gram of food or any aid to enter” until hostages were freed. An aid ship destined for Gaza wasattacked by dronesand disabled on Friday. More than 52,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to its health authorities.Unicef saysthey include 15,000 children, with hundreds of deaths since the new Israeli offensive began in March. But withholding food kills just as bombs do. Farmland is devastated. Flour is said to cost30 times morethan before the war. Aid warehouses are empty. UN World Food Programme bakeries closed a month ago when supplies ran out; essential community kitchensare now following.Israeli officials have said they need to stop Hamas getting their hands on aid. It’s obvious that men with guns will secure food long after others have starved. Donald Trump says that he has told Mr Netanyahu to allow aid in. Yet the UStold the ICJthat Israel’s security needs override its obligation to do so. The strong legal consensus is that occupying powers have anabsolute dutyunder the Geneva conventions to permit food to be given to a population in need.Israel isreportedlyplanning to resume aid delivery “in the coming weeks”, but via a radically new mechanism. It claims the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, essential to humanitarian efforts, has been mass-infiltrated by Hamas – an allegationstrongly disputedby the UN and others. The proposed alternative, of international organisations and private security contractors handing out food to individual families, looks both unworkable and dangerous for civilians.As Israel and the US attack international courts, other nations – including the UK – must do all they can to defend and bolster them. They must also press harder for the immediate resumption of aid. What is shameful about this ICJ case is the need to bring it. What is shameful is that almost half the children in Gaza questioned in a study saidthat they wished to die. What is shameful is that so many civilians have been killed, and so many more pushed to the brink of starvation. What is shameful is that this has, indeed, been allowed to happen.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

(Jenner & Block is specifically accused of hiring two former federal prosecutors who participated in the Mueller probe into suspected Russian interference in the 2016 election.  WilmerHale is accused of announcing they were “thrilled” to rehire Andrew Weissman, an architect of the case against Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who was convicted of fraud and witness tampering and sentenced to six years of prison – before being pardoned by the president.) Which prestigious firm, among the nation’s 10 wealthiest, with partners on average earning well over $5m a year, has not signed the brief?Wachtell, LiptonSimpson ThacherSullivan & CromwellKirkland & EllisAll of the aboveReveal3.CBS and its parent company Paramount Global is facing a $20bn lawsuit brought by Donald Trump alleging that 60 Minutes engaged in deceptive editing of an interview with Kamala Harris that aired during the 2024 presidential election. Last week, Bill Owens, a 37-year CBS veteran and only the third executive producer in 60 Minutes' 57-year history, resigned from the venerable weekly news program. He did so because:He believes that 60 Minutes’ future is secure, and he wants to develop what he believes will be an equally important program, a Teletubbies-style show for adults.He sobbingly admitted to using AI to overdub all of Harris’ responses, turning a string of inarticulate ramblings and bizarre conspiracy theories into coherent and focused statements befitting a presidential candidate.He appears convinced that rather than challenge a transparently specious lawsuit, Paramount has targeted 60 Minutes’ journalistic independence at a time when Shari Redstone, a multi-millionaire and Paramount’s controlling shareholder, is seeking the Trump administration’s approval for a multibillion-dollar sale of her company.Reveal4.In looking to settle with Trump rather than challenge him in court, Paramount appears to be following the approach of other media giants. In December 2024, ABC News and its parent, the Walt Disney Company, settled a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump by agreeing to donate $15m to Trump's future presidential library. And in January 2025, Meta agreed to a $25m settlement over a lawsuit filed by Trump concerning his suspension from Facebook following the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. These giant corporations agreed to settle because:They frankly felt bad for hurting the president’s feelings.They were prepared to defend themselves in court but didn’t want to overburden their lawyers with the extra work.It turns out that the choice between standing up for the constitutional right to freedom of press or currying financial favor with a would-be authoritarian was a no-brainer.Reveal5.Trump has also brought suit against The Des Moines Register and its parent company Gannett, seeking “unspecified damages.\" The suit alleges that shortly before the presidential election, the newspaper:Called Trump a “mentally impaired, highly destructive moron”.Disparaged Trump as “lazy as hell – a low-IQ fascist cheater”.Characterized Trump as an “evil, sick, crazy, nasty, vindictive, horrible person\".Published a poll showing Trump trailing in Iowa.Reveal6.In a recent presidential memorandum, President Trump singled out Christopher Krebs, who served as the head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) during Trump’s first term, as a “significant bad-faith actor.”  In ordering a justice department investigation into “disgraceful” “misconduct” that “violate[d] the First Amendment and… undermin[ed] the strength of our democracy itself,” Trump accused Krebs of:Using his personal cell phone to discuss sensitive military operations with his wife, attorney and brother.Sending out a barrage of mobster-like letters demanding ideological conformity “or else,” to everything from Georgetown law school to the New England Journal of Medicine.Using insider information to buy and sell stocks while the president flip-flopped his way to starting a trade war.“Falsely and baselessly deny[ing] that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen”—that is, for telling the truth.Reveal7.After the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the government must facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from a notorious Salvadoran prison and effectuate his return to the US, Stephen Miller, Trump’s trusted Homeland Security advisor, responded by:Sheepishly appearing before reporters and contritely mumbling, “my bad.”Solemnly acknowledging that Abrego Garcia had been improperly deported, and with President Trump and Vice President Vance nodding vigorously in agreement, saying, “Yes, we’re serious about getting a grip on illegal immigration, but, by golly, we’re also serious about respecting judicial decisions.”Insisting that the Supreme Court had unanimously ruled in the administration’s favor, while calling the government’s own lawyer, who had admitted in court that the deportation represented an “administrative error,” a “saboteur.”Reveal8.Gleichschaltung is a German word that means “coordination” or “bringing into line”. It specifically refers to the process by which Hitler worked to suppress opposition and consolidate total control over German life, and more generally describes the attempt of any authoritarian system to enforce total conformity through coercive means. These measures typically involve:Intimidating political opposition, such that people and organizations engage in unseemly acts of anticipatory prostration.Targeting those institutions — the free press, the judiciary and the academy — capable of challenging abuses of executive power.Deconstructing government bureaucracy by targeting and firing honest and responsible civil servants and replacing them with fifth-rate boot-licking toadies.I see where this is going.Reveal9.All said and done, however, people have no reason to fear the present US administration, since in the first hundred days of his second term, Trump has shown himself to be a:Responsible steward of constitutional values.Stalwart defender of NATO and the western alliance.Capable formulator of sound environmental and economic policy.Champion of human rights.Charming dinner host.RevealNote: Your answers to this quiz may be subject to subpoena by the Department of Justice.Lawrence Douglas is a professor of law at Amherst College in MassachusettsExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

(When challenged, the White House could not come up with any examples of when he had done so.)Trump feels tug of political gravity as economy falters and polls plungeRead moreThe problem for Trump and his supporters, many of whom remain staunchly loyal, is that the transition period in question is starting to resemble that felt by the classic Looney Tunes character Wile E Coyote between charging off a cliff into midair and plunging to the ground.So far, the hard data from the US economy is holding up well. Friday’s payrolls report was strong, and thenegative first quarter gross domestic product reading, while worrying, was hard to take a clear reading from because of the rise in imports as companies stocked up ahead of tariffs.There is little sign of anything as dramatic as mass job cuts, or a sudden stop in consumer spending – although the recent crop of data mainly relates to the period before “liberation day”.Look at the forward-looking surveys, though, and there are clear signs of anxiety. The long-runningMichigan consumer sentiment indexjust had its steepest quarterly decline since the 1990 recession.Spend any amount of time talking to US consumers and businesses, and it is abundantly clear why: there are so many sources of policy ambiguity as to make the future not just uncertain but completely unknowable.There is a cliche that “markets hate uncertainty”, but in truth the same applies to everyone in the real economy, too: the company wondering what size order to put in and how many people to hire and the family thinking about buying that fridge or booking that holiday.It is not surprising they are uncertain. No one, even inside the administration, can say with any confidence what the tariff rates on imports from specific countries will be in July.Even if the tariff policy was crystal clear, its impact on prices would be hard to gauge – depending, as it does, on how much of the cost companies are willing to bear (or “eat”, as the Americans have it) at the expense of reduced profits, and how much is passed on to consumers.For the moment, as the Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has admitted, the tariffs on China, at 145%, are nowso high as to amount to an effective trade embargo.Not every company will have the deep pockets and global reach of Apple to be able tobend its supply chain away from Chinato manufacture products for the US elsewhere (in the iPhone-maker’s case, India). Instead, many will be scrambling to find substitutes, which may be more expensive or not exist at all. Shortages of some products seem a distinct possibility.At the same time, sharp cuts in federal budgets, many of which have an ideological taint, including Robert F Kennedy Jr’s decimation of the National Institutes of Health, are raising short-term questions about unemployment and much longer-term worries about the US’s world-leading science base.Some of the most heartbreaking conversations I had were about aspects of Trump’s immigration policy: the man who said a Guatemalan friend’s six-year-old son had stopped going to school in case his mum was snatched by the authorities while he was there, and the restaurant manager who said it was becoming harder to hire Latinos because even fully documented workers feared they could face deportation anyway.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The credit rating agency Fitchwarned in a report last week: “Risks associated with mass deportations could include potential worker shortages, production delays and increased wage inflation that hinders revenue growth, weakens profitability and lowers return on investment.”Of course, because the US economy’s abrupt gearshift has been driven by deliberate policy actions, it’s tempting to think: “It doesn’t have to be like this.”Much more of the real economy impact so far results from this widely shared uncertainty – or perhaps it is better to call it fear – than from the specifics of Trump’s policies.Business owners told me that if they just knew what the final tariffs on products from the various countries in their supply chain would be, for example, then over time they could adapt.It is not completely out of the question that a more settled policy position could arrive in the coming weeks.Certainly, Bessent appears to be trying to manoeuvre Trump towards striking a series of “deals” (in effect, promises of concessions in exchange for tariff carve-outs) with key economies.Yet the president appears to have such a love of political drama – and such an inability to choose a course and stick to it – that the unknowability of future policy seems to be the very essence of Trump 2.0.It seemed to be the mighty bond markets, driving up the cost of US borrowing, that checked Trump’s initial “liberation day” drive, prompting the “pause”.But if time drags on with no agreements in sight, the next wave of distress signals are likely to come not from Wall Street but from main street – in soaring prices and empty shelves. How Trump responds then is anyone’s guess.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEconomics viewpointUS economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationTariffsEconomicsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Trump is destroying itGil Barndollar andRajan MenonThe US’s greatest strategic advantage is its friendly neighbors. But its ties to Canada and Mexico are being underminedSun 4 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 07.01 EDTShareThe secret to American power and pre-eminence was best summed up more than a century ago.America, observed Jean Jules Jusserand, France’s ambassador to the United States during the first world war, “is blessed among the nations”. To the north and south were friendly and militarily weak neighbors; “on the east, fish, and the west, fish”. The United States was and is both a continental power and, in strategic terms, an island – with all the security those gifts of geography provide. No world power has ever been as fortunate. This unique physical security is the real American exceptionalism.Americans take this providential geography for granted: their country’s wars are always away games, and their neighbors are trading partners and weekend getaway destinations, not rivals or enemies. The ability of the United States to project power around the globe depends on technology and logistics, but it rests ultimately on the foundation of secure borders and friendly neighbors. But that may not be the case much longer. In threatening war with bothCanadaandMexico,Donald Trumpis obliterating America’s greatest strategic advantage.In normal times, one would be hard-pressed to find a pair of friendlier nations than the United States andCanada. Canadians and Americans share a common language (aside from the Québécois), sports leagues, $683bn in trade, and the world’s longest undefended border, more than 5,000 miles (8,000km) long. Americans and Canadians have fought side by side in both world wars, as well as in Korea and Afghanistan.Trump’s coveting of Canada is easy to mock and dismiss. Since returning to office in January, he has said repeatedly that he wants to make Canadathe 51st stateand taken tocallingformer Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau “Governor Trudeau.” In what could be asatire of the post-9/11 ambitionsof some American neoconservatives, Trump called the border with Canada “an artificial line” that “makes no sense”.But Canadians aren’t laughing. Living next door to a superpower that has fought multiple wars over the last 20 years and now practices a post-truth politics, they are angry and rattled.Liquor stores in Canada havepulledAmerican-made alcoholfrom their shelves. The singing of the Star-Spangled Banner during hockey and basketball games has provokedboosfrom the stands. Airline travel from Canada to the United States has cratered, with ticket sales dropping70%. Trudeau, not knowing he was on a hot mic, told his ministerial colleagues that Trump’s territorial avarice was “a real thing” and that they should not dismiss it as typical Trumpian bluster. Mark Carney, Trudeau’s successor,warnedCanadians that the longtime partnership with the US, “based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over”.Earlier this year, Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative party’s candidate in Canada’s national elections, enjoyed a huge lead in the polls and seemed destined to become the next prime minister. But Canadians’ dislike of TrumpapparentlyhelpedCarney, a political newcomer and the Liberal party’s candidate (despiteTrump’s criticism of Poilievrein a Fox News interview, perhaps because Poilievre, reacting to his falling poll numbers, pivoted to criticizing the American president). Carney’s poll numbers surged, Poilievre’s plunged, and this week, Carneywon the election– but he’s not about to preside over Canada’s annexation. By Carney’s account, in conversations, Trump has brought up his vision of Canada as the United States’ 51st state, something Carney hasdismissedoutright.Americans are apt to find the idea of a security threat from Canada ridiculous. Some of Trump’s antipathy to Canada rests on its paltry defense spending, less than 1.5% of GDP, making Canada one of Nato’s laggards. But Canadian capabilities are critical for the defense of the American homeland. Canadian long- and short-range radars provide the bulk of theNorth Warning System(NWS), which guards against airplanes and missiles entering North America via the North Pole. A Canadian withdrawal from the jointly run NWS would diminish the United States’ capacity for strategic defense and deterrence. While such a move by Canada would normally be unthinkable, if it fears invasion, as it has reason to do now, it may take steps that have hitherto been beyond the realm of possibility.If Trump’s actions against Canada boggle the mind, his stance toward Mexico is more explicable, albeit far more dangerous. Trump came down that golden escalator at Trump Tower in June 2015 and announced his first presidential bid with a diatribe against Mexican immigrants. In the decade since, the Republican party has come to view Mexican drug cartels, if not the Mexican state itself, as a major threat to the United States, even as Mexico has displaced China to become the US’slargest trading partner.With Trump back in power, the reality is starting to match the rhetoric. Active-duty US troopsare now on the southern borderand Mexican drug cartels have been officially labeled asforeign terrorist groups, providing the legal pretext for the president to order US soldiers to enter Mexican territory and destroy them. US surveillance drones are monitoring fentanyl labs in Mexico – by mutual agreement – but the Mexican president,Claudia Sheinbaum, has ruled out their being used to strike drug cartels, something US officials havereportedly discussed.Although Trumpissued an executive orderon the first day of his second term, declaring an emergency on the US-Mexican border, the active duty troops he has deployed there aren’t currently engaged in law enforcement, which US law prohibits, only providing logistical support to Customs and Border Protection. But were Trump to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act at some point, that could change and the military could begin apprehending and detaining Mexican migrants.Any unilateral US military intervention inMexicowould be reckless. With some of the US’s largest cities just a few hours from the border, the cartels would have ample opportunities for retaliation, which in turn would provoke American escalation. Civilian deaths caused by US military strikes could unleash major domestic strife in Mexico, a country of 130 million people, to the point of creating a tidal wave of refugees. US geography shielded it from most of the consequences of its disastrous post-9/11 wars in the greater Middle East. But US luck would finally run out if Trump tried to rerun a version of the “war on terror” across the southern border.With wars raging in Europe and the Middle East and Trump toying with unprecedented tariffs on many US partners and allies, the fallout from Trump’s “America first” policies seem to be primarily in Europe and Asia. But the most gratuitous and serious threats to American security and prosperity lie closer to home.Barely three months into his second term, Donald Trump has damaged, perhaps even irrevocably, relationships with his country’s two neighbors andlargest trading partners. Few US presidents have committed greater strategic malpractice. None have done it with such speed. If the president wants to identify something he has achieved that none of his modern-day predecessors have, this feat would certainly qualify.Gil Barndollar is a non-resident fellow at the Defense Priorities Foundation.

Its longest periods of government are the result of the skills of the men who led it – Robert Menzies and John Howard. And compared with the Labor party, it gives its leaders more power. They have a free hand in the choice of their ministry, and they are ultimately responsible for the development of party policy. There are consultative mechanisms in place, between the leader and the party room, and between the parliamentary party and the organisation. But the power ultimately lies with the parliamentary party, and within that with the leader. If the leader chooses not to consult, he cannot be made to do so; and if the party organisation is unhappy about a particular policy direction it can advise and warn, but it cannot veto.Australians have soundly rejected Trump-style culture wars. Now Albanese must act with courage and vision | Julianne SchultzRead moreThe Liberal party’s two failed policy documents of last century, John Hewson’s Fightback! and John Howard’s Future Directions, were both produced out of the leader’s office. There was some use of outside consultancy firms, but almost no consultation with the parliamentary party or with the party organisation, including its joint standing committee on federal policy.Following the 1993 election loss to Paul Keating who had subjected the nation to “the recession we had to have”, the organisational structures which allowed an unpopular tax to become the centre of an election campaign were reviewed. There was a renewed emphasis on the need for a policy partnership between the parliamentary party and the organisation, but nothing essentially changed. The party’s fortunes continue to be hostage to one man’s leadership abilities.SoPeter Duttonwas right on Saturday night to take responsibility for the election loss. The policy ball was always in his court, but he barely noticed as he put his energy into sledging Labor. He would clean up Labor’s mess, Albanese was weak, only the Liberals had a plan. But it all lacked substance. Dutton told us he was a strong leader, tough and decisive, but when one looked more closely there was barely anything there – just claims and bluster, repeated by other leading Liberals. And it was massively overegged.Take the claim, made by both the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, and the campaign spokesperson, James Paterson, that under Labor Australia had suffered the greatest collapse in living standards in its history. Really? Compared with the early 1930s when a third of workers were unemployed, or in the 1890s when a speculative building bubble burst and the savings of thousands of people evaporated? How could intelligent, well-educated men spout such nonsense? Where did these campaign talking points come from – the leader’s office? To me, this was evidence of gross incompetence. Did no one know enough history to amend the claim to the greatest collapse of living standards in living memory, which is at least arguable? Or did they think that Australians knew so little history that no one would notice?So where does this massive defeat leave the party? The answer is, in dire straits, perhaps as dire as the situation after the 1943 election when the major non-labour party, the United Australia party, was reduced to 13 seats and 18.33% percent of the vote. These were the ashes from which Menzies and others reconstructed the party into a viable party of government which went on to win the 1949 election and govern for 23 years.Looking across the diminished ranks of Liberal parliamentarians, one sees no one of Menzies’ stature. The loss of Liberal moderates is a huge problem for any rejuvenation of the party. The competent, professional women who won old blue-ribbon Liberal seats in 2022 have mostly held them. But the marginalisation of Liberal moderates has been going on since the 1980s as Howard and the dries defeated the so-called wets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 1994 Georgiou succeeded Andrew Peacock who had succeeded Menzies to the prized Melbourne seat of Kooyong, and he held it for 16 years before retiring. Georgiou was competent and intelligent, with lived understanding of the changes postwar migration was making to Australia, yet he never held a ministry. His successor, Josh Frydenberg, was treasurer, restoring Kooyong to its historic place in a Liberal government until he lost it to Monique Ryan in 2022. The Liberals preselected a candidate, Amelia Hamer, with a Liberal moderate pedigree, and lost again.So where to from here? For my money, Dan Tehan is the most plausible. He is experienced, with no taint of scandal, and seems decent, though his doubling of the Hecs fees for humanities degrees when he was minister for education was a dreadful decision, showing that he too places little value on understanding our history. But the Liberals will need to think long and hard about their history if they are to find a way out of their current mess.It has put its faith in the capacity of the leader to develop the policies which will win the confidence of the electorate.Judith Brett is a political historian and biographer, and an emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University.

Yet it is not the phrases themselves that are troubling – there is real substance to them – but the missed opportunity to grasp the true meaning of what Buddhist teacher Tara Brach calls“radical acceptance”.Radical acceptance represents a fundamental principle in both Buddhism andmodern psychologyand is neatly summarised in thepsychotherapeutic expression“the only way out is through”.‘Let them’: can this viral self-help mantra change your life?Read moreIn a culture that emphasisespositive thinking, many tend to avoid, repress or downplay negative emotions and complex life events. Acceptance offers apowerful alternative. It encourages us to acknowledge and allow challenging states of mind and paves the way for greater wholeness, healing and ease.However, acceptance cannot be achieved instantaneously or via platitudes, nor can it be attained through willpower alone. It requires consistent effort and repeated application.In an era where viral self-help mantras such asMel Robbins’ “let them” theoryseem appealing, it is tempting to seek quick fixes to complex problems. However, authentic radical acceptance involves more than detaching from others’ behaviours; it requires accepting one’s own fluctuating mind states and engaging with the world from a place of wisdom, flexibility and humility.When my immediate family member died recently after a prolonged period of illness, the dimensions of my grief were (and continue to be) varied – sometimes jagged, sometimes soft and sometimes hard to accept. Yet I reminded myself that nothing was wrong. This was not a mistake. It was exactly as it was.Over months, I noted “anguish”, “desperation”, “bargaining”, “funny story”, “loving memory”, “fretting”, “attempt to fix”, and so on. With time, a relationship of friendliness emerged and, alongside it, a growing acceptance of what had initially felt unbearable.The practice is to accept each small, containable moment over and over rather than being lured into a grand narrative about a catastrophic life event.According to Brach, radical acceptance invites us topause, recognise and allowwhatever arises within us with a spirit of tenderness and care. It can take the form of a gentle “yes” or a knowing bow to our predominant experience, whatever shape it takes.As we learn to accept complicated and unwanted feelings such as confusion, disbelief, despair, judgment and resistance, we gradually relate to our circumstances with realism and courage. We notice our thoughts, yearnings and corresponding body sensations and set aside our desire to control or improve our situation. With time, we sow seeds of compassion, even joy, amid difficulty. And our wisdom grows.Of course, this is easier said than done.Even in spiritual circles, there is a tendency to bypass difficult experiences or unacceptable emotions. The late Buddhist psychotherapist John Welwood coined the termspiritual bypassingto warn against misusing spirituality, even popular psychology, to avoid the necessary emotional and psychological work required for healing. While certain interpretations of spirituality can make us feel good or righteous in the moment, they can also serve to control andavoidwhat is happening beneath the surface, which has been proven to result inundesired psychological outcomes.So what does it mean to practise acceptance without bypassing intolerable experiences and feelings?The first step is admitting what we are going through is hard and that it is very human to resist what is painful. We might start by saying, “I am suffering right now” or “This is hard, and I don’t like it”. Next, we strive to set aside our desire to replace negative experiences with positive ones. While this may seem at odds with the pursuit of happiness – particularly if we equate happiness with pleasure – it offers a more realistic and potentially fruitful way of being with our human predicament.As we become more willing to accept the unacceptable, buried, unconscious memories and feelings may emerge and ask to be held inloving attention.You might wonder: what if things are genuinely catastrophic? What if I am faced with circumstances I cannot possibly accept?The answer lies in abandoning the struggle. In Buddhism, we are encouraged to “let things be” – a phrase manyBuddhist teachersprefer to “letting things go”. This means seeing each moment, whether pleasant or unpleasant, as complete and whole, reflecting the flow of causes and conditions that constitute it. Let it be!You don’t have to enjoy every part of reality – in fact, things would get boring and you might get very disappointed if you only welcomed pleasant experiences – but instead, you can allow it to unfold as it will.Many of us have been raised with unrelenting standards. We need radical acceptance | Ahona GuhaRead moreAs Rumi writes in his beloved poemThe Guest House, “This being human is a guest house … the dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in.” He calls on us to inviteall“unexpected visitors” in – it’s a radical proposition.Buddhist monkAjahn Sumedhocaptures the heart of radical acceptance with the instruction, “It is like this right now. Life is like this right now.” In moments of distress, we might repeat these words. The striking part of his suggestion is that you do not have to do anything in particular. Life flows on and you meet it precisely as it is. With time, you may come to realise you are not the boss of your life or anyone else’s.

Someone should let our policymakers knowSun 4 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 21.52 EDTShareTo be a transgender person in the UK over the past two weeks has been to wake up daily to discussions on how your life must be made smaller. The supreme court ruled on 16 April that references to a person’s sex in the Equality Act 2010 should beinterpreted as referring only to “biological sex”. Since then, we have learned through a drip-drip of interviews and late-night website updates what the practical impacts of this verdict are likely to be.The equalities minister, Bridget Phillipson, was one of the first to speak for the government, telling parliament thatLabourwould “offer trans people the dignity that too often they were denied” under previous administrations. A head-spinning claim, given that she had warmed up by telling Good Morning Britain a transgender woman in a pub with a full bladder should use the men’s loo.Even that suggestion was made to look generous by the publication of anew “interim update”from the Equality and Human Rights Commission – a statutory body responsible for the promotion and enforcement of equalities law – late on a Friday evening, the night before the pope’s funeral. A cynic might wonder about the timing – it would certainly have been a convenient moment to release information you preferred not to receive intense media scrutiny.The text echoed Phillipson’s position that transgender women should not use facilities for women, nor transgender men those designated for men. But then it went further, asserting that “in some circumstances” both groups might also lawfully be excluded from facilities intended for their own “biological sex”. No detail was provided on what those circumstances might be.Transgender people banned from both the gents and the ladies, then, at that pub they imagined on GMB? A subsequent line did add that “trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use”, though again readers were left to guess at how this would be avoided.Is this what “dignity” means in 2025? To be placed in a position where you are made to feel so uncomfortable entering any toilet in a particular building that you instead awkwardly ask a colleague if he wouldn’t mind popping into his to grab you some tissue to deal with a runny nose due to hay fever? Or was this the “clarity” the prime minister, Keir Starmer,had been so delighted to receive?Even as I write this I feel a rising instinct to temper myself, to apologise for exasperation and police my tone. Anger is not a natural home for me. As I wrotewhen I came out publiclyas transgender in the Guardian, and as listeners to any of the podcasts I appear on already know, I’m a laugher, not a fighter. I’d much sooner be seeking our common ground.I can vividly remember the terror I felt writing that piece, fearing it might spell the end of my career. Clearly, it did not. I am still a sportswriter, and broadcaster, and much else besides. It has been my experience – even travelling across four continents at different times since my transition – that an overwhelming majority of people will take you as you are, not as any government imagines you to be.In the language of the angriest online campaigners, transgender people only ever “barge into” spaces intended for the opposite sex. Yet several of the most enduring friendships I have made since my transition have grown from explicit invitations – one to help form a podcast about women’s experiences playing board games in hobby spaces, and another to join an improv class for women and non-binary people.“Invited” might not even be a strong enough word for the latter instance. “Collared by the organiser and informed I was signing up after coming to watch a friend perform”, would be another way of describing it. I hope they know how grateful I am for all the mirth we have shared since.Lucky for me that these groups contain fewer than 25 people. Another astonishing line in the EHRC’s interim updatesuggestedthat any association for women or men reaching that number should not admit transgender women or men respectively.The disconnect between the reality of our lives and the way we are discussed by policymakers feels profound. One of the most pernicious lies I see thrown around by bad-faith actors in this exhausting and never-ending “debate” is that transgender women do not understand how women who are not trans are obliged to make constant risk assessments to protect their personal safety.How silly of me to imagine I ought to do the same. Why did I not just cut in and announce my transgender status to the cab driver who, hearing me say I was tired on the way back from covering the Super Bowl for this newspaper, suggested he could drive me back to his bed for a lie down? Or to the man who chased me down a dark street in Marylebone shouting sexual suggestions, until I found refuge under the umbrella of a couple who kindly offered to shield me, as I tried to get back to my hotel after covering the Euro 2020 final?Perhaps both men had already identified me as transgender, or perhaps not. These are not relevant considerations when you find yourself in a vulnerable situation and are making on-the-spot calculations to find a way out.What is relevant is that I had no parallel experiences in all the years before my transition. Meanwhile, every woman I have ever discussed them with has related back to me with similar – or worse – stories of their own. These are things that happen to women, transgender or not.It is an element of the conversation that has been missing this past fortnight, from the mouths of ministers to the pages of national newspapers: an acknowledgment that, no matter how you legislate, transgender people’s lives are not suddenly going to fit neatly into the boxes you imagine for them.You can ban people like me from using a toilet that reflects our reality – the way society treats us, the nature of our changed bodies and even the updated sex (not gender) markers on our government-issued IDs. But you cannot force us to go back to one that doesn’t. All you achieve is to make our lives more difficult and less safe.Not to worry, mind you, since the people doing all this have been so clear that they intend to protect our dignity. What a treat it will be to discover what they think that word means.Nicky Bandini is a football writer and broadcasterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I worked in the Vatican for 18 years, and on my return to Rome for the funeral ofPope Francislast month, the tension and drama were already palpable.Some observers and former colleagues I spoke to believe this will be a particularly difficult conclave, given its size – 133 electors, as opposed to 117 last time – and the fact that many of the cardinals don’t know one another. This is down to Francis diversifying the college, appointing cardinals from all over the world: a full 108 of the current crop were his selections. Others suggest the electors will try to reach a decision in less than a week to avoid the appearance of a divided church.In Conclave,the filmbased on Robert Harris’s novel, the conservative and progressive factions vie for dominance (using various underhand methods to lobby and campaign) while external events, which the voters are meant to be shut away from, intervene in the form of a terror attack. It’s an informative, though only partially accurate, portrayal. It’s true that there are both progressive and conservative currents within the church, but there is also a moderate current, which the film didn’t represent.View image in fullscreenStanley Tucci as Cardinal Bellini in the Robert Harris film adaptation, Conclave.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyThe progressive wing is represented by cardinals who will now seek to maintain the disruptive and reformist momentum of Pope Francis, pushing the church to modernise its structures and enter into dialogue with the contemporary world. Among their leading figures are the Italian cardinal Matteo Zuppi and the German cardinal Reinhard Marx, who has spoken openly about the need for reform within the church. The conservative wing focuses instead on safeguarding Catholic doctrine: the Hungarian cardinal Péter Erdő and the Congolese cardinal Fridolin Ambongo are among the prominent representatives of this stance.The moderate wing, on the other hand, seeks to build bridges between the two positions by adopting a more dialogue-oriented approach. It sees the church as one actor among many in the pursuit of the common good, encouraging engagement with culture, politics and other religions. Its representatives include the US cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, currently serving in the Roman curia, and the French cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline.In the days ahead, the first major challenge will be for cardinals across these three currents to get to know one another. They have already had preliminary meetings, often referred to as the “pre-conclave”. Here they present their ideas about how the church should be led, as well as describing their local realities – for instance, from remote regions or countries with fewer Christians. In this way, the necessary profile for the new leader, whether to continue or break from the previous pontificate, gradually emerges and alliances are formed. It wouldn’t be correct to assume that the 108 cardinals created by Francis will automatically vote for a reformist candidate; this is because some of them were appointed for specific reasons (as is the case of the curial cardinals, who work for the Vatican’s administrative state) and because others, over time, develop their own aspirations within the church.View image in fullscreenCrowds wait for the smoke announcing the result on the seond day of the papal election conclave, 13 March 2013 at the Vatican.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesDuring my time in Rome, I noticed that many seemed to be in favour of an Italian pope (the last one, Pope John Paul I, died in 1978). But as the saying goes: “He who enters the conclave as pope, leaves as a cardinal.” In other words, those seen as the most likely winners during the pre-conclave period are often quickly overtaken by others who have not been on the front pages of the newspapers.Seasoned Vatican observers note the appetite, regardless of geographical or ideological background, for the candidate to be in good health and ideally over 70 years old. “We need a new holy father, not an eternal father,” as one bishop told me.As far as Italian candidates are concerned, it is interesting to note thatItalyis the nation with the highest number of cardinal electors: 17 in total (12.6%). The three most mentioned names are Pietro Parolin, former Vatican secretary of state; Matteo Zuppi, president of the Italian Bishops’ Conference; and Pierbattista Pizzaballa, patriarch of Jerusalem, whose profile is particularly striking given the historical moment and the complex geopolitical location in which he exercises his pastoral work. His only “flaw” is that he is 60 years old.Fist fights, ghostly pranks and schism: a brief history of conclaves pastRead moreIn each conclave, there emerge the “great electors”: those with greater influence and experience, or those from financially powerful dioceses. In the run-up to the conclave that elected John Paul II in 1978, Polish bishop Andrzej Maria Deskur championed the candidacy of cardinal Karol Wojtyła, as he was then known, working so tirelessly that he suffered a stroke the day before conclave began. The day after Pope John Paul’s election, he visited Deskur in hospital and soon after named him a cardinal. Similarly, the Brazilian cardinal Cláudio Hummes was a key “great elector” for Pope Francis, and even suggested the name “Francis”, urging him not to forget the poor.As preparations for the conclave continue, the Sistine Chapel is being fitted with chairs and desks for the electors. Vatican security forces are rigorously inspecting the site to ensure there are no hidden microphones or devices that could leak information. All of this is intended to ensure that once the conclave begins on 7 May, the 133 electors will be completely cut off from the outside world and fully focused on their task.Thus, as the doors of the Sistine Chapel close following the historic command of “Extra omnes” (“everyone out”), and the world’s attention focuses on a chimney, one of the most consequential acts of our era will begin: the election of a new spiritual leader for more than a billion faithful. Beyond strategies, factions and nationalities, the conclave must remember that its mission is ultimately to select the one best suited to lead the church in our time.Ariel Beramendi worked at the Vatican for 18 years as an official in the Dicastery for Communication.

Colin Matthews, agenial former schoolteacher, was putting in another shift trying to convince people to give him another term as a local Conservative councillor and marvelling at the outbreaks of fury he was encountering. One man, he told me, had simply grabbed a bit of Tory campaign literature out of his letterbox and torn it into small pieces.A couple emerged from their house and got into a very large car. For some reason, they were both carrying huge slices of chocolate cake teetering on tiny white plates. What one of them told me was laced with disdain. “They don’t normally turn out giving us leaflets,” she said, pointing at Matthews. “They don’t normally give two shits.” Even here, it seemed, rude and angry were the things to be.Reform UK is main opposition party, Nigel Farage claims after election winsRead moreMatthews and a few of his fellow Tories explained some of the reasons for local people’s fury: the government’s plansto put up lines of pylonsin the fields next to the Lincolnshire coast, and the giving-over of increasing expanses ofland to solar farms. Outside the town’s principal pub, a few people talked of immigrants in Skegness being housed while military veterans slept on the streets. It was an odd spectacle: flailing fury in an idyllic-looking environment, for reasons Matthews well understood. “This country’s buggered,” he said.It’s certainly not a country that is prepared to give his party much support. In Thursday’s council elections, Matthewswas defeatedby a Reform UK candidate who received nearly three times as much support. Lincolnshire’s first mayoral election, meanwhile, waswon by Andrea Jenkyns, the former Conservative minister who has just joined Nigel Farage’s latest political vehicle. At 6.30 the next morning, I watched her give themost graceless, clunky acceptance speechI have ever seen, in which she said it was time for an end to “soft-touch Britain” – kindness, be gone! – and suggested that asylum seekers should be forced to live in tents.The biggest part of this story was about Tory defeat and collapse. But Reform got close totwice Labour’s vote in North East Lincolnshire, a local government area that includes Grimsby and Cleethorpes, a constituency with a Labour MP. Across the country, moreover, as the party took control of 10 councils and the Tories crashed, there was the same sense of a realignment of the right being part of something even bigger.A vocal chunk of Reform supporters – men in particular – is nothing if not familiar. They want “British shops”, zero immigration, the return of capital punishment and all the other things that usually make it on to the average hard-right shopping list. But in Lincolnshire I also spoke to newly converted Farage voters who spoke in much vaguer, tentative terms about how they simply craved change.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage with Andrea Jenkyns, left, and Sarah Pochin, winner of the Runcorn and Helsby byelection, 2 May 2025 in Paddock Wood, Kent.Photograph: Lia Toby/Getty ImagesWhat tied everybody together – along with plenty of abstainers – was the same bitterness and bad feeling I saw in Alford. Some 48 hours before polling day, Luke Tryl, the director of the More In Common thinktank, had reported backfrom his latest focus groups, which he said were brimming with a level of “anger, despondency or misery about the state of Britain that doesn’t feel sustainable”. That is completely right, and what has fundamentally caused that wave of negativity might be a lot simpler than some people would like to think.People’s food-shop costs, council tax bills and dealings with HMRC highlight the fact that they are paying much more for far less – surely the dictionary definition of infuriating. Thewinter fuel allowance cut, one of those rare political stories that just about everybody now mentions, has cast the government – probably for keeps – as mean bureaucrats set on tilting the scales even further away from basic fairness. And these distributional furies are the context for a lot of people’s complaints about immigration.There is also an overarching narrative about the last two decades. After the financial crash of 2007-8, the false dawn of Brexit, the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the ongoing cost of living crisis, people have a sense of life amounting to one damn thing after another. In that context, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves following their election win with warnings that everything was about toget even worsewas the most stupid thing they could have done. And here we are. Life continues to go round in circles, and with each grim rotation of the wheel, Farage and his friends get more and more popular.Dining across the divide: ‘I felt like the atmosphere was quite hostile’Read moreThey do so despite the clear gap between the issues they habitually bang on about and what might actually improve millions of lives. Over the weekend, Reform leaders sounded off aboutteaching kids the wonders of the British empire, theevils of councils’ diversity policiesand how they were going tofight green investment. In the places where they will now be in charge, meanwhile, the same stark problems fester on, even amid affluence: hollowed-out local services, terrible public transport, a chronic lack of social housing and a shortage of work more fulfilling than driving delivery vans or making up the parcels that are piled into them. To point that out is not to overlook the politics of culture and identity, but still: if mainstream politicians finally began to act on those issues, maybe they would begin to be less loathed and mistrusted.That, in crude terms, is a picture of how this moment could pass. But I also wonder whether England might have irrevocably changed in ways that none of us yet understand.When I hear people pay tribute to Farageas a “good lad” and see whole streets rush to take pictures of him on their phones, I rather wonder what has happened to our old bullshit detector. We are no longer the country of “mustn’t grumble” – quite the reverse, in fact. It often feels, moreover, as if the 21st-century combination of social media’s polarising effects and all those economic convulsions has left us with an intensified version of an old national problem: our inability to really speak to each other and collectively bargain for a better country. All of us, it sometimes seems, are suffering from the political equivalent of road rage, manifested in either futile shouting or tense silence.The day after my stop in Alford, I spent two days in Boston, the Fenland town that has long been a byword for immigration from eastern Europe and support for Farage. As usual, I stayed at the local Premier Inn, and dined in the adjoining pub and restaurant. Outside, everything was aligning for a victory based on anger and disaffection. Inside, despite the 30 or so people who were seeing out their evening, there was a deathly quiet, and a scene that vividly summed up where we have arrived: among the pints of Madri and faux-traditional grub, even the married couples hardly said a word to each other.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLocal electionsOpinionNigel FarageReform UKLabourConservativesLocal governmentLocal politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s just another way of making mothers feel guiltyRhiannon Lucy CosslettWe need a society that supports parents and makes good food choices achievable – not more lecturing of exhausted mumsSun 4 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 08.39 EDTShareLike many modern mothers, I have on occasion piped cold bolognese directly from a pouch into my small child’s open mouth and, radical though it may seem, I refuse to feel guilty about it. There is a lot ofpanic about ultra-processed foods(UPFs), and baby food pouches, with theirhigh sugar contentand dubious nutritional value, are the latest targets. Researchers at the University of Leeds School of Food Science and Nutritionfound that41% of main meals marketed for children had sugar levels that were too high and that 21% of ready-to-eat fruit products, cereals and meals were too watery and not providing adequate nutrition.It’s not great. But is it news? No parent picks up something called “Heinz fruity banana custard” believing it a fantastic alternative to actual mashed banana, yet this is being treated as the Watergate of the under-4s sandpit crowd. I’m starting to wonder if people have lost their collective minds over processed food. I even saw one comment calling for the death penalty for baby food producers. Baby pouch hysteria is the perfect new addition to the maternal guilt industrial complex.Look: I am, like many parents, concerned about the usual dietary issues, from childhood obesity to tooth decay to rickets. The way that baby food is marketed is certainly worthy of examination. In a way, I’m the perfect target for content about the dangers of UPFs: my mother, who was very much ahead of the curve on this, taught me how to cook from scratch on a low income, to be suspicious of certain additives and to generally consume things that your great-grandmother would recognise as food. I was mostly raised vegetarian, as was my husband, so we limit our consumption of meat and shop free range and organic as much as we can. You would think this “news” about pouches would worry me.But I have beenwriting this parenting columnfor long enough to be suspicious of any topic that could be used as a stick with which to beat mothers – and it’s usually mothers. Unevidenced claims, such as that thestraws on pouches cause speech delays, or contested claims that pureeslead children to be fussy eaters, seem designed to shame us into abandoning them and returning to the kitchen where we belong. I am sick of being bombarded by grinning egg-gathering trad wives who put cooking everything from scratch on the same continuum as serving your husband and denying your children lifesaving vaccines. The context into which this UPF debate has landed is one where we are seeing renewed efforts to confine women to lives of domestic toil.Ultra-processed babies: are toddler snacks one of the great food scandals of our time?Read moreWhether it’s diet or potty training, mothers are blasted as too lazy and too busy on their phones to put in the hard work of mothering. Yet I have yet to meet a baby that has been exclusively fed on baby food pouches, nor a mother who is unaware that a packet consisting largely of pureed fruit is going to be of less nutritional value than a homemade meal cooked from scratch. There are other social, political and economic factors at play here, which are continually elided in UPF coverage.One is time and labour. The current infant feeding orthodoxy is “baby-led weaning”, which, to my mother’s continued disbelief, involves giving babies pieces of food before they have teeth. Forsafety, these pieces should be soft and juicy, but sometimes the advice goes too far. I was once advised that my son should gnaw on a chicken bone, and I later found out that this is actually a choking hazard. In other words, purees – even the ones you make at home by blending sweet potatoes with your own breast milk before freezing them in ice cube trays, surely as virtuous as it gets – have become highly unfashionable.I had various reasons for choosing purees, not least being told by a paediatrician that “there’s a reason apes chew up their babies’ food before giving it to them, and that reason is choking”. But time was an important one of those reasons. Sitting there waiting for an infant to mash a stick of cooked carrot between his gums was not something I was prepared to do. I wanted to work and sleep. I wanted to leave the house and talk to other humans, and feel the warmth of the sun on my skin. I had tolive.I chose sanity.What I was unprepared for was the moral judgment, even though all I did was wait for a few more gnashers to appear. In choosing a pouch, the crime that a mother is being found guilty of is one of convenience. As one mum put it to me this week: “The pouches were a godsend when out and about and without them loads of trapped mums would be stuck in the house. I feel like anything that makes our life easier is a target.”The nutritionist Laura Thomas recently wrote a brilliant piece taking issue with those who criticise ultra processed baby foods. To Thomas, the preparation of fresh baby food represents whatthe sociologists Priya Fielding-Singh and Merin Oleschuk call “foodwork”, ie meal planning, shopping, preparing, cooking and cleaning up. It is work that is often mostly undertaken by women. Foodwork is one of the many facets of the “intensive mothering” culture in which, Thomas writes, “the work of weaning has taken on a valence that I have come to understand as part of a larger project to re-domesticate women”. It is worthreading the essay in full, because it has important things to say about how foodwork is weaponised in ways that rarely take account of structural and social inequalities of class, gender and race. I’d add disability to that list, too, because these food orthodoxies never seem to account for children with additional needs.Were I to choose to feel guilty about my occasional use of an Ella’s Kitchen pouch, I’d be buying into a neoliberal mindset that emphasises personal responsibility over fixing those inequalities. I’d be buying into an increasingly prevalent nostalgia for the time of home-cooked family meals, the decline of which is blamed almost entirely on working mothers, rather than the fact that we, as humans, are being deprived of systems of communal care, and which contain the seeds of our liberation. You can’t divorce food from politics. I might enjoy cooking from scratch for my family – I have the time and resources to do so – but I refuse to get completely back in the kitchen.Food companies need to play a part, but my vision for a better society for parents and children goes far beyond condemning pureed fruit. It is one with improved paternity leave, and workplace creches, SureStart centres delivering free weaning and cooking workshops, meal vouchers, the abolishment of the two-child benefit cap. It is one where you don’t need two incomes to afford basic housing costs, or where the intense pressure on parents isn’t such that a pouch so often feels like a solution. “Parents should be actively discouraged from buying these baby pouches,” according to First StepsNutritionTrust. Well, join the queue of people telling us off. Can’t we be more ambitious? What would a society that not only encouraged, but actually supported and facilitated good food choices look like?My son is three now, and he’s tall. Despite his earlier pureed diet, he can wolf down a chicken madras, a bowl of boquerones, most things, really (we used to mix the pouches in with more challenging foods to get him used to them). He likes to eat, this boy we built, whose bones I grew inside me for just under eight months. He was built with my breast milk and with formula and, yes, with pureed sweet potato that I made from scratch. But Ella’s Kitchen and Tesco pouches and melty puffs also built him, just as jars of 80s baby food and rusks helped build my generation. It’s exhausting, thankless work building a person.

But keep the anger about current wars tooSimon TisdallAround the globe, conflict is spreading – but it’s too often going ignored. Are we simply overwhelmed by the scale of it?Sun 4 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 4 May 2025 07.01 EDTShareVictims of Nazi atrocities will be remembered at ceremonies next week marking the end of the second world war in Europe. Survivors and relativesgatheredat the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near Hanover last Sunday to commemorate the estimated 72,000 people who were murdered there. Among those killed was a young German-born Jewish girl, Anne Frank, whosecelebrated diaryrecalls those terrible times.The dead of 1939-45 should never be forgotten. But we should also be mindful to count the dead of 2025. To know that in years to come, we will remember, record and honour victims of today’s recurring atrocities. Each day brings news of more appalling acts by governments and armed groups in wars and conflict zones around the world. One difference now is, unlike the Nazi atrocities, many of these crimes are very public knowledge even as they occur.When confronted by such horrors,silence is unacceptable. Silence is complicity. To remain silent is to suggest nothing has been learned from the past.So where is today’s outrage? Cries of protest are frequently not listened to. Take, for example, recent events in Yemen, one of the world’s poorest countries. Imagine, if you can, what it’s like to be a defenceless Yemeni child or bewildered Ethiopian migrant bombarded without warning from on high by the most lethally sophisticated weapons the US and, shamefully,the RAFpossess.In one terrifying airstrike in Saada last week, 68 civilians, mostly Africans,were killedat a detention centre. The US suggests it was used by Iran-backed Houthi fighters to attack Israel and Red Sea shipping – but has produced no evidence. Human Rights Watch estimatesseveral hundred peoplehave died in Yemen since Donald Trump relaxed bombing rules intended to limit civilian casualties. “Deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure are war crimes,” it warned.Atrocities are analmost daily occurrencein the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where rebels rampage. Yes, like Yemen, it’s a distant land of which most people in the UK know little. But take it from me. I’ve visited Goma and the eastern DRC. Children there are much like children everywhere else. And at the height of recent fighting, Unicef spokesperson James Elder said, a Congolesechild was rapedevery half an hour. Nearly 10,000 cases of rape and sexual violence were reported in January and February this year, Elder said. “Girls and women are enduring the most unimaginable horrors, and they are no longer getting even the basic medical care they need.”In Haiti, thousands have beenkilled or displacedin anarchic gang violence that UN peacekeepers cannot halt. In Myanmar, despite March’s earthquake, themilitary junta carries onkilling and torturing with impunity. Sudan’sgenocidal civil war, entering its third year, is not “forgotten”; it’s mostly just ignored. And then there’sstarving, besieged Gaza, where the predominantly civilian death toll caused by Israel’s war ismore than 52,000. Who will erect a memorial to their murdered daughters? Who will publish their diaries?Why is this carnage tolerated, even normalised? One proffered reason is the complexity and number of conflicts – the most since 1945. The totalhas doubledin the past five years. More than 300 million peopleneed humanitarian aidand protection. Yet the UN system, frequently paralysed by major power rivalries, is failing. Its authority is scorned, its envoys sidelined, its peacekeepers attacked, in Lebanon and elsewhere. It is critically under resourced.Key agencies are running out of funds, endangering millions of lives, the UN’s emergency aid chief, Tom Fletcher,warnedlast week. The future of peacekeeping operations, the subject of a crucial summit in Berlin this month, is also in doubt. The US, which contributes 27% of the $5.6bn UN peacekeeping budget, is $1.2bn in arrears. Now Trump proposesto end fundingaltogether.Draconian cuts to national overseas aid and development budgets, notably bythe USand Britain, further reduce capacity to address internal and inter-state violence. Conflict resolution is a forgotten art; witness Trump’s Ukraine blundering. The inability of international courts to effectively sanction states, or detain and punish indicted war criminals such asVladimir PutinandBenjamin Netanyahu, encourages perpetrator impunity.Militarily cosying up to Trump in Yemen cannot end well for the UK | Paul RogersRead moreYet another factor is also at work. People in wealthier, more stable countries appear overwhelmed by the vast extent and sheer awfulness of global breakdown. Anecdotally, many say that faced by relentless tsunamis of upsetting news they simply “switch off”. It’s not that they don’t care. It’s that they feel powerless. Natural disasters still prompt generous responses. The UK Disasters Emergency Committee’s Myanmar earthquake appealraised £16min its first week.But man-made “forever wars”, and complicated ethnic and religious conflicts in, say, Afghanistan, Syria or Somalia are harder to engage with. The Charities Aid Foundation’s 2025 report found thatfewer people than everin the UK are giving to charity (at home and abroad). Although a chunky £15.4bn was donated in 2024, the UK’s ranking in CAF’s globalgiving indexslumped to 22. Other well-off countries could do better, too. Some of those that gave the most, such as Kenya, were among those with the least.War and conflict are products, not causes, of current world disorder, which is primarily political in origin. Spreading instability stems, partly at least, from political fragmentation, from the ongoing rejection of globalisation and an agreed international rulebook. A rising tide of authoritarian rightwing populism, ultra-nationalism, me-first economics, xenophobic prejudice and fear of difference – as well as an enervating loss of faith, trust and moral purpose – contribute to this depleted sense of connection.Atrocities are not neatly historical. They don’t only happen to other people in faraway places. They are a metaphor for the ills of the modern world. Politically, militarily and morally atrocious behaviour is spreading like a virus, and draws ever closer to home.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And they have now said unequivocally that they are not angry little Americans, cultural warriors or self-interested libertarians.We always knew that there was a decency at the heart of this nation, but it took the bullying, showbiz bravado of the US president to crystallise it. First as thousands of people cancelled trips to America and then, decidedly, in the privacy of millions of cardboard voting booths.Even the prime minister, who in his first victory speech in 2022 struggled to get beyond the “greatest country” cliche when talking about Australia,found the words on election nightto begin to capture what makes this country unique and full of possibility. With practice and confidence he will get better. It might even translate into transformative action and not be left to die in the graveyard of empty words.Grievance politics not enough — an opposition must have a clear and coherent plan to win government | Arthur SinodinosRead moreCulture is almost always ahead of politics, so the signs have been there for a while. The notion of being unAustralian, which burst into the discourse in 2005 whenSam Kekovich beratedvegetarians, hippies, dissenters of all sorts, was jettisoned nearly two decades later. The iconic Australia Day lamb ad turned itself upside downin 2023embracing (shock horror) diversity. “Guess we are all a bit unAustralian, that’s what makes us Australian.”That’s a start.And when Australian leaders recognise that the ability to embrace the best of what is on offer, to not be afraid of innovation, to combine courage with compassion, remarkable things can happen.It’s been done before. True, this is usually in a dance of two steps forward one step back, but over time the two steps forward set the new direction.It was striking that the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, described his party’s victory as the greatest achievement since federation. Who ever talks about federation? But it was remarkable. It took a decade of debate and two votes in every colony and then protracted negotiations in London to create. A nation was formed that for the next 15 years was a global model of democratic and social innovation.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterWe tend to focus – rightly, and in a very Australian way – on the negatives, on the harshness of the white Australia policy, on the forced deportation of South Sea Islanders, on the exclusion and attempted extermination of the First Peoples.But the rest of the world saw innovation, economic success with a compassionate heart and the birth of an Australian model. Australians were literate, positive and enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the world. There were abundant possibilities.The devastation of the losses in the first world war and being beholden to British imperialism during the great depression sapped this confidence. But even before the second world war ended plans for reconstruction, the lessons of the previous decades were developed and implemented. This set the scene for modern Australia, which reached its peak when the Whitlam government swept to power in 1972 and implemented policies that had been gestating for decades.In the 1980s, when the old protectionist economic model imploded, Australia again led the world with a model of neoliberalism with a human face. It was not perfect, but it was copied around the world and celebrated for time as a “third way”. It was much better than allowing the market to hold the whip hand and privatise everything.Then in the global financial crisis Australian politicians and policymakers were poised to respond, intervening to prevent the catastrophe that occurred in many other countries.Australian election: Anthony Albanese claims a piece of history as scale of Labor victory stuns raucous crowd | Josh ButlerRead moreThese models should provide confidence that there is an Australian way, that even in the face of existential crises innovation is possible, that there is no need to be unduly dependent on what great powers might be doing. That courage and compassion are not incompatible.We have lost the habit of innovation and reform. Its memory needs to be revived and acted on. The crises we currently face – the climate catastrophe, a crumbling post war global order, an unreliable great power, the new digital imperialism and intergenerational inequity – need vision and courage.Strikingly this election showed that the Australian people recognise we can no longer rely on the rest of the world to provide the lead – the future is ours to make, fixing the foundations and imagining the future. As Rose Scott, one of the participants in the federation debates about the new nation, presciently observed: “Be bold, be bold, be bold.

But first-term governments have often gone backwards.The scale of the Labor victory highlights structural problems with the Liberals that have been papered over for years.Dutton lost because of mixed messaging and not the medium.Labor had done its best to lose the election over the last three years but came good at the right time when people were switched on and thinking about the election. Labor was well organised and coherent, their presentation firmly grounded in Labor values and appealed across various demographics.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThere was a clear choice and Australia opted for a version of relaxed and comfortable over a leap into the unknown. The risk of a prime minister Dutton was leveraged with none too subtle references to the “Americanisation” of policies. Just as in Canada, the Trump factor played to the incumbent’s strengths. All politics is local.A stunning win for Labor – podcastRead moreThe danger for Labor now is hubris and overreach. In no small measure, this victory is thanks to their opponents’ fumbles. If they think this victory is an endorsement of the status quo they are setting themselves up for a mighty fall. Labor does not have a proper mandate to grapple with the tough questions of economic reform and grand strategy in a world order that is changing rapidly. Australia cannot stand still.Grievance politics was not enough to win. An opposition must have a clear and coherent plan that demonstrates they are ready to govern.The polls over the preceding few years were a false dawn for Liberals. They were not an indicator of final voting intention but a snapshot of voter frustrations. Dutton amplified those frustrations and acted as if the deal was sealed before the campaign started.As the election came into view, the scrutiny of the opposition increased, and things fell apart.Matching your opponent’s policies only works if you then move the agenda on to your preferred areas of battle, for the Liberals this has always been the economy and national security. They fluffed both. Too little too late on defence and mixed messages on the economy (higher deficits in the next two years and then budget improvement).Now is the time for serious reflection.When the Liberals lost in 2022 it was easy to pin it all on Scott Morrison who ran a very centralised operation.The Abbott-Turnbull rivalry pitted the broad church of liberals and conservatives against itself. Longstanding differences over climate crippled the government.The Morrison era moved somewhat on issues like net zero but was consumed by the urgency of dealing with a once-in-a-century pandemic. Necessary deficit spending in that era played into a public insouciance about debt and deficits.TheCoalitionfranchise has been very successful in winning elections but in a world of AI, changing geopolitical circumstances and wall-to-wall social media, there is room for adaptation. This can be done without abrogating long-held values and principles that can help us navigate the current trends. Liberals preserve the best of the past while adapting to the future.The decision to target outer suburban and regional seats made sense, given Dutton’s persona – but it conceded inner-city seats to the teals and other minor parties.A broad church has an all-of-the-above seat strategy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Menzian Liberals do not divide the electorate into us and them. No snide references to the elites v “the real people”. We value education and science, and meritocracy based on having a fair go. Pragmatism and practicality are preferred to social experimentation and ideology.Liberals eschew identity politics, considering people on their own merits rather than as part of a group, and upholding the rights of the individual in the face of the collective.Economic populism or business bashing is also at odds with traditional Liberal equities around smaller government and lower taxes. The argument for these traditional policies is economic efficiency (a bigger pie that makes more fairness possible) and restraining the power of government over people. Effective competition policies are the best way to restrain the power of big business.A further round of economic reforms in the Hawke-Keating and Howard-Costello mould has become increasingly urgent. Along with smart industrial policies to leverage sovereign capabilities in critical and emerging tech. But advocates need to stand up and explain why and how. It won’t happen by itself.Rational economic policies are entirely compatible with a strong social safety net that balances protection with incentives to self-improvement. Strong families and communities are part of that safety net. The social role of housing is an important priority given the fracturing between generations that we are witnessing in Australia.On social cohesion, the Liberal creed used to be that the things that unite us are greater than those that divide. Social cohesion is not a function of enforcing conformity to a predetermined set of national characteristics.In liberal democratic Australia, freedom to celebrate one’s heritage, religion or beliefs is baked into our values. The only caveat is an overriding loyalty to Australian institutions like democracy and the rule of law that make this freedom possible. Rights and responsibilities in equal measure.This second-term opposition should go back to first principles and build policy on those foundations, in tandem with keeping the government of the day accountable.Australian election 2025 live results: votes tracker and federal seat and Senate countsRead moreListening to our fellow Australians, grappling with the complexity of demographic and social change in a way consistent with Menzian values will succeed if we do the hard work.The countdown to the next election has begun.Arthur Sinodinos is a former Australian ambassador to the US.

Recently, flanked by the preposterously dressed Maga rocker Kid Rock, the presidentsigned an executive orderto protect fans from “crazy prices” by cracking down on scalpers and hidden fees. “Make America Fun Again,” Kid Rock declared.It will take more than an executive order to resolve the ticketing industry’s most intractable problems. Scalpers, anyway, are an easy target with few friends. The fact is that, with or without them, top-flight concert tickets have never been harder to acquire or afford. As customer experiences go, it’s the pits.You may know the drill. You get online at 10am, several months before the show, and receive a place in the virtual queue. Perhaps you notice with dismay that your number is larger than the capacity of the venue. Perhaps you then lose your place because you’ve been misidentified as a bot, or the site crashes altogether. If you make it to the front, you may well wonder why £100 (plus about £20 in opaque surcharges) now qualifies as a cheap seat. And that’s if there are any cheap seats left, not just inflatedVIP packages. And you may ask yourself why it has to be like this.When you don’t get what you want, you tend to look for someone to blame. That someone is usuallyTicketmaster. The company, which merged with concert promoters Live Nation in 2010 to form Live Nation Entertainment, sells about 70% of all concert tickets worldwide, and an even greater proportion of the arena and stadium market. In 2024, Live Nation generated a record $23.2bn (£17.5bn) in revenue, with Ticketmaster selling 637m tickets. Rivals such as See Tickets (owned by Germany’s CTS Eventim) and AXS (the ticketing arm of promoters AEG Presents) aren’t exactly minnows but Ticketmaster has become a synonym for ticketing: a lightning rod and a punchbag.Demand at the top level is insatiable. Oasis would have had to play a stadium every night for six months to satisfy all 14 million fans who wanted ticketsTim Chambers, a freelance consultant who worked for Ticketmaster from 2000 to 2012, calls it “the 800lb gorilla that everyone loves to hate”. Indeed, country singer Zach Bryan gave his 2022 live album the barbed title All My Homies Hate Ticketmaster. For the last 40 years, the company has faced allegations of predatory pricing, misleading fees, restrictive contracts, technical blunders, suppressing or colluding with competitors and generally abusing its monopolistic power. It has been the target of numerous hearings, investigations, class-action lawsuits and multimillion-dollar penalties. Even at the best of times, it makes an enemy of anyone who leaves its site empty-handed. Michael Rapino, Live Nation’s 60-year-old Canadian CEO, is therefore both the most powerful figure in live music and the most controversial. He joked to podcaster Bob Lefsetz in 2023 that he logs on to social media each morning to see who hates him today.View image in fullscreenA fan tries to buy tickets for Oasis’s 2025 reunion tour.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesChambers calls ticketing a “bad-news business”: it only makes headlines when things go wrong, especially if journalists and politicians are directly affected.The intense publicity around the Oasis reunion, which Rapino called “the biggest on-sale in history”, shone a light on the state of the industry last summer.First, prices have gone bananas. A standing ticket to see Oasis at Wembley Stadium on their last tour, in 2009, cost £44 (£69 adjusted for inflation). It will now set you back £151. Great for the Gallaghers, who will take home millions, but ominous for live music in the long term. High prices don’t just attract older, wealthier crowds but leave less money in fans’ pockets for the smaller shows that breed the headliners of tomorrow.Second, demand at the top level is insatiable. With an estimated 14 million fans seeking tickets, Oasis would have had to play a stadium every night for six months to satisfy them all.Third, the Oasis on-sale exposed the relatively new tactic of demand-driven“dynamic pricing”, which more than doubled the price of some tickets without warning. In response, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation into breaches of consumer protection law, while Labour MP Rupa Huq proposed a bill that would enforce transparency about the availability and cost of tickets. The uproar was so great that “dynamic pricing” made the shortlist for the Oxford University Press’sword of the year. A recent More in Common poll found that 58% of Britons would like to see Ticketmaster nationalised: an impossible demand yet symptomatic of populist anger towards the company.In the US, Ticketmaster’s current problems stem from a cardinal error: getting on the wrong side of Swifties. In November 2022, the company failed to stagger the presale for Taylor Swift’s Eras tour, listing all 2m tickets simultaneously. The colossal demand overwhelmed the servers, causing myriad problems. Swift expressed her disappointment. Ticketmaster grovelled. Last May, the US justice department (DOJ) filedan antitrust suit, now backed by 39 states, which alleges that Live Nation and Ticketmaster use their “power and influence … to freeze innovation and bend the industry to their own benefit”.Live Nation protests that its profit margins are less than 2% and its US market share has actually fallen since 2010. An emollient spokesperson, Rapino likes to imply that Ticketmaster is a convenient whipping boy for complex structural factors beyond its control. “There’s so much confusion around this business,”he told the Los Angeles Times. “We need to do more work for fans to understand why they can’t get tickets, or why it’s three times the price on secondary markets.”On the one hand, he would say that, wouldn’t he? On the other, he has a case. Ticketmaster’s competitors charge almost identical prices and fees. “They all act very similarly,” says Chambers. “It’s not a consumer-friendly industry.” He describes a pyramid of financial priorities in the concert business. At the top, of course, is the artist. Below them, in descending order, sit the manager, the promoter, the venue, the sponsor or partner, and the ticket-seller. And right at the bottom are the fans.View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift’s Eras tour lands in France in 2024.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesSo is Ticketmaster the cause of fans’ frustrations or merely the public face? Whyaretickets so expensive and hard to get? And is there a better way?There has never been a golden age of ticket-buying, when the biggest fans got the best tickets for a fair price. Queues, scams and disappointments spring eternal. In the mid-70s, the industry leader was Ticketron, selling tickets via terminals installed in retail outlets, or by telephone. Three men in Phoenix, Arizona, thought they could do it faster and cheaper. They designed a computer system that would allow venues to share a database. On 2 October 1976, Ticketmaster was born.The company grew slowly. When it was bought by Chicago investor Jay Pritzker in 1982, it had just 25 employees and $1m in sales. But the new CEO, bullish New York lawyer Fred Rosen, set out to destroy Ticketron with a radical new business model. Ticketron billed clients to use its terminals, while charging fans a flat booking fee of $2. “We can’t finance this business on the backs of the consumer,” insisted Ticketron vice-president Bob Gorra.Rosen disagreed. He demanded exclusive deals with venues – 100% of the tickets available. In return, he promised to double surcharges and split the additional revenue with his clients, while offering generous signing bonuses and supplying the software and hardware for free. The people paying for all this were the fans, who had to suck it up or miss out. According to former Ticketmaster executive Alan Citron, Rosen promised that his company would become “the face of ticketing” and “take the bruises from people who don’t like the process”.The Los Angeles Times described Ticketmaster as “an agile David tackling an ageing Goliath”, and David won. In 1990, Ticketron was liquidated, with its assets sold to the giant-killer. Soon, the company held the exclusive rights to two-thirds of the tickets sold in major US venues and sold a good chunk of the remaining one-third, too. It had become a prize asset, acquired by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 1993 and by media magnate Barry Diller in 1997.Meanwhile, a New York entrepreneur called Robert FX Sillerman was remaking the concert promotion business at dizzying speed. Having gobbled up so many radio stations that onetrade publication compared him to Pac-Man, he saw a similar opportunity with promoters and venues: consolidation would make tours more efficient and facilitate big-money sponsorship and advertising deals. Sillerman’s company SFX Entertainment embarked on a debt-financed $2bn spending spree that corporatised the last area of the music industry where independent operators had still prevailed. By the time he sold SFX to the radio chain Clear Channel Communications for $4.4bn in 2000, a Goldman Sachs report stated that it was“virtually impossible”to tour the US without playing an SFX venue.The most consequential of Sillerman’s acquisitions was the Canadian promoter Core Audience Entertainment, because its co-founder was Michael Rapino. Rapino says he “came from nothing”, specifically Thunder Bay, Ontario. He began promoting bands in local bars as marketing for Labatt Breweries while still a student at Lakehead University. When Clear Channel spun off its debt-laden promotions company as Live Nation in 2005, 40-year-old Rapino became its first CEO.Rapino is a very modern pop mogul: slick, unflashy, fluent in corporatese. He describes artists as “billion-dollar brands” and music as “one of the most passionate consumer experiences”. Married to Star Trek actor Jolene Blalock since 2003, he’s a vegan father of three who starts every day with meditation. While fellow Canadian Arthur Fogel, Live Nation’s CEO of Global Touring, is an outgoing enthusiast, personally beloved by clients such as Madonna, Beyoncé and Sting, Rapino describes himself as an introvert who doesn’t enjoy working the phones or wining and dining managers. “I don’t think relationships are as important as they historically were,”he told Billboard. “I think great products speak for themselves.”Rapino aggressively expanded Live Nation’s operations, buying majority shares in venue chains around the world and moving into the festival market. He also launched a management division, Artist Nation, which offered so-called “360” deals to artists including U2 and Jay-Z, handling not just artists’ tours but their entire careers. Ticketmaster also expanded into management.But both companies were in the red, especially when the 2008 recession hit the concert market. In February 2009, the two giants announced merger talks in the interest of mutual survival, which raised fears of a vertical monopoly (when one company controls multiple stages of a supply chain). Asthe New Yorker put it, the fusion would combine “the world’s largest ticket seller and the world’s largest management company with the world’s largest concert promoter and the world’s largest venue operator”. Bruce Springsteencalled the proposed merger“the one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now”.View image in fullscreenMichael Rapino is questioned by senators in 2009 about the merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesNonetheless, in January 2010 the DOJ approved the merger under certain conditions to protect competition, and Rapino became the CEO of Live Nation Entertainment. Its new chair, hard-nosed veteran manager Irving Azoff,gave a congressional hearinga version of Rosen’s scapegoat strategy: “Ticketmaster was set up as a system where they took the heat for everybody … We’re like the IRS. We deliver bad news.”Rapino has continued to grow Live Nation by expanding into international markets such as Brazil and India while building more of its own venues from scratch. In the UK, its properties include the vast Academy Music Group and Reading and Leeds festivals. Currently valued at $30bn,the company makes more than 80% of itsrevenuefrom concerts but more than half of itsprofitfrom ticketing, sponsorship and advertising.“He’s remained true to the mission of leveraging the various aspects of the company to support one another,” says Dean Bundick, co-author of Ticket Masters: The Rise of the Concert Industry and How the Public Got Scalped. “He’s realised the goals of Robert FX Sillerman.” In 2022, Rapino’s total remuneration package of $139m made him the fifth highest-paid CEO in the US.How much should it cost to see your favourite band? The industry’s answer is always: more. Thirty years ago, Fred Rosen called concert tickets “the most underpriced commodity in America” and Rapino still claims that they are “massively underpriced”. Speaking onLefsetz’s podcast, he claimed that even people on modest incomes will find the money for a unique experience. While his comparison of a concert ticket to a Gucci bag or a seat at the Super Bowl suggests an unusual definition of a modest income, he isn’t wrong about fans’ willingness to pay sky-high prices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It began in the 1980s, when Rosen escalated service charges to woo venues. Simultaneously, managers of major artists demanded a better split of the gross for their clients,pushing the industry standard from 70/30 to 90/10 and beyond. Surcharges aren’t really payment for a service – it goes without saying that it doesn’t cost £20 to sell a ticket online – but a way for venues and ticketers to get paid.Currently,three add-ons increase the priceof a Ticketmaster ticket by an average of 20-30%: a service charge, a facility fee and a processing fee. The venue (which may be owned by Live Nation) takes about two-thirds of the service charge and all of the facility fee. Ticketmaster gets the remainder. “Everyone has their hand out,” says Chambers, “especially since Covid, when they all lost two years of revenues.”In the 1990s, Robert FX Sillerman caused further inflation by overpaying performers in order to net big sponsorship deals. According to the trade publication Pollstar, between 1996 and 2003 the average ticket price of the top 100 tours almost doubled from $25.81 to $50.35 – more than five times the rate of inflation. By then, digital piracy had demolished record sales so that concert revenue represented up to 95% of an artist’s income. And technological advances in the field of concert design created a costly audiovisual arms race. As a result, the top 100 ticket price rose 55% during the 2010s, reaching $92.42 in 2019, just before the industry went into lockdown.After the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine, worldwide inflation afflicted every element of the concert business, from transport to venue hire to salaries. This coincided with an explosion of pent-up demand that Pollstar called the “Golden Age of Live”. In 2019, 98 million people attended a Live Nation show; last year, it was 151 million. With most small and mid-sized shows, affordability and availability are not an issue. The majority never sell out and many artists struggle to cover their costs. But with A-listers such as Taylor Swift and Coldplay, demand will always exceed supply. Factor in the industry’s need to compensate for 18 months of blackout and the average price spiralled, hitting $135.92 in 2024. Yet Rapino maintains that prices are, in fact, still too low because resale reveals a ticket’s true market value. By this logic, a £100 ticket is underpriced if a secondary seller can list it on StubHub for £400.View image in fullscreenColdplay’s Chris Martin performing live at London’s Wembley Stadium, 2022.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesArtists have always loathed scalpers. “We are at our wits’ end how to keep tickets out of the hands of speculators,” Charles Dickens complained during his 1867 American tour. Yet there is a long and murky history of artists and promoters secretly funnelling tickets to scalpers and taking a cut. Scalping went “from the streets to the internet”, as Rapino puts it, in 2000, when StubHub launched with the euphemistic rebrand “secondary ticketing”.Back then, it was the only way for fans to sell unwanted tickets for legitimate reasons, but the emergence of face-value, fan-to-fan platforms such as Twickets has eliminated that justification. Many tickets on resale sites have been obtained en masse by professional scalpers, sometimes by illegal means, and listed for sale anonymously. Some are even listed speculatively by people who haven’t actually bought them yet. The CMA hasproposed a price capof 10% above face value, but the campaign group FanFair Alliance wants the UK to follow Ireland in criminalising for-profit resale altogether.In the meantime, the industry has three responses to scalpers. One is to throw up obstacles, such as anti-bot software and stringent resale restrictions. (Bots are illegal in many European countries but not the US.) Yet the scalpers, incredibly well organised and technologically adept, always find a way through, while some legitimate fans get caught in the digital net.Another strategy is to get a piece of the action, but that can go badly wrong. In 2009, Ticketmaster directed Bruce Springsteen fans to its own secondary marketplace TicketsNow before the shows had even sold out – the primary seller was also the scalper. “The abuse of our fans and our trust by Ticketmaster has made us as furious as it has made many of you,”Springsteen raged.Ticketmaster blamed a glitch, apologised fulsomely and partly refunded some customers, but the optics remained terrible. In 2018, it closed its resale sites, Seatwave and Get Me In!, and replaced them with a face-value marketplace.The third approach is to charge more to reflect the supposed market value. So prices keep climbing in increasingly inventive ways, such as greater price differentials between the front and back rows or tiered pricing: as each batch of tickets sells out, a more expensive one goes on sale. Then there are numerous premium options targeted at superfans and corporate hospitality. The problem for fans is that VIP packages, along with presales via fanclubs and brand partners, eat away at the number of tickets available for the general on-sale. A2016 investigationby New York’s attorney general found that it was fewer than half.The most contentious mechanism, as Oasis discovered, isdynamic pricing: the greater the demand, the higher the price. This is standard practice with airline seats, hotel rooms and Uber rides, but caused uproar when Ticketmaster first applied “Official Platinum” pricing to a Springsteen tour in 2022. Ticketmaster responded that only one in 10 tickets was allocated to dynamic pricing, but it had failed to warn in advance that they could go as high as $5,000.“Ticket buying has gotten very confusing,” Springsteen complained, “not just for the fans, but for the artists also.” Unlike most businesses, musicians are expected to have a special relationship with their customers, so pricing is a moral and reputational question, not just a financial one. After the Oasis furore, the band turned off dynamic pricing for their US dates. “The execution of the plan failed to meet expectations,” Oasis said in a bland statement.How long can ticket inflation continue?Attendance has dipped slightlysince the post-lockdown boom, even as prices have kept climbing. Last year, many arenas and stadiums were left with empty seats while some tours, including those by Jennifer Lopez and the Black Keys, were cancelled altogether. “It reminds me of 1999 when record labels thought: we’re manufacturing CDs and this is going to go on for ever,” says one industry insider. “It’s the same kind of thing: we’re recession-proof, demand’s off the scale, growth, growth, growth …” We all  know what happened next.The first artists to take a public swing at Ticketmaster’s imperial dominance were the Seattle band Pearl Jam. The hottest group in the US wanted to sell tickets to their summer 1994 tour for just $20: $18 for them, $2 for Ticketmaster. Fred Rosen wasn’t having that. When Ticketmaster pushed back and threatened promoters who broke ranks, the band pulled the whole tour. “Ticketmaster said: ‘If you don’t like us, go someplace else,’” the band’s manager, Kelly Curtis,told the New York Times. “But we found out that there wasn’t anyplace else.” The DOJ invited Pearl Jam to file an antitrust complaint, alleging uncompetitive practices, and testify to Congress.In 2023, the Cure’s Robert Smith made their US tour tickets available for as little as $20. He soon discovered Ticketmaster’s fees cost more than the tickets themselvesThe battle was lost the following summer. The antitrust investigation was abruptly dropped, while Pearl Jam’s efforts to swerve Ticketmaster by using a grassroots ticketing company and independent venues such as fairgrounds and state parks proved a disaster. Even as they succeeded in drawing attention to Ticketmaster’s outsized power and hidden surcharges, Pearl Jam’s defeat discouraged their peers from taking a similar stand. “If Pearl Jam couldn’t do it,” asked Rolling Stone, “who can?”Right now, Ticketmaster’s most dogged celebrity antagonist is Robert Smith of the Cure. For the Cure’s 2023 US tour, their first in seven years, the frontman decided on a radically fan-friendly approach. He rejected dynamic pricing, prohibited resale and made tickets available for as little as $20 – adjusted for inflation, that’s half what Pearl Jam considered low in 1994. But he soon discovered that Ticketmaster’s fees cost more than the tickets themselves. Smith cried foul and Ticketmaster offered partial refunds, claiming that Smith’s freakishly low prices had short-circuited the system.View image in fullscreenThe Cure live in Clarkston, Michigan, in 2023.Photograph: Scott Legato/Getty ImagesAlthough artists including Coldplay andNeil Younghave also ditched dynamic pricing, Smith’s heroic stubbornness remains unusual. “People are terrified of upsetting Live Nation and Ticketmaster,”he told the New York Times. “It’s really bizarre, actually, because the power of the artist, it’s the ultimate power.” In fact, he made things awkward for artists by proving that they set the prices and dictate the conditions, in the knowledge that fans would sooner blame a corporation.Live Nation is still in the line of fire. Itsshare price jumpedafter Donald Trump’s election victory in the expectation that his DOJ would drop the antitrust suit, but it remains ongoing, and enjoys rare cross-party support. Unwinding the merger would certainly increase competition, but it’s unclear whether it would actually help fans because rival promoters and ticketers would try to outbid each other for exclusive deals and then have to recoup those advances by raising prices. “The economic environment of the live music industry is odd, as competition often leads to higher prices for consumers,” says Dean Bundick.Meanwhile, bad headlines and social media storms are the most effective spurs to reform. Unlike Fred Rosen, who put criticisms of Ticketmaster down to nothing more than “jealousy and envy”, the smooth-talking Rapino is quicker to make tactical concessions, such as withdrawing from the secondary market, no longer taking a cut of merchandise sales, and pre-empting legislation to include fees in the upfront price.Rapino’s immense wealth and power hardly make him a victim, but nor is he the villain some would like. Even Ticketmaster’s sharpest critics acknowledge that there are no easy fixes to the core problems of affordability and availability unless demand falls dramatically. Fans’ expectations have yet to catch up with the economics of live music.So when Ticketmaster, for all its sins, protests that it is a convenient Aunt Sally, it has a point. Then again, that was Fred Rosen’s promise to his clients 40 years ago. “Ticketmaster’s job has been to take that punch in the head for the industry,” Rapino told Lefsetz. “That’s part of why they hire you.”Explore more on these topicsTicket pricesTicketmasterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They reveal what they lost – and how they’re rebuildingGreg CochraneSun 4 May 2025 05.00 EDTShareWithin the ashes of what used to be Christopher Fudurich’s home inLos Angeles, some objects from his garage music studio were still identifiable. Microphones charred and blackened, a scorched keyboard and melted cables among the toxic debris. Not just objects; a life’s work, passion and creativity burned up. “Things I’d been collecting since I was a teenager,” says the songwriter, producer and sound technician. “Just gone.”This was the reality confronted by Fudurich, and thousands of other Angelenos, following January’s wildfires. Their homes have been damaged or levelled, their possessions destroyed. The fortunate ones fled with what they could; for Fudurich that was some treasured vintage synthesisers, a bag of clothes and his passport.Still, he and his partner escaped with their lives;30 othersdid not. America’s second most populous city was used to wildfires, but not like this. From the coastal oasis of Malibu to the villas of the Pacific Palisades, fierce Santa Ana winds combined with tinderbox dry conditions saw blazes roar through multiple neighbourhoods. They were simply too fast, big and geographically widespread to be contained. At its peak, one fire in the Palisades covered an area roughly 15 times the size of the Glastonbury festival site. Overall, an estimated 180,000 residents were evacuated; 17,000 structures destroyed; thetotal cost of the disaster hitting billions. LA was a city overwhelmed, struggling to rescue itself from an inferno.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christopher FudurichFor its part, the music community responded immediately. There were messages of shock and solidarity. Major artists lined up with donations to the relief efforts: from Beyoncé and the Weeknd to Taylor Swift and Metallica. Gigs were cancelled, albums delayed, Grammy parties postponed. Promoters and streaming platforms paused their rivalries to organiseFireAid, a pair of A-list mega-concerts staged with miraculous speed that raised $100m. Countless grassroots benefit events – from punk bars to club raves – have taken place in LA and beyond. In the home of Hollywood entertainment, music’s response was loud and strong.However, three months on, the city’s own music community is still coming to terms with a fresh, complex lived reality. Not just the notable performing artists whose homes were destroyed – such aship-hop producer Madlibor therock-pop band Dawes– but the thousands of music workers who call LA home.We’ll have to reinvent the resilience to make music. In LA, we don’t know what that looks like yet“Music professionals in general are a vulnerable population,” says Laura Segura, the executive director ofMusiCares, an established charity foundation supporting the music sector. “The pay is not regular. Many are independent contractors who are just trying to make ends meet.” LA is a magnet for those people. Because of its significant music legacy, but also its concentration of networking opportunities: a vibrant, influential concentration of recording studios, record labels and business headquarters.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christopher FudurichThe extent to which music professionals have been affected was first revealed by a spreadsheet that went viral. The first night of the fires, Judy Miller Silverman, a longtime music publicist, watched as a colleague posted online about their rush to get to safety. “My heart just dropped. You have two kids and two pets and you’re evacuating – how scary,” says the LA resident. “The next morning, she said: ‘Our house is gone.’ My jaw hit the floor.”Very quickly, Miller Silverman’s online feeds were full of similar stories – desperate tales of loss – and fundraising links. Her response? “The only thing I could do at the time,” she says, “I opened up a spreadsheet.” On the first day, the document logged the details of eight or nine fire-affected music professionals. Most had lost everything. Within days, as the link spread rapidly between WhatsApp groups, it grew to hundreds (400+ at time of going to press). Collectively, the fundraisers indexed have raised $19m.The sheet reads like an inventory of music industry jobs: guitar tech; conductor; music lawyer; sound healer; artist photographer; record label executive; lighting tech; venue manager; composer; booking agent; piano teacher; band manager; backing singer; DJ; promoter; mastering engineer; video director; songwriter. The list goes on. These workers often live project-to-project on irregular salaries, with careers that had already been reshaped by the Covid-19 pandemic. When this sector is struggling, there are potentially significant ramifications for the music industry as a whole.Based in Santa Monica, Alejandro Cohen is the music director at KCRW, a public radio station that champions the city’s sounds. His team got involved to help organise the response efforts: sharing word of everything from hotels to food, offers of free studio time and replacement gear. “We knew that the situation was unique for musicians,” says Cohen. “We wanted to do what we could to connect those donating resources to those that needed them.”He is, at the same time, grieving the impact. “I’m concerned about what we lost that connects us to our past and our history,” he says, pointing towards the numerous reports of archives, master tapes and memorabilia lost in the fires – the storied instruments, vinyl collections and gig posters. LA’s creative ecosystem has, in part, been gutted by the disaster. “They form so much of our identity,” reflects Cohen. “Part of our history was erased with those fires.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christopher FudurichAltadena, the mountainside neighbourhood tucked up on the city’s northern hairline, may not have had a famous record store or a street packed with venues like the Sunset Strip, but it was – quietly – a hotbed for the city’s music community, largely due to its diversity, generational mix and historic affordability. Emeka Chukwurah co-owned Rhythms of the Village, a vibrant music store-cum-community space in the centre of the district, a self-described “ultimate welcoming place”. A family business, the shop was run by Chukwurah – himself a rapper and designer – with his musician father, Onochie, who settled in LA after visiting the city on tour with Fela Kuti in 1969. It was the pulse of the neighbourhood, in spirit and in sound – on weekends the family would play Afro-Cuban and west African drumming out front on the street. Inside were bespoke artworks, instruments and curiosities. Twice a year, they’d throw a community festival in the car park they shared with the local post office. “Young and old, people come together, that’s what I love about what we do,” says Chukwurah.The first night of the fires, he evacuated with his partner and their toddler and travelled to a nearby hotel. The next day, his father was first to the store. “I called him … the cry he cried. I could hear the devastation of 12 years of accomplishments. Everything we built, and were unable to save.” Rhythms of the Village – and all its one-of-a-kind contents – was gone.It left Chukwurah, and performers and music business owners like him, facing an immediate loss of income. But it also severed the connection with their local community they’d worked tirelessly to create. “We’re still trying to heal, still trying to find our voice,” he says, optimistically. “There are high levels of compassion. The music community is coming together and becoming maybe even more tight-knit.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

MusiCares’ initial response was about getting them food and shelter; Segura says the priority is now accessing secure housing and a place they can work. “So many people make their money using specific instruments or music tools. You can’t make music without these,” she explains. “And so many people make their music at home – homes that have now burned down.”Even those with homes or workspaces to rebuild – many were renters – face stark choices. To stay means navigating the administrative toll of recovery: insurance and legal claims; government fund and grant applications; securing architects, materials, labour. A process that could take years, coupled with the strong likelihood that the cost of home insurance will increase.“It’s turned into a full-time job trying to figure out this entire process,” says Fudurich who, as well as navigating the aftermath of the fires, is undergoing treatment for throat cancer. It’s no surprise that some – by choice or not – will leave LA, driven by prohibitive rebuilding costs, the security of work elsewhere, or the recognition that the climate crisis is multiplying the likelihood such fires will happen again.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christopher FudurichSo, does LA face the very real possibility of a creative “brain drain”? Or, at least, a pause in creativity? “There’s no doubt it’s affecting the creative output of our industry. Even if people aren’t talking about it yet. All of those people are now focused on that [recovery] versus making music,” says Segura.“My fear is that people will give up on music completely because they don’t have the resources to put their lives back together. I like to stay positive. We’ll have to reinvent the resilience to make music. In Los Angeles, we don’t know what that looks like yet.”For the moment, Fudurich, like Chukwurah, is resolved to stay, even if the reality of that is unclear. “Our neighbourhood, Altadena, will definitely be different,” he nods. “Everything’s still a big question mark.”He brightens, explaining he’s just finished his first music project since the fires, a song with his synthpop group Moderns. “I was not going to let this knock me down. I was not going to let this kick me out.”For more information about the organisations supporting fire-affected residents in Los Angeles, visitfireaidla.orgExplore more on these topicsMusicCalifornia wildfiresMusic industryLos AngelesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

McCartney has made a big splash, online and on stage, charting the millennial woman’s journey from mindless nights on Mad Dog 2020 to motherhood and beyond. There may be something ruthless about her zeroing in on the generic at the expense of anything remotely particular. But there’s a skill even to this brand of crowd-tickling observational comedy, and the Liverpudlian has it in spades.We’re firmly in the familiar standup territory of (in McCartney’s words) “too old to be young, too young to be old”. It’s all nostalgia for her generation’s wild youth, and alarm at the inadequacy of their successors. (“We wouldn’t have gone out in trainers in the noughties, would we?!”) McCartney presents herself as a superficial twentysomething trapped in a mum’s body, dispensing reckless sex education to her 12-year-old son, and embarrassing herself on a middle-aged “girls’ trip” to Magaluf.Little in that latter anecdote is convincing; rare is the ring of specific truth. I’m inclined to agree when at one point McCartney says, “I feel like I should have something profound to say” about her stage in life. But if profundity is in short supply, at least, in this celebration of received thinking about randy husbands and women regretting their wrinkles, she makes the familiar shine. One routine about squirting during orgasms (“like a highly pressurised Calpol syringe” – nice) devolves into a gossip with audience members deftly orchestrated by our host for maximum mirth. Another witheringly dismantles the idea that a kick in the testicles is as painful as childbirth.

The two started an affair and in 1957 MacColl wrote the song The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face for Seeger, performing it for her over a long distance phone call (it was later a No 1 hit in the US for Roberta Flack). Seeger often performed with MacColl by her side until his death in 1989. She then married singer Irene Pyper-Scott, after forming an intense connection – she later described herself as “uncontrollably in love”.Seeger is also widely recognised as a feminist icon and an activist on issues from the environment to war and workers’ rights. Her song I’m Gonna Be an Engineer became a feminist anthem thanks to scathing lyrics such as: “She’s smart – for a woman, I wonder how she got that way / You get no choice, you get no voice / Just stay mum, pretend you’re dumb.”It’s a remarkable career, and one that’s coming to an end: her latest album Teleology, out now, is being billed as her last, and she is doing a 25-date farewell tour of the UK and Ireland from 14 May. Before she brings the curtain down, what would you like to know about her songwriting, her activism, her loves and losses, and the rest of her richly lived life? Post your questions in the comments before Wednesday 7 May, and her answers will be published on Friday 16 May.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicThe reader interviewcalloutShareReuse this content"

The turnout toppedMadonna’s free mega-showlast year, which drew 1.6 million to the Brazilian city’s shores.It was a moment of unadulterated joy for Brazil’s particularly dedicated fans, many of whom are too young to have seen Gaga during her last performance in the country 13 years ago. Anticipation was even higher as Gaga had cancelled a planned appearance in 2017 for medical reasons.View image in fullscreenThe atmosphere among the crowd was part-frenzy, part-reverence.Photograph: Bruna Prado/AP“She came,” the ecstatic crowd chanted as Gaga appeared on stage shortly after 10pm local time. The staunchestmonstrinhosarrived before dawn and spent the day under the blazing sunshine to secure a spot near the stage.“I’ve been waiting for this for 15 years,” said Ana Clara Salomão, a 26-year-old designer from São Paulo and self-professed Little Monster since the age of 11.“There are no words to describe my levels of excitement, the joy that this is. It’s surreal,” she added, hiding behind a black veil and bugeye sunglasses.People poured into Rio from all over Brazil and South America for the show, part of a series of promotional concerts the pop star is putting on before her next tour, The Mayhem Ball.View image in fullscreenThe show was the biggest yet of Lady Gaga’s career.Photograph: Pilar Olivares/Reuters“I’ve been preparing the trip for months,” said Betina Faundes, a 40-year-old shopkeeper from Chile whose 18-year-old daughter Barbara Marin is a lifelong fan. “Gaga is life,” said Marin, who has tattoos referencing the artist’s songs inked on her forearms. “It’s like a religious thing.”The atmosphere was part-frenzy, part-reverence during Gaga’s five-act “gothic opera”, which saw her cycle through herCoachellaset list, interspersing tracks from her latest album, Mayhem, with hits from her early electro-dance pop years such as Paparazzi and Poker Face.Nods to her Brazilian audience included a chorus of dancers wearing the country’s canary-yellow football shirt during How Bad Do U Want Me and an interpreter translating her emotional speech into Portuguese.View image in fullscreenThe turnout topped Madonna’s free show last year, which drew 1.6 million people to the beach.Photograph: Andre Coelho/EPA“Thank you for making history with me,” the 39-year-old told the adoring crowd. “The people of Brazil are the reason why I can shine.”On Sunday, Rio’s civil police said they had thwarted a bomb attack planned for the concert, which would have targeted children, teenagers and LGBTQ+ members of the audience. ‘Operation Fake Monster’ identified suspects who promoted hate speech and the violent radicalisation of teenagers online and were recruiting participants, including minors, to carry out coordinated attacks using improvised explosives, the police said ina statement. Two people have been detained.Little Monsters wearing extravagant outfits in homage to Gaga had overrun Rio in the days leading up to Saturday, infusing the city with an out-of-season carnival atmosphere. Hundreds of fans held vigil outside the Copacabana Palace Hotel, where the singer had been staying since Tuesday, singing her latest songs at the top of their lungs and revelling in a shared sense of community.“Gaga helped me climb out of a deep hole, so she’s very, very, very important in my life,” said Bella Donna, a 20-year-old drag queen from southern Brazil. “She’s fought hard and continues to fight today for the [LGBTQ+] cause, embracing people and making them understand that there’s no problem in being gay, lesbian, transgender or whatever, the world has to welcome us and respect us.”When Lady Gaga started singing the LGBTQ+ anthem Born This Way, thousands of spectators held up rainbow-coloured fans, slicing them through the air in time to the music with a sharp snapping sound.View image in fullscreenFans waved rainbow-coloured fans during the song Born This Way.Photograph: Bruna Prado/APFor Karolayne Araújo, Gaga’s universal appeal is what makes her so popular. “She manages to connect with everybody, she sings for everybody and embraces everybody,” said the 21-year-old student, who spent more than two hours on public transport to reach Copacabana from Rio’s working-class West Zone.Although more affluent spectators watching the show from brightly lit beachside apartments served as a reminder of Brazil’s deep inequality, the free nature of the concert made it accessible to many who would otherwise never have the opportunity of seeing the superstar live.“The fact that she’s playing for free is a dream come true,” said 19-year-old student Hugo Monteiro, who was sporting a pink cowboy hat. “To have an affordable show, for everyone to be able to feel the emotion of seeing Gaga live, makes it all the more beautiful.”View image in fullscreenMany ‘Little Monsters’ arrived before dawn to get a good spot near the stage.Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty ImagesThe concert, which city authorities expect will have injected 600m reais (£80m) into the local economy, is part of a project through which Rio plans to host a free music show of epic proportions every May for the next four years.Madonna and Lady Gaga – whose climactic Bad Romance finale ended with heart-shaped fireworks exploding overhead – will be tough acts to follow. But for Monteiro, “there is no better place in the world to host free concerts”, because “we put on a show with the artist”.Explore more on these topicsLady GagaBrazilLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the late 80s he was experimenting with synthesisers and released an album called Tana Mana, an anomaly in his discography. I remember my imagination would light up with the title song – I would picture a village dance, and I’d be acting it out in my living room for my mum.The first single I boughtWhatta Man by Salt-N-Pepa. I was living in California in the 1990s and there was a lot of R&B around. I bought a lot of Salt-N-Pepa and TLC as a teenager.The song that changed my lifeI was at Luz Records in California and they put Teardrop by Massive Attack on. I had a visceral response from the first beat.The song that gets me up in the morningBedia by Rajeryis uplifting and happy. There’s a strand of my heart that belongs to music from Africa; these incredible melodies are unabashedly joyful.The song I sing at karaokeI fucking hate karaoke. I despise it with a fiery passion. I don’t understand what’s fun about it. I remember being at a party in my early 30s where everyone started belting out a Coldplay song and I was probably the only person in the room who didn’t know the words.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toI Swear by All-4-One. I was about 13 and had my first crush. I’d slow danced with him to this the night we met. Unfortunately, he lived in India. We would write letters – it was very romantic. I ended up completely obsessed with this song, I would listen on repeat. If it comes on, I act out the whole thing. It happened a couple of months ago; my kids were mortified.The song I can no longer listen toAnything from my first three albums. The first one came out when I was 17, but I recorded it when I was 16. I was given an incredible opportunity, but there is not the inner passion that makes it unique. I took a break and released Rise, my fourth album, when I was 24. From then on, I love what I was doing.The best song to have sex toCome Away With Me by Norah Jones. The funny thing is how many people over the decades have felt the need to tell me that my sister’s first record is great to make love to. Clearly I’m not having sex to that record, but apparently it’s a good one.The best song to play at a partyJimmy Jimmy Jimmy Aaja by Parvati Khan. There was a magic moment where Bollywood tied with early disco in such a perfect way in the 70s and 80s. If I put this on, without fail, everyone’s up and dancing.The song that makes me cryStill Feel It All by Maro. This is sparse, there is a quality to her voice that is spacious, minimal, you hear the emotion, but it leaves space. It is a beautiful song.The song I want played at my funeralShanti-Mantra by Ravi Shankar, which has always been a favourite of my dad’s. It means prayer for peace. It feels hallowed and uplifting.Anoushka Shankar’s Chapter III: We Returnto Lightis out now.

This brilliant show looks at the impossible decisions one doctor has to make … that ends in tragedyLucy ManganSun 4 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareTwo years ago, former NHS doctor Grace Ofori-Attah created the relentlessly tense first series ofMalpractice, a tale of an A&E doctor whose errors under impossible pressure, combined with the inexperience and equal stresses of others, resulted in the death of a patient. Then things escalated. It took in topical medical subjects – primarily the creeping problem of opioid addiction – alongside social issues, including the manifold effects of the pandemic, the prevalence of burnout, the bureaucratic inefficiencies that hinder staff and patients, the institutional buck-passing and arse-covering that greet any type of mistake, and the potential for corruption that exists in any large organisation. It asked how much we should expect of people trapped in a system starved of resources, how much human fallibility we should tolerate in healthcare. It was fast and in every sense furious, written as leanly and cleanly by Ofori-Attah as only someone with direct experience of a particular environment can.Only one episode of the new series is available for review but it looks to be shaping up just as well as the first. Psychiatric doctor James Ford (Tom Hughes) needs to be in two places at once: doing an assessment on shaky new mother Rosie (Hannah McLean), whose GP Dr Sophia Hernandez (Am I Being Unreasonable’s Selin Hizli), contacts him about as the on-call psychiatrist during Rosie’s postnatal checkup, and attending the sectioning of a troubled, crack-addicted pregnant woman at her home where the police are already waiting and threatening to leave if they have to do so much longer.Ford does the assessment first. He asks all the necessary questions. Can we accurately judge if he is rushing things? If he is paying enough attention to the answers? To Rosie’s body language? Can anyone? Hernandez is certainly annoyed he leaves it to her to go through the medications he prescribes Rosie, but surely this is a legitimate division of responsibility when he has another vital job to get to? Hernandez seems demanding and dislikable. How much does that colour how we evaluate their point of view?These seeds of doubt already sowed, we move on to the sectioning visit and the necessary savagery involved in removing someone from her home against her will. The patient, Toni (Seraphina Beh) is placed in psychiatric care, where Hernandez and Ford – both with Toni and her baby’s best interests at heart – clash again over how to manage the pregnancy and delivery. The frequent lack of clear clinical pathways is where dramas like this – Cardiac Arrest, Bodies, This Is Going to Hurt – are most confronting and terrifying. We want to think doctors know everything. No one wants to admit that this is impossible or that what we are really doing is trusting them to be the best at weighing options and risks, but never able to banish the latter.But the meat of the thing is in the fate of Rosie. The lack of clarity around her medications leads to her being insufficiently sedated during an episode of postpartum psychosis and to – in a courageously quiet, underplayed scene – tragedy. Possibly one that could have been avoided if Ford hadn’t massaged the truth about how long it would take him to get back her ward (he is supposed to live within half an hour of the hospital – he is staying with his sister 45 minutes away), but equally possibly not.And so we meet again doctors Norma Callahan and George Adjei (Helen Behan and Jordan Kouamé) from the Medical Investigations Unit as they launch a “fitness to practice” inquiry against Ford and we come again to the questions of culpability and moral responsibility that suffused the first series.The closing scenes suggest that we will not be done out of the many twists and turns the original Malpractice so brilliantly delivered, complete with revelations about the characters that complicate their moral standing in our eyes, their motives, their decision-making processes, the capacity they have to be at their best at any given moment in jobs that demand constant perfection. The new series promises to be as addictive and unsettling as the last, with another good cast and Ofori-Attah still with plenty of material. Malpractice can surely run and run – which is great news for viewers, if less so for doctors and their patients out in the real world.Malpractice season two aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMedical dramaHospitalsNHSDramaHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

Director Sean Holmes’s high concept production might have been preposterous and, initially, the idea speaks louder than the play, but by turns it woos, bewitches and becomes irresistible.Romeo (Rawaed Asde) and his brawling compatriots wear holsters while Tybalt (Calum Callaghan) is referred to as something of a lone ranger. There is a blood-smear – as visual foreshadowing – at the back of Paul Wills’s incredibly handsome clapboard set, which has a Shaker-like simplicity: three swinging saloon-bar doors and an upstairs window which opens to a band of musicians that includes a harmonica and banjo player.More outlandishly, there are clear comic elements, with a light, funny lilt to many of the lines. Juliet’s nurse (Jamie-Rose Monk) is like a rambunctious Wife of Bath; Paris (Joe Reynolds) is like a musical hall clown and Benvolio (Roman Asde) wears a Chaplinesque hat.View image in fullscreenLola Shalam (Juliet) and Rawaed Asde (Romeo) in Romeo and Juliet.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianJuliet (Lola Shalam) looks like Calamity Jane and speaks like a bored teenager, in an emphatically stolid, London twang. Yet her broadness works, alongside the inner steel she shows to have later on.The comic bonhomie feels ungrounding at first but its heartiness does not grate against the central tragedy. Juliet turns giggly with Romeo and their relationship is sweet, callow, bearing the single-minded ardour of young love.It seems flagrantly to be a crowd-pleasing production with aims to reach a young audience but that mission does not undermine the text or patronise its older audience. And the frontier backdrop fits surprisingly well into Shakespeare’s fractious Verona. The masked ball features period line-dancing, there is tension to the brawls and shootouts, as daggers are drawn from the hip, as well as pistols.It is not without its flaws: some actors declaim lines, flattening away the nuance. Rawaed Asde as Romeo certainly brings intensity but every line is spoken in the same determined tone, so that he seems perpetually incensed. Mercutio is over-animated too, albeit entertainingly playing to the audience.It is also long – far closer to three hours than the two stated in the text. And yet you can’t begrudge it. The last hour is immaculate in its execution. The dead rise, eerily, and sometimes speak. The ghost of Mercutio delivers news of Juliet’s death to Romeo here. The final act is stark for all the earlier laughter. For a while it stands in the balance but, ultimately, here is a rare production where high concept meets high-class execution.At Shakespeare’s Globe, London, until 2 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreRomeo and JulietShakespeare's GlobereviewsShareReuse this content"

Couples stroll on the sand, kids play on the carousel, pastel-coloured buildings reflect in the still waters of the old harbour. In the main square, lined by plane trees, a group of elderly men concentrate on a game of petanque. It’s a charming slice of Provençal life, a world away from the Cote D’Azur’s more glitzy hotspots. In summer, tourists flock to the narrow streets and pretty coast, but off season the buzz is gentler, with weekenders feasting onbouillabaissealong the water’s edge.View image in fullscreenI grab a seat at a bar overlooking the Med and check out my walking route for the next day. Cassis is in the heart of theCalanques national park– an extraordinary place of steep fjord-like limestone inlets, deep green pines and turquoise sea – perfect for exploring on foot. It’s a fitting finale to a solo self-guided hiking trip with Macs Adventure, which has taken me from theSainte-Baumemountains down to the Riviera over six days. While my hiking legs have been put to the test with up to six hours of walking each day, I’ve not had to worry about logistics. The routes are plotted on the app and my luggage is transferred ahead, leaving me to simply enjoy the scenery.Solo travel is on the rise, according to the Association of British Travel Agents and tour operators (17% of Macs Adventure trips were booked by single travellers last year – most of them women). Offering the freedom to go at my own pace without having to interact with a group, but with help on hand if needed, this trip promised a winning mix of adventure and comfort; an ideal way to explore less-trodden Provence alone.View image in fullscreenThe seafront at Cassis with Cap Canaille looming behind.Photograph: Davide Guidolin/AlamyMy adventure begins with a night in the village of Pont-de-l’Étoile, 30 minutes east of Marseille by taxi, before I set out on my first hike: 10 miles (16km) to Plan-d’Aups-Sainte-Baume. Tarmac soon gives way to stony paths as I leave urban streets behind and climb towards the ridge above Vallon St-Clair through a landscape of craggy limestone valleys, softened by shrubs such as cistus and broom and pockets of pine and oak woodland. Close to the ancient chapel of St-Clair, a mountain biker whizzes past but then silence descends again and there’s just me and sweeping views all the way back to Marseille.My smugness morphs into contained panic when my phone battery dies and I realise I’ve left my paper map and power bank behindIn summer, there is an acute risk of wildfires in this part of France, and water cisterns dot the route (it’s advisable to do this hike in spring or autumn). I climb what looks like a giant wooden chair (a lookout tower perhaps?) to picnic under the bluest skies, then continue upwards along narrow tracks towards Col de Bertagne. There’s no one around. I’m nailing it as a solo hiker, I think.But my smugness morphs into contained panic when my phone battery dies and I realise I’ve left my paper map and power bank behind. There is no one around. I take a punt and scramble down the hillside, battling through dense forest until I find a path which eventually leads to a road. More through luck than judgement, I find myself in Plan-d’Aups and the welcome sight of theHôtel Lou Pèbre d’Aï– my home for the next two nights – just two hours later than planned. I’m delighted to find my room has a bath and sleep deeply that night.“Walkers love it here,” the receptionist tells me as I prepare to head off the next day, “the mountains are sacred – you’ll see.” Indeed, the Massif Sainte-Baume draws pilgrims to its hidden chapels and holy sites. Today’s circular walk is nine miles; I climb steep paths through woods to a ridge which I follow for a couple of hours, with 360-degree views across countryside and coast.

It feels wild and remote, with paths zigzagging next to deep gorges. I pass the ruins of a Cistercian abbey and follow a river into pretty parkland. From here it’s two short bus rides down to Cassis, and flashes of ocean appear between the trees. Three nights at theHotel Royal Cottageand a new landscape await.On a stretch of coast known more for the glamour of Saint-Tropez, Cannes and Nice, it’s refreshing to discover La Ciotat – an unpretentious former shipbuilding town a 15-minute taxi ride east of Cassis. I wander suburban streets then climb to the top of the Soubeyran cliffs – the highest sea cliffs in France at Cap Canaille. Lingering morning mist clears to reveal the spectacular indented coastline as I follow the windingRoute des Crêtesback.View image in fullscreenThe path above Port-Pin.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyMy last day is saved for the Calanques to the west of Cassis. The wind is up and rain is threatened but I head out past the sprawling villas on the outskirts of town and soon reach the Calanque de Port-Miou, boats bobbing on agitated water. In high summer, visitor numbers to the park are restricted to protect the delicate environment. Today I’m almost alone as I scramble up and down, descending to the white beach ofPort-Pin, climbing aboveCalanque d’en-Vau, then descending again through a rocky ravine to the water. Its beauty feels even more raw under the darkening sky and distant roll of thunder.The heavens open as I begin the return journey and I arrive back in Cassis completely drenched. Heavy rain turns roads into rivers, flowing down towards the sea. I take refuge at Le Bonaparte, a family-run bistro in one of the backstreets. Dressed head-to-toe in black, complete with beret, owner Jean Marie tells me he’s run the place for 37 years – “and people still come back for more!” I’m not surprised, I tell him, when I taste themoulesgratinéesand deliciously fresh sea bass – accompanied by a glass of the local white wine de Cassis.

Those notes, in this case, are a green salad, a thick, umami-spiked dressing and savoury croutons, all tossed in a pitch-perfect combination of flavours (milky lettuce, salty fish, rich fat) and textures (crisp leaves, creamy dressing, crunchy toasted bread). So, while the recipe below isn’t pretending to be an authenticclassic caesar, consider it a very decent and, I hope, similarly pleasing cover version.The dressingView image in fullscreenBecky Hughes’ vegan caesar employs a sprinkling of roasted nori for an added iodine hit. All thumbnail photographs by Felicity Cloake.The caesar is a simple salad, however much people like to complicate it with toppings and other nonsense (of which more later), which means it stands and falls on its dressing. Yes, we can and will argue about whether it’s acceptable to deviate from the usual cos lettuce, but, really, the leaves are a mere vehicle to convey this rich, fiercely savoury substance from bowl to mouth; a fig leaf of fibre floating on a lake of “good” fats. The problem here is that, in its original form, the dressing, which gets its substance from egg yolk and much of its flavour from salty little anchovies, is very much not vegan-friendly.My first task was to replace the egg yolk. I tried several bases: cashews, as recommended byBecky Hughesin the New York Times; almonds and silken tofu, as used byIsa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romeroin their book Veganomicon;Ashley Madden’s tahini, from her Plant-Based Cookbook; andIxta Belfrage’s coconut yoghurtandTom Hunt’s aquafaba, both from the Guardian recipe archive. All work, but my testers and I aren’t overly keen on the flavour of coconut here, and find the cashews a little sweet and grainy – soaking, we surmise, might have helped with the texture, or perhaps I might just need to invest in a more powerful blender (there seems to be a lot of blending involved in vegan cookery, I’m discovering).Silken tofu and tahini both work well, the former giving a lighter, creamier result that’s more reminiscent of that other great American favourite, ranch dressing, and the latter blending in better than I anticipate, but the overall favourite is Hunt’s aquafaba. This, for anyone new to Guardian food content, isthe cooking water from tinned chickpeas(the cooking liquor of home-cooked ones is apparently less reliable, because the liquid can be less concentrated). Though some people find it has a slightly leguminous flavour, if you can taste it here you simply haven’t added enough garlic. Once whizzed up with the same olive oil used in the classic caesar dressing, it has a surprisingly voluptuous richness that works a treat, especially with a few chickpeas thrown in to stabilise the emulsion, as suggested byJ Kenji López-Alton Serious Eats.View image in fullscreenCaper brine and coconut sugar do the business in Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero’s take on the vegan caesar.The flavourings I find easier to pin down. In keeping with tradition, there will be garlic (I infuse the olive oil with it) and lemon juice, but instead of salty anchovies, I like the idea of Hughes and Veganomicon’s caper brine. You could stick in some whole capers, too, as Hunt and Madden do, but I prefer the deeper, richer savouriness of Belfrage and Hughes’ white miso paste (the lightest, sweetest variety, ideally). I prefer the miso to Hunt’s vegan Worcestershire sauce, which, like Madden’s cider vinegar and maple syrup combo, brings sweet-and-sour notes that I don’t remember in the original. The same goes for the coconut sugar in Veganomicon’s version and, much as I enjoy mustard (Madden uses dijon, Chandra Moskowitz and Hope Romero mustard powder), I don’t think it has a place in a caesar dressing.To try to mimic a little of the maritime notes of the fish, I’ve crumbled in some of Hughes’ roasted nori – my testers are divided as to whether the seaweed actually tastes anything like anchovies, or whether the effect is purely psychosomatic, but, because plant-based dietstend to be low in iodine, it feels like a good addition either way. I’ve also added some cheesy nutritional yeast, because, while the cheese goes on top of a traditional caesar salad, in this case it’s useful to include another source of umami in the dressing itself. As usual, however, you may like to adjust to taste, adding more or less of any of the above as you fancy.The saladView image in fullscreenTom Hunt saves time and energy by crisping his croutons in a frying pan rather than in the oven.As Madden writes: “Kale caesar salads are popular for a good reason – they’re incredible!” I first came across the idea in New York more than a decade ago and would echo her enthusiasm – the dressing clings to the frills of both her curly kale and Hughes’ cavolo nero with far more enthusiasm than to even the most meticulously dried cos. But, having removed the eggs, anchovies and parmesan from the equation, I feel I at least ought to stick with the original lettuce.Should you be braver in the privacy of your own home, other suggestions include Belfrage’s cucumber, Veganomicon’s spinach or rocket and Hunt’s wild sea kale, dulse and dandelion leaves (OK, I couldn’t get hold of the sea kale in central London, but, Tom, I did raid the garden weeds for you and can confirm that well-rinsed dandelion leaves are deliciously bitter). Whatever you use, I’d recommend tearing or cutting it into bite-sized pieces, and drying it very well after washing, so the dressing coats it, rather than sliding off into a watery mess. You might also, as Belfrage does, fancy popping in some herbs – she suggests chives and basil, both of which pair beautifully with the other flavours here.The toppingsView image in fullscreenAshley Madden’s effort features a ‘parmesan’ made by blitzing cashew nuts, turmeric and nutritional yeast: ‘Sceptical as I am, I really enjoyed it.’Croutons are a must in a caesar salad – I like to keep them fairly simple and bite-sized. I bake them, but, as Hunt’s recipe proves, they can be made successfully in a frying pan, too, which will use less energy, as would an air fryer. But you might like to get fancy and, like Belfrage, coat them in sesame seeds, maple syrup and chilli, or in Chandra Moskowitz and Hope Romero’s roast garlic and lemon juice. Fried, air-fried or baked, make sure they’re nice and crunchy, so leave the crusts on to help with that.Both Madden and Hughes top their salads with chickpeas – roasted until crisp in Hughes’ case, fried in a smoky spice mix for Madden – while Hunt recommends walnuts. Your choice, but I don’t think the salad needs either. But I do like it topped with a blizzard of parmesan, which is where Madden’s “cashew turmeric parmesan” comes in, made from blitzed nuts, sesame seeds, nutritional yeast and turmeric for colour.View image in fullscreenIxta Belfrage jazzes up her croutons by coating them in sesame seeds for extra crunch.Sceptical as I am, I really enjoy it – it tastes more one-dimensionally, almost artificially “cheesy” than actual parmesan, but with the creamy dressing and blandly crisp leaves as a foil, it works. That said, I’ve left out the sesame seeds in my copy-cat version, because I don’t think they add anything to the experience. Heap it over the top, or replace with your favourite vegan parmesan alternative as you wish. If you want to bulk out the salad, top it with smoked tofu, seitan or similar, but I think it’s pretty damn perfect as it is.Perfect vegan caesar saladPrep15 minCook20 minServes2-4 as a side1 thick slicecrusty bread(about 100g)Salt and black pepper1 large cos lettuce, or 2 little gems, washed and well driedFor the dressing1 plumpgarlic clove100ml olive oil4 tbsp aquafaba(ie, the liquid from a tin of chickpeas)10 cooked chickpeas6cm x 6cm piece dried nori, crumbled (optional)2 tbsp lemon juice1 tbsp caper brine2 tsp white miso paste2 tbsp nutritional yeastFor the cashew “parmesan” (optional)35g unsalted cashews, plus a small handful extra to finish2 tsp nutritional yeast¼ tsp turmericScant ¼ tsp fine saltCrush the garlic into the oil and leave to infuse while you get on with everything else.

Or at least it will if you were “on the scene” back then. These days, the 90s are synonymous with louche, raffish semi-pandemonium, mainly because today feels so saintly in comparison. No 90s restaurateur ever offered reclaimed spud peelings as a starter or a kombucha-led, alcohol-free drinks flight to spare your liver, complete with an earnest lecture on zero-waste hospitality. Puritanism was definitely out there back then, yes, though mainly only inThe Cranks Recipe Book. But mindfulness? Not so much.What One Club Row and similar London establishments such asthe Devonshire in Piccadillyandthe Plimsoll in Finsbury Parkseem to offer, is a thrilling, retro glimpse of mindlessness. Battered stuff, things in buns, strong drinks – and the sense that, at any point, you might cop off with one ofShed SevenorWendy from Transvision Vamp.View image in fullscreen‘Zingy, smoky, delightful’: One Club Row’s tuna crudo with smoked aubergine and Amalfi lemon.In that same spirit, the Knave of Clubs downstairs calls itself “a proper pub” where dogs are welcome and you can “have a pint and a packet of crisps”. There are bags of Tayto’s, scotch eggs and toasties on the bar menu, and Sunday roasts. On a side street behind the pub, One Club Row has its own separate, neon-signed door, a hole in a graffitied wall, that opens to a wooden staircase – think 1990s squat party – that leads up to a long room where, by 8pm, the party will already be in full swing. Elegantly, of course – this is not a bun fight – with rather sexily dim lighting, and a long bar where you can eat a plate of pickled jalapeño gougeres while sipping one of their four house martinis (club, classic, French or olive oil).Obviously, if, like me, you remember the 90s from their original incarnation, by 8pm you may well be thinking: “Gosh, it’s a bit late”, and “Why is the font on this menu so faint?” and “Hang on, is this actuallyLes Trois Garçons?! IthoughtI’d been here before!” If that all sounds rather expertly staged, then thank owners James Dye and Benjy Leibowitz and chefPatrick Powellfor that. It’s all very well creating a buzzy, laid-back, convivial vibe, but with Leibowitz on the floor, alongside general manager Niall Harte, things stay the right side of fancy.View image in fullscreenOne Club Row’s cheeseburger au poivre: ‘Not quite the best fancy burger in London, but it’s certainly nothing to complain about.’Powell, meanwhile, has been one of my favourite chefs for quite some time, particularly at his former Michelin-starredAllegra in Stratford. Here, however, his menu is much more hearty than fussy or finickety. There are croquettes filled with lobster and ham, roast scallops in confit garlic butter and thick French onion soup topped with comté and gruyere.We began with a round of those gougeres laced with cheese and sweet, spicy chilli, plus one of the chunky, crisp lobster croquettes, which dance a dainty line between anAntonin Carêmeclassic and a Findus crispy pancake. A classic steak tartare with beef-dripping bread, dressed with crisp baby gem leaves, was really very delicious, as was a remarkably pretty tuna crudo, arranged artistically with teeny slices of pickled celery and draped over a rather funky blend of smoked aubergine, creme fraiche and lemon. Zingy, smoky, delightful.View image in fullscreen‘Now that’s what I call a yorkshire pudding’: One Club Row’s Dutch baby with blueberries, chantilly cream and maple syrup (and also available with bacon).Photograph: Phoebe Pearson/The GuardianMains are marginally even less cheffy, and major on the likes of fishcakes, pasta, moules frites, meatballs, a ribeye with chipotle mayo to share, and so on. Hell, there’s even a burger, and they won’t even resent you for ordering it. This 250g grass-fed specimen, served almost rare, may not quite be the best fancy burger in London, but it’s certainly nothing to complain about, either. The accompanying sauce au poivre, however, was a little weak and drab in comparison. The fries – just fries, mercifully, rather than truffled or faffed with in any way – come separately, with a little bowl of aïoli. A whopping pork schnitzel in a saucemoutardewith added gorgonzola was a feisty combination and, considering its size, felt a bit of a challenge.For dessert we shared aDutch babywith chantilly, blueberries and optional smoked bacon. What is a Dutch baby, you may ask – well, it’s what those of us in this parish call a yorkshire pudding.One Club Row isn’t fine dining by any means, and some things still need a little fine-tuning, but that isn’t really the point. They will feed you, water you, give you a good time and make you feel carefree and cosseted. And if that all sounds a bit old-fashioned, then the future suddenly feels a whole lot brighter.One Club Row1 Club Row, London E1, oneclubrow.com (no phone). Open dinner only, Tues-Sat, 5.30-11pm.
