Now robots are coming to the kebab shop, alongside self-service screens and loyalty apps, as takeaways look for ways to tackle rising costs.German Doner Kebab (GDK), a perhaps surprisingly British-owned chain that has been springing up across the country, has turned to technology to keep its fast food business buzzing in the face of rising costs and tough times on the high street.With households cooking at home more often to save money, and restaurants facing increases in energy bills, business rates, national insurance and hourly pay, profits are under pressure despite rising prices at the till.“It is survival of the fittest,” says Simon Wallis, the CEO of the brand, which operates via dozens of franchise partners running 155 outlets in the UK and nearly 40 more overseas including in the US, Dubai, Ireland and Sweden.The Glasgow-based company serves up chicken, beef and vegetarian kebabs, as well as burritos and rice bowls, in snappily branded outlets more akin to McDonald’s or KFC than the traditional kebab shop.The business expects to open at 25 new sites in the UK this year, and there are longer-terms plans for 900 outlets worldwide, as Wallis says his tweaks to operations have “given partners confidence to invest” despite pressure on hospitality businesses.“My number one priority is to make the franchisees profitable,” he says as he enjoys a GDK chicken burrito at its hectic outlet on St Martin’s Lane in central London.“Labour has had the biggest impact on costs, and we have really leaned in to improve productivity,” says Wallis, who previously held senior roles at the rival fast food chains Domino’s, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut and KFC.View image in fullscreenA robotic kebab-slicer at a GDK outlet.Photograph: German Donor KebabA robotic kebab-shaver, a gadget that automatically slices meat grilling on a vertical rotisserie, is just one of the gambits he has drawn on to improve productivity in the stores.Wallis says the technology, which GDK has been trialling at its outlet in Bedford and is looking at installing in new outlets later this year, not only reduces labour hours but is more efficient than its human counterparts, as the machines cut the meat from rotating skewers more precisely and consistently.GDK is also slicing away labour hours with equipment that preheats bread so that it takes less time to toast, and by using a central kitchen to mix the group’s signature sauces.In the last three years, the chain has also introduced at least three self-service screens in each restaurant, with the newest outlets hosting four so that the devices now ring up about two-thirds of transactions.Wallis’s “smart kitchen” innovations also include removing a barrier between the kitchen and the counter so that one person can prepare and serve food at quiet times – in a similar fashion to traditional takeaways.The owners, led by True Capital, a British investment company that owns stakes in a number of consumer groups from the Hush clothing brand, the Cotswold Company and Bedfolk homewares to Warpaint cosmetics, are fully behind the plans.double quotation markIt is wrong to say the high street is dead. In some pockets, high streets are coming back and you have got to be smart about the right locationSimon WallisTrue bought its 60% stake last year from Hero Brands, a company controlled by Athif Sarwar, the brother of the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar. Hero had acquired the brand in 2015 from its founder, Farshad Abbaszadeh,after Athif Sarwar was impressed by GDK when on holiday in Dubai. The United Arab Emirates city was the site of the company’s first outlet in 2013 when Abbaszadeh imported the concept and the ingredients to create the German-style doner kebabs he had enjoyed back home.Now the owners are backing investment in a loyalty app that will entice consumers to spend their money in restaurants rather than ordering deliveries.Despite cost of living concerns, GDK’s delivery sales were up by more than 10% last year, but these sales are less profitable for restaurant operators, especially when ordered via such apps as Deliveroo or JustEat, which come with a number of fees.So, GDK is planning to tempt punters back to restaurants with special dine-in-only menu items and promotions, while geolocation technology is being deployed to help find the best areas where high streets are regenerating.“It is wrong to say the high street is dead. In some pockets, high streets are coming back and you have got to be smart about the right location,” said Wallis.The company is also bringing in healthy and trendy options that will particularly appeal to younger diners.Wallis says 57% of the menu, which is heavily geared towards chicken, is already compliant with the government’s so-called HFSS rules, which limit advertising on food that is high in fat, salt or sugar, and GDK is aiming to increase that to about 66%.The company’s plans come amid nervousness across the industry about the effects of GLP-1 appetite-suppressing drugs, which are expected to hit sales at fast food restaurants. Wallis says: “We like to think our business is a bit immune. We target gen Z. People taking the jabs tend to be older.”In the St Martin’s Lane outlet, GDK is pumping out edgy dance music designed to appeal to youngsters, and Wallis says proposed new kebab flavours follow the success of an extra-spicy dish that gained traction on social media.“We have got to be worth it,” Wallis says “People are being more discerning about spending money.”Explore more on these topicsRobotsFood & drink industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now this pathetic photograph will define the former princeFri 20 Feb 2026 10.58 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 17.29 ESTShareYou will have seen the photograph by now: Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly a prince, slumped in the back of a car outside Aylsham police station in Norfolk. His face is corpse-like – his lips tight, stare fixed, eyes turned red by the camera flash. It’s a far cry from Randy Andy, the handsome prince with the big teeth and the easy grin, whose face was once plastered on china cups and plates and commemorative tins, pressed into the soft metal of national affection.Never the heir, but less of a spare than Harry somehow, Andrew’s face was once memorialised in the way that only royalty, Jesus and the saints were: endlessly reproduced as public property. Andrew’s face was part of his – and the royal family’s – brand; he was the warrior prince, the helicopter pilot, the man who had served. He had sweated for us, so much in fact, that he could never sweat again.That face on those cups and plates was not merely decorative but an assertion of something ancient: that lineage writes itself in bone structure; that the face of a royal is not just a face but a symbol, a cipher, a condensed history of power.In antiquity, the ruler’s face was stamped on coins not merely for identification but as a claim: this profile is authority, this jawline is legitimacy, this gaze is the state. By the time of the Tudors, the royal portrait was an act of sovereign self-presentation – as seen by Holbein’s Henry VIII or later in Van Dyck’s Charles I.Andrew’s face was never intended for coinage. Yet its “physiognomy” was a text that would have been read for centuries as royal lineage: that strong jaw asserting resolution and authority; the broad forehead intelligence; the wide-set eyes openness and clear-sightedness; the full mouth sensuality, which would have worried Johann Kaspar Lavater, the 18th-century founder of the pseudoscience. Why? Because a sensual mouth spoke of negative character traits, including a lack of intellect, sloth and moral degradation.We can’t read faces so easily now. But for centuries, it was used to “prove” how some men, especially rich white men, were morally, intellectually, physically, superior to others. The founder of eugenics, Francis Galton, and the French police officer who developed biometrics, Alphonse Bertillon, measured and photographed the faces of criminals and poor people, sorting humanity into hierarchical categories. The distinction that underpinned their work – compared with the rich tradition of portraiture – mattered enormously: to be portrayed was to have your humanity affirmed; to be catalogued was to have it denied.The widespread democratisation of photography in the late 19th century made it possible for us to take our own portraits. The face became less a symbol of lineage than an index of personhood and individualism. And the royal family got in on the act too. After the death of Queen Victoria’s beloved husband, Prince Albert, the palace released a postmortem image of his face, still in deathly repose, his jaw held closed by a bandage.View image in fullscreenAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor leaves Aylsham police station, 19 February 2026.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersBut something vital has happened to the image of the monarchy that we can see in the face of Andrew in the back of a police car. Until now, the lens through the car window has been in service of proximity to glamour – a glimpse, a wave, as people have craned to see Diana and Charles, William and Kate, Harry and Meghan (who, apparently shockingly, opened her own door) and Andrew and Sarah Ferguson as they stepped in and out of waiting cars: state limousines, Bentleys, Rolls-Royces.Never, before Andrew, had we seen a member of the royal family leaving a police station in an unmarked car after their arrest. And in that photograph, Andrew’s face is not glimpsed but trapped behind glass; no mugshot (yet) but a recumbent image of a man brought low, with a face read anew: he looks “haggard, shamed and haunted”, says the Daily Mail; all dignity lost.Many newspapers reached for Charles I, the last time a member of the royal family was arrested. And there are similarities beyond a public fall from grace. In 1649, Charles I walked to his execution scaffold at Whitehall wearing two shirts – the extra layer so that he did not shiver in the cold; he didn’t want his body shaking, to suggest that he was frightened.Rather less nobly, whenAndrew declared on that now infamous Newsnight interview that he couldn’t sweat, supposedly a medical condition from the Falklands, he presented hisbody as not like other bodies, common bodies, bodies that had not sacrificed themselves for queen and country.Two years later, Virginia Giuffre filed her civil lawsuit against Andrew and that famous photograph of the once prince grinning at the camera, his arm around Giuffre, came to symbolise the case. When the image circulated for the first time in 2011, Andrew wrote to Jeffrey Epstein: “We are in this together and will have to rise above it.”Fifteen years on, what has Andrew’s face become? The ageing man is there before us, hollow and undone, but in that image there remains the remnants of the Falklands hero, the grinning prince on the china cup, the Newsnight face with its sneer of disdain, the face staring into the camera bent over the body of a young woman or girl, as revealed in the Epstein files.How do we reconcile these faces of a man who for 66 years has been a fixture of the royal family, maintained by the public and consumed by the press?It is perhaps ironic that it is Epstein’s endless cataloguing that has brought us here. Epstein built a Victorian-style archive of surveillance of the rich, alongside a gallery of victims, and that was seemingly for leverage, rather than classification. Now that catalogue, the instrument of bureaucratic power, is turning against power itself.And the public have become the classifiers – poring over 3m pages of files, running AI facial analysis on images of men that look like Epstein, sharing debunked images that show him living in Tel Aviv with a beard. We are all physiognomists now, and we are all archivists. Every face simultaneously a portrait and a document.Andrew once controlled which side of that equation he stood on, or at least, he thought he did. He took his seat before the Newsnight cameras by choice, certain that the interview was just another way of putting his face forward – a portrait sitting, perhaps, with Emily Maitlis as Van Dyck, allowing him to compose his face for posterity. Which did happen – just not in the way he intended.Dr Fay Bound-Alberti is a writer and professor of modern history at King’s College London.

Seven surprising signs you’re heading for divorceFrom never arguing to knowing exactly what the other thinks, the signs your relationship is in trouble aren’t always obvious. Experts reveal what to watch for – and how to get the spark backLaura PotterFri 20 Feb 2026 10.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleYou stop arguingYou would think this is a sign of perfect harmony. Not so if you have stopped arguingcompletely. “Stopping disagreeing isn’t a sign of peace, it points to emotional withdrawal,” explains Simone Bose, a relationship therapist at Relate. It happens, says Bose, because couples are “likely protecting themselves from feeling disappointed or from conflict itself, but are becoming emotionally numb”.Clinical psychologist andCouples Therapy star Dr Orna Guralnik agrees, noting that “some people don’t argue because they’ve come to a state of acceptance of who each other are, but some don’t argue because they’ve given up. It’s a cold, detached form of not arguing – a resignation.” For Oona Metz, a social worker, psychotherapist and the author of Unhitched: The Essential Divorce Guide for Women, “Couples who stop arguing even when they have major disagreements are on a collision course towards either an unhappy marriage or a divorce.” This is because “unresolved issues get swept under the rug and eventually come out in some other way”.In terms of a remedy, Bose says “many people experience conflict as dangerous or overwhelming because of early family experiences, so they learn that staying quiet feels safer. The first step is to gently lean into that discomfort and name the emotional distance. Saying something like, ‘I feel us drifting and I miss feeling close to you,’ opens the possibility for re-engagement.”You stop trying to change your partnerThe conventional wisdom is that trying to change a partner is a sign of dissatisfaction, but it’s more nuanced than that. “First, trying to change a spouse is a sign of trouble, that one is unhappy, but once that pattern gets established,stoppingany attempts is a bigger warning light,” says Dr Lee Baucom, a therapist and host of The Save theMarriagePodcast. “It indicates they have started distancing.” He continues: “They haven’t seen any change that sticks, so they pull away from the relationship.”Look out for a “why bother” mindset and address it asap. “Marriage is not about changing a spouse, but it can be about working together to face what’s not working as a couple,” says Baucom.You don’t say ‘thank you’ any moreCan’t remember the last time you thanked your partner for small things, such as making you a cup of tea or cooking the dinner? “That’s not a good sign,” says Guralnik. “You’re losing contact with what’s good. Gratitude is an important experience to have and it’s really good for the relationship to express it.”Eli Weinstein, a therapist and author of From I Do to We Do: Navigating Marriage in the Parenting Years agrees: “Gratitude is the lubricant of partnership; it reduces friction, softens edges and reminds you that you’re seen. When it disappears, partners start to feel invisible, unappreciated and taken for granted.”Specifically in the context of co-parenting, “You start assuming the other personshoulddo things, so appreciation fades. That breeds resentment, which slowly erodes goodwill and teamwork until everything starts feeling transactional.” Weinstein advises that you “reconnect by naming small wins, saying ‘thank you’ out loud, and acknowledging what’s often unseen – the mental load, not just the chores”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: ClassicStock/AlamyYou know exactly what the other person is thinkingYes, you are sharing your life together, but that shouldn’t leave you complacent. A partner who is “no longer curious about the inner world of their spouse” is a danger sign, says Baucom. So how does this play out? “They stop asking probing questions or expressing interest in a spouse’s views. The discussions that do happen are logistical in nature – no more dreaming and planning together. No more concern for a spouse’s fears or hopes.”Guralnik describes this phenomenon as “when people in a split second already reach ‘I know exactly what the other person is thinking.’ They go from nought to 100 with one word because the history is already baked in, but for a relationship to thrive to continue it’s core to be curious about your partner and to want to know what’s going on with them, rather than assuming you know.”Bose says: “When we stop checking in, we freeze our partner in an old version of who they are, rather than allowing space for who they are becoming, and intimacy slowly erodes.”Sound familiar? Guralnik says: “Catch yourself, and actually put your attention on your partner, away from yourself.”One of you goes to bed early every nightObviously there are plenty of caveats; shift work, ill health, the list goes on – but if one of you is so tired and overwhelmed by the rigours of co‑parenting that you go to bed early every single night, in case tomorrow is worse than today, your relationship could be on a collision course – because you need to make daily effort to protect your connection as a couple.“When both partners are running on empty, even small moments of connection feel like one more thing on the to-do list,” says Weinstein. “The couple become co-workers managing chaos instead of teammates nurturing a relationship. Over time, disconnection becomes the norm instead of the exception, and the relationship loses its spark and emotional safety.”When life is getting on top of you, protect your marriage by “rebuilding in small, doable doses: tiny rituals, five-minute check-ins, a shared laugh, a warm touch”, says Weinstein. “When you stop aiming for ‘date night perfection’ and instead focus on small, consistent steps, connection becomes accessible again.”You take up ultramarathonsAgain, there are plenty of caveats, but getting overly absorbed in hobbies leaves little space for couples to connect meaningfully. “Hobbies are great and it’s important that couples have activities they do together as well as time apart, but when one member of a couple takes up an activity that is extremely time-consuming, it can be a sign that the relationship has been demoted in favour of the activity,” warns Metz. Bose agrees, saying: “Getting overly absorbed in hobbies can be a way to distract from connecting directly with one another.”So how do you know whether their devotion to running, cycling or writing a novel is a red flag, not just an innocent desire to get fit or take on a challenge? “If your partner is rigid about how much time is spent on the activity, or the activity begins to infringe upon the couple spending time together or going to important events – ‘I’m sorry I can’t attend our anniversary weekend/our son’s graduation because I need to train for my bike race’. There is a difference between a one-time event (training for one marathon) versus a new all-encompassing hobby that goes on indefinitely,” says Metz. A hobby becomes unfair to a spouse “when it is negatively impacting one partner in an ongoing way; creating inequality or leaving no time for the couple to connect, or when there is no compromise”.To shore up your marriage, Metz advises looking for compromise: “Instead of ultramarathons, can the runner just do marathons? If the hobby takes many hours a week and the bulk of the parenting or home care falls to the other spouse, can the ultramarathon runner pitch in more at other times during the week?”You never ask for helpFor Weinstein, people slip into the habit of never asking for help because they “don’t want to nag, fear disappointment or believe they should handle everything themselves. But when you can’t ask for help, the partnership stops functioning as a team.” Probably there’s animbalance of some sort in all relationships, but let it escalate and you risk the partnership’s longevity. “The mental load grows silently until it becomes resentment, burnout or emotional shutdown,” says Weinstein. This is especially true for those who are co-parenting. “Eventually, one partner feels like the ‘default parent’, while the other feels pushed out.”Bose sees this a lot: “Some people have always been self-sufficient and believe only they can do things and their partner won’t do them well enough. This can turn some partners into a martyr-like character, which in turn creates conflictual dynamics in the relationship. Carrying everything yourself can feel protective in the short term, but it often breeds resentment and emotional distance.”The remedy, according to Weinstein, is to “name what you need without apology, and create shared systems rather than last-minute asks”. He encourages “full communication”, which he describes as “giving your partner the whole message; not the hint, the half-version, but sharing your full thought, need and want from start to finish, so they can meet you where you are.”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsMarriageFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With Alan Cumming set to helm the Baftas on Sunday, here’s what he needs to knowAndrew PulverFri 20 Feb 2026 11.15 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 14.54 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleNo modern film awards show is complete without a wisecracking host, who has the tricky job of compering the evening, bringing people on and off stage in rapid succession, keeping a restless audience entertained, and coming up with a decent comedy routine themselves. Hence the attention that is paid to the annual announcement of the Baftas, Golden Globes and Oscars hosts; they are gigs that can flourish in the cultural memory, such asTina Fey and Amy Poehler’s multiple turns at the Golden Globes, or become infamous,such as Anne Hathaway and James Franco’s double act at the Academy Awards in 2011, which saw themcastigated as “children” and “spectacularly unwatchable”by the media.In December, the Baftas announced that Scottish actor Alan Cumming was to host of the 79th edition of the event, which takes place on Sunday; he takes over from fellow actor and Scot David Tennant, who occupied the berth in 2024 and 2025. Tennant was given amiddling review for his effortslast year by the Guardian’s Gwilym Mumford, who called him “a game host, a willing song and dance man, but he definitely needs more help from whoever’s writing his gags” – but that was glowing compared with the notices that arrived for Absolutely Fabulous star Joanna Lumley after her turn in 2019; in an article headlined “Is Joanna Lumley the worst Baftas host of all time?”the Guardian said: “Watching it on TV was excruciating. Not only were the jokes bad, but the Bafta audience responded with a total, ominous silence.” Following the Lumley debacle, Bafta managed to claw back some credibility by hiring Graham Norton in 2020 (“a safe pair of hands”) and a well-reviewed Rebel Wilson in 2022 (“rescues Baftas”).View image in fullscreen‘A willing song and dance man’ … David Tennant at the helm of the 2025 Baftas.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/Getty Images for BaftaTheactor and film-maker Alice Lowe, who presented three London film critics’ awards with her acting partner Steve Oram, says that awards show presenting is not as intimidating as it may seem. “Personally I don’t think it’s that much of a tough gig if you are used to live performance. The trick is not being so annoying that people hate you. I think they thought we would bring a sort of authenticity to it, which is why I suspect they asked me and Steve.”Lowe adds: “I made sure I did my homework and watched the films nominated, knew who the nominees were and how to pronounce their names – I didn’t want some kind of John Travolta mispronunciation scenario. We also ran any jokes past the organisers.”Travolta’s difficulties in introducing Frozen star Idina Menzel– calling her Adela Dazeem at the 2014 Oscars – have since become regardedone of the all-time great awards show blunders.Anna Smith, presenter of the Girls on Film podcast and chair of the London film critics’ circle from 2014 to 2020, was part of the committee that hired Lowe and Oram. She says that the choice of host is key to a successful night: “It’s good to have someone to set the tone of the event, to give a sense of occasion and to keep things running smoothly and to time. What organisers look for is a familiar face who understands the nature of the awards, and who’s prepared to do their research. They don’t necessarily need to be a comedian, but they do need to have a sense of humour and charisma. Most importantly, they need to be relaxed in front of a large audience of celebrities.”View image in fullscreenThat’s how it’s done … Tina Fey and Amy Poehler at the 2015 Golden Globes.Photograph: Paul Drinkwater/APAs the Hathaway/Franco and Lumley experience demonstrates, the charisma and comedy timing that actors can display on screen doesn’t always translate well to the live presenting environment, where standup comedians and talkshow hosts often seem more comfortable. Lowe says that it’s “the ‘being yourself’ thing which throws actors”, adding: “They often start to malfunction in a fascinating way. Comedians, on the other hand, have an exalted position as jesters who are there to tear things apart anyway, so it’s sort of allowed to be a bit rude and disregarding of the pomp of it.”The joke writers – often anonymous, behind-the-scenes figures – are a key part of the process, Lowe says. “It’s not about you. It’s about putting yourself into the other person’s shoes and preempting how they feel, and putting them at ease.” But even for comedians well versed in the art of the roast, things can go badly: seeJo Koy’s disastrous routine at the Golden Globesin 2024, orSeth MacFarlane’s poorly received We Saw Your Boobs songat the 2013 Oscars.Combat intensifies as One Battle After Another takes 14 Bafta nominations to Sinners’ 13Read moreWhile memory may dwell on the disasters that awards shows can serve up, an inspired host can provide a positive cultural experience on a gigantic scale.The selfie taken by actor-director Bradley Cooperat the 2014 Oscar ceremony, which featured a number of Hollywood stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, and event host Ellen DeGeneres, became the most reposted item on what was then Twitter (now X). Lowe says that Jonathan Ross, who helmed the Bafta film awards five times, from 2007 to 2011, is the most impressive host she has seen. “It was the way he seamlessly segued from chatting to people and putting them at ease in the commercial breaks, into scripted Autocue moments, and then improvised gags in response to unpredicted events. A very smooth operator, and supremely relaxed, which is the key.”This year’s Bafta film awards, hosted byAlan Cumming, take place on Sunday at the Royal Festival Hall in London, and will air on BBC One.Explore more on these topicsFilmBaftasOscarsBaftas 2026Oscars 2026Golden GlobesAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

It has given me the chance to really be present and feel the excitement and anticipation that sport brings, not to mention the importance it has in giving us something else to focus on in difficult times.As a TV pundit, it was hard to keep my emotions in check watching Great Britain’s skeleton success because I knew what it meant to Matt Weston and Tabby Stoeckerto become Olympic champions– Matt twice, of course. Their achievements are not only historic but the day-to-day impact will be so meaningful to both of them. I remember seeing kids’ drawings of me and people dressing up as “Lizzy” and now I’m seeing it from a different perspective. I’m incredibly proud of them.Winter Olympics 2026: ski cross, halfpipe and more on day 14 – liveRead moreWinning gold with your teammate, as Matt and Tabby were able to experience in the new mixed event, is something special. In the individual events, you wait in the changing room and storm out when it is your turn. But this time the athletes lined up like aeroplanes on a runway, supporting their teammates before following them down the ice. I would have liked to have had Matt Weston as my teammate.There is a sense that some athletes have been in the right place at the right time in 2026. Austria’s Janine Flock won skeleton gold for the first time at the age of 36. She led the standings going into the final heat when I defended my title in 2018 but ended fourth. Elana Meyers Taylor of Team USAwon her first goldin the monobob aged 41. Her teammate Kaillie Humphries, 40, took bronze. It’s a joy to see women in their prime in their 40s.Even through all of my physical issuesafter Pyeongchang 2018, I was very pleased to be able to retire on my own terms. Dave Ryding, now 39, was representing Team GB at his second Games at Sochi 2014 and, as a first-time Olympian, I looked up to him as a more mature athlete. Dave was always so smiley and generous. I appreciated that. He has said he would ski until his legs fell off. “I think they pretty much have,” he said this week afterfinishing 17th in the slalomin his final Games.View image in fullscreenTeam GB’s Kirsty Muir endured two fourth-placed finishes, but at 21 her disappointment can fuel future medal tilts.Photograph: Action Press/ShutterstockThe level at which athletes are willing to go out and give their best continues to astound me. Whether it isthe bravery of Lindsey Vonn, who we’ve seenlying in bedwith a contraption on her leg after crashing out in the downhill, or the determinationin the eyes of Kirsty Muirat the top of the freeski ramps as she considered what was needed to reach the podium. Fourth place can be the greatest fire to light ambition for the future.The Olympics always looks glamorous. People will message you: “Are you having the best time? It looks so fun!” But I think there is this very human reality. I was really drawn to the image ofAtle Lie McGrath lying in the woods– the isolation, the reflection – after straddling a gate in his second run of the slalom and missing out on gold, all while mourning the death of his grandfather. People are captivated by the human side of elite athletes: they feel joy in your success but also empathy in those moments of failure.View image in fullscreenIlia Malinin put his falls in the free skate down to the ‘endless insurmountable pressure’ of being at the top of his sport.Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesI reallyfelt for the figure skater Ilia Malinin, who has spoken of the “endless insurmountable pressure” of being at the top, after his falls in the free skate cost him a medal having been the overwhelming favourite for gold. The Games can ask so much of you. There can be this loss of who you might have been had you won or what life might have been like in this moment. It’s like sliding doors, a moment of change.Charlotte Bankes, one of Britain’s great medal hopes, showed the power of human endeavour after the disappointment of her individual snowboard cross campaign, where she exited the competition at the quarter-final stage. In a matter of days, she changed that moment of frustration into the triumph ofwinning gold in the mixed team event with Huw Nightingale.From a British perspective, the three golds going in to the final weekend, including a first on the snow, are brilliant. But the fact of the matter is that UK Sport hadhoped for up to eight GB medalsat these Games. Even as we talk about the ups and downs of the human Olympic experience, there is still a cold reality of the outcome relating to funding.However, the fourth places of Muir, ofJen Dodds and Bruce Mouat in the mixed curlingand of Freya Tarbit and Marcus Wyatt in the mixed team skeleton demonstrate the potential for the next four-year cycle. As for now, I have been captivated by all the highs and lows thus far from Milano Cortina 2026. The full range of human emotions on show at the Olympics is what makes it so wonderful to watch.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicscommentShareReuse this content"

Police are understood to be seeking unredacted documents relating to Andrew from the US Department of Justice.In another significant political development, the government said on Friday it would consider introducing legislation to remove Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession once the police investigations have concluded.Mountbatten-Windsor spent 11 hours in a Norfolk police station on Thursday, during which his mugshot was taken. Thames Valley police searched his former home at Royal Lodge, Windsor, for a second day on Friday.The Metropolitan police, which provides highly trained protection officers to VIPs, said on Friday it was identifying and contacting current and former serving officers who may have worked closely with Mountbatten-Windsor in a personal protection capacity.“They have been asked to consider carefully whether anything they saw or heard during that period of service may be relevant to our ongoing reviews and to share any information that could assist us,” a statement said.The Met also said it would examine claims that airports in the London area were used by flights linked to Epstein to traffic women.Five other British forces are examining whether such claims about airports in their areas merit full criminal investigation. Airports the Met will look at include Heathrow, Biggin Hill, and RAF Northolt, which hosts private flights.The Met said: “Following the further release of millions of court documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein by the United States Department of Justice, we are aware of the suggestion that London airports may have been used to facilitate human trafficking and sexual exploitation.“We are assessing this information and are actively seeking further detail from law enforcement partners, including those in the United States.”As well as the Met, up to seven other forces so far are seeking the unredacted documents from the Epstein files held by US authorities as they intensify their pursuit of the disgraced financier’s links to British figures.The release of millions of documents held by US authorities about Epstein earlier this month led to the former prince and the former Labour cabinet minister Peter Mandelson being placed under criminal investigation for misconduct in public office after allegedly passing sensitive material to Epstein.Mountbatten-Windsor could not be contacted for comment but has in the past denied wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Mandelson has denied any criminal wrongdoing and apologised for his association with Epstein.A national coordinating committee has been set up for the various police investigations, led by a serving Met assistant commissioner, Louisa Rolfe, now on secondment to the NPCC.The Guardian understands a senior detective will be recruited by the committee to help coordinate issues such as getting the original documents from the US.The formal requests will be made by National Crime Agency, with some forces saying they will use artificial intelligence to help plough through the mountain of material held in the Epstein files.A senior source said: “There are millions of documents which we want unredacted. We need to turn that into evidence. It is a massive job. You are never going to get a conviction based on a few redacted emails.”The five forces considering claims about the Epstein flights into airports in their area are Norfolk, Essex, Bedfordshire, West Midlands, and Police Scotland. Surrey and Thames Valley police forces are considering claims of sexual wrongdoing by the former prince.The misconduct in public office allegations stem from his time as a UK trade envoy, a role he gained in 2001 before stepping down a decade later over his friendship with Epstein.It is understood the Cabinet Office is ready to provide any government documents connected to Mountbatten-Windsor’s time as a trade envoy if asked by police, although no request is believed to have been made yet.While his role was administered by UK Trade and Investment, a now defunct body co-run by the Foreign Office and the business department, the Cabinet Office is the lead department for such inquiries. It is sorting through documents due to be released about the appointment of Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the US.Mounbatten-Windsor was released on Thursday evening under investigation, which means there are no restrictions on his freedom.Detectives are yet to take formal early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, a spokesperson for the service said. That suggests any decision about whether the king’s brother will face charges is some time away.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Two security sources told Reuters that senior Hezbollah leader Hussein Yaghi was killed in the attacks.Yaghi is the son of former Hezbollah MP Mohamed Yaghi, and his funeral is set to take place on Saturday, according to Hezbollah media.Local television footage from the scene of one of the strikes showed the targeted site appeared to be an apartment building. Emergency crews were seen firefighting and searching for survivors.Earlier on Friday another Israeli strike hit a Palestinian refugee camp in the port city of Sidon, killing two people.The Israeli military said it struck a “Hamas command centre” in the Ain el-Hilweh camp. Hamas acknowledged that two of its members had been killed in the strike but said the claim it was a command centre was a “flimsy pretext”.It said the targeted building belonged to a joint security force made up of various Palestinian factions tasked with maintaining security in the camp.After 7 October 2023, Hezbollah began firing rockets from Lebanon into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024, before being reined in by a US-brokered ceasefire two months later.Since then, Israel has accused Hezbollah of trying to rebuild and has carried out near-daily strikes in Lebanon that it says target militants and facilities. Hezbollah has claimed one strike against Israel since the ceasefire.The death toll from Friday’s strikes was unusually high and comes at a moment of heightened tensions in the region with the US threatening to strike Iran – a backer of both Hezbollah and Hamas – if negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme fail to produce a deal.During last year’s Israel-Iran war, Hezbollah remained on the sidelines but many in Lebanon fear that the country will be pulled in should another war break out.Explore more on these topicsLebanonMiddle East and north AfricaHezbollahIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Goodwin, 44, volunteered an apology after the complaint had been raised.The woman is understood to have complained to the network’s HR department in 2025. She later left the network for unrelated reasons.Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, is understood to have been told by a senior member of staff at GB News about the complaint prior to Goodwin’s selection as the party’s candidate for next week’s byelection.A number of sources have told the Guardian that they were aware of the woman’s complaint against Goodwin and thatGB Newshad undertaken an inquiry into the complaint.One source at the broadcaster said: “She was very upset at the time, and her colleagues were upset on her behalf that she was so distressed by the situation.”Goodwin has denied acting inappropriately. A lawyer acting for him confirmed to the Guardian that a grievance had been raised.

The investigator had found the young woman’s and Goodwin’s accounts of the situation were both credible, they said, giving Goodwin credit for offering an apology once the complaint had been raised.Farage is understood to have decided the complaint was not serious enough to warrant a rethink about Goodwin’s selection. A source at GB News told the Guardian that Farage had characterised the complaint as “that is just Matt being Matt”.Weeks after the complaint was raised, Goodwin was announced as the candidate for the byelection, which was triggered by the resignation of Andrew Gwynne for health reasons.Goodwin has faced criticism during the campaign for comments he has made previously, including a 2024 suggestion that “young girls and women” should be given a “biological reality” check, described by the Labour MP Natalie Fleet as positing a“Handmaid’s Tale” future.He has also been criticised for comments made last year on a podcast with the rightwing academic Jordan Peterson in which he said there had been a “feminisation of higher education”, after Peterson outlined this as a potential reason for “politically correct authoritarianism”.Goodwin was described by some as a controversial choice for the byelection, after he claimed recently that UK-born people from minority ethnic backgrounds were not necessarily British. After announcing his candidacy, he wasswiftly endorsedby the far-right agitator and convicted criminal Tommy Robinson.In a blog entry written in 2023, Goodwin suggested the government should “remove personal income tax for women who have two or more children”.Goodwin spent most of his career as an academic before turning his eye to politics. He has spoken at various Reform UK events over the last year, and he has a Substack blog with 90,000 followers where he posts essays detailing his views.He left academia in 2024 when he took voluntary severance as a professor at the University of Kent.Reform UK did not respond to repeated requests for comment prior to publication. Goodwin and GB News also declined to provide an on-the-record comment.Following publication, a spokesperson for Reform described the claims as “a desperate, last-minute smear by The Guardian, timed to damage Matt Goodwin days before polling day.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageByelectionsGB NewsGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

The district attorney’s office would ultimately be the determining authority for any criminal charges to be filed.”The avalanche, the deadliest in California’s modern history, killed at least eight people and a ninth skier is still missing but is presumed dead.Blackbird Mountain Guides, which employed the ski guides that led the trek, said in a statement released on Wednesday that three of their workers died after the avalanche, and one of them survived.“This was an enormous tragedy, and the saddest event our team has ever experienced,” said Zeb Blais, founder of Blackbird Mountain Guides, in the statement. “We are doing what we can to support the families who lost so much, and the members of our team who lost treasured friends and colleagues.“There is still a lot that we’re learning about what happened. It’s too soon to draw conclusions, but investigations are underway,” Blais added in Wednesday’s statement.As the 15 skiers were coming back from their trip, which started on Sunday, avalanche warnings were already in place. Blackbird Mountain Guides seemed to be aware of the hazardous weather conditions, according toa social media videoposted on Sunday.During a press conference on Wednesday, Shannan Moon, Nevada county’s sheriff, said that the investigation includes learning why the ski trip was not cancelled.“Those are the decisions that the guide company clearly had made,” Moon said. “We’re still in conversation with them on the decision factors that they made.”Six of the 15 skiers survived and were rescued, including the fourth guide. Amid hazardous weather conditions, the avalanche victims have not yet been extracted from the mountain.“Adverse weather, coupled with ongoing avalanche danger, has hindered the recovery process,” astatementreleased on Friday by the Nevada county sheriff’s office said. A statement released on Thursday said “until the recovery mission is completed, the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office is unable to confirm the identifications, ages, affiliations, or cities of origin for the victims.”Family members have confirmed the identities ofsix of the eight peoplewho died in Tuesday’s avalanche. The identified victims – Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt – were part of a group which frequently went on ski trips together.Explore more on these topicsUS newsCaliforniaAvalanchesUS weatherWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

NHS England subsequently announced children with gender dysphoria would no longer receive puberty blockers as routine practice, with their use confined to research settings.Sir Jonathan Montgomery, professor of health care law at University College London, said: “The letter to the investigators is clear that the discussions are intended to strengthen the protocol, not to stop the trial.“The letter also states that these are scientific issues and not a result of legal action.“The focus here is on safety, as it should be. This pause shows the regulatory process working properly and in the interests of participants.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchTransgenderHealthYoung peopleChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

We want parents to get the help they need without being forced into a legal fight with their council.“The school system has not kept up with the pace of change that children are experiencing in their lives. We utterly rejectthis narrative of ‘overdiagnosis’. That needs to be banished from the debate.”There are lingering concerns among Labour MPs on several issues, including whether parents will still have the right to make a legal appeal if they feel their child is not being properly supported.One said: “There is understandable anxiety amongst parents, but if the reforms as a whole look to promise a better system with enough time for a smooth transition, then I think MPs will recognise that.“Where I think the challenges may come is on the legal redress issue – if parents have enough confidence that they can hold schools and local authorities to account on the support they are supposed to be giving.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsLabourDavid BlunkettRuth KellyAlan JohnsonSchoolsEducation policynewsShareReuse this content"

Our son Ethan tragically and unexpectedly passed away at just 17 years old, alongside his beautiful girlfriend.“No parent should ever have to write these words. No family should ever have to face this pain.“Ethan had his whole life ahead of him. He’ll never get to pass his driving test. He’ll never celebrate his 18th birthday. He’ll never reach the milestones we all assumed were waiting for him.“He was just beginning his journey into adulthood, full of plans, laughter, and a future that was taken far too soon.”Ethan was described as kind-hearted, warm, funny and protective.“He carried himself with a quiet strength and loyalty that made us so proud to call him our son. He was loved beyond measure.”Officers received call of concern for safety at the park on Wednesday. Some holidaymakers are understood to have been asked to leave the park, where families had gathered for the half-term school break.A cordon remains in place at the park and police said they were continuing to work in coordination with the health and safety executive alongside Humberside Fire & Rescue and East Riding of Yorkshire council.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the Wolf volcano tortoises had domed shells like those living on Isabela’s other volcanoes to the south, but some had a saddleback-shaped carapace more typical of the tortoises that evolved on Floreana.Acaptive “back breeding” programmebegan in 2017, for which 23 hybrid tortoises most closely related to the Floreana subspecies were chosen to recreate it as genetically close to the original as possible.More than 600 hatchlings had been born by 2025, and several hundred grew large enough to be returned to their ancestral island. Males can reach nearly 1.5 metres (5ft) in length.mapAlthough whalers wiped out the Floreana tortoise, it ironically endured on Wolf volcano because they also deposited live tortoises on other islands for safekeeping and sometimes tossed tortoise cargo overboard if they needed to lighten their load during their whaling missions.Floreana, the sixth largest island in the archipelago, was once home to a wealth of endemic wildlife, including spectacular species such as theFloreana mockingbird, theFloreana racer snake. But the arrival of sailors, whalers and then settlers brought invasive mammals including rats and feral cats that wiped out native fauna and flora,a pattern repeated on small islands across the world. When Charles Darwin reached Floreana in 1835, its giant tortoise population was in its death throes.Its reintroduction has been brought about by theFloreana Ecological Restoration Project, a partnership between theGalápagos national park directorateand a number ofcharitiesworking closely with the island’s 160 residents.An invasive species eradication programme, which began in 2023 and has removed most of the rats and feral cats on the island, paved the way for the tortoises’ return.TheGalapagos railhas since been rediscovered on Floreana after not being recorded since Darwin’s first visit, and there has been a resurgence in populations of ground finches and native geckos, lizards and snails.Verónica Mora, a Floreana community representative, said of the tortoises’ return: “This moment marks an important step toward a future where conservation and community wellbeing go hand in hand, because our livelihoods, from tourism to agriculture and fishing, depend on the health of this island.”View image in fullscreenThe Floreana giant tortoise.Photograph: PRThe island’s farmers have also reported much-improved harvests since rat numbers were drastically reduced.Giant tortoises are “keystone species”. Their grazing maintains open habitats, promoting the growth of native plants and creating conditions that benefit reptiles, invertebrates and birds. They also distribute native seeds across the island as they roam.“Habitats are the foundation for biodiversity, the home that allows species to move, live and evolve naturally over time,” said Rakan Zahawi, the executive director of theCharles Darwin Foundation. “Giant tortoises are a critical part of this system. By dispersing seeds, shaping vegetation, creating micro-habitats such as their well known wallows, and influencing how landscapes regenerate, they help rebuild ecological processes that many other species depend on.”Hugo Mogollón, the chief executive ofGalápagos Conservancy, said: “By identifying tortoises on Wolf Volcano with Floreana ancestry and breeding their descendants, we are returning this species to its island in a form that closely reflects the original lineage – laying a critical scientific foundation for the restoration of Floreana’s ecosystems and the future reintroduction of additional native species.”The next phase of restoration will seek to return species including the Floreana mockingbird, the Floreana racer snake, the vegetarian finch and thelittle vermilion flycatcher.Dr Jen Jones, the chief executive of theGalapagos Conservation Trust, said: “It’s a validation of the incredible efforts we’ve seen over the last 20 years from a whole ecosystem of conservation NGOs, local authorities, determined individual researchers and community champions.”Explore more on these topicsGalápagos IslandsReptilesWildlifeConservationBiodiversityEcuadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

As the fourth anniversary of the invasion approaches and the world enters a new period of geopolitical uncertainty, Europe’s politicians and spy services continue to draw lessons from the failures of 2022Written byShaun WalkerFri 20 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 12.26 ESTShareYour browser does not support the video tag.The phone call1-The-BeginningWilliam Burns had travelled halfway around the world to speak withVladimir Putin, but in the end he had to make do with a phone call. It was November 2021, and US intelligence agencies had been picking up signals in the preceding weeks that Putin could be planning to invade Ukraine. President Joe Biden dispatched Burns, his CIA director, to warn Putin that the economic and political consequences if he did so would be disastrous.Fifteen years earlier, when Burns was US ambassador in Moscow, Putin had been relatively accessible. The intervening years had concentrated the Russian leader’s power and deepened his paranoia. Since Covid had emerged, few had been granted face time. Putin was squirrelled away at his lavish residence on the Black Sea coast, Burns and his delegation learned, and only phone contact would be possible.A secure line was ready in an office at the presidential administration building on Moscow’s Old Square, and Putin’s familiar voice came through the receiver. Burns laid out the US belief that Russia was readying an invasion ofUkraine, but Putin ignored him and ploughed on with his own talking points. His intelligence agencies had informed him, he said, that there was an American warship lurking over the Black Sea horizon, equipped with missiles that could reach his location in just a few minutes. It was evidence, he suggested, of Russia’s strategic vulnerability in a unipolar world dominated by the US.The conversation, as well as three combative face-to-face discussions with Putin’s top security officials, seemed extremely ominous to Burns. He left Moscow far more concerned about the prospect of war than he had been before the trip, and he relayed his gut feeling to the president.“Biden often asked yes/no questions, and when I got back, he asked if I thought Putin was going to do it,” Burns recalled. “I said: ‘Yes’.”Three and a half months later, Putin ordered his army into Ukraine, in the most dramatic breach of the European security order since the second world war. The story of the intelligence backdrop to those months – how Washington and London garnered such detailed and accurate insight into the Kremlin’s war plans, and why the intelligence services of other countries did not believe them – has never before been told in full.View image in fullscreenUkrainian national guard personnel taking positions in central Kyiv in the early days of the war.Photograph: Gleb Garanich/ReutersThis account is based on interviews conducted over the past year with more than 100 intelligence, military, diplomatic and political insiders in Ukraine, Russia, the US and Europe. Many spoke without attribution to discuss events that are still sensitive or classified; those quoted by name are referred to by their job titles at that time.It is the story of a spectacular intelligence success, but also one of several intelligence failures. First, for the CIA andMI6, who got the invasion scenario right but failed to accurately predict the outcome, assuming a swift Russian takeover was a foregone conclusion. More profoundly, for European services, who refused to believe a full-scale war in Europe was possible in the 21st century. They remembered the dubious intelligence case presented to justify the invasion of Iraq two decades previously, and were wary of trusting the Americans on what seemed like a fantastical prediction.View image in fullscreenBodies are exhumed from a mass grave in Izium, in Kharkiv region, in September 2022. UK and US intelligence services had assumed Russian forces would quickly overrun Ukraine.Photograph: Gleb Garanich/ReutersMost crucially, the Ukrainian government was thoroughly unprepared for the oncoming assault, with PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyspending months dismissing increasingly urgent American warnings as scaremongering, and quashing last-minute concerns among his own military and intelligence elite, who eventually made limited attempts to prepare behind his back.“In the final weeks, the intelligence leaders were starting to get it, the mood was different. But the political leadership just refused to accept it until right at the end,” said one US intelligence official.Four years on, there are many lessons to be drawn from these events about how intelligence is collected and analysed. Perhaps the most pertinent, as the world appears more unpredictable than at any time in recent history, is that it is dangerous to dismiss a scenario because it seems to fit outside the realm of what is rational or possible.“I felt the evidence we presented to them was overwhelming. It’s not like we held back something that, if only they had seen it, would have made all the difference,” said Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, on why European allies did not believe the Americans. “They were just seized with the conviction that this simply made no sense.”Putin starts planningThe KremlinTheCIAdiscovered an awful lot about Putin’s plans to invade Ukraine, but one thing they never worked out for sure is when he first made up his mind to go all-in. Sifting through the evidence later, like detectives at a crime scene, some of the agency’s analysts pinpointed the first half of 2020 as the most likely moment.During those months, Putin passed constitutional amendments to ensure he could stay in power beyond 2024. Then, locked away in isolation for months during Covid, he devoured books on Russian history and pondered his own place in it. Over the summer, the violent crushing ofa protest movement in neighbouring Belarusleft President Alexander Lukashenko weaker and more reliant on the Kremlin than ever. It opened up the possibility of forcing Lukashenko to allow the use of Belarusian territory as an invasion launchpad.View image in fullscreenPolice detain a demonstrator in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, in August 2020.Photograph: Yauhen Yerchak/EPAAround the same time, a team of FSB poisonersslipped novichok nerve agent into the underpants of Alexei Navalny, the one opposition politician with the potential to command mass public support, sending him into a coma. Back then, these all seemed like discrete events. Later, they started to look like Putin getting his ducks in a row before implementing the big Ukraine gambit he felt would cement his role in history as a great Russian leader.Hints of that plan first came into focus in the spring of 2021, when Russian troops began building up along Ukraine’s borders and in occupied Crimea, supposedly for training exercises. The US received intelligence suggesting Putin could use an annual set-piece speech, due on 21 April, to lay out the case for military action in Ukraine. When Biden was briefed on the intelligence, a week before the speech, he was so alarmed he called Putin directly. “He raised concerns about the buildup and called for a de-escalation, as well as proposing a summit in the coming months, which we knew would be of interest to Putin,” said Avril Haines, Biden’s director of national intelligence.View image in fullscreenThe Kremlin at night in November 2021.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWhen Putin gave the speech, it was much less bellicose than expected, and a day later the Russian army announced its military exercises at the border were over. It seemed the summit offer had successfully defused the threat, and when the two leaders met in Geneva in June, Putin hardly mentioned Ukraine.It was only in hindsight that it became clear why: he had already decided on a non-diplomatic solution.Raising the alarmRussian convoy in Donbas region, 23rd Feb 2022Four weeks after the Geneva summit, Putin published alengthy, rambling essayabout the history of Ukraine, in which he went back as far as the ninth century to make the argument that “true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia”.The screed raised eyebrows, but attention in London and Washington was soon diverted by the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. In September, Russian troops began another buildup along Ukraine’s borders; within a month it had reached a mass that was hard to ignore. Washington collected new intelligence about Russian plans, more detailed and much more shocking than in spring. Back then, the assumption had been that Russia could attempt a formal annexation of the Donbas region, or in a maximalist scenario, might try to hack a land corridor through southern Ukraine, linking Donbas to occupied Crimea. Now, it looked as if Putin could be planning something bigger. He wanted Kyiv.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and Russian defence chiefs inspecting military drills in September 2021.Photograph: Alexey Druzhinin/Sputnik/AFP/Getty ImagesMany in the US political elite were highly sceptical, but the intelligence analysts were worked up over what they were seeing. “There was enough information coming in that made it clear this was no longer a remote possibility,” said Haines. When Burns came back from Moscow, the alarm bells rang even louder. Whether or not the intelligence was right, Biden said, it was time to start planning.In mid-November, he dispatched Haines to Brussels. There, at the annual meeting of Nato-member intelligence heads, she presented the US belief that there was now a real chance of a massive Russian invasion of Ukraine. Richard Moore, the head of Britain’s MI6, backed her up. As part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance, Britain had seen most of what the US had collected, and also had its own intelligence channels that pointed towards the possibility of an invasion. The primary response in the room, however, was scepticism. Some dismissed the idea of an invasion out of hand. Others expressed a fear that if Nato adopted a strong posture in response, it could prove counterproductive, provoking exactly the scenario the US claimed to be concerned about.Managing that perception would be in the back of US and British minds over the next months. “We had to make sure we weren’t going to do anything that gave them an excuse to invade,” said Chris Ordway, a senior official working on the region at Britain’s Ministry of Defence. At the same time, London and Washington believed Russia needed only two more months to be ready for an invasion, and they wanted to raise the alarm.Biden ordered his team to share as much intelligence with allies as possible, to help them understand why Washington was so worried. He also suggested a declassification push to get some of the information into the public domain. This had to be done carefully, to avoid exposing how Washington had obtained the evidence. “These are sources and methods that we put our blood and sweat and tears into obtaining, and they can put people’s lives at risk if lost,” said Haines.A system was implemented whereby officials from different intelligence agencies would have “an opportunity to weigh in on anything before it went out the door”, she said, to make sure nothing slipped through that could give away a source. Over the next weeks, the US downgraded more sensitive intelligence than at any time in recent memory for allies and often for the general public, too. “We were getting classified briefings from the Americans, and then a few hours later you’d read the exact same information in the New York Times,” said one European official.The view from KyivVolodymyr Zelenskyy on 20th October 2020At the end of October, the CIA and MI6 sent memos to Kyiv outlining their alarming new intelligence assessments. The next week, after Burns visited Moscow, two US officials on the trip peeled away from the delegation and flew to Kyiv where they briefed two senior Ukrainian officials on the US fears and the CIA director’s conversations in Moscow. “We basically said: ‘We will follow up. You’ll see the intel. This is not a normal warning, this is really serious. Trust us,’” said Eric Green, one of the US officials. The Ukrainians looked sceptical.In mid-November, the British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, visited Kyiv and told Zelenskyy London believed a Russian invasion was now a matter of “when”, not “if”. He urged Zelenskyy to start preparing the country for war. “You can’t fatten up a pig on market day,” Wallace told the Ukrainian president, according to a source briefed on the meeting. Zelenskyy appeared to be in passive listening mode.Zelenskyy had been elected in 2019 on a platform of pursuing peace negotiations to endthe conflict Russia had launched in eastern Ukraine in 2014. He no longer believed he could do a deal with Putin, but he feared that public talk of an even bigger war would prompt panic in Ukraine. This could lead to an economic and political crisis, collapsing the country without Russia needing to send a single soldier across the border. This, he suspected, was Putin’s plan all along. He grew increasingly irritated at the Americans and British, who alongside the private warnings were starting to talk about the invasion threat in public. In November, he dispatched one of his most senior security officials on a top-secret mission to a European capital to deliver a message to political leaders via intelligence channels: the war scare is fake, and is all about the US trying to leverage pressure on Russia.View image in fullscreenA woman passes by shelled shops near the train station in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, in August 2014.Photograph: Mstyslav Chernov/APFew in Ukraine believed a full-scale invasion was likely, but the country’s intelligence agencies had been picking up worrying signs of increasing Russian activity. Ivan Bakanov, the head of the SBU domestic agency, recalled that while Russian spy services had traditionally focused on trying to recruit high-level Ukrainian sources, in the year prior to the invasion “they were going after everyone”, including chauffeurs and low-level functionaries. Often, these pitches were “false flag”: the Russian recruiters would pretend to be from one of Ukraine’s own intelligence agencies.The SBU also tracked clandestine meetings between officers from Russia’s FSB and Ukrainian civil servants or politicians. These meetings often took place in luxury hotels in Turkey or Egypt, where the Ukrainians travelled under the guise of tourism. Russia hoped these people, motivated variously by ideology, ego or money, would act as a fifth column inside Ukraine when the time came.“Before I came to the SBU, I also thought we could do a deal with the Russians,” said Bakanov, who was an old business partner of Zelenskyy’s and had no intelligence background when appointed in 2019. “But when you see every day how they are trying to kill and recruit people, you understand that they have a different plan, that they are saying one thing and doing another.”Still, the prevailing mood in Kyiv was that the US warnings were overegged. Ukraine had been fighting Russian proxy forces in the Donbas for eight years, but the idea of a full-fledged war – with missile attacks, tank columns and a march on Kyiv – seemed unimaginable.A European intelligence official said this line of thought remained fairly constant in briefings from Ukrainian counterparts in the months leading up to the invasion. “The message was: ‘Nothing is going to happen, it’s all sabre-rattling,’” said the official. “They thought the absolute maximum possible was a skirmish in the Donbas.”The intelligence5-Intel-PictureLater, when it turned out that the US and Britain had it right all along, many wondered what it was that had allowed them to be so sure. Was there a mole in Putin’s inner circle, passing on the war plans to their CIA or MI6 handlers?“Often, it’s presented as ‘we found the plans’ but it definitely was not that simple,” said Haines. The most obvious indicator was partly visible on commercial satellite imagery: tens of thousands of Russian troops moving into positions close to the border with Ukraine.View image in fullscreenA satellite image shows Russian troops deployed to Yelnya, in the western oblast of  Smolensk, in November 2021.Photograph: AP“These troop movements were unexpected and you had to work really quite hard to come up with explanations for why you’d do this, other than that you want to use them,” said a senior official at DI, the British military intelligence service.There were also intercepted military communications: none of them mentioned an invasion, but they sometimes involved actions that would make little sense if no invasion were in the works. There was other information from various sources that pointed in the same direction: pro-Russian groups doing groundwork in Ukraine that might support military action, and the establishment of a programme to boost the ranks of reservists inside Russia. “For the first time, we saw information indicating the potential for action west of the Dnipro,” Haines said, referencing the river that splits Ukraine in two.Most of those interviewed declined to expand on what exact intelligence was collected, citing the importance of safeguarding sources and methods. But interviews with dozens of people who saw some or all of the evidence provided plenty of clues.Two sources pointed to intercepts from the Russian army’s Main Operations Directorate as a likely source of information about the invasion. The department is run by Colonel General Sergei Rudskoi, a well-respected military planner who has long been “the best-informed person inside the general staff,” according to a former Russian military insider who knew him personally. All strategic planning goes through his close-knit unit, based inside the general staff headquarters in central Moscow, and it was the place where war plans were drafted and refined, even as other top army commanders were left in the dark.Preparations could be discerned in other parts of the military and intelligence services too, even if the people carrying them out did not know the end goal. “Most people in Russia did not know about the plan,” said one US official. “But to make it possible, enough things had to happen that it was very difficult to hide.”The veteran journalist Bob Woodward, in his book War, referenced a “human source in the Kremlin”, without giving further detail. This is certainly possible – back in 2017, the CIA had exfiltrated a long-standing source who worked for Putin’s foreign policy chief and had been passing the agency secrets for years. There may be others still in place.But Putin went to great lengths to hide his intentions even from most of his inner circle, and only a handful of people in the Russian system knew of the invasion plans until a couple of weeks before it began. It could be that the CIA or MI6 had recruited a super-mole right by the president’s side, but it seems more likely that human sources in Russia provided tangential or corroborating evidence, rather than the core details. Much of the key intelligence could be sourced to satellite imagery, or to intercepts collected by the NSA and GCHQ - the US and British signals intelligence agencies - said people who saw it. “No human source detected,” said one.Ten weeks before the invasion6-Ten-weeks-before-invasionBy December 2021, the US and Britain had obtained reasonable clarity on what Putin’s war plan might look like. In Washington, a cross-agency “tiger team” began meeting three times weekly, to discuss how the US would prepare for and respond to the worst-case scenario: an attack on the whole country with the goal of regime change. But there was no solid evidence that Putin had taken a political decision to put his plan into action. And this was where everyone else had a problem.In Paris and Berlin, just as in Kyiv, intelligence agencies interpreted the military buildup not as a war plan, but as a bluff to put pressure on Ukraine. The British defence intelligence official said “huge amounts of effort” were invested to bring the French and Germans around, including several briefing trips by various delegations. But the conversations were largely met with resistance. “I think they took as a starting point: ‘Why would he?’ And we took as a starting point: ‘Why wouldn’t he?’ And that simple semantic difference can lead you to wildly different conclusions,” said the official.View image in fullscreenA soldier participates in a joint Russia-Belarus military exercise in September 2021.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesFor some Europeans, memories of the twisted intelligence backdrop to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 fuelled scepticism of this new war scare. One European foreign minister, who asked not to specify their country, recalled a discussion with Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, that became heated: “I’m old enough to remember 2003, and back then I was one of those who believed you,” the minister told Blinken. While the British and Americans were sharing more than usual, the really sensitive intelligence often came with its origin obscured, to protect sources. “They warned us, they really did,” said the minister. “But they said: ‘You have to take our word for it.’”Even when 2003 was not mentioned explicitly, officials often sensed its shadow. “The reluctance to trust us was definitely a legacy of Iraq,” said John Foreman, Britain’s defence attache in Russia, who convened fortnightly meetings of Moscow-based military attaches from Nato countries during the pre-invasion months. He and a US colleague made largely unsuccessful attempts to convince European colleagues the threat was real: “If you’re showing people things and they still don’t believe you, you’ve got a problem,” he said.A big psychological block for some European intelligence services was that they believed Putin to be a largely rational actor, and were deeply sceptical that he would embark on a plan they felt was likely to fail. According to Russian estimates obtained and collated by a western service, Moscow thought only 10% of Ukrainians would fight an invasion, while the rest would either actively support or grudgingly accept a Russian takeover. This was a hopelessly optimistic assessment, but even 10% of Ukraine’s population was 4 million people. The force Russia had amassed was not nearly enough to fight against such resistance, the Europeans believed.View image in fullscreenA training exercise for Ukraine’s 24th Mechanised Brigade in an undisclosed location in the east of the country in March 2025.

The Polish service had good insight into neighbouring Belarus, where the forces who could descend on Kyiv from the north were stationed, and these seemed to be the weakest troops of all. “They were mostly newly drafted recruits … they lacked ammunition, fuel, leadership and training,” said Krawczyk. It looked like a distraction mechanism to draw Ukrainian attention and firepower away from a limited incursion in the Donbas, not a serious fighting force that could hold an occupation of most of the country.The Americans, however, could see detailed Russian planning for a new political order in Ukraine, and were increasingly convinced that Putin was preparing for a full-scale invasion, with regime change as the goal. “He was not looking at a menu and saying: ‘I could do small, medium or large,’” said Sullivan. “He was very focused on taking over Kyiv.”View image in fullscreenA poster of Putin being used as target practice in Ukraine’s Luhansk region in early 2022.Photograph: Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty ImagesIn Washington, the working assumption was that, at least in the initial phase of the war, Putin would be successful. Ukraine’s defence minister,Oleksiy Reznikov, recalled a visit to the Pentagon, shortly after he took office in November 2021. He was sceptical about the invasion scare, but he could see the Americans were convinced, so he asked if they would consider sending more and better weapons to help defend his country from the horrors they were predicting. He received a firm rebuff.“Imagine you have a neighbour who comes home with a cancer diagnosis that they’re dying in three days,” Reznikov said. “You’ll offer them pity, but you won’t give them expensive medicines.”Six weeks before the invasionMacron meets with Putin in Moscow on February 7, 2022. Below, Olaf Scholz and MacronIn the first part of January, the Americans got hold of more detailed information about the plans: Russian troops would invade Ukraine from several directions, including from Belarus, airborne forces would land at Hostomel airport outside Kyiv to set up the capture of the capital, and there was a plan afoot to assassinate Zelenskyy. Preparations for the post-invasion ground game were also under way, with lists being compiled of “problematic” pro-Ukrainian figures who would be interned or executed, and pro-Russian figures who would be tapped to run Ukraine.Burns flew to Kyiv to brief the Ukrainian president in person on what the CIA feared was about to happen, but the response was not what he might have hoped for. A week later, Zelenskyy released avideo appealto Ukrainians telling them not to listen to those predicting conflict. Come summer, Ukrainians would be grilling meat on their barbecues as normal, he said, insisting that he “sincerely believed” there would be no major war in 2022. “Breathe deeply, calm down, and don’t go running to stock up on food and matches,” he told the population. It was catastrophic advice, given many thousands of people would soon be trapped in an active conflict zone or under Russian occupation.View image in fullscreenUkrainian civilians attend combat and survival training in early 2022.Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesZelenskyy was still worried, not without cause, that a war panic could crash the economy. The authorities did facilitate military training courses, and thousands of Ukrainians who were spooked by the war scare signed up. But it seems that, deep down, Zelenskyy simply did not believe the Americans. This was partly because the west was not speaking with one voice. The French and German leaders, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz, still believed a war could be averted through negotiating with Putin. “The Brits and Americans were saying it was going to happen,” said one senior Ukrainian official. “But the French and Germans were telling him: ‘Don’t listen to this, it’s all nonsense.’”Three days after Zelenskyy’s video appeal on 22 January, the British Foreign Office released astatementclaiming London had intelligence that Russia wanted to install the former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev, a marginal figure with little public profile, as a post-invasion prime minister. To many, it sounded absurd beyond belief.“When Britain announced that, I became even more sceptical,” said a European intelligence official. “It didn’t make any sense. Surely the Russians weren’t that stupid?”Two weeks before the invasionRamzan Kadyrov and the US embassy in KievBy mid-February, the British, US and some other embassies had evacuated Kyiv, destroying sensitive equipment before they left. The CIA station withdrew to a secret base in western Ukraine, dropping off a few shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles at SBU headquarters as a farewell gift on the way out of town. In London, key staff at the Ministry of Defence moved into hotels near to the ministry building, so they could be at work in minutes when the moment came.Even many European countries had lowered their presence in Kyiv to a skeleton staff and drawn up evacuation plans, just in case. But Macron and Scholz still believed Putin could be talked out of an attack and both travelled to Moscow in February to make the case for diplomacy. After six hours of talks in the Kremlin, Macron proudly announced that he had “secured an assurance” from Putin that Russia would not escalate tensions.View image in fullscreenDaily life continuing around St Sophia’s Cathedral in Kyiv in early February 2022.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Americans continued to interpret Moscow’s signals very differently. In Biden’s last phone conversation with Putin on 12 February, he found the Russian leader steely, determined and utterly uninterested in any offers of negotiations. When he put down the phone, Biden told his aides it was time to prepare for the worst. War was inevitable, and the invasion could happen any day.In calls between Biden and Zelenskyy, the tone sometimes became strained as the US president stated bluntly that the Russians were coming for Kyiv. Frustrated with the failure to get Zelenskyy and his team to listen, Sullivan had decided the focus should be on Ukrainian intelligence agencies and the military, hoping they would raise the alarm from below.“At every meeting, they told me it’s happening for sure,” said a Ukrainian intelligence official stationed in Washington, recounting numerous encounters with CIA counterparts. “When I looked into their eyes I could see there was no doubt. And every time, they asked me: ‘Where are you going to take the president? What’s the plan B?’” He told them there was no plan B.A small group of officers at HUR, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, did begin quiet contingency planning in January, prompted by the US warnings and the agency’s own information, one HUR general recalled. Under the guise of a month-long training exercise, they rented several safe houses around Kyiv and took out large supplies of cash. After a month, in mid-February, the war had not yet started, so the “training” was prolonged for another month.The army commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, was frustrated that Zelenskyy did not want to introduce martial law, which would have allowed him to reposition troops and prepare battle plans. “You’re about to fight Mike Tyson and the only fight you’ve had before is a pillow fight with your little brother. It’s a one-in-a-million chance and you need to be prepared,” he said.View image in fullscreenA convoy of Russian armoured vehicles moving along a motorway in Crimea as the Russian troop buildup intensified in the weeks before the full-scale invasion.Photograph: APWithout official sanction, Zaluzhnyi did what little planning he could. In mid-January, he and his wife moved from their ground-floor apartment into his official quarters inside the general staff compound, for security reasons and so he could work longer hours. In February, another general recalled, table-top exercises were held among the army’s top commanders to plan for various invasion scenarios. These included an attack on Kyiv and even one situation that was worse than what eventually transpired, in which the Russians seized a corridor along Ukraine’s western border to stop supplies coming in from allies. But without sanction from the top, these plans remained on paper only; any big movement of troops would be illegal and hard to disguise.In the second week of February, Ukraine’s border guard agency intercepted a new piece of evidence that should have been decisive: communications from the commander of a Chechen unit stationed in Belarus to Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-installed leader of Chechnya. The commander reported to Kadyrov that his men were in place and would soon be in Kyiv. Zelenskyy was shown the recording but remained unconvinced, according to a well-informed source. At security council meetings, the prevailing narrative was still that a full-scale invasion was unlikely, and that the buildup was about putting economic and political pressure on Ukraine.“Lots of us were uneasy, but I guess everyone decided that the safest thing was to agree with the president,” said one senior official.Several Ukrainian sources said they believed Zelenskyy was adamant that a major invasion was unthinkable because he had been convinced of it by Andriy Yermak, his chief of staff and closest confidant. Russia operated in the grey, deniable zone of hybrid warfare, Yermak believed, and would not go in for a big, dramatic invasion that would sever relations with the west irrevocably.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Bakhmut, the site of heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russia troops, in June 2023. Pre-war, much of Ukraine’s political leadership had believed a major Russian invasion unthinkable.Photograph: Libkos/APYermak, who declined an interview request for this story, was one of the few Ukrainian officials to have regular contact with Russian counterparts. He spoke often to Putin’s deputy chief of staff, Dmitry Kozak, as part of long-deadlocked negotiations over the Donbas region.If Kozak helped to reassure Yermak that the US invasion scare was ludicrous, it was most likely because he believed so himself. The CIA estimated that just a handful of non-military officials knew about the detail of Putin’s plans until very late in the game. Kozak was kept in the dark, along with the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Putin’s longstanding spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said two well-connected Russian sources.Even a week before the invasion, most of the Russian elite still had no idea of what was coming. “I got a call from someone high up in the Kremlin saying: ‘There’s a lot of military guys around Putin, the atmosphere is tense, and something is going on, but we don’t know what,’” said one political insider.Three days before the invasionSergei Naryshkin, Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin in MoscowThings started to become clearer on 21 February when Putingathered his security councilin one of the Kremlin’s grand, marbled halls. He sat alone at a desk with his courtiers assembled on chairs across the room, awkwardly far away from him. Putin ordered them, one by one, to a podium to offer their support. Ostensibly, the council was debating whether to formally recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics”, which Russia had de facto occupied since 2014, as independent states. But the subtext was clear. This was a war committee.View image in fullscreenPutin hosting his security council on 21 February 2022.Photograph: Alexei Nikolsky/Kremlin pool/Sputnik/EPAMany of the elite appeared dumbstruck as Putin called on them to give their consent. Sergei Naryshkin, the foreign intelligence chief, looked terrified and fluffed his lines, stammering through a confused answer that prompted Putin to chuckle disdainfully before eventually securing agreement.One Russian insider said the mood in the meeting was reminiscent of historical accounts of the atmosphere in the Kremlin in spring 1941, when Stalin’s intelligence bosses tried to warn the leader that Nazi Germany was about to invade the Soviet Union, but were afraid to push too hard given the leader’s firm conviction it wouldn’t happen. “Naryshkin had information about Ukraine which did not match what everyone else was saying,” said the source. “But he is weak and indecisive, and Putin wanted to make sure everyone was seen to be part of this decision. So that’s why you saw the behaviour you saw.”Off camera, there was another startling interaction. Kozak, Putin’s Ukraine point man, had a reputation in Washington as a hardliner, but privately he was horrified by the idea of an invasion, which he only fully realised was in the works on the day of the Kremlin meeting, said a source close to him.Kozak, who had known Putin for decades, was the only person in the room brave enough to speak up. Arguing from a strategic rather than a moral point of view, he told the president that invading Ukraine would be a disaster, though like most of the elite he still did not know whether Putin’s plan was for limited military action in Donbas or a full-scale war. After the meeting ended, he continued to debate with Putin one on one in the large hall, said the source.The millions of Russians watching on television did not get to see any of that. Instead, they heard Putin ask: “Are there any other points of view or special opinions on this matter?”The question was met with silence.Two days before the invasionEncryptor deviceOn 22 February, the day after Putin’s theatrical performance, Ukraine’s own security council met in Kyiv. As the bigwigs assembled outside the hall before the meeting, Zaluzhnyi tried to canvass support for the introduction of martial law, which would finally allow him to begin moving troops. In the room, he was supported by Reznikov, the defence minister. But Zelenskyy was still worried about sowing panic, and the council rejected martial law, voting for the lesser measure of introducing a state of emergency.View image in fullscreenPeople strolling through the city centre of Lviv in western Ukraine in the days before the Russian invasion.Photograph: Gaëlle Girbes/Getty ImagesA few hours later, the security council chief, Oleksiy Danilov, handed Zelenskyy a red folder containing a top-secret intelligence report about a “direct physical threat” to the president. In other words, assassination teams were on the way. Zelenskyy seemed to brush it off, but the information apparently made an impression. The next day, in a sombre meeting with the Polish and Lithuanian presidents inside the grand Mariinsky palace in Kyiv, Zelenskyy told them it could be the last time they saw him alive. As soon as the meeting was over, Polish intelligence officers hurried the two visiting presidents into a motorcade that headed west at top speed.Bartosz Cichocki, Poland’s ambassador in Ukraine, remained in Kyiv and a couple of hours later he was summoned to the embassy to receive a classified telegram from Warsaw. It was a curt one-paragraph text, stating that the invasion would start that night. In the final two weeks, the Poles had revised their invasion scepticism, based partly on new intelligence about the Russian troops stationed in Belarus. Now there was final confirmation that the attack was coming. It was one of the last such telegrams the embassy received; later, the walls would shake for several hours as one of the Polish intelligence officers still in Kyiv smashed up the encryption equipment with a heavy mallet to preclude any chance of it getting into Russian hands.After reading the telegram several times, Cichocki went outside to get some fresh air. He saw the people of Kyiv going about their business on a winter’s evening, a jarringly normal scene given what he now knew. People were checking the playbill at a theatre across the street, and part of him wanted to run, shouting, to tell them that war was coming and there would be no more performances. Instead, he walked home quietly, his head filled with thoughts of how the world was about to change.Eight hours before the invasionJoe BidenIf Warsaw was now on board with London and Washington, Paris and Berlin remained doubtful even in the final moments. The intelligence assessments of both countries did now accept that some kind of military action was possible, but they still rejected the idea of a full-scale invasion targeting Kyiv. The French ambassador would learn about it only when he was woken in his high-rise apartment by the sound of Russian missiles.Even more telling is the story of Bruno Kahl, the chief of Germany’s BND foreign intelligence service. By the time his plane landed in Kyiv, late in the evening on 23 February, the US, British and Polish spy agencies had already determined that Russian attack orders had been given. Panicked messages about the imminent invasion were even doing the rounds among foreign journalists in Ukraine, tipped off by their intelligence sources. But Kahl was either oblivious to this information or unperturbed by it.Soon after Kahl arrived at his upmarket Kyiv hotel, the German ambassador to Ukraine received an order from the foreign ministry in Berlin to evacuate all remaining diplomatic staff from Kyiv by road immediately. The threat was too urgent to wait until morning, said the ministry. Even then, the German spy chief declined an invitation to join the midnight diplomatic convoy, citing his important meetings the next day. Unsurprisingly, those meetings never took place. Instead, Kahl had to be extracted from Kyiv on the day of the invasion with the help of Polish intelligence, along roads gridlocked with fleeing Ukrainians.At Ukrainian army headquarters on the final evening before the attack, Zaluzhnyi and his top generals tried to implement some last-minute measures. Mines were laid on the bed of the Black Sea to thwart a potential maritime landing in Odesa, and some units were ordered to be moved into more strategic locations. “All of this was totally forbidden. If the invasion hadn’t happened, there would have been a chance of court cases against us for doing it, but most commanders accepted we had no choice and carried it out,” said one general.Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, HUR, was also continuing quiet preparations. On 18 February, its head, Kyrylo Budanov, had received a three-hour briefing from a western official who laid out in detail the Russian plans for seizing Hostomel airfield. The information helped with setting up some last-minute defensive plans, although the Ukrainian victory at Hostomel in the first days of the war would be a chaotic and close-run thing.View image in fullscreenA woman leaving her home in Hostomel, one of the first places to come under attack when Russia invaded.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOn the eve of the invasion, Budanov met Denys Kireev, a Ukrainian banker with contacts deep in the Russian elite, who had agreed some months earlier to feed HUR information he picked up from his contacts in Russia. Now Kireev told Budanov that the decision to invade had been taken, and gave him information about the timing and vector of the Russian attack. (The SBU believed that Kireev was a triple agent, ultimately working for Moscow, and he was shot dead as the SBU tried to detain him a few days after the invasion.)As for Zelenskyy, his musing to the Polish and Lithuanian presidents that they might not see him alive again suggested that, at the very last moment, he had accepted the gravity of what was coming. Later that day, he tried to call Putin, but was rebuffed. Instead, he recorded a video message to Russian citizens, calling on them to prevent their leadership from starting a war. He also told them: “If you attack, you will see our faces. Not our backs, but our faces.” It was a complete change of tone from his earlier messages.Nevertheless, Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena, went to bed as normal that night, she said. She had not even packed an emergency suitcase, something she would do hurriedly the next day while listening to explosions in the distance as she evacuated to an undisclosed location amid assassination threats with the couple’s two children. The invasion also caught most of the Ukrainian cabinet by surprise, including Reznikov, the defence minister. He went to bed with an alarm set for 6am: he was due to take a military plane to the contact line in the Donbas with Baltic foreign ministers, a show of defiance in the face of the heightened threat. Instead, he was woken at 4am by Zaluzhnyi calling him with news that the war was about to start.One Ukrainian official who knew what was coming was the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. He had travelled to Washington for meetings on 22 February and intelligence officials there showed him the exact locations where Russian tanks were warming their engines and waiting to cross the border. Afterwards, he was ushered into an unscheduled meeting with Biden. The sombre discussion felt like a “doctor-patient conversation”, he recalled, and the diagnosis was apparently terminal.“When I left the Oval Office, I had the feeling that Biden was bidding farewell, both to me and to the people of Ukraine,” said Kuleba.The invasion12 - InvasionPutinannounced the start of a “special military operation”at 4.50am Kyiv time on 24 February. Minutes later, Russia launched a series of missile strikes at targets around the capital. Before dawn broke, Zelenskyy arrived at the presidential compound on Bankova Street, where his first foreign phone call was with Boris Johnson. “I want to ask you Boris, like a friend of my country. Call him [Putin] directly and tell him to stop the war,” Zelenskyy told Johnson, his voice hoarse. Later there were more calls, to Paris and Washington, and a meeting with security officials. Martial law, finally, was implemented, in a hastily assembled parliamentary sitting.Zelenskyy regained his composure as the morning went on, and the disorientation turned to determination and anger. During a meeting with political leaders, his security detail swept into the room and hustled him out: there was information about airstrikes on the presidential office, they said, and possibly assassination squads in close proximity. He re-emerged later, having already begun the transition from a shocked politician in a suit to a wartime leader in military-style fatigues.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises from a military airport near Kharkiv on the first day of the invasion.Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty ImagesAround the same time as Zelenskyy was changing outfits in Kyiv, Putin welcomed the Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, to the Kremlin. The visit had been planned months in advance, and Khan landed in Moscow just as Russian tanks were crossing the border into Ukraine. Surprisingly, Putin kept the appointment. On a momentous day that changed the course of European history, as shocked members of his elite swapped horrified text messages, he spent more than two hours with Khan discussing the minutiae of Moscow and Islamabad’s bilateral relations. Putin came across as “chilled” during the talks, said a source close to Khan. Afterwards, he invited his guest to stay for an unscheduled, lavish Kremlin lunch. At one point, Khan asked about the elephant in the room: the war that Putin had unleashed a few hours earlier.“Don’t worry about that,” Putin told him. “It’ll be over in a few weeks.”AftermathImages of Ukrainian Armed Forces. Top; 2025. Bottom; 2022Four years later, the war continues. An estimated 400,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, for the prize of controlling 13% more of Ukraine’s territory than at the beginning of 2022.For British and US intelligence agencies, Putin’s gruesome and bloody assault on Ukraine was a redemptive moment. For months, they had been deep inside the war plans that Putin had kept secret from most of his own elite, and two decades after the Iraq fiasco, they had been proven right in the face of widespread scepticism. In the aftermath, US officials said, many partner services developed a new respect for the CIA and other US agencies and became interested in closer cooperation. (It is not clear whether those desires have survived into the Trump presidency.)But whatever they got right, London and Washington underestimated Ukrainian resistance and overestimated Russian power, just as Putin had. They had concluded that the task after the invasion would be to help a partisan movement against successful Russian occupiers, with the Ukrainian government operating from exile, or ruling over a rump state in the west of the country. “All the way up to the day of the race, there had been an assumption that this is not going to last very long,” said the official from British defence intelligence. “We thought they’re going to be west of Kyiv really quickly, at which point they’re going to say: ‘Job done, we’ve got this lot, someone else can take care of that lot, thanks for watching.’”The Americans had a similar view. “We thought the Russians would be more effective initially – take Kyiv in a couple of weeks, and then the Ukrainians would regroup,” said Haines.The European services that had been so hopelessly wrong about the possibility of the invasion used this discrepancy as their explanation: “We didn’t believe it would happen, because we thought the idea that they would be able to walk into Kyiv and just install a puppet government was completely insane,” said one European intelligence official. “As it turned out, it was indeed completely insane.”Part of the problem for the British and Americans was that while there was great insight into the planning, there was too much reliance on Russia’s own estimates of its force capabilities. “The system encourages them to make things sound better than they are,” said a US intelligence official. “We didn’t have a Russian general on the payroll who could say: ‘I haven’t written an honest report in my entire career.’”View image in fullscreenA family from Bucha, a town north of Kyiv, walk past destroyed Russian military machinery in April 2022.Photograph: Roman Pilipey/EPAPutin’s tiny planning circle also played a role, creating a hopelessly cocky plan that had not been subjected to a rigorous critique by intelligence professionals versed in Ukrainian realities. Russian troops entered Ukraine expecting a surgical regime change operation with little resistance, rather than the bitter battles that awaited them. Moscow did not bother with many actions that western military analysts had assumed would accompany the invasion, such as taking out Ukraine’s power and communications networks. The Russian army assumed they would control most of the country in a matter of days, so decided to make the subsequent occupation easier by keeping the infrastructure intact. Instead, the working mobile networks and ready power supply proved crucial for the coordination of Ukraine’s hastily assembled defence forces.“Half of it is we overestimated Russian military performance and underestimated the Ukrainian military,” said Michael Kofman, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington. “But the other half is the Russians didn’t execute the operation remotely how many anticipated it might go, or in a way that made sense.”Zelenskyy’s defiant stand in the days after the invasion was another unexpected factor. Washington, like Moscow, had assumed he would either be killed or flee as soon as the missiles started flying. Biden urged him to leave the capital, or even the country, to ensure he remained safe. But Zelenskyy stayed, and his inspiring performance as a wartime leader during the crucial first weeks of the invasion helped rally Ukrainian society in its fight against the invaders. It also buried questions about his abject failure to heed the US warnings in the buildup.Ever since then, Ukraine has been at war, with little time or appetite to revisit the debate over whether more should have been done to prepare the population in advance. But this discussion may yet resurface, especially if a future election pits Zelenskyy against Zaluzhnyi, the former army commander and current ambassador to London, who pushed for more action but was rebuffed. Zaluzhnyi said the inability to prepare properly cost Ukraine dearly at the start of the invasion. “Martial law should have been introduced in January, or in February at the latest,” he said.Others suggest that Zelenskyy’s refusal to raise the alarm – even if not by design – could be what saved Ukraine. “If he had started to talk about an oncoming war, had told everyone to prepare, society would have panicked and millions would have fled,” said one HUR general. “The country would most likely have fallen.”Lessons learned14 - Lesson LearnedFor the European services that failed to foresee the invasion, a period of soul-searching followed. One European intelligence officer said they were furious over the failure and had pushed internally for an inquiry into what could have been done better. “The whole raison d’etre of an intelligence service is to predict when the next war will come,” said the officer. “And we completely messed it up.”Huw Dylan, a historian of intelligence at King’s College London, said there was a long history of intelligence analysts being unwilling to predict that future events will create a dramatic break with the past. People could not imagine what a major European land war would look like in the 21st century, so assumed it was unlikely to happen. Additionally, scepticism is usually the safer option. “If you’re predicting something that has massive implications, you’ve got more to answer for if you get it wrong,” he said.The Ukraine failure has started to change that. As one German official put it: “The main thing we took away from all of this was that we need to work with worst-case scenarios much more than we did before.”Now, as the world has entered a new era of uncertainty, there are more worst-case scenarios to ponder. Recent European military exercises have focused on how to maintain order after massive attacks on power and communications infrastructure that cause civil unrest. For the first time in a century, Canadais modellingpotential responses to a US invasion.For many, the key intelligence lesson from Ukraine was stark: do not rule things out, just because they might once have seemed impossible.View image in fullscreenNumbers mark the graves of unidentified residents killed during fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.Photograph: Sergei Ilnitsky/EPACreditsAdditional reporting:Pjotr Sauer and Ada PetriczkoAnimation:Anaïs MimsArt direction:Ellen WishartDesign and development:Pip Lev, Harry Fischer, Fred O’Brien, Alessia AmitranoTicker animation:Adapted from Peter Butcher"

The6-3 decisionon Friday to strike down his barrage of tariffs on imports from virtually everywhere based on the preposterous argument that they addressed national emergencies will reassure the world that the US’s system of government – based on the separation of powers, checks and balances, and the rule of law – has not collapsed entirely.But let’s hold the (imported) champagne. The court’s ruling will not restore the United States to its former place as a reasonable, trustworthy player in the world economy. The rules-based economic architecture that underpinned the integration of the world economy over the decades that followed the second world war remains fractured. Trump is still intent on its disintegration. And he retains power to do so.The court’s decision is good news, for sure, grounded on the fact that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) invoked by Trump does not, in fact, give him the power to raise tariffs. These are a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has sole authority.The ruling explicitly referred to tariffs justified by the “public health crisis”, due to illegal drugs from Canada, Mexico and China, and those to counter trade deficits the administration claimed “led to the hollowing out” of American manufacturing. But it will stop all the other supposed “national emergency” duties, including the one Trump attributed to the Brazilian government’s tussle with Elon Musk’s X and its jailing of former president Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup.The Swiss-basedGlobal Trade Alert estimatedthe supreme court’s call will reduce the United States’ average, trade-weighted tariff, to 8.3% from 15.3%, which will come as very good news for harried American consumers as well as businesses who rely on imported components.Barring any countervailing action by the White House, the average tariff against imports from China will fall from 36.8% to 21.2%, on a trade-weighted basis. It will fall from 26.3% to 6.8% on Brazilian imports and decline from 14.9% to 9.9% on Japanese goods.But before anybody calls this a win, it is worth noting that 8.3% is an extraordinarily high tariff, by recent historical standards. More importantly, the court had little to say about the corruption at the heart of Trump’s trade war: the incongruous, bullshit arguments Trump has deployed to justify aggression against the world.The court said nothing about whether the president should justify how tariffs would remedy the emergencies he claims they address. (The blanket “reciprocal tariffs” he imposed on “Liberation Day” last April notably failed to curb the trade deficit, which grew by 2% in 2025, fuelled by a surge in imports to a record high of $4.33tn.)The Court did not limit the president’s ability to justify government action by saying whatever he wants, however mendacious it may be. Apparently, it’s fine for him to say that Bolsonaro’s arrest or theinternational criminal court’s investigation of US and Israeli officials is a “national emergency”. He just can’t use that argument to impose a tax.The court’s decision, in fact, adds to economic uncertainty, as deals Trump struck with other countries are upended by the decision. He needs another source of revenue to fill the budget hole created by the foregone custom duties. CapitalEconomicsestimates that levies collected so far under the now invalidated national emergency pretext amount to about $120bn, or half a percent of gross domestic product.And as Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted in his dissent, the supreme court did nothing to remove all the other weapons Trump has to continue on the offensive.“We have very powerful alternatives,” a visibly frustrated president said in a rambling press conference after the decision was announced. “We’ll take in more money.” He immediately announced a 10% blanket global tariff “over and above our normal tariffs already being charged”, under section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows temporary tariffs to address “large and serious” balance-of-payments deficits.So here we go again but maybe there is reason to cheer. Perhaps the court’s ruling will protect the international economic architecture from Trump’s tantrums. Section 122 requires congressional approval to extend the tariffs beyond 150 days, and must not discriminate among countries – meaning Trump can’t tweak them in the pursuit of bilateral deals.Trump could resort to section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which permits tariffs to retaliate against unfair trade practices, and which he deployed against China in his first term. He could invoke section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which he used to put levies on steel, aluminum, lumber, semiconductors and autos on national security grounds. But these also come with limits.Before retaliating under section 301, for instance, the US trade representative must perform an investigation, consult with the country in question and publish its proposed action and the factual findings on which it is based.Even if he can eventually replace the tariffs that the court struck down, Trump can no longer credibly threaten tariffs every other day to advance this or that foreign policy objective.Who knows whether world trade has been granted a true reprieve. What is certain is that Trump will not simply eat this defeat. Many countries around the world must now negotiate some new trade deals with the United States. It’s unclear whether the supreme court’s decision will make that process any easier.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEconomicsUS economyDonald TrumpTariffsUS supreme courtanalysisShareReuse this content"

The hip-hop stars enjoyed a picnic beside thespectacular rocky outcropon the leafy 106 hectare (256-acre) common land in the heart of the Kent town.“Now we want development arrested for the commons,” said John Barber, a local resident and the former chair of theFriends of Tunbridge Wells and Rusthall Commonscharity.The people of Tunbridge Wells are racing against time to raise funds to buy their privately owned commons, which have been put up for sale. Fears are growing that new owners could exploit what looks like prime real estate.“Over the years, there’s been this piecemeal chipping away of land for development,” said Nick Leech, another resident and trustee of the Friends charity. “The commons last came up for sale in 2008. It’s a very rare opportunity for the town to secure long-term stewardship. It’s now or never.”View image in fullscreenThe wooded commons support 28 butterfly species, bees, 18 dragonfly species and 300 flowering plants.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianWhile public meetings about the commons’ sale have been packed out, it is not yet known how much money will be required to buy them – their commercial potential is disputed, and commons do not usually come up for sale. Because the land isregistered as an asset of community value, the Friends charity has until 26 March to secure the funds to make an offer.The wooded commons support 28 butterfly species, nationally scarce bees including the broad-banded nomad bee, 18 dragonfly species, 300 flowering plants including scarcities such as coralroot.On a bright afternoon, the commons were bustling with joggers, dog-walkers, prams, birds singing of spring and the first bumblebees of the year.“Just to come up here and listen to the song thrush, I really do love it,” said Camilla Macnaghten, walking Leonardo, her “19-breed” mongrel. “I certainly wouldn’t like to see it developed. It’s such a special place for centuries. Kings and queens have camped up here. For me, owning a rather full-on dog, it’s wonderful to walk him around here and have some peace from the whirl of the town.”Clare Sinha, a local “freehold tenant” of the commons who volunteers asone of 12 conservators on the body that controls the commons, said it would be “a big effort” to buy it but her fingers were crossed: “I’d like to feel we’ve got enough legal protection for it but I don’t think we have. It always should’ve been part of the community, in public ownership, and a series of mistakes since its foundation in 1890 means it isn’t.”View image in fullscreenChildren playing on a rocky outcrop on the commons.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianDespite having been privately owned by Targetfollow, a property management company thatacquired the commonsas part of a commercial property purchase 18 years ago, there are stringent and specific legal protections against the commons’ development, including an act of parliament.Targetfollow is offering for separate sale one small parcel of the common land, which is currently an unsurfaced car park for 170 cars surrounded by trees. The company has suggested this piece of the common could be turned into 104 luxury apartments and 285 underground parking spaces.It could be possible for a purchaser to develop this parcel of land if they can deregister this section of the commons. They could do this by providing a comparable replacement parcel of land, which Targetfollow is offering to potential purchasers at Still Green, close to Rusthall Commons but not connected to it.The Friends charity argues that the Still Green replacement land is not of equivalent amenity value, being not connected to the existing common. Similar land-swaps have been successful but a developer would have to obtain permission from the secretary of state for the environment.View image in fullscreenThe Friends charity said it had ‘got a lot of support from local residents’.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianTargetfollow said there has been international interest in the sale of the commons, which comes with the title Lord of the Manor of Rusthall – the type of ancient title that appeals to “status buyers”.Richard Simm, a co-owner ofthe Forum, a music venue and community space in a former toilet block on the commons’ edge that has hosted up-and-coming musicians for 33 years including Oasis, Adele and Coldplay, said: “We hope the common comes into community ownership then it’s future-proofed for ever.”He worries about the commons close to the venue being turned into new flats. “We owe a huge amount to our commons, it’s not just a nice place to be but it’s insulated us from the biggest problem for a music venue – noise complaints,” he said.Roger Barton, the chair of the Friends, said: “The important thing is to secure the commons, not just for us but for future generations. We’ve certainly got a lot of support from local residents. What we need now is to raise the pledges to buy it.

Seasoned pros from Esther Rantzen to Kirsty Wark reveal their tips and tricks for creating interview goldZoe WilliamsFri 20 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 12.21 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleClaudia Winkleman’s new chatshow will land next month, and its enthusiast army are already excited. Winkleman herself, who doesn’t come off at all breathy, said: “I can’t quite believe it and I’m incredibly grateful to the BBC for this amazing opportunity.” Kalpna Patel-Knight, who commissioned TheClaudia WinklemanShow, observed: “Claudia is a true national treasure – warm, witty and endlessly entertaining.” Graham Stuart, long-term producer/buddy of Graham Norton, who runs So Television, which produces both, said of his new venture: “How can you possibly follow [Graham Norton]? By booking a host equally as brilliant. So we have.”And if anything proves how hard it is to create great chat, it’s those quotes. If anyone was ever that bland and blow-hard on one of their chatshow sofas, most TV people would punch themselves in the head. No wonder so many chatshows struggle when they first come out – it’s not that the expectation is too high, exactly, so much as the fanfare is too boasty. Brilliant as she is, then, the success of Claudia’s new series is far from given. But how exactly do you go about creating chatshow magic?One tricky balancing act is getting the guests right. An awesome amount of energy goes into securing A-listers, but the bigger the name, the less they’ll say. Some host-guest magic needs to occur to leaven the stories, which pray God are not retreads. Graham Norton’s multiply populated sofa – which has its own formula, big ticket guest at the seat nearest Norton, a good mixer who is nice in the middle, and someone who is funny and can hold their own in seat three – is the show’s secret weapon. That’s even according to Norton, who told the Radio Times in 2010 (when his show was but three years old) that: “I’m really bad at actually interviewing people.” In an ideal world, the guests make their own magic (go watchLady Gaga and June Brown, AKA Dot Cotton), creating TV that’s lively and chaotic like a circus.View image in fullscreenDwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt, Matthew McConaughey, Graham Norton, James Norton, Raye on The Graham Norton Show.Photograph: Matt Crossick/So Television/PA Media/Then there’s the interview itself. In the same issue of Radio Times, Michael Parkinson, who’d hung up his mic in 2007, had a moan about chatshow formats where “television executives who really ought to know better … entrust the job to people who, more often than not, neither know how to ask a question nor listen to the answer.” But those days are long over; nobody really wants to watch people be interviewed any more. The question-answer format belongs to a more civil century, when you’d approach a celebrity the same way as a politician: searching, polite.Kirsty Wark, the Bafta-winning interviewer and ex-Newsnight host, who speaks to me over the phone while she babysits her brand new granddaughter, says that nowadays “entertainment interviews are a totally different kettle of fish from current affairs ones. Scratchiness is OK for political interviews, it’s a bit tricky for sofa interviews.” You could actually imagine Claudia Winkleman revivifying the old art of asking genuinely difficult things. She has a lot of natural authority, either caused or signified by the eyeliner, nobody knows which. But you can also imagine that going really wrong on contact with a thin-skinned Hollywood A-lister whose most significant disclosure that year was how he felt about lactose. The norms of celebrity interrupt human connection at every stage. Even the entourage a star walks in with creates some artificial power imbalance that chatshow hosts either kick against or cave into.Kirsty Warkstill remembers the time she interviewed George Clooney: “He just sauntered in on his own and it was so much nicer.”View image in fullscreen‘Entertainment interviews are a totally different kettle of fish’, says Kirsty Wark.Photograph: Mike Marsland/WireImageIf the chatshow isn’t really about interviewing, though, what the hell is it about? Jonathan Ross doesn’t love talking about his work because he gets into trouble running his mouth, but told the Guardian in 2010: “My talkshow is not an interview show as such, which is why I’m always bemused when critics say the interview wasn’t very good. And I think, but I’m not doing an interview! What I’m trying to do is make a comedy show. And that, trust me, is a fuck of a lot harder.” But is it? Seems like comedy, if you’re funny, is not as hard as the white-knuckle ride of creating a chemical reaction between people who are each flogging something (generally speaking) and have never met. Very often, and surely in Claudia Winkleman’s case, the question is: we have this gold-dust host whom everyone wants to watch – how on earth do we maximise that?In 1973, that person was Esther Rantzen. She didn’t say that, by the way, she’s way too modest: she tells the story ofThat’s Lifeas a magpie pilfer of the consumer show that went before it, from the Canadian actor Bernard Braden (Braden’s Week). She was a researcher on that and, when he went back to Canada, turned it into something that people definitely watched for Rantzen herself, and it was massive.View image in fullscreen‘Mrs Thatcher and John Major watched it [That’s Life], because they knew that their voters watched it’, says Esther Rantzen.Photograph: David McHugh/Brighton Pictures/Shutterstock“In those pre-fragmented days, we had audiences, regularly, of around 15 million, at its height, 22 million. Mrs Thatcher and John Major watched it, because they knew that their voters watched it,” she tells me on the phone while her daughter makes her some lunch.She can’t watch herself now, she says, “like actors sometimes say they don’t like watching themselves on film, because there’s nothing you can do to improve it. I do shudder when I watch it, and I’m sure there would have been viewers that felt the same.”It is just a fact that you can’t be that person – that national treasure, that water-cooler main character – if you don’t excite strong feelings in the audience, which means you have to split the crowd a bit. The Princess of Wales, for instance, could not host a chatshow. Claudia Winkleman comes off as someone who has the backbone to be 90% loved and 10% loathed, which matters, because it’s not fun loathing people unless they seem as if they’ll brush it off with casual self-deprecation. (Rantzen sat in for Terry Wogan once in 1986, and interviewed Anthony Perkins, who took umbrage at one of her questions: “He had a fantastic go at me, and said: ‘All the aficionados know that that’s the truth,’ and I said: ‘With my teeth, I can’t even say aficionados.’”)Part of That’s Life’s success was that it wasabout a thing. The key to its longevity (it ran for 21 years – and led to Rantzen getting her own spin-off chatshow, Esther) was that it evolved, from low-stakes outrages (people selling fake slimming tea) or things that were funny (a dog that could say sausages) to campaigns. The first, in 1984, about Ben Hardwick, a toddler who needed a liver transplant, doubled the number of transplants in the immediate aftermath. In this more cynical age – and given how difficult it would be to keep it apolitical – pioneering social affairs content like that would be impossible to pull off.View image in fullscreenHugh Grant during an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, 1995.Photograph: Margaret Norton/NBC/Getty ImagesIf sofa magic is hard to conjure, some dynamics are pretty failsafe. Norton said once (when he himself was a guest, on Late Night With Seth Meyers): “I think what’s good about actors is sometimes they don’t care about the audience but they care about each other. So if an actor tells a funny story, you can see someone seething, like: ‘I have a funny story! I shat myself!’ So the stakes get higher and higher.” Winkleman brings something extra to the baseline of competitiveness, which is that people want to show off in front of her. You can see it inThe Traitorsbetter than onStrictly, where everyone is showing off already – the way the Traitors, celebrity and regular, stand up straighter, mugging not for the cameras but for her twinkly approval. If you could bottle chatshow chemistry, that would be a big part of it – but sadly we’ve established that you can’t.Ultimately, the key is to make TV that’s memorable. Hosts and audiences remember discord on a chatshow word for word (Michael Parkinson and Meg Ryan; Terry Wogan and George Best) and they remember when things were funny, even if they can’t recall what anyone said. Moments of spontaneous connection and openness (Freddie Flintoff on Jonathan Ross, Hugh Grant’s mea culpa about that blowjob on Jay Leno – look it up, young’uns)are also extremely watchable, they’re just quite rare; if you could turn it on and off like a tap, it wouldn’t be authentic.“You’ve got to do your homework but, in a sense, throw it all away,” Kirsty Wark says, “and follow the conversation. I did the last interview with Harold Pinter before he died. I think he knew that he wasn’t well. People who are less well known and perhaps less practised, that conversation sometimes flows more naturally. But I also feel that people who are comfortable in their skin give better interviews.” They also make better interviewers, on which terms, Claudia Winkleman should absolutely smash this. But what do I know? I said The Celebrity Traitors was going to be rubbish.The Claudia Winkleman Show starts on BBC One in March.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionClaudia WinklemanGraham NortonEsther RantzenKirsty WarkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An appeal against the ruling is expected.While professional mountain guides in many jurisdictions belong to certified bodies and can be held legally responsible for negligence in serious cases, and similarly for adults leading activities with minors, Hofer’s ruling suggests a novel and potentially complex duty of care: between more experienced and more novice participants in mountain sports.Climber convicted of manslaughter after leaving girlfriend on Austria’s highest peak to seek helpRead moreAt the heart of the case was Thomas P’s decision to climb a high-altitude, mixed snow and rock route on the 3,798-metre (12,461ft) Großglockner in poor weather with insufficient safety equipment, as well as errors of decision making, including failing to turn back late at night below the summit when it would have been safe to do so.The prosecution’s argument, accepted in part by the judge, was that Thomas P had made nine separate mistakes, the most serious being to take Kerstin G on the climb despite her inexperience and the fact she had never undertaken an alpine tour of this length, difficulty and altitude, and despite the challenging winter conditions.The court heard Thomas P had left his girlfriend alone and exposed in the open and pushed on alone, apparently believing he could secure assistance from a hut on the other side of the mountain. He had declined the offer of assistance from a rescue helicopter that had been sent to see if they required help.“You haven’t been convicted because you’re [the] better [climber],” Hofer told Thomas P, rather it was because he had met the threshold for what the court believed was “guiding out of courtesy” and the duties that involved. “You did not fulfil the leadership responsibilities you assumed in the manner required of you by law.”Whether Hofer’s ruling has a wider impact will depend on how it is seen in different jurisdictions with varying attitudes to regulation in the mountains, including how police investigate fatal accidents.In an interview withAustria’s Kurier newspaper, Andreas Ermacora, a former head of the Austrian Alpine Club, which is a major provider of mountaineering insurance throughout Europe, was sceptical the ruling would have a major impact. “I don’t think so, because every story is so unique. [But] it is perhaps groundbreaking that this is the first time in Austria that someone has been convicted as an unqualified guide,” said Ermacora, a lawyer who has represented professional guides involved in accidents.“The crucial point was that it was clear the woman would never have gone up there alone. For a mixed ice and rock climb like that in winter, you really need to know what you’re getting into. And I don’t think she knew that at all. He, on the other hand, had been up there several times before. She transferred her responsibility to him.”Where that becomes complicated, however, is that the main way in which many aspirant mountaineers gain skills is through the mentorship of more experienced partners.“One of the things that struck me was the big disparity in experience between the two,” said John Cousins, a British mountain guide and chief executive of Mountain Training, which runs training schemes for mountain activities.“We’re all on a continuum of experience. If someone is an absolute novice they can only be looked after. But once you get a way along that continuum, in my mind as a mountain guide, it very definitely becomes a negotiation. You want to be constantly checking in with the other person to see how it is going for them.”Checks would include whether the less experienced person was still within their comfort zone, and whether the more experienced climber might feel out of their depth, even if they say they are not. The latter issue was prominent in reporting around Kerstin G’s death last year and in the case itself.“I can’t think of a precedent,” said Cousins. “But I also don’t believe anyone goes into the mountains with a court in mind in the event of an accident.”Where it may have an impact, some observers suggest, is around whether some amateur climbers could feel nervous about being seen as responsible for a less experienced companion, a point made by Severin Glaser, a professor of criminal law at the University of Innsbruck.“This could shift the responsibility for yourself if you’re doing something dangerous,” hetold the New York Times. “The costs of mountaineering, the costs of expressing your freedom might rise, and maybe some people are not willing any more to pay this higher price.”A final issue apparent to climbers is the sometimes complicating issues of climbing partnerships where those involved are in a relationship, a situation where – regardless of gender – the dynamics of the need for approval or vulnerability can creep in.It is an issue coincidentally discussed in the current issue ofClimbing magazineby the climber Alice Hafer, on why she had decided not to climb with her “significant other” after a frustrating climb. “I looked back on … situations like this one and saw that I often deflected decisions to my partner and avoided empowering myself towards my own goals. Climbing, a place where I usually excelled, became tainted by the context of a relationship.”Explore more on these topicsMountaineeringAustriaEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Can they revive the UK’s love of them?Fri 20 Feb 2026 05.44 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 09.16 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on Google“You wouldn’t seeOlivia Colmandoing this bollocks would you?” jokesDanny Dyeras he clears up a dustbin at Priory Hill & Nutts Farm Holiday Park in Kent.But over the past year – around filming the return of the hit Disney+ seriesRivals– the actor, and his daughter Dani, have been spending weekends on the Isle of Sheppey, filming The Dyers’ Caravan Park (Sky One) in an attempt to boost the fortunes of Priory Hill and make caravanning cool.As Danny puts it: “[Jeremy] Clarkson’s got a farm, Richard Hammond’s got a workshop … if Jamie Oliver can save school dinners, then why can’t we save the great British holiday?”The pair have got properly involved – from cleaning the caravans to donning a bear costume to entertain children, to sorting out the issue of poos in the park’s indoor swimming pool.Danny says he wanted to make the show as he adored his childhood holidays with his extended family in a caravan park in Canvey Island. “There was a real sense of community,” he says, “which I think in today’s world is severely lacking. It was the best time of my life, running about getting a bit of sea air in my lungs. These places are dying out.”Dyer does not own Priory Hill (it has been in the Butcher family since 1951) but he has invested in it; staking not just his money but his reputation. Sitting in Priory Hill’s clubhouse with Dani, he says: “We’re living in a very divisive time, it’s very difficult, and … no one’s really interacting with each other any more [due to] social media.View image in fullscreenDanny and Dani relaxing inside one of the caravans.Photograph: Ellis O’Brien / Sky“I do think, on a caravan site, the kids [are] just playing, laughing on bikes … fresh air in their fucking lungs. [It’s] such a beautiful thing to watch … can we bring that back? Can we get kids out all day, getting naturally tired instead of having their brain just zapped all day? Can we make that an exciting thing again?”Sporting the moustache he has grown for Rivals’ Freddie Jones, Danny says older generations love caravanning but, “it’s about trying to get the next generation involved … It’s so accessible to go abroad, and probably cheaper.”He acknowledges that there is a fair degree of snobbery to overcome: some people he has spoken to, “just don’t understand [the appeal]; they turn their nose up at it slightly. I think the elitism comes from, it’s a very working-class holiday … So if you’ve got a few quid, then you probably wouldn’t buy a caravan.”Yet, Dani explains, new luxury ones have all mod cons and are “so cosy” but expensive. One on the seafront cost more than £50,000 (with a boutique hotel-style interior) but the Dyers sold it by making an amusingsocial media video.Expectation’s creative director, entertainment Ben Wicks said the pair want to ensure, “everyone is having the time of their life when they’re on the park” and Danny has, “got a real social conscience. He worries about things that not everyone worries about.”The pair are happy to send themselves up and acknowledge mistakes: one marketing initiative, involving a giant billboard by the Sheppey Bridge, backfired and was targeted with graffiti.Danny was keen to get Dani onboard the series because she had more youthful ideas (she has successfully introduced glamping to the site) and was able to rein in his more extravagant plans.Attending a residents’ meeting to discuss improvements led to the pair holding a sports day, complete with a mobility scooter – a “granny prix”. It was a hit, but cost about £10,000.The show is made by Expectation TV, the company responsible forClarkson’s Farm, and there are similarities – particularly the idea of its fish-out-of-water celebrity stars being guided by knowledgable local workers and characterful residents.But Leysdown-on-Sea is less affluent than the Cotswolds, and more open to the TV tourism the Sky show could bring. As Priory Hill’s co-owner Jimi Butcher explains: “Already the hype in Leysdown is incredible.”View image in fullscreenDani Dyer gets stuck in to the cleaning routine.Photograph: Ellis O’Brien/Ellis O’Brien / SkyWhen I visited the island, the locals were friendly but there was evidence that some are struggling. One business had a sign saying: “Closed for now due to problems.” But the town and Priory Hill & Nutts Farm have stunning views across the bay to Whitstable – that beacon of how a once run-down town can be rejuvenated by tourism.The pair hope the show will help reinvigorate a “very deprived” area that has “a real charm”. Although, says Dani, their other aim is to not “tread on” the owners’ toes, but to “put a lot of smiles on people’s faces” – from viewers to Priory Hill’s residents and managers.However, Priory Hill was badly affected by Covid and the cost of living; when the Dyers got involved the business had 38 empty pitches, causing a loss of £150,000 in potential revenue per annum.The co-owners, Alex and Jimi, lost their father, Michael, (who previously ran the park) seven years ago and say “it’s not been the same” since, but the Dyers have “brought some energy back”.This has included star appearances from EastEnders actorShaun Williamsonand Harry Redknapp, who helped with a football tournament the Dyers organised to bring the site’s residents together.With his lauded appearance onITV’s The Assemblyand Rivals, Danny’s career is experiencing a renaissance. “We don’t know how [the show] is going to be received,” he says, but he and his daughter feel a responsibility towards the residents and to try to use their fame wisely – even if his public persona doesn’t always open doors for him.View image in fullscreenDani and Danny patrolling the site.Photograph: Ellis O’Brien/Ellis O’Brien / Sky“I am from a working-class background. People might have had a perception of me and [Dani], and then if they don’t really like you it’s about trying to win them over.”He says he is “getting better” at dealing with fame and remembering to be “true to yourself”, not “losing [who] the fuck you are. Being famous … it’s very toxic. I do love being in these sort of surroundings, I really do, around other peasants like me!” he jokes.But not everything he is working on is down to earth. He’s been writing a play about his friendship with his late mentor Harold Pinter, called When Harry Met Danny. “And,” he says, “I would love to play Harold.”The Dyers’ Caravan Park launches 24 Feb on Sky and NowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDanny DyerinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Too big to be contained within the regular loop of the auditorium, even when the director uses the full height of the in-the-round space, sending her actors up ladders and getting them to pop out from the upper level. More than that, before the show and in the interval, her production spills into the wider building.Leslie Travers’s set is scattered like so much post-industrial debris into corners where, if you get there early and time it right, you will see actors perform sketches of working-class life: some pre-party preening; a boozy game of darts; a lost soul wandering with her shopping trolley.The intrusion excites the audience and extends the playwright’s slice-of-life portrait. This community, the director seems to suggest, is not just living around one Lancashire road in 1986 as the playwright envisaged, but in and around us. You start looking at your fellow spectators and wondering if they too are part of Cartwright’s tapestry.View image in fullscreenSinging for her supper … Lesley Joseph.Photograph: Ros KavanaghSimilarly bold is Cartmell’s approach to the actors. She sets them off at a fast simmer and heats them to boiling point. Playing Scullery, a dishevelledJohnny Vegasis at once measured and pugnacious, punching out his introductions to a short-fuse cast of characters, be that Lesley Joseph as an old dear singing for her supper or Laura Elsworthy and Lucy Beaumont as girls on the town.None of this diminishes the sourness of Cartwright’s play, written in anger at the neglect and poverty of Thatcher’s Britain, but more bitter than politically articulate. His characters dream of the beauty ofOtis Redding’s Try a Little Tenderness, while locking their own beauty away. Insults come first, demands for cash come second, friendship is hard won.A collage of unrelated monologues and two-handers, Road can seem like a sequence of audition pieces. Cartmell’s actors, including a pre-recordedTom Courtenayas a man crippled by nostalgia, would effortlessly pass such an audition, but the fragmentary structure makes it easier to be impressed than to care. Still, as the centrepiece of the Royal Exchange’s 50th anniversary season, the production is exuberant, abrasive and giddily theatrical.At theRoyal Exchange, Manchester,until 14 March.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreRoyal ExchangereviewsShareReuse this content"

The US made far lighter work of Slovakia in the nightcap to set up the heavyweight clash, strolling to a 6-2 win after Jack Hughes and Jack Eichel scored in a 19-second span during the second period to blow things open, ensuring the Americans no worse than silver and their first men’s hockey medal in 16 years.USA roar back from brink to beat Canada in overtime and claim Olympic women’s ice hockey goldRead more“When we started this journey last summer and got together for an orientation camp, our goal was to be in the gold medal game,” Eichel said. “That’s where we are at.”The Americans are targeting their third ever Olympic title in men’s hockey and first since theMiracle on Iceteam of 1980, while Canada can win a record-extending 10th. The eagerly awaited matchup will mark the third time the border rivals have met in the gold medal game and the first since 2010, when Sidney Crosby etched his name into Olympic loreby scoring in overtime to seal a 3-2 winover the Americans on home soil.Crosby, 38, is still in the Canada squad four Olympics later, but he did not dress for Friday’s game after leavingWednesday’s quarter-final win over the Czech Republicin the second period with a lower-back injury. No details about the two-time Olympic gold medalist’s injury have been released and the severity remains unclear, but Canada coach Jon Cooper said “he’s got a better chance of playing in the gold medal game than he had of playing in tonight’s game”.“We are a deep team, and we have leaders up and down the lineup,” Canada star Connor McDavid said. “It does not matter who is wearing the C, everybody can play and play a big role and lead.”Canada found themselves staring down elimination on Friday for a second straight knockout game after Erik Haula’s short-handed goal fired the Finns to a 2-0 lead early in the second period.But forward Sam Reinhart pulled one back before the second intermission for the Canadians, while defenseman Shea Theodore notched the third-period equalizer. Then after MacKinnon drew a high sticking penalty from Niko Mikkola, the Colorado Avalanche star fired home the winner in the final minute, improving Canada’s dominant power play to 7-for-16 (43.75%) in the tournament.“It’s everything,” said MacKinnon, the NHL’s leading goalscorer. “It’s the gold medal at an Olympic Games. We are very lucky to be here and it’s a great opportunity. We have got to be ready.”The US ran out to a 5-0 lead behind goals from Dylan Larkin and Tage Thompson in the first period, then Hughes (twice) and Eichel in the second. The Slovaks narrowed the gap in the third through goals from rising Montreal Canadiens star Juraj Slafkovsky and Pavol Regenda, but Brady Tkachuk’s breakaway goal with nine minutes left kept matters on course.“It’s the two best teams in the tournament, both undefeated, and we’ve got an opportunity to go win a gold medal.” Hughes said. “I’m really excited about the opportunity we have on Sunday. We’re one shot away [from gold], but the line between winning and losing is so fine in tournaments like this.“Both teams have earned their right to be in the final game and a chance to play for a gold medal. Here we are, we’re going to find out who the best team at the Olympics is.”The US and Canada are two of the only three teams in the Olympic tournament, along with quarter-finalists Sweden, made up exclusively of NHL players.The matchup comes one year after the North American rivals played twice in the 4 Nations Face-Off, which was the first international tournament to feature the NHL’s best players since 2016. The Americanswon 3-1in the round-robin contest played at Montreal’s Bell Centre that sawthe US anthem booedand featuredthree fights in the first nine seconds, while Canadawon the final 3-2 in overtimeat Boston’s TD Garden.“It’s best on best, it’s what every American and Canadian grows up watching, grows up hearing about,” Matthew Tkachuk said. “This is the pinnacle of the sport. This is as good as it gets, a rivalry that’s as good as it gets. There will not be one TV without this game on in the United States and Canada. That should get you pretty fired up.”The elder Tkachuk may not be exaggerating. No sooner had Canada punched their ticket for the final than Ontario premier Doug Fordannouncedall restaurants in the nation’s most populous province can serve alcohol beginning at 6am on Sunday ahead of the scheduled 8.10am ET start.Italian media outletshave been humming for dayswith reports that US president Donald Trump has mulled flying in for the final and the closing ceremony in Verona.

The 20-year-old from West Oakland had just become thefirst American woman to win figure skating’s biggest prizein 24 years, drilling seven clean triples to leapfrog a pair of Japanese rivals from third place after Tuesday’s short program and gatecrash her sport’s most rarefied air. But to hear Liu tell it, her second gold in 12 days was merely a passing footnote in a Milan fortnight she doesn’t want to end.Liu’s carefree mindset should and will be studied in the weeks, months and years after these Olympics – especiallytheseOlympics– as a counterpoint to the results-obsessed mindsets that have shattered the mental wellbeing of so many athletes thrust into the pressure-cooker of the world’s biggest sporting event. She spoke candidly and insightfully on how her unique journey from child prodigy to burnout case to second-act skater gave rise to an indifference to scores or placements. All she wanted in the end was a chance to make the US team and share her artistry on the world stage.Only a few meters away stood Kaori Sakamoto, the silver medalist and one of the most joyful people ever to skate on Olympic ice, dabbing away a steady stream of tears with a wrinkled tissue, brought down by the cold arithmetic and brutal reckoning of this unforgiving sport. The 25-year-old from Kobe, who is retiring after this season, had won a shock bronze medal four years ago at the Beijing Olympics only when a nailed-on favorite who’d never lost a competition at the senior levelwent to pieces in the free skate. She’d backed up that breakthrough with a run of three world championships in the years since. But a couple of faint mistakes on Friday night – a wobbly landing on a triple flip, a missed triple toe in a combination – left her short of Liu’s marker and lamenting the storybook ending that might have been. Sometimes third can feel like first. Other times second can feel like nothing at all.Alysa Liu wins Winter Olympics gold to end US women’s 24-year figure skating droughtRead moreLiu’s journey since Beijing, where she’d finished sixth on her Olympic debut, was different. She’d vanished from the sport only months after the 2022 Games citing mental fatigue, making itInstagram-officialbefore anyone could talk her out of it. She started school at UCLA and studied psychology. She went hiking in the Himalayas with friends. She discovered herself outside a sport where she said she’d felt boxed in sincewinning US nationals at the age of 13, when her 4ft 6in frame left her too short to reach the top of the podium without a hand from the other medalists.“I really hated skating when I quit. Like, I really didn’t like it,” Liu said in the run-up to Milan. “I didn’t care about competitions. I didn’t care about places. I didn’t care about skaters. I didn’t care about my programs. I just wanted to, like, get away. I wanted nothing to do with that. I hated fame. I hated social media. I didn’t like interviews. Like, I hated all of it.”View image in fullscreenGold medalist Alysa Liu celebrates alongside silver medalist Kaori Sakamoto and bronze medalist Ami Nakai of Japan.Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty ImagesBut a chance reconnection with her love for movement while gliding down the mountain during a Lake Tahoe ski trip led her back to the ice.Gradually at first, once a week at public sessions at the Toyota Sports Performance Center in El Segundo, where she found the complex jumps that had propelled her rise had not completely abandoned her. Over time she rediscovered a love for skating not as a competitive pursuit but a vehicle for self-expression. She soon fixed her sights on a comeback, but only under certain conditions. Her father, Arthur, who had poured untold sums into molding his daughter into the next Michelle Kwan – another Chinese-American skating icon from California – would no longer be part of the team. Alysa Liu would be the CEO of Alysa Liu Inc, having final say over everything from her costumes to her music to her diet to her training schedule. Most importantly, the results wouldn’t matter.Enter Alysa 2.0: a term she dislikes, but an accurate shorthand for the complete reinvention of a skater on her own terms. Sporting an eye-catching frenulum piercing and a bleached tree-ring hairstylethat has required years to cultivate, she has embraced a nonconformist streak that’s made her a darling of outsiders everywhere. But the transformation runs far deeper than aesthetics.“Protecting my identity is my main goal,” she said in Thursday’s aftermath. “I know exactly what it’s like to not have that. My experience with it before has taught me how I should guard myself. I don’t go online that much. I hang out with my friends and family as much as possible. Being grounded is really what keeps me. I love exploring other hobbies, doing side-quests and what not. It keeps me curious and I’m protecting that.”View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu seemed to be enjoying herself during her gold medal winning routine.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianLiu first signaled her comeback was for realat last year’s world championshipsin Boston, when she became the first American to win figure skating’s biggest competition outside the Olympics since Kimmie Meissner in 2006. The bumps in the road since then have ranged from the prosaic to the macabre. There weremusic rights headaches. Dress issues. Her planned short program music for the Olympic seasonwas scrappedwhen the artist was found at the center of a police investigation after the remains of a teenage girl were discovered in the trunk of his impounded car. (Regular figure skating things.)Alysa Liu left figure skating behind. She came back better than ever | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreTo hear Phillip DiGuglielmo put it, the Olympic gold was a “kind of taboo” subject and didn’t even enter open conversation until November. One half of the thrice-fired, thrice-rehired coaching duo – along with Massimo Scali – that have been with Liu from the start, DiGuglielmo reflected on how their skater’s reframed expectations have rubbed off on the team. Stress management ahead of Thursday’s free skate, for instance, meant two glasses of Pol Roger champagne before their walk over to the rink.“We did a little pre-celebratory thing, like we learned from her,” he said. “Third place or fourth place would have still been an incredible accomplishment. I can’t sit here and say shehasto win. That doesn’t jibe with her values. And as a coach you have to amplify the values of the athlete.”He added: “Her goal was about showing her art. We get a lot of flak. Pretty hair and pretty dresses and sequins. It’s a sport. It’s a hard sport. It’s a split-second timing sport. You get a little bit of adrenaline and it changes your timing. Her internal clock is just ticking along. Her goal was to just make the Olympic team. That was really the big deal for her.”View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu shows some love to the fans alongside coaches Phillip DiGuglielmo (left) and Massimo Scali (right) after receiving her score.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianDiGuglielmo, who was initially skeptical of the comeback and tried to talk her out of it, had stood alongside Liu through her dizzying, unfulfilling first chapter, giving him a unique perspective for how far she has come.“When she was younger, she has no memories of any of the places she went to, or any of the competitions she did,” he said. “She was so not happy that she wound up compartmentalizing. She does not remember that she went to junior worlds, or that she went to the junior Grand Prix final. She doesn’t remember any of that. So last year’s tagline wasmaking memories.If we’re in Japan, we’re getting ramen. We wanted to say, ‘Here we are, this is what we’re doing.’”‘If there was no one on Earth, I would still skate’: Alysa Liu on her remarkable figure skating comebackRead moreThat odyssey culminated on Thursday night, when an arena once headlined by Whitney Houston and Lady Gaga gave rise to a new American original, an unthinkable outcome two years ago when Liu was off the grid roving the trails around Mount Everest with skating firmly in the rear view. She is now the reigning world and Olympic champion, flying home from Italy after Saturday’s exhibition gala with two golds followinglast week’s team eventas the face of US figure skating, if not the sport itself. But more importantly she’s offered proof that joy, not pressure, can prove the sharper edge.“My story is more important than anything to me, and that’s what I will hold dear,” Liu said. “This journey has been incredible. I have no complaints, and I’m so grateful for everything. It’s just how my life has gone. Everything in general has led me to this point.”Explore more on these topicsAlysa LiuWinter Olympics 2026US sportsFigure skatingWinter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After the fury of the first two rounds, everything would stop for a much-needed fallow week in which to restore energy levels. And now? The battle-scarred gladiators are about to “go again”, putting their bodies on the line out on the pitch or, in the case of travelling supporters, in the pub.Player welfare rules OK? That debate still rumbles on but certain other areas – fitness, mental resilience, squad depth – traditionally reserved for the tournament’s closing fortnight are increasingly front and centre. The rhythm of this year’s championship is subtly different, particularly for sides such as England with only two home fixtures. Slip up for a second successive Saturday and that’s it, folks, until November in terms of high-profile Twickenham opportunities.Itoje’s character and consistency shine through as he joins England’s 100 club | Ugo MonyeRead moreThe Six Nations title will also disappear down the swollen River Thames for another year unless England can restore some equilibrium inthe wake of their Murrayfield jolt. Another defeat, by an Ireland side who have been looking about as vibrant and fresh as an old episode of Mrs Brown’s Boys, would unquestionably be a backward step, regardless of the potential that Steve Borthwick’s squad clearly possess.That may also have underpinned Andy Farrell’s experience-heavy visiting team selection. Back into the starting lineup come a veritable Mount Rushmore of familiar thirtysomethings – Josh van der Flier, Tadhg Beirne, Tadhg Furlong, Jamison Gibson-Park – all capable of jamming an old-school spanner into the sweet chariot’s wheels. For this big stadium gig, Farrell has essentially reunited the Irish oval-ball equivalent of U2 and challenged Bono, the Edge and co to rattle and hum one more time.Admittedly it’s not quite up there with the famous recall of Tony O’Reilly, aged 33, for this same fixture in 1970 after a seven-year international career break. O’Reilly wasn’t in the greatest shape, as his captain, Willie John McBride, wryly observed when the wing admitted he was nervous about facing his lightning-quick English counterpart, Keith Fielding. “I wouldn’t worry too much,” said McBride. “By the time he runs around you he’s going to be bloody tired.”Joking aside, Farrell could do with a statement performance from his leading men every bit as much as Borthwick clearly does. Round three is still “moving day” in terms of the championship leaderboard and, with a run-in comprising successive home games against Wales and Scotland, the moment of truth for Ireland has arrived. Yes, they wereblown away in the rainin Paris and were a touch fortunateto escape the clutches of Italy’s scrumbut, equally, they have not morphed into no-hopers overnight.View image in fullscreenEngland must regroup and restore some equilibrium after their disappointment in Scotland last weekend.Photograph: Jamie Johnston/Focus Images Ltd/ShutterstockIreland have also won four of their past five Six Nations meetings with England, the exception being two years ago when Marcus Smith’s late, late drop goaledged the hosts home23-22. There is an entire PhD thesis to be written on the reasons why Smith’s international career has not kicked on since that compelling contest but, as it happens, Ireland have also not been the same force since the summer of 2024.Which is what makes this weekend so fascinating. What further motivation could Ireland’s old stagers need than to stand in the tunnel alongside the young English pretender to their slowly slipping crown? Henry Pollock is making his first Test start on Saturday and it is only a tiny exaggeration to suggest that if the 21-year-old goes well against Ireland’s more seasoned back row then England will be three-quarters of the way to the winners’ enclosure.While Farrell rated the Northampton tyro highly enough to take him on the British & Irish Lions tour last summer, he ended up preferring Conan and Beirne in his Test XV when push came to shove. Since then, though, even legendary old Lions such as Keith Wood have been re-evaluating the blond-haired, black-headbanded future and wondering if their initial perceptions may need updating. “I looked at him at the start and I said: ‘My God, he’s a pain in the arse,’” the former Ireland captain said this week.“I look at him now and I think: ‘My God, he’s a pain in the arse but he is box office.’ And for somebody who many people say hasn’t done a huge amount, he has done extraordinary things. I want players of that calibre on the rugby field. I want to see the personality. You don’t have to like every single part of it. But he is a nuisance and a thorn in the side of the opposition. I’d say he’s even driving his own teammates batty half the time – but he is electric.”A surge of electricity is unquestionably what England need after their sluggish, error-strewn loss in Edinburgh. If their previous 12-game winning run did breed a hint of complacency, that has now vanished. Borthwick is backing several of his players to respond immediately and the return of Ollie Lawrence and redeployment of Tommy Freeman on the wing should add to their attacking options.There is also the small matter ofMaro Itoje’s 100th Test appearancefor England, which he will hope proves more fulfilling than his 99th. Perhaps the biggest compliment to pay the 31-year-old is to stop for a moment and imagine where England – and the Lions – would have been without him at the heart of their pack over the past decade. With any luck there will be plenty more caps to come.View image in fullscreenEngland need a surge of electricity after their error-strewn loss at Murrayfield.Photograph: Tim Williams/Action Plus/ShutterstockIn the shorter term, though, the captain will be hoping to extend England’s nine-match winning run at home, stretching back toa 29-20 defeat by South Africa15 months ago. Ireland have ended such sequences before, not least in 2018 when England had been unbeaten at Twickenham for more than two years under Eddie Jones.This season, though, England’s share price has been rising, notwithstanding last week’s market correction. Scrum-wise they will fancy gaining parity at the very least and, with some dampness in the air, their tactical kicking and chasing game should pose a few more problems if Henry Arundell remains on the field for slightly longer this time.They can also dig deep in the knowledge that next week, finally, offers some brief respite before the championship’s back-to-back concluding rounds in March. Ireland have the knowhow to be spoilsports, with Stuart McCloskey’s midfield offloading ability and Robert Baloucoune’s footwork also potential threats, but if England do not win this weekend’s generation game, even by the tightest of margins, they will be seriously disappointed.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamRugby unionSix NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the long game,” hetold the Men in Blazers podcastbefore Sunday’s north London derby.Remaining patient has been a recurring theme throughout Eze’s career ever since he was released byArsenalat 13 and then rejected by several other clubs before finding a home at Queens Park Rangers. Yet having made an immediate impression after a £67.5m dream move back to his boyhood club from Crystal Palace that peaked with a memorable hat-trick against Tottenham at the end of November, the goals have dried up completely as Mikel Arteta has seemingly lost faith in the England forward.Saka rejects talk of Arsenal wilting but scars of title near-misses run deepRead moreEze has made 18 appearances in all competitions without scoring since the 4-1 victory over Spurs and found himself restricted to a bit-part role in the Premier League. He was substituted at half-time after an ineffective display against Brentford last week – a first league start for almost two months – while Bukayo Saka was preferred in the No 10 role against Wolves in midweek. With Arteta confirming on Friday that Kai Havertz and Martin Ødegaard are both back in contention for the weekend following injury, Eze faces another challenge to force his way back into the team as also he attempts to earn a place in Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup squad.Not since the last-minute defeat by Aston Villa in December has the 27-year-old been deployed on the left-hand side of Arsenal’s attack – the position where he thrived at Palace and has played most frequently for his country. Eze was culpable for Matty Cash’s equaliser when he failed to track the Villa full-back’s run and that is thought to have done him no favours in Arteta’s highly-tuned system. The Arsenal manager has usually preferred Leandro Trossard or Gabriel Martinelli in that role, with Eze’s preference to drop deeper to try to find space often clashing with runs being made by Declan Rice.“In the last few weeks he has had more consistency in one position and is just trying to understand those relationships where he is more comfortable where he can impact the game more in relation to the opponent,” said Arteta before the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Chelsea earlier this month. “That is where we are.”The statistics show that when Eze does get on the pitch, there has been nothing like the same kind of productivity he managed at Palace. While he attempted 4.6 dribbles per match last season and completed exactly half of those – significantly more than any Arsenal player – this season that figure is down to 2.8 per match, with only 1.6 being successful.It’s been the same with the number of chances created, which has been a wider issue for Arsenal in general. In his final two seasons at Palace, Eze created 54 and 58 chances (2.4 and 2 per match) respectively, albeit for a side where he was the main creative hub and was guaranteed to play every week. That has dropped significantly this season to just nine (0.7 per match), with some Arsenal supporters feeling that he is being stifled by Arteta in the same way that Jack Grealish seemingly was by Pep Guardiola at Manchester City after his move there from Aston Villa.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze was culpable for a Matty Cash goal when he failed to track the Aston Villa full-back’s run during a costly defeat.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty Images“As long as I’m on the pitch and I’m given the opportunity to play and express myself in that environment then it doesn’t matter where I play,” Eze told Ian Wright in an interview after his move from Palace in August. “Of course [the manager] has ideas and things he wants. But for me, I’m free, man.”That certainly wasn’t the case in the draw with Wolves. Despite providing two excellent assists in the FA Cup win over Wigan at the weekend, Eze looked anxious when he replaced Noni Madueke just after the Premier League’s bottom side had pulled a goal back and also wasted a chance to win the game in injury time when he snatched at a shot inside the area.Arsenal have only two players – Saka and Rice – in the top 25 for chances created in the Premier League and are fourth behind Liverpool, Manchester United and City in the team standings, with Guardiola’s side having scored 17 more goals from open play than their title rivals. Arteta is in desperate need of inspiration from somewhere with City now breathing down their necks and Eze will hope that his record in previous campaigns could help his cause as the season reaches its climax.He had a penchant for goalscoring runs in the spring when at Palace and that could be crucial in regards to Arsenal’s hopes of becoming champions for the first time since 2004. Incredibly, of the 38 Premier League goals Eze has scored so far, 18 of them have come in weeks 30 to 38 of the campaign – when it matters most. But first, he must convince Arteta.Explore more on these topicsArsenalanalysisShareReuse this content"

He offered a curt “100%” in response to questions on his confidence in Spurs’s survival. The Croat’s tenure begins on Sunday with a north London derby at home to the wobbling Premier League leaders, though a lengthy injury list leaves him with only 13 fit senior players.‘Ferryman’ Igor Tudor has the record to steer Tottenham to safetyRead more“What I saw this week was the quality of the players,” said Tudor, contracted until the end of the season afterreplacing the sacked Thomas Franklast weekend. “We have enormous quality in the squad.”A coach presiding over 12 remaining league matches, the Champions League being a lower priority with Spurs five points off the relegation zone, made no promises of living up to the club’s attacking traditions.“When you start pre-season and then you have 50 days in pre-season and you have 20 players, of course then we see the style,” Tudor said. “This is an emergency, an emergency situation, when you need to find fast what suits the 10 plus three players and it’s totally different.”Tudor tries his best to avoid league tables. “When I coach I never watch the classification. Maybe it sounds strange. I don’t watch where we are. It’s a process. If you ask me what we are going to see on Sunday, I believe that we are going to see something concrete, something good that the people will like.”Arsenal have won three from eight league matches in 2026 so Sunday offers Spurs opportunity to sabotage their bitter rivals and forge a path towards safety. Tudor said he had “big respect for [Mikel] Arteta who made an amazing team, one of the best in the world with the style of play and amazing mentality in the team, with 11 players behind the ball, pressing from the back. So it is a big challenge for us. Maybe at the moment it is not the best one but you never know in football.”View image in fullscreenIgor Tudor takes charge of his first game this weekend against Arsenal.Photograph: Chloe Knott/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockTudor pledged his total commitment. “I came here not to visit the city. I have come here to do a job at a very difficult moment for this club. We work every day, like all coaches do. Every day, focus on the work and live it 24/7. Even if you go to the restaurant or a museum, you are thinking about how to make the team play better. It’s a strange job.“This is an era of information. Everybody speaks, everybody has comments, everybody has discussions. Sometimes you can lose yourself in listening to too much information. In my life, generally, especially when I work in a club, I never read nothing in the newspaper, on television, nothing. I just want to focus on this, enjoy this, because to think about other things, what others think about you, can give you nothing.”Alongside Tudor will be Bruno Saltor, a former coach at Brighton, Chelsea and West Ham. Tomislav Rogic, the new goalkeeping coach, and Riccardo Ragnacci, the physical coach, have worked with Tudor on previous assignments.Tudor has his first job in the Premier League having coached four clubs in Serie A plus Marseille, Galatasaray and Hajduk Split. “I believe in Italian coaches,” said the former Juventus and Siena midfielder. “The way I feel is half-Italian, half-Croatian in the way of football education because I played there. Italian football gives you something that maybe some other leagues don’t give you. Of course, tactical preparation and I believe they are the best about mentality things.”Frank failed to get the best out of Tottenham’s squad. Tudor requires a quick fix. “We need to become a team, we need to become a group of the people who are available, who will give something more. Who will not watch themselves, but each other.“I never speak about results. I never speak about what we need to achieve at the end of the season. I don’t believe in this. I believe in today’s training. This is all I want the players to think about.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s nice to be back with positive vibes, we’ve got lots to look forward to and lots of decisions to make.“One thought this would tell us roughly what we would do and this does open up a lot of doors, doesn’t it? We have to think long and hard. It would be lovely to say ‘We will do this’, but I don’t think we can at the minute.”Michael Buckley, Constitution Hill’s owner, has suffered more than anyone as a horse who was already established as one of the finest hurdlers of all time has had a series of setbacks. The possibility of Constitution Hill running on the Flat at all would have been unthinkable just 11 months ago, when he went to post as the 1-2 favourite for the Champion Hurdle.After afall at the fifth at Cheltenham, his career has lurched from one disappointment to the next, culminating in athird fall in four starts in Newcastle’s Fighting Fifth Hurdlein November. That early exit, at the second flight after taking off too early at the first, suggested that the nine-year-old had lost all confidence in his ability to get from one side of an obstacle to another.“It sounds a silly thing to say after what’s happened in the last year,” Buckley said, “but we’ve always known he was special. And I think with all the problems and heartbreaks we’ve had, now everybody knows how special he is. He’s a nine-year-old horse, but he sure is good.”View image in fullscreenOisin Murphy was motionless in the saddle as Constitution Hill strode away to victory at Southwell in his first Flat race.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAConstitution Hill had drifted in the betting in the days running up to Friday’s race, but he set off as the 6-4 favourite after a rush of money in the hours beforehand and was roared to victory by a near-record crowd for an evening meeting at Southwell.The same fixture 12 months ago drew just 320 spectators, but there were 3,520 racegoers on Friday, as confirmed fans eager for a glimpse of Constitution Hill were joined by a large contingent from the “Invades” initiative, there as part of racing’s new Friday Night Live programme to attract a younger audience to the sport.The bumper crowd and the jubilant reception for Constitution Hill as he returned after his facile success was a huge vindication for Southwell’s decision to create the £40,000 event for novices, following a suggestion by Henderson that Constitution Hill could benefit from a spin on the Flat after his latest setback at Newcastle.There were fears earlier in the week, when the big purse attracted a bumper entry including a runner from Willie Mullins’ yard in Ireland and several from top Flat stables, that Constitution Hill would be balloted out, and his place in the lineup was confirmed only on Wednesday morning.“Putting on that prize money made the race far too competitive for my liking, with all these fancy Flat horses turning up,” Henderson said. “But what can you say, he was unbelievable.”Kdeux Saint Fray can put a dent in Mullins’ Kempton recordWith pre-Cheltenham purdah fast approaching, the Ladbrokes Trophy Handicap Chase at Kempton on Saturday could well be the most competitive betting heat for the next two and a half weeks and Emmet Mullins’ decision to field two runners in the 13-strong field adds a further layer of complexity to the puzzle.Mullins has a well-earned reputation for sliding contenders into handicaps at Cheltenham and Aintree on very competitive marks, but his Kempton record – three wins from five runners – is not too shabby either.Eight of those 10 winners set off as favourite, so money for either Rising Dust – three-from-three over fences and with the champion jockey, Sean Bowen, booked to ride – or Chance Another One, a course-and-distance winner in November, would be significant.As things stand, though, neither Rising Dust nor Chance Another One is an obvious blot on the handicap, and even the unbeaten Rising Dust is making a big jump in class after an 11lb rise in the weights.Several rivals have very similar claims on the book, including last year’s 15-length winner, Katate Dori, and the ultra-consistent Hoe Joly Smoke, but neither makes as much appeal as the progressive six-year-oldKdeux Saint Fray(3.35), at around 7-1.Kdeux Saint Fray was five lengths behind Jordans Cross at Cheltenham last month but finished with running left after getting caught behind a tiring rival at a vital stage. He runs off just a 1lb higher mark and has plenty of room for improvement as he steps up to three miles for the first time.Kempton 1.10:Grenadier Jedis both consistent and still progressive and sets a fair bar for the lightly raced favourite, Hold The Serve.Lingfield 1.25:Robson Aguiar has made a strong start to his training career in Ireland andValiant Forcelooks primed to get him off the mark in the UK at the first attempt.Kempton 1.45:Precious Manis still on the up and can reverse form with One Horse Town from Cheltenham in November.Lingfield 2.00:Karl Burke’sBoiling Pointhas the most convincing profile stepping up to 10 furlongs for the first time.Kempton 2.25:Jax Junioris progressing rapidly and has several pounds in hand of this field.Newcastle 2.43:It is still early days forDom Of Maryat the James Owen yard and this extreme test of stamina could bring the best out of him.Kempton 3.00:Double Measureposted a useful time when successful at Huntingdon and looks ready for Grade Two company.Explore more on these topicsConstitution HillTalking HorsesHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

Behind them, Bobby’s bar is bustling and above the club logo on a wall behind one of the goals are four unmissable words: “If I can dream …” Helping to manifest that dream is the shiny Women’s FA Cup trophy, temporarily on display in the boardroom. The group of players who have just finished a day’s work are about to begin their training session at 8.30pm.Chatham Town Women, the lowest-ranked side in the fifth round of the Women’s FA Cup and one of only two sides remaining from below the second tier, are preparing for the game of their lives, against big-spending Birmingham City at St Andrew’s on Saturday, live on television, vying for a place in the quarter-finals. Chatham cover their players’ expenses but do not pay football salaries, unlike their full-time opponents.Controversial Women’s FA Cup plans on hold after pushback from clubs, players and fansRead moreChatham, who play in the fourth tier, entered the competition in the third qualifying round in September and have won five ties, two on penalties away to third-tier opponents, AFC Wimbledon and Exeter City.The run has earned the Kent club £107,000 in prize money and they will get another £20,000 if they lose on Saturday, or £80,000 if they can stun Birmingham. Chatham’s manager, Keith Boanas, estimates that the £107,000 “sustains and helps build the women’s game here for at least the next two to three years”.The prize pot is vastly different from the £5,000 reward that went to the Cup winners in 2005 when Boanas managed Charlton to glory. He led the club to the final four times between 2003 and 2007, including three in a row that culminated with their victory, when an 18-year-old Eni Aluko’s goal gave a Charlton side that also included the Canada head coach, Casey Stoney, and the club’s current manager, Karen Hills, a 1-0 win over Everton.View image in fullscreenChatham Town have two training nights a week and do not pay their players. Saturday’s opponents are full-time footballers.Photograph: Rachel O’Sulllivan/The GuardianBoanas’s assistant that day at Upton Park was Matt Beard, the former Liverpool, Chelsea and West Ham manager who died last September at the age of 47. It is clear Beard has been in Boanas’s thoughts through this Cup run.“I do look to the side of me when I’m on the touchlines sometimes – I feel him there,” says a visibly emotional Boanas, before taking a deep breath and having to pause his answer. He later says: “When we won with Charlton, I collapsed on my knees and looked up, at that time, to my mum. This time, if we win on Saturday, I’d say: ‘Cheers, Beardy.’”The duo were great friends and what Boanas and Beard achieved together has granted Boanas the deep respect of his squad. Chatham’s former England youth defender Ellie Perkins, who had a spell at Arsenal, says of Boanas: “He’s so full of wisdom, expertise, experience, and I think everyone here just absorbs that from him. Everything he says, take it on board, because he’s been there and done it. So we get behind every decision he makes.”Quick GuideSkinner delighted Cup overhaul on holdShowThe Manchester United head coach, Marc Skinner, said it was \"great news\" that the Football Association hasput the brakes on plansto make radical changes to the Women's FA Cup, such as seeding the top teams. He thinks big teams going head-to-head in earlier rounds is good for the competition.United travel to face the holders, Chelsea, in the fifth round on Sunday, a repeat of last year's final. The tie that would not have been possible  next season before the semi-finals under proposals put forward by the Football Association, which were due to go to the FA board in April. But the Guardian revealed on Thursday that the FA, after receiving negative feedback, has extended the consultation period and there will be no changes to the format until at least 2027-28.“Great news, great news,\" Skinner said. \"We play one of the best teams in English history on Sunday in an early round, but that’s the draw, that’s the beauty of the game. I watch competitions because there’s an element of luck. For us to play Chelsea is rough luck but it’s part of the game and it allows the beauty of the Cup.”An FA spokesperson told the Guardian: “While we will continue to review the Women’s FA Cup and the ways it can evolve, we have listened to the feedback and no changes will be implemented for the 2026-27 season. We understand how much the competition means to clubs, players and fans across the pyramid, and it is important that all parties have enough time to share their views. As a result, we will be extending the consultation phase to allow for further engagement informed by the questions and comments raised.”Tom GarryWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Perkins, who works as an estate agent, says Chatham will try to keep everything as “normal as possible” this week. “We’re anticipating them being that bit more athletic, that bit faster, that bit stronger than us, just because they have the facility to do this as a day job,” she says of Birmingham. “For us it’s a case of doing your nine-to-five through the week, getting home from work quickly, getting your Chatham clothes on, having a quick dinner and getting straight back in the car to go to training. So we’ve got to try and do what we can from the mental and technical side of the game.”There have been many heroines during this Cup run, such as the midfielder Elle Jeffkins, who has scored from outside the box four times, and the goalkeeper Simone Eligon, a Trinidad and Tobago international, who has made shootout saves. In the league, they are mixing it with bigger-name clubs such as Fulham and Norwich towards the top of the Women’s National League Division One South East and sit fourth.View image in fullscreenChatham Town’s co-captain Grace Coombs says the Cup run has brought the players closer together.Photograph: Rachel O’Sulllivan/The GuardianThe co-captain Grace Coombs says of the Cup run: “It’s brought us closer together every single game. Our [fourth-round] win here was absolutely amazing – that feeling was probably one of the best feelings of the girls’ careers.”Coombs, who works in project management for the NHS, says: “My job is not as physical as a lot of the other players’ are, and I don’t have a long commute or a long route to training compared to some of the others, who have it a lot harder than me. We have two training nights a week and then we get ourselves to the gym and do workouts around our work schedule. We’ve got great resources here that we can tap into but it’s in our own time around our schedules. You make it work because you love it.”About 200 fans are expected to travel to Birmingham for a game shown on TNT Sports 1 & discovery+. It would have been significantly more but for the men’s team having a home fixture on the same day. The excitement around this community club, sandwiched between Rochester and Gillingham, the town whose name this team carried until a rebrand in 2023, is clear. Before training the players gather excitedly for selfies with the trophy, while the staff lay out the cones on one half of the pitch, with the men’s team training in the other half.Boanas’s wife, the former England goalkeeper Pauline Cope-Boanas, a police officer, has been helping with goalkeeper coaching when time allows. Her husband, 66, is juggling an extensive list of other football roles on top of managing Chatham, including coaching boys via a Millwall community project, coaching the England colleges national side and the English Universities women’s side (both voluntarily), tutoring coaches doing their Uefa B and C licences and being president of the Surrey Football Coaches Association. “I should be retired,” he says, chuckling.View image in fullscreenKeith Boanas holds a variety of coaching roles in addition to managing Chatham.Photograph: Rachel O’Sulllivan/The GuardianHe has taken charge of the Estonia women’s national side and clubs such as Watford and Millwall Lionesses and he says this run with Chatham makes him almost as proud as winning the Cup with Charlton.“Even getting this far has come really close to that,” he says. “I mean that, genuinely. I was a little bit unwell a couple of weeks ago because I had kidney stones. I think if we win on Saturday, you’ll probably need the ambulance at St Andrew’s to come and pick me up off the pitch for different reasons.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was a nice fella but I just don’t think, for Liverpool, he’s got that aura about him.

I think the more a manager wins, the more aura he has. I don’t know if you agree with Wayne Rooney, by the way, but if this would be the general opinion then I think people would probably tell you last season I had more aura than this season.“But maybe he’s the only one who has this opinion; I don’t know, you tell me. It’s the first time that I heard this but I think it’s fair to say that Jürgen definitely has an aura. I can talk about him, not about myself, but he definitely had that. But a winning manager has an aura as well.”In the reverse fixture three months ago against Forest, then managed by Sean Dyche, Liverpool lost 3-0. At the City Ground Slot will come up against Forest’s fourth head coach of the season, Vítor Pereira. Dyche’s strained relationship with Forest’s players was a key factor in costing him his job, indicating where the balance of power is in the modern game.“I like to do what I’m doing now and that’s enough for me,” Slot said. “It doesn’t matter who’s the most important person or not at the club. I think it’s always the owners, isn’t it? They have to hire the sporting director, they have to hire the head coach. If they make the right decisions then it’s a better chance to be successful.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotWayne RooneynewsShareReuse this content"

He set a time of 1min 31.992sec, eight-tenths clear of the second-placed McLaren of Lando Norris and a second up on Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Mercedes’George Russell.Domenicali pleads for calm over fears new rules will wreck Formula OneRead moreNonetheless, Russell and Mercedes will head to Australia with no little confidence, having been consistently quick across all three tests, and Russell remains the early favourite. He felt there was more to come but remained wary of the threat from Red Bull, McLaren and in particular the blistering paceFerrarihave demonstrated in practice starts.“The car’s feeling good. The new power units are feeling fast,” he said. “We’re making improvements every single day. However, we need to keep on improving the reliability. I think we’ve got a lot of potential beneath us.”What was striking by the close of the last test was how quick theFerraris of Lewis Hamiltonand Leclerc were off the line as the FIA trialled a new race start procedure. Russell by comparison has been sluggish and he said it was an area he and Mercedes would have to address.“To win a race, you’ve also got to get off the line quite well,” he said. “Two starts I’ve made this week were worse than my worst ever start inFormula One. And Lewis down in P11 got into P1. So at this stage I don’t think it matters how quick you are. The thing that’s going to trip you up is going to be that tallest hurdle. And that’s what we’re trying to get our heads around right now. We’re stumbling on some at the moment.”Aston Martin ended what has been a hugely disappointing pre-season at a low point. With the designer Adrian Newey at the helm this season, optimism was high but the team have endured a harsh wake-up call. They were late completing their car,missing the opening of the first test, and have struggled with a litany of problems restricting their running time.On Thursday Fernando Alonso lost three hours of running after a battery problem and on the final day in Bahrain there were more difficulties. Their engine manufacturer, Honda, was forced to concede it had worked through so many parts it had in effect run out by Friday and the team could run only very short stints with half-hour breaks in between. They completed just six laps and called a halt over two hours before the end of the final session.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Formula OneMotor sportFerrariCharles LeclercGeorge RussellMercedes GPnewsShareReuse this content"

Parish is believed to have been disappointed with Glasner’s reaction in Friday’s press conference to preview Sunday’s home game against Wolves when the 51-year-old said he was unsure whether he would see out the season.However, Parish has decided against making an immediate change given the importance of the match against the Premier League’s bottom side with Palace still not clear of relegation trouble and the second leg of their Conference League playoff to come on Thursday.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Another issue is believed to be their reluctance to pay off the remainder of his contract, which is thought to be worth nearly £2m and expires at the end of the season, should he depart early. It remains to be seen whether Glasner – who said “maybe I would sing the same” when asked about fans chanting “you’re getting sacked in the morning” in Bosnia and Herzegovina – sees out the campaign given the animosity towards him after a run of one win in 15 games in all competitions.“Let’s see what the future brings,” he said on Friday. “You never know. I’m always realistic and we’re not in the best moment. I understand and I take responsibility for everything because I’m responsible for the whole team.“Right now, I’m just not good enough to replace the players we sold. I’m just not good enough to integrate the new players in a way to play the same way like we did and I’m not good enough that we can cope with the schedule we had.”Glasner, who ledPalace to the FA Cup last season, their first major trophy, and secured the Community Shield, said: “It’s my responsibility to get the turnaround. I can’t expect [positivity] from the players if I’m not that way. But right now I just can’t do it because it’s how I feel.”Thomas Frank, sacked by Tottenhamlast week, is believed to be a contender to take over in the summer. Palace would also be interested in Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola, whose contract expires at end of June. The former Republic of Ireland forward Robbie Keane, who is managing Ferencvaros, and Rayo Vallecano’s Iñigo Pérez have also been mooted as potential replacements.Palace have been given a £50,000 fine for a banner that appeared in the crowd at Selhurst Park in August, depicting the owner of Nottingham Forest, Evangelos Marinakis.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

But in a fast-changing media landscape, this solves two problems at onceKirsty MajorFri 20 Feb 2026 07.15 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 14.46 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleLast year,No 10 took an unprecedented step: it invited content creators to cross the threshold of Downing Street.Naturally, the creators all filmed themselves outside the famous door. Once inside, their most treasured possessions, their phones, were taken from them and exchanged for government-approved devices, so they could continue to take photos and record video without breaching security guidelines. At the reception, creators from areas as wide as science, education and travel took part in a networking session at the heart of government.This was one ofa number of eventsin 2025. There were also off-the-record breakfasts to talk about how creators might collaborate with the government to reach new and younger audiences. A large part of the work being done by No 10’sNew Media Unitwas aimed at working with financial education creators to help share new policies being launched by the Treasury.Financial content creators were invited to speeches and briefings for the biggest political events of the year. WhenAnna Brading, a personal finance content creator, entered the No 10 briefing room for the spring statement, she could hardly believe it. Having three kids at a young age meant that she spent her time raising a family and making ends meet by tutoring maths on the side. As she managed her family’s money, she began posting tips online for other mums. Now she was in the room that public health experts had updated the public from during the pandemic. “The day I walked in that room, I had to take a minute,” she says.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThere was, of course, a backlash as some journalists felt that these creators didn’t have the expertise or clout to hold the government to account, but this may be one of the few areas in which No 10 is getting it right. The unit is attempting to address two unavoidable truths: one,people don’t trust politicians; two, more people are now getting their news fromcontent platforms. Usinghighly trustedcontent creators to share news of policies addresses both of these issues at once.Financial educator Rotimi Merriman-Johnson, known asMr MoneyJar,has recorded videos for policies such as changes to the minimum wage for young people. He began making content before training as a financial adviser, and is keen to emphasise that it’s not just about relaying any old information. It’s about consistently sharing quality information that makes a difference to people’s pockets. “Every additional year you spend as a content creator, you become more trusted … It’s not just about the information, it’s about the person sharing the information.”Political journalists, known as lobby journalists, have been permitted to work in parliament since the 1870s, sit in the press gallery watching the Commons floor, and receive briefings from the prime minister’s communication staff. The walls of the room where these briefings happen are lined with now-defunct telephone booths designed to allow reporters to file their copy down the phone. Desks in the members’ lobby, the room in which MPs gather before entering the Commons chamber, are pitted with now-dry ink wells. The bowels of Westminster are knotted with internet cables that sit – quite precariously – on top of old steam pipes. Inviting creators into the heart of government is yet another iteration of British politics and its institutions responding to technological innovation.Since their introduction more than 20 years ago, social media sites have evolved into “content platforms”. Once, Myspace, Facebook et al were spaces to connect with friends; with the advent of Instagram, they became places to follow lifestyle “influencers”; now they are platforms that host a never-ending stream of “content”. Some of the best creators lean hard into specialisms and niches, and present themselves as experts in specific areas. According to Diane Banks, the chief executive of talent management agency Northbank Talent: “We are in the age of the expert content creator.”In many ways, these expert creators are the perfect interlocutors for the Starmer government: they are technocratic and emphatically apolitical. As creatorCameron Smithsays: “When I go into these rooms I’m representing my audience’s interests, not the interests of these political parties.” In fact, being non-ideological is integral to the business model. Talent management agencies shy away from polemicists as they are difficult to monetise. Brands don’t like to work with opinions. In this sense, the UK is treading a different path from the US, as the White House has seen an exodus of mainstream reporters who are being replaced by regime-friendly influencers and commentators.Of course, the creators acknowledge the tension between pushing politicians on issues their audiences may be facing and needing to maintain access. This is especially pressing at a time when so many people feel knots tighten in their stomachs whenever they check their bank balances. There are more than a dozen major news publications in the UK, but millions of individual creators. It’s hard for a government to ignore – to pick an example out of nowhere – the Guardian for long, but easy to cast aside a creator who isn’t playing ball.CreatorMat Gaysays: “It’s a difficult question because while I would love to push a bit harder and talk a little bit more about the things that people are worrying about, to me it’s more important to just get them to the table.”Gabriel Nussbaumbelieves things are shifting. “They were a little bit rigid at the start,” he says. “They said: ‘Can you submit five questions that you’d want to ask Rachel Reeves?’, for example. And then they’d come back and say: ‘Do you mind not asking question four and five?’” But now, he finds he is given the freedom to question politicians. A government spokesperson said: “We are engaging with content creators, as well as journalists to reach new audiences, ensure we are held to account in a changing media landscape and keep the public better informed about government policies.”Talking to these creators, I get the sense that they’re diligent and dutiful to their audiences, focused on the policy rather than the politics. Rather than political journalists, they seem to have more in common with themost trusted man in Britain, Martin Lewis, a former consumer-affairs journalist turned consumer-rights champion. Lewis has managed to make a career of teaching people how to work the system, and when to intervene so that the system works for them. I am sure content creators will figure that out too.Kirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionSocial mediaDigital mediaEconomic policyBudgetConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Without a united front the left may splinter and loseFri 20 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 08.17 ESTShareYou don’t have to be in Gorton and Denton for long to know thatnext week’s byelectionreally matters. If Labour wins in what has been an over-50% solid red-voting area since the second world war, that will calm nerves on its febrile back (and front) benches. If Labour loses, heavy blame will fall on Keir Starmer for fixing the party’s ruling NECto bar Andy Burnham’s selection, ensuring he couldn’t challenge for the leadership without a Westminster seat.Few doubt the popular Greater Manchester mayor would have won next week in Gorton and Denton on his home patch. Blocking him is widely seen as grubby Westminster politicking that has weakened, not strengthened, Starmer’s grip on the leadership. For many erstwhile supporters that jiggery-pokery was a turning point, as Starmer seemed willing to riskReform UKscoring another win in order to stop Burnham, though “stop Farage” has to be Labour’s overwhelming priority.The field is a three-way split betweenLabour, Reform and the Greens, and each can make a good case as to why they will win. There is plainly a strong anti-Reform majority in an area that has been Labour for more than 80 years, but how is anyone to know which is the best anti-Reform vote to cast?Greens and Labour fight it out fiercely here, each accusing the other of dirty tactics, of uprooting each other’s posters from front gardens and worse. A mass of canvassers has descended. A journalist arriving, as did I, can, as ever, take their pick of doorstep vox pops and shape a conclusion to suit any proposition. The truth is that I am none the wiser about the result after spending time here; my crystal ball is murky. Professional pollsters say the same thing: Patrick English of YouGov says it all depends on whether either Labour or the Greens can unite the “beat Reform” vote. The venerable pollster Peter Kellner says: “If Reform get 40% they will be hard to defeat, but if they get 30-35% they can be beaten if voters have a clear signal as to who is best placed to overtake them.” Good polling could be vital, he says. But there is none in sight. Without it, if anti-Reform votes split, then he says “first past the post will deliver a Reform victory”.Minds may be concentrated sharply this weekend when the white supremacists of Britain First hold what threatens to be a large “march for remigration” in the centre of Manchester, challenged by Stand up to Racism and others. Resisting the far right, kin to Nigel Farage’s crew, must surely be the prime focus for all on the left, setting aside their smaller differences. Reform’s candidate, the GB News presenter Matt Goodwin,has claimedUK-born people from minority ethnic backgrounds are not necessarily British.He has also said: “We need to dramatically lower, if not stop, migration into the UK from predominantly Islamic nations.”More than 40% of votershere are from an ethnic minority.From my vox pops, I can quote a former Labour voter on the doorstep who says: “Everything has to change from top to bottom.” He doesn’t quite say it, but “change” is now the Farage trope. Or there’s a woman dithering, after longtime voting Labour. “Nothing’s going well, is it?” she says. Then she nods to the sound of Labour achievements – breakfast clubs, local bus fares capped at £2, NHS waiting times falling, the move to curtail zero-hours jobs, living wage rising and more. Then she looks at a leaflet of Farage, declaring: “Not that smile; he has to be stopped!” She likes Burnham. She will probably back Labour.Burnham is everywhere most days: at events, door-knocking, recording TikToks, “the most loyal of foot-soldiers”, his team says. You look at him for the eye-roll: he would be less than human if deep within there wasn’t a schadenfreude wish for a loss here to serve Starmer right. But he’s ultra-visible in backingAngeliki Stogia, the good local candidate, whom he knows well as a local councillor. Sometimes people tell him they won’t vote Labour because he was blocked from running. “Please, please don’t do that!” he begs them, raising the threat of Farage, reminding them that nearby Runcorn was lost to Reform at the recent byelection by just six votes. “Keeping Farage out means voting Labour,” he says. He talks of national policies, what Labour got wrong on disability benefits and winter fuel allowance, of the need for electoral reform, Lords reform, and a new economic direction. He talks, they listen.Can he tilt for the leadership one day? Can he win it? My crystal ball is murky as ever. But primed to go, you see him standing “in the slips, straining upon the start”,as Shakespeare might have it, ready with plans to govern, and like so many others, deeply frustrated by the missteps that have cast Labour so low in so short a time.Next Thursday, Gorton and Denton won’t just yield a result – it will also reveal the shape of the battle to come.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsByelectionsOpinionLabourReform UKGreen partyAndy BurnhamFar rightcommentShareReuse this content"

So why did the rest of the world fail to stop them?Husam MahjoubWestern governments have put elite bargains before civilian lives. If El Fasher is to mean anything, this approach must changeFri 20 Feb 2026 08.45 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 09.01 ESTShareThe latest report from the UN independent fact-finding mission on the fall of El Fasher in Sudan reads like a postmortem of a preventable tragedy. The report details what it calls the “hallmarks of genocide”: mass killings, systematic sexual violence and ethnic cleansing targeting non-Arab communities by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).The atrocities in El Fasher should have surprised no one in the international community. Western governments were warned repeatedly by civil society, humanitarian organisations, investigative journalists and their own agencies. In Britain, awhistleblowerlast year accused the Foreign Office of censoring internal warnings about imminent genocide. The US state department and members of the UN security council receivedcontinuous reportingfrom the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab documenting the RSF’s military buildup and preparations to overrun the city. SeniorUS officials warnedthe Biden administration that El Fasher was at imminent risk. A security council resolution in 2024 called for an end to the siege. None of this prevented the city from being strangled.The clearest expression of the failure to act on information emerged in October 2025, when Washington hosted talks involving officials from the Sudanese government and the RSF. Just days after those discussions, the RSFcaptured El Fasherand began the massacres the UN has now documented. These talks did not prevent catastrophe. They provided political cover while it unfolded. The subsequentcalls for a trucewere issued without any acknowledgment of why they failed to prevent the assault.The silence reflects a hierarchy of priorities. Strategic relationships with theUnited Arab Emirates(UAE) have been placed above civilian protection in Sudan.Multiple investigations, includingleaked UN expert reports, have raised serious concerns about the UAE’s role in sustaining the RSF through arms transfers, logistics networks and financial pipelines. When supply routes through Libya and Chad became widely exposed, alternative corridors reportedly emerged via Somalia’sPuntlandandEthiopia. Advanced weaponry, drones and foreign mercenaries further strengthened the RSF. At the very moment the Sudanese armed forces had retaken Khartoum, Gezira province and Sennar, creating a narrow but real opportunity for de-escalation, the UAE’s support for the RSF intensified.Yet western governments continue to treat Abu Dhabi as a mediator. The “Sudan quartet”, bringing together the US, UK, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, presents itself as a diplomatic mechanism for peace. In practice, it institutionalises contradiction. When a state widely accused of arming one of the belligerents is seated as a broker, mediation becomes theatre and engagement replaces accountability.A widening rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE has turned Sudan into a proxy arena of Red Sea competition. Riyadh frames the conflict through state authority and regional stability; Abu Dhabi has pursued an assertive strategy anchored in ports, gold and militia patronage. Rather than confront this divergence, Washington and London have chosen equilibrium, careful not to alienate either Gulf ally.That caution has translated into conspicuous silence. At theMunich security conferencelast week and in front of theUN security council, the UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, expressed concern for Sudanese civilians and for women subjected to sexual violence. Yet she didn’t acknowledge claims that the UAE was the principal external supporter of the RSF, instead asserting that “a dozen states” were involved in arms transfers. The effect was to diffuse responsibility precisely at the moment clarity was required.Donald Trump’s adviser, Massad Boulos, followed the same script. In hissecurity council briefingyesterday, he avoided addressing the documented scale of Emirati support and instead focused on the threat posed by Islamists and remnants of the former regime within the Sudanese army. Those concerns may be politically convenient, but they do not explain the RSF’s campaign in Darfur.With this evasive strategy, alliances are protected but civilians are not. The result is paralysis dressed up as diplomacy.International humanitarian law is at risk – but it still carries weight | Kenneth RothRead moreWestern officials routinely invoke accountability while remaining adrift in their attempts to operationalise it. The liberal peace-building model that privileges armed actors and elite bargains has already failed Sudan. It treats generals and militia leaders as indispensable stakeholders and relegates civilians to observers. By treating the RSF as a legitimate political interlocutor rather than what it is, an armed organisation implicated in mass atrocities and sustained by foreign patronage, the international community validates violence as a pathway to recognition. If El Fasher is to mean anything, this approach must change.First, fund the people keeping Sudan alive. Channel resources directly to Sudanese civilian networks such as resistance committees, emergency response rooms, and the medical and food lifelines operating outside both armed camps.Second, name the parties to the war. The US, the UK and the UN must explicitly acknowledge the UAE’s role in sustaining the RSF and treat it as a belligerent, not a broker. This means sanctions not only on individuals but on the companies, financial channels and transport routes implicated in arms transfers and logistics to the RSF.Third, establish real accountability. Any ceasefire or political track that lacks independent monitoring, enforceable civilian protection and automatic consequences for violations will merely provide cover for rearmament.Peace cannot be built on the same elite bargains that have repeatedly collapsed. Without confronting the external enablers of this war, diplomacy becomes theatre and accountability a slogan. El Fasher has already exposed the cost of that illusion.Husam Mahjoub is co-founder of Sudan Bukra, an independent non-profit Sudanese TV channelDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s not just about moneyChristopher MarquisIn a university ecosystem that breeds hunger for status, Epstein made scholars feel like celebritiesFri 20 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 14.21 ESTShareTheJeffrey Epsteinstory is often told as the intersection of two obsessions: sexual abuse and money. The recently released emails certainly contain significant evidence of both. But after more than two decades as a professor at Harvard, Cornell and Cambridge, I am most struck by the limitation of that frame – in part because it fails to explain why academics show up so consistently in these files.Certainly, money played a role in Epstein’s university connections. A rich man using donations and access to burnish his ego and legitimacy is a well-worn script, from Andrew Carnegie’s libraries more than a century ago toBill Gates’s more recent global health philanthropy. As a college drop-out, Epstein clearly craved “respect” from high-profile academics. Universities, meanwhile, are perpetually fundraising and institutions that rely on donations often avoid asking hard questions about where the money came from. As the Bard College president, Leon Botstein,put itwhen defending his Epstein connections: “Among the very rich is a higher percentage of unpleasant and not very attractive people.” Institutions sometimes learn to stop asking hard questions about where the money came from.Some professors also seemed drawn to the louche lifestyle. Duke’s Dan Ariely, for example,asksEpstein for contact information for a “redhead” who had been with him. The Yale computer science professor David Gelernterdescribessomeone he apparently recommended for a job as a “v small goodlooking blonde”. Stanford’s Nathan Wolfeinvited Epsteinto dinner with “a couple of hottie interns”. The connection to universities populated by young women was no doubt another draw for Epstein. (Ariely,GelernterandWolfehave all denied wrongdoing.)But the emails suggest something deeper than greed or libido. Epstein’s malevolent genius was understanding personal and professional vulnerabilities – and then offering a bundle of bespoke and non-monetary rewards, such asaccess to companiesanddeals for the investorsin his network,inside scoops for journalistsandprivate banking relationshipsfor executives. Molly Jong-Fasthas saidthat Epstein built his influence by “acting as a kind of superconcierge”.Most academics spend their careers inside the ivory tower – a world set apart from everyday commerce and politics, organized around research and teaching, with its own norms, hierarchies and insulated debates. That separation brings freedom, but it also breeds a unique hunger for status that travels outside the campus gates. Even the most successful professors are usually not powerful in the way power is understood in the “real world”. Their prestige exists only in narrow circles and is mostly legible only to other specialists.While universities love to celebrate “impact”, they often starve the conditions that produce it. The result is a constant craving for recognition that feels immediate and personal. Epstein supplied this attention, plus connections with elites in finance, entertainment, technology and government. He made scholars feel like celebrities for the one thing they are trained to prize, but for which they are frequently denigrated in America: their minds.Even at the top, academic life is full of quiet humiliations that wear people down: anonymous reviewers, rejected grants, students who care more about social media than classwork, committee work, institutional politics that drains more than just time. You can see this in how university departments obsess over minor expenses. Senior professors are boxed in by per diem caps, and required to furnish receipts for minor purchases; there are pre-approval forms and bureaucratic rules that turn routine travel into petty bargaining. You can hold an endowed chair and still waste time arguing with an administrator about whether the hotel cost was “reasonable”.Epstein understood the psychological power of bypassing that grind.One emailarranging a visit for the Harvard professor Martin Nowak includes an offer of “use of an available apartment … as well as the Jaguar”. He understood the social capital he would receive in return for providing shortcuts around the constant and myriad indignities of life in academia.Epstein was not ostracised for his crimes. To some powerful men, he became even more appealing | Moira DoneganRead moreBut Epstein’s power over academics was not a strange exception. The uncomfortable conclusion is that he had a rare ability to pinpoint what people needed or wanted and exploit it. His private plane, nicknamed the “Lolita Express” , sits at the center of many of his controversies, but as the journalist Michael Wolff, whoseemail exchanges with Epsteinhave been widely reported, has suggested, using it was less about travel than about creating a hard class boundary between those who can fly private and those who can’t. The status is what is important. HesummarizesEpstein’s perspective: “Nobody turns down an invitation to fly private.”To understand how Epstein accumulated the wealth and influence that enabled his predation of young women and children, we have to look beyond sex and money. For the Epstein class, what’s truly valued is what money can’t buy directly: deference, access and moral permission.Universities and academics like me need to face a hard truth about our own desires. The job is supposed to be about ideas, teaching and public knowledge. Epstein offered something else: prestige without peer review, and attention without consequence. Too many people – even those who were not involved directly in exploitation – took the deal because it was easy to do and because it felt good.Christopher Marquis is theSinyi professor of management at the University of Cambridge and author of The Profiteers: How Business Privatizes Profits and Socializes CostsExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Systemic failures to protect innocents and hold people accountable are adding even more fuel to the fireFri 20 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 09.02 ESTShareNot so long ago, if you said there was a shadowy cabal of elites who were involved in the sex trafficking of young women and girls and that some of the most famous people in the world were allegedly involved, then you would have been dismissed as a conspiracy theorist.On a certain level, it feels psychologically safe to “other” people who have conspiracy theories – Jon Ronson even wrote a book called Them about extremists and conspiracy theorists.Conspiracies were for people who needed a coherent story in order to make sense of all the bad things in the world. They were for people who could not handle chaos and desired a neat narrative, the way children like a bedtime story.The Epstein files reveal that a vast global conspiracy actually exists – sort ofRead moreHaving worked in the media and politics – two areas often accused of being in on the conspiracy – what I saw instead were people just trying to get through each day and get the basics of their job done, rather than being players in some shadowy network that operated according to hidden rules. People who worked in newsrooms were too disorganised to be part of a global plot! They were too busy trying to get a paper out.There are many unsettling and vile elements to the Epstein story, which has now seenformer Prince Andrew arrestedin the UK on suspicion of misconduct in public office, but one of the most unnerving is that conspiracy theorists may be on to something with this one.For years, the broad outlines of what Epstein was doing were available to anyone who cared to look. Journalists had reported on it. Survivors had spoken. And yet the story kept not quite landing, kept being filed away in the part of the brain marked too strange, too vast, too much like something a paranoid person would believe.The powerful men in his orbit, the politicians, the financiers, the scientists, the royals, remained largely in their positions, collecting their awards. We let them, in part because the alternative required believing something that felt, to reasonable people, unreasonable.This is the epistemological trap the Epstein case springs on the rationalist.We tend to think of conspiratorial thinking as a failure of critical intelligence, the category error of people who see patterns where there are none, who mistake coincidence for coordination, who are drawn to the narrative satisfaction of a hidden hand pulling strings. And mostly conspiracy theories are wrong. The moon landing happened. Covid is real.But here, the systems designed to hold people accountable and protect the vulnerable failed. Big media organisations had the story and didn’t run it.Prosecutors initially gave Epstein a sweetheart deal. And a team of lawyers enforcing strict NDAs meant those in his orbit could not speak out.Epstein himself “threatened harm to victims and helped release damaging stories about them to damage their credibility when they tried to go public with their stories of being trafficked and sexually abused”,according to a report in the files. Epstein also instructed that evidence be destroyed.Even now, the powerful are protected through the US Department of Justice’s extensive redactions of the Epstein files, whichaccording to membersof US Congress who have seen the files, include the name of six powerful men.These are not the far-fetched claims on a QAnon message board. They are institutions that rationalists, implicitly, trust.What is emerging from the Epstein files does look like a conspiracy.When we accept the existence of a conspiracy like this, it opens the possibility for more conspiracies just like it, hiding in plain sight - just like the Epstein case, and before that in the UK, the Jimmy Savile case.This will further weaken trust in institutions, the media and government.Already this age is marked by a departure from the rational. Astrology is huge among young people, trust in science is waning and old diseases like measles are coming back due to a decline in people getting vaccinated.Conspiracy theories feed on distrust and extend it into a worldview where official explanations are automatically suspect.With the Epstein files proving conspiracy correct, expect conspiracy theorists to become emboldened and their numbers increase. It’s a time-honoured way of trying to find order in the chaos.Brigid Delaney is the author of the philosophical novelThe Seeker and the Sage(Allen and Unwin)Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

At 16, Kemi Badenoch wasflipping burgers and cleaning toiletsin McDonald’s. Me, I waitressed at weekends from the age of 15 in an Essex pub owned by an ex-paratrooper with two formidable rottweilers roaming behind the bar, which was a life lesson all of its own.But whatever your first job may have been, there’s a reasonable chance it combined the thrill of hard cash with several mortifying mistakes and a crash course in handling stroppy customers, taking criticism more or less gracefully and moaning about it only out of earshot. Though teenage starter jobshave been in decline for decades– for reasons varying from academic pressures on sixth-formers to the rise of side hustles on Vinted that don’t show up in official statistics – everyone still has to start somewhere, even if it’s now more likely at 18 than 14. But getting that start is becoming harder than it was.This week, unemployment rates for 18- to 24-year-oldshit a highnot seen outside the pandemic since 2015. School leavers are now competing for work stacking shelves or pulling pints with overqualified new graduates who can’t find graduate jobs, at a time when pubs, shops and cafes don’t seem to be hiring. Even those employers strong enough to have survived lockdown routinely complain that it’s getting too expensive to hire staff – especially young ones.Ministers may slow youth minimum wage rise amid UK unemployment fearsRead moreThe Centre for Policy Studies thinktank calculates that itwill cost 26% moreto hire an 18- to 20-year-old by this spring than it did in 2024. That reflects government decisions taken for perfectly good reasons, including hiking employers’ national insurance to fund the NHS, plustwo chunky rises to the minimum wagefor the under-20s (now £10 an hour) in line with manifesto promises to level it up with the higher adult rate (now £12.21) over the course of a parliament. No matter how noble the motive, once it costs the same to hire four teenage Starmers as it once did to hire five,there are likely to be consequences. Yet until this week, when an internal Labour argument about whether they could be inadvertently pricing young people out of work spilled on to newspaper front pages, political debate over why so many young people don’t have jobs has mostly involved blaming them for being anxious snowflakes. Injury, meet insult.So in some ways it was refreshing to hear the former minister Alan Milburn, charged with reviewingwhy record numbers of 16- to 24-year-oldsare neither earning or learning,finally concede this week that this complex puzzle isn’t simply explained by a teenage mental health crisis. Anxiety, ADHD and autism diagnoses are rising worldwide,he told the BBC, but elsewhere that doesn’t seem to be driving teenagers out of work: our rates of young people not in education, employment or training (Neet) are treble those of the Netherlands. (Incidentally, Dutch teenagers have asignificantly lower minimum wagethan Dutch adults.) His review is nowconsidering economic factors. At least everyone can now be honest about what may or may not be going on.Our young people aren’t shirkers or snowflakes - they were failed by government policy.

The politics of watering down a manifesto pledge on the youth minimum wage would be hideous, and not just because it would be the latest in apainful run of U-turns.Dumping or delaying it would put Starmer in direct conflict not only with trade unions but with Angela Rayner, a more formidable political organiser than anyone in No 10.Give an inch on minimum wage, meanwhile, and the fear is that business will try to take a mile, pushing to delay the rollout of Rayner’s broader flagship package of workers’ rights until the economy is stronger.We have, of course, been around this block many times before. Every time new employment rights are introduced, employers claim they’ll cost jobs, and in a growing economy they often turn out to be crying wolf. But this time it’s not just the usual suspects howling.George Bain, who led the low pay commission that pushed through the original minimum wage against considerable corporate opposition,now believesa rising youth minimum wage is pushing up youth unemployment. I’ve heard the same from other veterans of the era. Gordon Brown, as chancellor, set a lower rate for the young precisely to encourage employers to take a risk on people needing first jobs. If you’re a pub landlord choosing between a gawky sixth former with no experience who will need closely supervising, and a seasoned 27-year-old with good references, who would you hire? Especially if the older one needs the job to pay their rent while the younger is mostly trying to save up for Reading festival tickets.For the lower rate also tacitly recognised that most under-20s aren’t wholly supporting themselves. Today, that’s if anything more true, with almost three-quarters of 19-year-olds and 61% of 20-year-oldsstill living with their parents, in homes where someone else probably fills the fridge. The vulnerable teenagers for whom that’s sadly not true, including those estranged from their families, meanwhile need the kind of intensive support that comes most reliably from in-work benefits.Almost 27 years on from its introduction, the minimum wage has drifted from its original purpose of ending exploitation. The idea was to create a decent floor from which people could rise into better jobs, helped by a booming economy: it was never the sole lever for raising living standards. But as successive governments struggled to reignite that boom, the minimum wage had to do more and more of the heavy lifting. There was always going to be a ceiling on how much employers could reasonably afford to pay, and now we may be hitting it.One cynical view of what’s happening is that the Treasury is privately prepared to see unemployment rise and some zombie businesses go to the wall in return for transitioning to a more productive hi-tech economy. If so, good luck selling that to a country that never voted for a re-run of the 1980s.But in the altogether less dramatic event that ministers conclude they’ve simply got the balance wrong for young people,as one minister hintedto the Times this week, then any tinkering is best done under cover of a broader rethink of how working poverty has changed since 1999. The worst option of all, meanwhile, would be to plough stubbornly on with something everyone worries might be making young people’s lives harder, just to avoid the embarrassment of admitting that for once your enemies might be right.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Can Labour come back from the brink?On Monday 30 April, ahead of May elections, join Gaby Hinsliff, Zoe Williams, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr as they discuss how much of a threat Labour faces from the Green party and Reform – and whether Keir Starmer can survive as leader of the Labour partyBook ticketshereExplore more on these topicsMinimum wageOpinionYoung peopleUnemploymentJob huntingKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The shock ofthe Greenland crisismay have faded from the headlines, but Donald Trump’s US has also suggested it may decide not to defend Europe. And Russia continues to be a nuisance in the Baltic Sea.Luckily, the vulnerable Baltic nations have launched an impressive string of initiatives to keep their mini-ocean safe. As the US sheds responsibility for Europe’s defence, these efforts could provide a model for the future of Nato itself.Finland announcedin January that it would team up with other Baltic Sea countries to create a maritime surveillance centre. Finland sees it as a way to increase capability and authority to intervene in “situations” in its territorial sea and exclusive economic zone. It’s a sensible measure.And it’s not the only one. Whenthe two Nord Stream pipelines explodedin the exclusive economic zones of Sweden and Denmark in September 2022,it took the region by complete surprise. To be sure, a few prophetic voices had been warning for years that undersea cables and pipelines were vulnerable to sabotage, but with virtually no suspicious incidents jeopardising this invaluable infrastructure, complacency set in. Then came thesabotage of Nord Stream, followed by the arrival of theRussian shadow fleet– designed to dodge oil sanctions – and the mysteriousrupture of two cablesand a pipeline in 2023.Whether or not Trump invades Greenland, this much is clear: the western order we once knew is history | Timothy Garton AshRead moreThe ocean’s coastal states – minus Russia – began cooperating more. As undersea cables continued to be mysteriously cut, threatening energy and internet provision, and shadow vessels traversed these waters on a daily basis, they began to improve information-sharing, a boring but essential measure. They launched anAI toolcalled Nordic Warden to detect anomalies above undersea cables and pipelines. Their navies and coastguards expanded maritime patrolling. They launched shadow-vessel inspections (a more difficult task than it sounds, because international maritime law grants all vessels freedom of navigation). Early last year, they even created ajoint maritime patrolling serviceto protect cables and pipelines day and night. AlthoughBaltic Sentry, as this patrol is called, is officially a Nato initiative, it’s executed by the Baltic Sea nations themselves.For Estonia, 2023 was a rude awakening, as Erkki Tori, the country’s national security adviser, told me. Now, in 2026, he says that Russia’s shadow fleet is being tackled not just in the Baltic Sea, but in other waters as well. Existing maritime law is a constraint but it does allow certain types of action, Tori insists. The exchange of ideas and practices with other countries is a vital part of the solution.The same approach – taking action within the limits of international law – goes for the protection of undersea cables and pipelines.“The international mechanisms that the world has were not built for things like this, but we’ve tried anyway – within the rule of law,” Tori says.The Baltic Sea nations appear to have inspired other countries. The French navyseizedan alleged Russian shadow tanker with false flag registration in the waters between Spain and Morocco in January. It was thesecond such interventionby France of a suspected shadow tanker in recent months.Indeed, the Baltic Sea nations are demonstrating what Nato’s member states can do, especially by teaming up with their neighbours. That matters now that the alliance’s ability to operate is being questioned. As the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen,concludedduring the height of the Greenland crisis, Nato would no longer exist if the US decided to attack the territory of another member country.Trump may decide to leave Greenland in peace for the time being (although Frederiksenis not too sanguine on that point, as she made clear at the Munich Security Conference). Even so, the question remains whether the US would support European countries in case of attack, as the Nato treaty’s mutual defence pledge,or article 5, requires. “If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them,” Trumpsaidlast March, referring to his European allies in Nato. A few months later, member statescommittedto spending 5% of GDP on defence and related areas.Ordinary Europeans have already drawn their own conclusions about how Nato must be reimagined for an era in which the US puts up less and less of the military capability. In Sweden, onlya quarterof the population believes the US would come to its aid in the case of an attack. Last June,51% of Britonsconsidered it unlikely that the US would come to the aid of the Baltic states in case of a Russian attack.That’s why initiatives such as the Baltic Sea nations’ maritime collaboration are so essential.Natomay survive or even thrive in the long term. Trump may abandon his confrontational stance. But nobody knows. Teaming up in smaller groups is imperative: it allows Nato countries to look after their own regions, without Nato and without the US. What’s more, it does no harm to the alliance.The localised cooperation we are seeing among the Baltic Sea nations is a taste of Nato’s future.Elisabeth Braw is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council thinktank.

Peace in the region rests on law and sovereignty, not ego and brinkmanshipFri 20 Feb 2026 12.52 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 14.46 ESTShareIn Gaza, aid still trickles in at levels relief agencies say are far below what is required. Temporary shelters are scarce. Reconstruction materials are restricted by Israel’s controls on goods entering the territory. Conditions, say the UN, remain “dire”. The violence has not stopped: Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed about 600 people since the ceasefire began. The announcement that the US wouldtransfer $10bnto President Donald Trump’s newly convened Board of Peace is hard to reconcile with the reality on the ground. Even worse is that Washington has paid only a fraction of its UN arrears – $160m against more than $4bn owed.This raises the obvious question: why is a private initiative being capitalised so heavily while existing UN mechanisms remain severely cash-strapped? Funnelling state funds into a body chaired by Mr Trump suggests foreign policy is serving private interests, not the public good. The board has ambitious plans. Rafah is to be rebuilt withinthree years with skyscrapers. Gaza is to becomeself-governingwithin a decade. An International Stabilisation Force isexpectedto begin deployment, eventually numbering 20,000 troops. These are dramatic claims. But their delivery is largely notional.Worryingly, there’s no clearlegal authoritydefining the board’s mandate. Last November’s UN security council resolution authorised the board solely for Gaza as a temporary,two-yeartransitional administration. Mr Trump – who holds veto power in the board and the authority to interpret its remit – thinks otherwise. He claims it canintervenein other global conflicts. The board is not embedded within existing UN structures, perhaps intentionally sidestepping the lengthy coalition-building with regional partners. If its objective is to generate headlines, then the board has succeeded. The question is whether the guardrails are keeping pace with the public relations.In a recent European Council on Foreign Relations paper,Muhammad Shehadaargues that the US’s top-down, externally designed economic model risks remaking Gaza as a tightly managed enclave – with Palestinians restricted to new heavily surveilledcompoundswhile the strip is dotted with residential towers,datacentresand seaside resorts. Mr Shehada is not wrong when he says Mr Trump’s plan poses a blunt question: is Gaza the home of its people – or a prize for outside powers and profiteers? Palestinians are not getting much of a say, yet the answer will shape their future.Gaza lies in ruins. What unfolded, many experts say, was agenocide. Yet Benjamin Netanyahu’s government claims the mission is unfinished and is signalling a newoffensiveif Hamas does not disarm – possibly before Israel’s election this year. This may fit the letter of the UN resolution, but it shreds its logic. Clearly, Palestinians must have a believable path to sovereignty. Hanging over all of this is the most unpredictable wild card: thethreatof US military action against Iran within days if negotiations fail. Tehran says American bases would be legitimate targets if it is attacked.Peace in Gaza requires regional calm, Israeli restraint, Palestinian legitimacy and institutional credibility. Yet the US – operating through personalised diplomacy – contemplates war against Iran because it won’t give up itsnuclear enrichment programmewhile encouragingRiyadhto adopt one. Any stable peace demands patience and predictability. Escalatory threats invite conflagration. In Gaza, that contradiction is already visible, and it is potentially explosive.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now artists need support to match itFri 20 Feb 2026 12.51 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 14.53 ESTShareThe granting of Grade II-listed building status to thebrutalist concrete Southbank Centre,comprising the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Hayward Gallery and Purcell Room, is a bold embrace by the government of this London landmark. It is also timely. Seventy-five years ago, the 1951 Festival of Britain transformed the South Bank. Of its buildings, only the Royal Festival Hall remains.From its postwar beginnings, the South Bank has grown into acultural landmarkrecognised far beyond London. The section of the Thames Path taking in the Southbank Centre, BFI cinemas, Royal National Theatre, Tate Modern and Shakespeare’s Globe is the flourishing successor to the Victorian precinct of the Kensington museums and the Royal Albert Hall. The festival was designed to help the nation to recover from the traumatic years of the second world war, and to look forward to a better future. This month’s decision to protect the 1960s component of the Southbank Centre is a vindication of that vision of hope.In architectural terms, the listing closes adecades-long argumentabout postwar Britain and what it chose to build. Previous recommendations to list the centre, which was completed in 1968, were rejected. Sir Denys Lasdun’s Royal National Theatre, built from similar concrete nearby, was listed more than 30 years ago. Unlike Lasdun’s theatre, the Southbank Centre – conceived by a London county council team led by Norman Engleback – divided opinion from the beginning. In 1967, the Daily Mail carried a headline asking “Is this Britain’s ugliest building?”While millions of people have been entertained by an extraordinary range of exhibitions and performances in its venues, it is fair to say that the centre’s grey, blocky appearance, maze of walkways and undercroft do not please everyone. For some, it isbleak and oppressive; for others, monumental and public. Brutalism’s uncompromising nature means that it is never likely to be universally liked. But the period in which its grandest edifices were regarded as blots to be erased is thankfully over.Catherine O’Flynnwrote a novel that was partially inspired by regret over the demolition of John Madin’s Birmingham Central Library. Adrien Brody won an Oscar last year for his performance as abrutalist architect. Public housing projects such as Ernö Goldfinger’s Trellick Tower in London and Park Hill in Sheffield now appear on tea towels andmugs.But while the Southbank Centre belongs to the same family, architecturally speaking, its purpose is different. And having taken the decision to conserve the buildings, ministers must ensure that they can work. Recent decades have seenseveral redevelopment schemesaimed at increasing commercial space, in order to improve the Southbank Centre’s finances and reduce its dependence on grants. Each has failed, with plans to move the riverside skatepark proving aparticular sticking-point.This decision draws a line under all this. Altering the site in future will be far more difficult. With conservation now a paramount concern, ministers must also back the artists and curators who keep the place alive. Its origins lie in a moment when Britain believed the state should build boldly for the public good. TheSouthbank Centrehas requested £30m from the government. Having ruled against redevelopment, ministers must show their support for the innovators of the present.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Is that OK now?, 17 February), I noticed many years ago how almost all women move aside, unconsciously, out of the path of oncoming men. Sit at a cafe watching – it’s shocking once you realise that this happens all day every day.I decided to challenge myself to hold my line when walking, and the results are amazing.Mensimply presume I am going to move away, and look shocked at me when I don’t. Luckily for me, I am almost 6ft tall and in my 60s, so perhaps I am less vulnerable to the usual aggression. I look like I might verbally “hit back”.I urge all women to take time to watch from the sidelines, or try walking along your chosen line. Try to experience just how strong the urge is to move aside – to allow men to pass freely through their world unhindered, untroubled by anyone more vulnerable than themselves.Learned perhaps from childhood, I am sure men mostly have no idea of the amount of space being made for them wherever they choose to go. If we need a new definition of masculinity, polite awareness of all the people around us in public might move us toward harmony. Loosening the grip men hold over all public space would go a long way toward helping women feel less oppressed.I fear that men who are so angry that they are lashing out at random women for their need to feel power are totally lost to us already.Elizabeth JohnstonLondonI found Lucy Pasha-Robinson’s article upsetting, but also, weirdly, I felt that at least I was not alone. Two days ago I was loudly shouted at by a man, perhaps in his late 40s, in a service station car park.He had thought, wrongly, that I had hit the side of his vehicle with my car door. I automatically apologised (I don’t know why) and tried to explain that I hadn’t caught his car, but he just carried on shouting, unprepared to listen. His parting shot was to shout “Idiot!” at the top of his voice.I am 73, small in stature, and I was alone. My husband was convinced that this man wouldn’t have acted as he did had our son been with me. We also, like Lucy, wondered how he might behave behind closed doors with women unfortunate enough to be family members, if he was willing to yell at an elderly woman in public.Lucy is right that many women suffer much worse at the hands of abusive male strangers than either she or I have, but she is also right that something has shifted in terms of public behaviour. Shouting at grannies, or physically barging into women in the street, would have been unthinkable not so very long ago.Theresa GillSt Andrews, FifeLucy Pasha-Robinson’s piece stopped me in my tracks – a bit like the man who called me the C-word at Oxford Circus tube station, as he passed me and my husband. He put his face to the side of mine and just said it. I could not believe it.I ran after the man and caught up with him, because in seconds I went from surprised to shocked to furious. I asked him what the heck he thought he was doing (or words to that effect). His answer: “I’m having a bad day, sorry.” Lucy is right. Loads of women could recount a tale of this kind. Something has shifted. We cannot let it slide.Anthea EastoeStreatham, LondonLucy Pasha-Robinson’s account of casual abuse breaching our social contract is not confined to the street. Years ago, a female friend and I headed to a late night eatery after a few beers. We were school friends back in our home town for the weekend.The only other diners were two blokes on the opposite side of the restaurant. Despite initially ignoring their catcalls, my response was to ask them to leave us alone as we were trying to talk. For this, one of the two men walked over to our table, picked up my drink and poured it all over my plate of food.In public or private, it never shocks me how simply rude men are. This behaviour is on a spectrum: what starts as an attitude of entitlement can progress to verbal/physical abuse, violence with disastrous consequences.Rachael ElliottLondonI’m a native New Yorker and this happened to me in my early 20s. I don’t know if I would dare to do this now. On a rainy day I was waiting for the subway train. A man standing behind me pushed me forward. I turned around and nicely said “Please don’t push me, it’s not safe.”A second time, my same response. The third time, a more forceful push made me turn around and raised my umbrella threateningly at him saying “I told you not to push me!” It alarmed me that I threatened violence to a stranger, but he and sadly everyone else quickly backed away from me.Naida SperlingPalo Alto, CaliforniaA lens of misogyny can be very useful to help understand women’s experiences, but it can often obscure our understanding of perpetrators of such bad experiences. Plenty of men like myself can also report the exact same bad experiences mentioned in the article.The issue with the perpetrators is a more generalised one linked to assertion of power through violence and antisocial anger. Seeing it as merely misogyny leads to misunderstanding of the motives involved, and what the viable solutions could be.Liam RileySalfordRegarding Lucy Pasha-Robinson’s recent article on being shoved by men in the street, this also happens to men. It happened to me (a 6-feet tall, fairly well-built man) last week in London. It happened to me, more seriously, some years ago on the Tube when I was assaulted and threatened. It happened to me last year in Regent’s Park when a runner ran into me deliberately, and then turned around and shoved me hard in the back for good measure. Cowardly and inconsiderate men are generally the perpetrators, and they shove both genders, in my experience.Tim GoughLondonI witnessed the exact same thing walking down Fulham Road in London at 7am last month. A woman was walking towards me on an empty pavement, and I saw a man walk up quickly behind her, barge into her and shove her quite hard from behind. He then shouted “watch where you’re going, (b-word)!”I was utterly shocked – it was unbelievable; so obviously intentional and at the same time completely unnecessary, as there was nobody but us three anywhere on the pavement. So I shouted at the man “what are you doing? What is your problem?”, which was the best I could think of, and he stared at me angrily but clearly thought better of treating me in the same way as he had the woman, and walked off quickly.The aggression and misogyny in his action was so barefaced and obvious, it shocked me deeply and it stayed with me for weeks. I’ve since discussed this with my wife and a few female friends, and sadly they all confirmed this is has either happened to them before, too, or that they know someone who’s been attacked in this way.Men everywhere need to call this out and be ready to challenge perpetrators of such sexist intimidation and attacks, wherever and whenever they happen. This will be effective because those men are clearly cowards (aside from whatever else may be ailing them psychologically), and it’s up to us men to help call it out, end it, and ensure the perpetrators cannot get away with it. Thank you for reporting on this issue – it’s past time for this to end.Markus IckstadtLondonLucy Pasha-Robinson’s piece resonated deeply with me because it captures a particular kind of disturbance: something seemingly small happens, yet the body’s reaction reveals that something larger has been threatened. What she describes also feels far from local or isolated. Living in Germany, I have increasingly encountered similar situations, typically without force, but with the same dynamic in muted form: men choosing unnecessary proximity.I think of moments at a bus stop or on a wide pavement, in an almost empty public space, when a man passes far closer than necessary. No shove, no words – just a proximity that feels deliberate and triggers an instinctive alarm. I step aside automatically, and in doing so will never know whether he would have collided with me. What I do know is that he could easily have kept his distance. Even without physical contact, being passed by a stranger with inches to spare amid such a “huge expanse of empty pavement”, as Pasha-Robinson puts it so aptly, is unsettling enough.Like the author, I find myself asking why. Why does the burden of awareness, adjustment and de-escalation fall so predictably on women?It is tempting to explain this away as individual rudeness or post-pandemic fraying of social norms. But that feels insufficient. Is this kind of behaviour connected to a broader backlash? As women occupy more public and social space, some men appear to experience this not as neutral change but as provocation, responding with micro-assertions of dominance – reminders about who is expected to yield.There is something quietly hopeful, though, in naming it. Each time we recognise the pattern, share it, and refuse to dismiss it, we reclaim a little of the space – and mutual respect – that should belong to us all.Vera WichersMunich, GermanyQuite a few years ago, I started playing a game/experiment called “patriarchy chicken”, in which, as a woman, I refuse to cede space to a man if we are walking directly toward one another. I remain on a straightforward path, no matter what. I do this on the sidewalk, wandering around museums, on subway platforms, in intersections when crossing the street, in the park, etc.This has resulted in many, many collisions due to men’s inaccurate presumptions that this woman will move out of their way. Although once it resulted in a ridiculous standoff after a man stopped in his tracks, and so did I. Neither of us moved off to the right or the left into the grass; we both stood our ground on the narrow dirt path, face-to-face, mere inches from one another. He told me I was a “very odd woman” for not moving to let him pass. I wish I’d had Lucy Pasha-Robinson’s words – why is sharing public space only a woman’s job? I guess I was lucky not to have been literally shoved aside.Anneliese DickmanCastle Rock, Colorado, USWhat’s going on with men and their sense of entitlement these days? Where does this hubris come from? What has happened to basic human kindness and respect?One morning, I was walking along a concrete path holding the hand of my three-year-old grandson in a local park in an inner-Sydney suburb. Two strong-looking men in their 30s came striding along the centre of the path towards us. They didn’t acknowledge our presence in any way, did not attempt to move to one side of the path or slow down. We had to leap out of their way for fear of being bowled over.I spent a good part of the rest of the day feeling angry, disrespected and wondering what this says about men’s attitudes towards women in Australia. I have no answer except to observe that disrespect and a sense of male entitlement is, sadly, a growing trend.Judith RadinNew South Wales, AustraliaLucy Pasha-Robinson’s story of multiple encounters on British streets with men who have pushed or berated her was so triggering that I waited a day before writing. Sadly, the societal fraying she reports is not just a British thing. Many years of encountering American men while out running, bicycling or just walking alone has taught me to expect the worst. Not that long ago, I was home in the US, driving on rural roads I know well. When I pulled into traffic to make a legal turn on to a long highway, a man in a truck sped up to swerve around me, pretending I had cut him off, manoeuvreing around my car, shaking his fist and screaming, his face contorted with anger. My heart raced for miles afterward. And, yes, I worried he might have had a gun.Lori FontanesParis, FranceHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

They are the archetypical pest. I studied them as an introduced pest on crops of garden peas in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand, in the 1960s, and again for Ken Livingstone, who misguidedly ignored pigeon friends in Trafalgar Square in the 2000s.As an animal population ecologist, I asked why the pigeons’ repertoire made them so successful. They’re smart and mobile, flocking to each distant source of food and moving just far enough away to avoid harm when scared.As I predicted, all of Ken’s ideas for deterrence failed. Be it explosions, rocket-propelled nets or Harris’s hawks, the number of pigeons steadfastly correlated with the amount of food provided for them and not with the supposed “control” measure. The disturbances merely gave them a bit of exercise as they flew round, only to settle back down for the food. When feeding was deterred sufficiently to actually lower the amount available, which was no small task in the face of determined pigeon-lovers, the birds didn’t die off in droves, but just moved on to other places.The latest misguided idea is to convince them to breed in dovecotes and harvest their eggs. That is to assume that they are inherently sedentary, which is far from the truth, and that fecundity is the problem, which it isn’t. Investing in dovecotes would be fun and, like Harris’s hawks, a tourist attraction, but sadly the solution to the undeniable problem of excess pigeon populations is to control those who believe that pigeons need feeding. Where we have controlled pigeon feeding, we have achieved humane population control.Dr Dave DawsonFormer head of environment, GreaterLondonAuthorityI read with interest your article about the problems with pigeons inNorwich. Some 25 years ago, I held the environment portfolio on the former Chester city council, where we faced a similar problem. The solution we were offered was to build a specially designed pigeon loft in an open car park near the city centre, and introduce a bylaw prohibiting feeding pigeons anywhere else in the city.This meant that the pigeons had no incentive to nest anywhere else, and the eggs they laid could be regularly removed from the base of the pigeon loft, thus reducing, or at least stabilising, the pigeon population. This solution seemed to work, and generated very few complaints.Paul RobertsFarndon, CheshireInstead of declaring war on pigeons, Norwich city council should be commemorating them on their war memorial. On 24 February, International War Animal Day, we remember the millions of animals that served, suffered and died in military conflicts around the world by wearing a purple poppy or badge.I’ve been researching the role of pigeons in the second world war for a book, and concluded that no other animal did more to save this nation than the pigeons that carried messages in small canisters attached to their legs. Nearly a quarter of a million pigeons served with the army, RAF, navy, civil defence, Home Guard and Special Operations Executive, saving thousands of lives.Many were killed in the process, with only one in eight making it back alive from missions over occupied Europe. Their work was recognised through the award of 32 Dickin medals (or animal Victoria Crosses) out of total of 54 given out during the war – more than for all the other animals combined. It is therefore deeply ironic that the council are eradicating them from the war memorial in the city.Nicholas MiltonStratford-upon-Avon, WarwickshireFeral pigeons form a major part of the diet of the peregrine falcons that have become established in many city centres in recent years, including London and indeed Norwich, where they have nested on the cathedral, not far from the market place.Take away the pigeons, and the future will once again be bleak for these iconic predators. Let nature take its course and an equilibrium will be found.David JobbinsKelvedon Hatch, EssexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It was the Conservative-Liberal coalition government that set in train the withdrawal of the bulk of government funding, previously provided through agrant-in-aid from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Is it too cynical to see this as not simply a desire for cost savings, but also as an attempt to saddle the domestic BBC with the burden of financing the World Service?It was clearly not safe in that government’s hands. But neither has it been safe in the hands of a domestic-focusedBBCmanagement. Countless expert staff have been sacrificed. In my experience, senior BBC managers are fond of pronouncing lofty platitudes about the value of the BBC’s overseas services, but they are not willing to make sufficient domestic cuts to fund them.BBC bosses recently opined that the World Service should befunded from the defence budget– clearly they had not kept up with the pressures that the Ministry of Defence is facing at a time of unprecedented global challenge.Maybe, with so much about the BBC’s overall future in the melting pot, it is time to ensure that this vital strategic asset is funded properly and consistently, if necessary by requiring an adequate share of the licence fee to be directed its way. If anyone is broadcasting in the national interest, it is the dedicated journalists and production teams of the World Service.Jonathan MarcusFormer World Service defence and diplomatic correspondentI worked at Bush House in 1969‑70, at the Spanish section of the World Service. When, at 10pm, we started our news service, we were able to give Spaniards news about strikes, demonstrations, military assassinations – all the Spanish news that the local press was not allowed to publish. Franco was alive, and censorship was reintroduced after a short period of partial freedom.We of course added afterwards features on the Mini and the miniskirt. But this was the only way my country was informed about what was happening under the dictatorship. How many other countries need this today?Enrique MurilloBarcelona, SpainAs a former US serviceman and cold warrior, I crewed military aircraft in some of the more remote corners of the world in the 1980s. We worked with our brothers in arms from other free world countries monitoring the Soviet submarine threat worldwide. It was a time of political turbulence, constant threat and misinformation.Frequently, in distant places, the local press was saying wildly irresponsible things. But wherever we were, we could be assured of receiving accurate news and commentary via the BBC short‑wave service. The locals in places we visited almost universally used the service as well, both in English and frequently in their native tongue.I cannot imagine the BBC stepping back from transmitting a voice of freedom used by so many distant compatriots during this crucial time in world history.Emmett DignanBorrego Springs, California, USWhen I was doing a two-year stint with VSO, working for a secondary school in Bartica, Guyana, theBBC World Servicewas a lifeline. It was a familiar voice that brought home comforts. The sports report on a Saturday. The commentary of David Beckham scoring a last-gasp goal against Greece to send us to the World Cup. I still get a lump in my throat when the football commentary includes the immortal words “and we are now joined by the World Service”.More important, the Guyanese people would listen to the Caribbean report and know that this was an unbiased view of the various political turmoils in their country. We must not lose this vital cultural and political channel of news, views and analysis.Kris Marshall SmithFakenham, NorfolkI’m dismayed by the decision to cut the World Service. It is my comfort at 3am when sleep is elusive, and is a vital resource for those living and travelling overseas; it’s the voice that you can trust with stories from around the world that aren’t covered anywhere else on the BBC.I also recommended the World Service to students joining courses on global development, so that they can hear different accents and original stories from far away, and situate themselves in the lives of others. The World Service is a vital resource that serves the public and is worth every penny it receives.Martha KnightFormer senior lecturer, Open UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

At 172.5 metres, the Sagrada Familia, to which the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí devoted the later part of his life, is Barcelona’s tallest building and theworld’s tallest church.As the Catalan and Vatican flags were raised, Jordi Faulí, the chief architect for the project, said: “It’s been a joyful day, wonderful for all the people who have made it possible.”A ceremony to mark the completion of the tower – the tallest of 18 conceived by Gaudí – is due to take place on the centenary of Gaudí’s death in 1926 on 10 June, 16 years after the church was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI.View image in fullscreenWorkers assemble the upper part of the tower of Jesus Christ’s cross on to the Sagrada Familia.Photograph: Enric Fontcuberta/EPAThe end to the building at the church is expected in about a decade with the construction of a striking south-facing facade.It was nevertheless a day full of emotion for a city that has lived with Gaudí’s unfinished work for generations and, although there remains much work to do, the temple now defines the Barcelona skyline as much as the Eiffel tower in Paris or the Empire State building in New York.For decades it was a building site open to the skies, where generations of stone masons and carpenters worked around the tourists who have ultimately funded the construction. It’s only in the past 15 years, since work began on the breathtakingly beautiful interior, that it has felt more like a church than a building site.Here Gaudí’s geometrical designs have created an oasis of light, with delicate, tree-like columns tapering off to the roof, the white stone of the interior picked out in colours from the stained glass windows.The basilica is loved and loathed equally by those who live in Barcelona. George Orwell described it as “one of the most hideous buildings in the world” and regretted the anarchists did not blow it up when they had the chance.View image in fullscreenThe Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona, Spain, is the city’s tallest building and the world’s tallest church.Photograph: Enric Fontcuberta/EPAThe anarchists did, however, destroy Gaudí’s drawings and the plaster model, which years later was painstakingly reconstructed. In the late 1970s, Mark Burry, a New Zealand architect, adapted rocket design software to realise Gaudí’s design.Europe’s housing costs akin to ‘new pandemic’, warns Barcelona mayorRead moreTo those who claim the basilica is nothing like what was originally envisaged, Burry’s retort was that Gaudí’s geometry is so precise that should there be any deviation from his plan, the building would collapse.It is, however, now the work of many hands. There are elements that jar, in particular the Passion façade, popularly known as Darth Vader façade, the work of the sculptor Josep Maria Subirachs, and yet overall it is unmistakably Gaudí’s work.Aside from finishing the details of the main tower, three artists – Miquel Barceló , Cristina Iglesias and Javier Marín – have been commissioned to present designs for the Glory façade, which is expected to take a further 10 years to complete.The Sagrada Familia is the city’s top tourist attraction, with about 5 million visitors a year and an annual income of roughly €150m (£131m), about half of which has so far been spent on construction.Explore more on these topicsBarcelonaAntoni GaudíSpainEuropeArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

So, [it] felt really good. Very proud of the team,” the Artemis launch director, Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, told a Friday early afternoon press conference.Nasa has several dates available in early March to launch Artemis, which will conduct a 10-day trip around the moon, but not land. The flight will take humans further into space then ever before and, according to Nasa, the mission will fly about 4,700 miles (7,600km) beyond the far side of the moon, surpassing the distance record set by Apollo 13 in 1970. The mission will test systems for future deep-space exploration.The mission is in preparation for Artemis III, scheduled for 2028, which will be the first human landing on the moon since the final Apollo program flight in December 1972.The successful fueling test was a welcome bright spot for Nasa, which acknowledged in a damning reportpublished on Thursdaya succession of failures on Boeing’s ill-fated Starliner capsule that left two astronauts stuck on the International Space Stationfor nine months.The space agency said the first crewed test launch of Starliner in June 2024 was part of what Isaacman designated a “Type A mishap” – its most serious classification – in the report.The Nasa astronautsSuni Williamsand Butch Wilmore finallyreturned to Earthin March 2025 after an extended stay on the International Space Station (ISS) caused by severe technical failures on Starliner, including faulty thrusters and helium leaks that became apparent upon docking.The stricken capsule wassent backin September empty, and Williams and Wilmore became part of the ISS until they eventually came home on aSpaceXDragon spacecraft in what Donald Trump portrayed as a “rescue mission”.“The agency failed them,” Amit Kshatriya, Nasa’s deputy administrator, told a press conference on Thursday afternoon, describing its decision to accept Boeing’s assurances at face value that the capsule was safe and ready to launch.“Our responsibility is to them and to all the crews that are coming and to the crews that we’re about to go fly.”Those astronauts include the four who are set to climb on board Artemis II next month: Nasa astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen of the CanadianSpaceAgency.The Starliner report details an often “chaotic” and at times adversarial relationship between agency officials and Boeing executives, including a reluctance on both sides to entertain dissenting views, and growing mistrust.“While Boeing built Starliner, Nasa accepted it and launched two astronauts to space,” Isaacman saidin a statementaccompanying the report, acknowledging it had been overly keen to secure an alternative to SpaceX for crew transportation.“Beyond technical issues, it is clear that Nasa permitted overarching programmatic objectives of having two providers capable of transporting astronauts to-and-from orbit, influence engineering and operational decisions, especially during and immediately after the mission. We are correcting those mistakes.”Investigators found shortfalls in Boeing’s building and testing of Starliner, and blamed for its downfall “an interplay of combined hardware failures, qualification gaps, leadership missteps, and cultural breakdowns that created risk conditions inconsistent with Nasa’s human spaceflight safety standards”.The agency, Isaacman said, “will not fly another crew on Starliner until technical causes are understood and corrected”.Boeing responded to the criticism in a statement saying it was “grateful” to Nasa for the investigation and opportunity to contribute to it.“In the 18 months since our test flight, Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team that directly align with the findings in the report,” a spokesperson said.“Nasa’s report will reinforce our ongoing efforts to strengthen our work.”Explore more on these topicsNasaThe moonSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

The claims came from a juvenile who had been staying at his residence.According to investigators, the teen had hidden a small camera in a bedroom in the home. On 13 January, she reportedly received multiple motion alerts indicating recordings had been captured. Deputies say the footage showed Dingus smelling at least four pairs of her underwear “for several seconds” and also “touching his groin area over his clothes”.Richland county children’s services passed the report along to law enforcement the same day the alleged incident occurred, and a deputy later interviewed the girl at her school.A deputy later contacted Dingus and arranged a meeting, but the conversation did not happen after his attorney advised canceling it, local news outletWKYCreported. Authorities arrested Dingus nearly a month later, an action that took place on 13 February.Dingus appeared in court on Thursday and pleaded not guilty. He was released after posting 10% of a $10,000 bond. Judge Michael Kemerer required him to wear a GPS monitor and barred him from contacting the accuser.Deputies forwarded the case to a local prosecutor’s office on 26 January. After consulting with a member of that office, deputies prepared two court summonses charging Dingus with voyeurism, according toCleveland19. Those summonses were then delivered to Dingus.Dingus, who is a registered Republican according to publicvoter records, became mayor of Butler in 2022. Then mayor Joseph Stallard resigned, and Dingus was elevated to the vacant post from his role as council president.Dingus was soon afterelectedto a full term after receiving 199 votes from the village’s fewer than 1,000 residents.In August, Dingus was indicted on four counts related to an incident in which he allegedly struck a fleeing criminal suspect with his car, theRichland Sourcereported. Officials say that on 11 July, he saw a man attempting to escape from police and struck the man with his vehicle to prevent him from getting away. Dingus entered a plea of not guilty in that case, and the injured man was expected to recover.Explore more on these topicsOhioUS crimeRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Lawyers representing the Post argued that it was extremely damaging – for Natanson’s journalism and for the freedom of the press – for the government to be in possession of her devices. Lawyers for the government argued that the material contained on the devices was necessary for its investigation into the contractor Aurelio Perez-Lugones, and that the judge should remove his pause on the government reviewing the files it had obtained.A lawyer representing Natanson, Amy Jeffress, told the judge that her client has “suffered significant harm, both personally and professionally, as a result of the government’s actions”. “The shock of this unprecedented search has had lasting consequences,” she added.Referring to the government raid, Jeffress said: “They’ve done something here that opens the door to a lot of reporters’ homes being searched without a very good reason.”If the judge chooses not to order the government to return the devices, lawyers for the Post argued that they should be present for a review of Natanson’s materials – and that the task should not be left to a government “filter team”.It is possible that the judge could choose for the court to undertake the document review process, an avenue the Post’s lawyer, Simon A Latcovich, said was preferable to the government handling the process – though he noted that Natanson “had court sources among her many sources”.“The government commandeered the entirety of reporter Hannah Natanson’s professional life,” Latcovich said. “Today, more than 1,200 confidential sources are following this very proceeding to see if their identities will be exposed to the government.”In a surprisingly combative moment, the judge expressed frustration with the government’s legal teamfor not informing him about a law protecting journalists– the Privacy Protection Act – when requesting that he sign a warrant for the raid. The judge acknowledged publicly that he had initially declined to sign the warrant.“Did you not do it because you didn’t know, or because you decided not to tell me?” the judge asked government lawyer Christian Dibblee. “How could you think it doesn’t apply?”The omission – and the judge’s response – was significant, according to Gabe Rottman of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.“The court was clearly frustrated by the government’s failure to disclose in the warrant application a federal law that is meant to severely restrict searches of journalists,” he said. “When given the chance to explain, prosecutors didn’t offer a credible response. Given what the court heard today, we hope that it will promptly return the seized devices and ensure that news gathering material is appropriately protected.”While the judge did not issue any rulings on Friday, he said he had “a pretty good sense of what [he’s] going to do here”, and scheduled a follow-up hearing on 4 March.The case comes at a challenging time for the Post, which is reeling from a historic round of layoffs earlier this month and the abrupt resignation of its embattled publisher, Will Lewis. Jeff D’Onofrio, who is serving as active publisher in Lewis’s place, was in attendance at the hearing, along with the Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray.Explore more on these topicsWashington PostUS press and publishingNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesLaw (US)Trump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Sixty-eight plants were granted exemptions.Last week, the EPA announced it was repealing the “endangerment finding”, which gave the agency the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and the White House directed the Pentagon to purchase power from coal plants for military use.Coal-burning power plants are among the largest sources of hazardous air pollution, including mercury, lead, arsenic and acid gases, as well as major sources of benzene, formaldehyde, dioxins and other organic hazardous air pollutants.Coal plants generate less than 20% of US electricity, according to theEnergyInformation Administration.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPollutionUS politicsCoalEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Now, as an allergy specialist at Jagiellonian University Medical College who treats patients struggling to breathe, he knows all too well the damage those toxic gases do inside the human body.“It’s not that we have this feeling that nothing can be done. But it’s difficult,” Mazur said.Kraków, long known as the smog capital ofPoland, is proof that politicians wield the power to save lives by cleaning the air. A drop in soot levels since 2013, when the city announced it would ban coal and wood in home heating, has averted nearly 6,000 early deaths over a decade, according to an expert assessment shared exclusively with the Guardian.Mazur’s research has separately shown that there were17% fewer cases of asthmaand 28% fewer cases of allergic rhinitis in children in 2018 than in 2008.Anna Dworakowska, a co-founder and director of Polish Smog Alert, said: “It’s a huge improvement.” Polish Smog Alert is a network of campaign groups that began in Kraków and led a nationwide push to improve the quality of Poland’s air. “Little more than 10 years ago, we had about 150 days a year with too-high concentrations of particulates in Kraków. Now it’s down to 30,” Dworakowska added.‘Clean air should not be a privilege’: how Bogotá is tackling air pollution in its poorest areasRead moreKraków’s ban on burning solid fuels came into effect in 2019, by which point most of the tens of thousands of dirty stoves and boilers had been replaced. The local government subsidised the switch to cleaner forms of heating, sometimes paying the full cost, and restricted which fuels could be burned in the years leading up to the ban.The reduction in soot – known as black carbon – saved 5,897 lives over a decade, according to the European Clean Air Centre. The researchers used established methods to calculate the death toll and relied on a special station in Wrocław to estimate the fraction of black carbon in the tiny particulate matter (PM2.5) they measured in Kraków.Łukasz Adamkiewicz, the president of the European Clean Air Centre, said the progress was a result of rare consensus from parties of all political stripes. “Green, red, black, right, left, up, down – everyone said ‘OK, this is a problem we need to tackle’.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators stage a protest against high air pollution levels in Kraków in 2017. Pollution in the city is now expected to fall further after the introduction of a low-emissions zone this year.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesBlack carbon is a superpollutant more powerful than carbon dioxide that is released during the incomplete burning of fossil fuels and biomass. At the UN climate summit in November, nine countries announced first-of-their-kind plans to cut black carbon emissions as part of efforts to stave off global heating and save local lives from bad air.Rachel Huxley, the head of mitigation at the health charity Wellcome, said: “It’s a big deal. If we take action to tackle superpollutants, we can have this huge impact on global warming and also on all of these premature health impacts.”Early deaths from fine particulates in Poland fell by 18% between 2005 and 2022, the latest data shows, and across the EU they plunged by 45%.Health impacts of air pollution chartKraków, the capital of the coal-rich Małopolska region, has witnessed perhaps the most dramatic turnaround in air quality in Poland. In 2024 it recorded no breaches of daily limits for benzo(a)pyrene, another cancer-causing pollutant from burning wood and coal, for the first year since measurements began, according to Polish Smog Alert.Pollution is expected to fall further due to the introduction of a low emissions zone – restricting the types of vehicle that can drive in about 60% of the city – at the start of the year.Experts say more needs to be done. In late January, Kraków briefly became the most-polluted major city in the world, ahead of Lahore in Pakistan and Kolkata in India, according to a ranking of 120 global cities by IQAir. Smog floats into Kraków from surrounding towns and villages, where coal and wood dominate home heating and the city has little say over policy.View image in fullscreenIn late January, Kraków briefly became the most-polluted major city in the world, ahead of Lahore in Pakistan and Kolkata in India, according to a ranking of 120 global cities by IQAir.Photograph: Omar Marques/Getty ImagesThings are not going as well elsewhere in Poland, said Mazur, who has a house in Szczawnica, a small town in the south of the country. Before he replaced the coal boiler, he had to fill it with fuel three times a day in winter and clear it of ash just as often. The switch to a heat pump and a gas boiler has been “incomparably more convenient, and much more eco-friendly”, he said.“What happens in the towns and villages surrounding Kraków has a direct impact on the air quality in our city,” Mazur said.The reverse may also be true. The ban in Kraków has spurred similar policies across Poland, with pressure from citizens and campaign groups driving political enthusiasm to adopt anti-smog measures and restrict the burning of the most polluting fuels.Experts say its success could guide polluted cities across eastern Europe and further afield, where death tolls from air pollution are high but public discontent rarely rises to the level of protests or organised campaigns.Huxley said: “My experience of working with cities is you can’t do it without public support. That will either drive it, or without it you’ll be hamstrung.”Explore more on these topicsAir pollutionPollutionPolandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The story may sound familiar, but this one is different: there’s a satisfying comeuppance all round.The ongoing saga of sewage being pumped into the Thames has inspired a new YA (young adult) novel,Floaters– and when its limited first edition is published later this month, 50% of all profits will go to the conservation and campaign charitySurfers Against Sewage(SAS).Described as a “coming-of-age revenge caper”, Floaters follows a group of teenagers who find their favourite swimming spot has been compromised by oozing sewage, and is based on the author’s own experiences.Craig Taylor, writing as C M Taylor, and his two daughters regularly canoe along the Thames. They used to swim, too, in the stretch near their Oxfordshire home, but they stopped when they discovered how frequently sewage was being dumped into the water. “There’s a very active environmental network doing citizen science in our area and that’s really helped educate us about the declining water quality,” said Taylor.View image in fullscreenHalf of the profits made by the book will be donated to Surfers Against Sewage, who campaign for cleaner waterways across the UK.Photograph: Charlotte Coney/Getty ImagesThe book’s initial run of 215 copies will raise funds for SAS in a year the campaign group calls a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to positively influence the UK’s water quality.View image in fullscreenThe first publication is limited to 215 copies, one for each mile of the River Thames.Photograph: Craig Taylor“It just seemed a cute conceit to restrict the number of copies to 215, one for each mile of the river,” said Taylor. “Although there are ongoing fights about where the source of the Thames is, so I’m sure some purists will argue that it’s actually 218 miles long.”In July thewater reform billwill be introduced in parliament, and other government consultations on bathing water regulations, environmental offence sanctions and river basin management plans are taking place.Taylor’s book reflects on how the polluting actions of UK water companies – and the executivebonusesthat continue in spite of them – are increasingly seeping into popular culture.Two years ago, the Channel 4 documentary Joe Lycett vs Sewage saw the comedian take on the issue, and from 23 February, the broadcaster will airDirty Business, a new three-part TV drama telling thetrue-life storyof pollution and cover-up by England’s water companies.Just as ITV’s Bafta-winning Mr Bates vs the Post Office revived public interest in the Post Office scandal in 2024 and led a breakthrough moment in the continued fight for justice, this year clean water campaigners will be hoping for a similar turn in the tide.“I’ve been thinking about sewage for a long time and I’ve been wanting to write something set on a river,” said Taylor. “And I love capers – there are lots of stories that are heists, but there are not enough capers.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentYoung adultWater industryThe ThamesYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some drones will be equipped with light detection and ranging (lidar) technology, which can create highly detailed maps of illegal waste sites.TheEnvironment Agency, which holds the responsibility for investigating waste crime, has increased the size of its joint investigations unit to 20 specialists.Phil Davies, the head of the joint unit for waste crime, said: “With organised criminals becoming ever more sophisticated, we are adopting new technologies to find and, importantly, stop them. Through the greater use of drones, stronger partnerships and more officers on the ground, we will build on our action so far and send a clear message to those committing waste crimes – we will stop you.”View image in fullscreenIllegal dumping by Datta’s company at Rhyddings Mill, Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire.Photograph: Environment AgencyThe EA secured a major victory against Datta when he was convicted last week after pleading guilty to knowingly causing controlled waste to be deposited at 16 sites. The weight of the waste totalled about 4,275 tonnes, and the illegal dumps were spread across Lincolnshire,Cambridgeshire, Lancashire, Kent, Surrey, Rutland and Middlesbrough.Datta was convicted along with two other men. Two further suspects are still being hunted.Judge Paul Farrer KC said at the sentencing the crimes were reckless. “Smell and flies were a feature at some of the illegal sites and caused a localised adverse effect to air quality,” he said. Landowners had been forced to incur substantial costs to remove the illegal waste, he added.He gave Datta a four-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, as well as 30 days’ rehabilitation and 200 hours of unpaid work.The court heard that Datta became a registered waste broker through his company,Atkins RecyclingLtd, in 2015. He acted recklessly by claiming the waste the company handled was being sent to a legal site at Kiveton Park, near Sheffield. However, the loads were actually diverted to unlicensed dumps around the country, the court heard.The Middleton nature reserve in Lancashire was one of the locations where waste was dumped.

ANL denies all the allegations of wrongdoing.At the high court, Henderson was accused by the claimants’ legal team of being a conduit between corrupt private investigators and other ANL journalists, which he said was an “absolute lie”.He was repeatedly questioned about his relationship with Burrows, who has since said that a witness statement in his name – which admitted to bugging houses, phone tapping and “blagging” bank and medical records – was forged.The disputed Burrows statement points to Henderson as his “first proper contact … on Fleet Street” and says they spoke regularly. “I trusted him and he trusted me and we had a good working relationship,” the statement reads.Henderson said Burrows may have been “the Mallorca man” – a contact he met on the island in relation to a potential story relating to the business magnate Richard Branson. “I do not remember ever working with or having any contact with the Mallorca man again,” he said in a written submission.He said it was “surreal to me” to be answering questions about working with Burrows, given Burrows himself had disowned the claims in his witness statement.Henderson said he could not remember what he asked the “Mallorca man” to do, but that he would never have asked anyone to do anything illegal and did not recognise Burrows when shown a picture of him.David Sherborne, the leading barrister for the claimants, said that the disputed Burrows testimony would need to have fabricated “an exceptionally detailed” account of how Henderson acted as his “handler”.The account includes claims that Henderson introduced Burrows to other journalists and even sent cash to a virtual mail drop on Regent Street, London, in exchange for an envelope containing tapes. “This is nonsense and is absolutely untrue,” Henderson said.“I understand there’s detail in there, but it’s fabricated – it’s just not true,” he said. “I’d like the claimants in this action to know I never did any of this.”Asked by Sherborne why he would have been the target of such fabrications, Henderson surmised that those who put together the disputed Burrows confession “weaved something together” based on their possible Mallorca meeting.“These are extreme and grotesque claims that never ever happened,” he said. “Mr Burrows has since categorically refuted all of it … I don’t know how this document was put together.”The judge, Mr Justice Nicklin, is yet to rule on how he will treat the disputed Burrows claims, which play a major role in the cases of some of the seven claimants, including those relating to Elton John and Elizabeth Hurley.Henderson also denied commissioning other private investigators, including previously convicted figures Glenn Mulcaire, Steve Whittamore and Jonathan Rees.The case continues.Explore more on these topicsAssociated NewspapersMail on SundayDaily Mail & General TrustPrince HarryNewspapers & magazinesNewspapersNational newspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

This is cruel and heartless and will harm these children in both the short and long term.“The government talks a good game on ending child poverty, but unless this includes all children then ultimately these words are hollow. They must immediately scrap plans to introduce their so-called earned settlement model and cap existing settlement routes at five years. This will ensure that British children of migrant parents do not see their life chances greatly diminished.”AdviceUK, the largest network of independent advisers in the UK, said Mahmood’s “fairer pathway to settlement” consultation had increased insecurity and inequality for migrants and their families who are attempting to apply for leave to remain.A consultation on Mahmood’s proposals closed on 12 February. The changes could be in force by April and it is expected they will apply retroactively.The proposals say the baseline qualifying period could be reduced by “considerations” including English competency, taxable income, working in public service, volunteering or being the parent or child of a British citizen, but warn “additional years will take precedence over any reduction to the baseline”.The cost, stress and uncertainty a further prolonged wait for ILR would place on career prospects is causing alarm. One parent, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “It’s like you have to choose between settlement and surviving. It’s ridiculous. A decade of paperwork, a decade of your mental health, a decade of everything, and yet still you’re going to add to that.“What are you trying to tell us? We’re going to continue punishing you people because 10 years is not enough. We give you access, but yet we are going to reverse it and punish you for it.”Migrants to UK will not get benefits until becoming citizens under new plansRead moreMost people on the existing 10-year route are Asian and Black. The government proposes an even tougher “earned settlement model” that sets the “baseline” qualifying period at 10 years, adding an extra five years for people who have used public funds for less than 12 months, or an additional 10 years for those accessing them longer.Cases seen by AdviceUK include Julia, a carer and mother of three, who is on the 10-year route and only one year away from qualifying for ILR. Fearing that accessing benefits would add 20 years to her route, she cancelled all benefits she was legally entitled to, including housing benefit, universal credit and the disability living allowance of £103.10 a week for her autistic daughter.She said: “I’ve stopped the benefits, even though I need them because I’m so scared I will not be able to get my settlement. It feels so unfair that I accessed benefits because I’m on a low wage and now that is being used against me.”Meanwhile, Ramfel surveyed 68 parents – all from West African, South Asian and Caribbean backgrounds – and conducted focus groups with another five.Out of 51 contributors using public funds, 90% (44) said they would forgo them to avoid being penalised, despite the fear of homelessness and debt, being prevented from full-time work by childcare costs and caring responsibilities, and difficulty affording housing, food, fuel bills and school trips.Ramfel’s report said: “Of 134 children referred to in the survey, over 50% were British citizens. The proposals create a two-tier settlement system that punishes people on lower incomes (and) force families to choose between immediate survival and long-term security.”Launching the consultation in November, Mahmood said: “We have built a multi-faith, multi-ethnic democracy that is pluralistic, grounded in tolerance towards difference. But it does demand contribution and integration.To become a part of this country, permanently, is therefore not a right but a privilege – and one that must be earned.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsMigrationImmigration and asylumHome OfficeShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Their ability to perform this work safely depends on a foundation of trust,” Tierneywrote in his letterto Tim Davie, the outgoing director general of the BBC.He added that staff had “expressed distress” that this trust might have been “inadvertently compromised” by the BBCepisode.It is understood, however, that no member of the public has so far mentioned the episode of Industry specifically to the statistics body.The TV series Industry, which is produced by HBO and airs on the BBC, follows the lives of a group of young investment bankers in London as they compete to rise up the ranks of their sector. Over four series, starting in late 2020, it has become a huge hit in the UK and the US.The incident, which appears in episode three of the latest series,shows the characters Sweetpea Golightly and Harper Stern impersonating ONS field agents in Sunderland to access the home of someone they believe is inadvertently helping a company to defraud its investors and customers.The ONS said its interviewers send a letter before any house visit and carry a photo identification card with an “authority number” that can be checked with an ONS helpline.Tierney has invited Davie and the BBC to meet its interviewers and look at the “challenging and vital work they do”.The fashion choices in Industry have also been attacked. In a blogpost accompanying Tierney’s letter,the ONS saidthat, while its field agents were allowed to choose their work attire, it was “unlikely they’ll turn up on your doorstep, as the impostors do in Industry, looking like a flight attendant”.The letter comes as the ONS faces scrutiny over the quality of its statistics, after problems with the accuracy of data including employment, GDP and inflation figures, which expertspreviously saidleft policymakers “flying blind”.The“deep-seated”problems have partly been caused by overstretched resources as well as sharp declines in survey responses.Some City economists expressed surprise at the ONS’s attack on Industry, arguing that the show did not depict anyone in a particularly good light.Simon French, the chief economist at the investment bank Panmure Liberum, said: “If that is Darren’s major issue with Industry,he has been focusing on the wrong bits … Can I write a letter saying that City workers are worried that BBC is portraying us all as sex-mad, drug-peddling sociopaths?”The BBC declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsBBCTelevision industryOffice for National StatisticsTelevisionDramanewsShareReuse this content"

Officials were told by Simons’ team that the former adviser was “suspected of links to Russian intelligence”.The extraordinary disclosures are contained in emails that Simons and his chief of staff at Labour Together sent to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a division of the spy agencyGCHQ, in 2024. A spokesperson for Simons, a Cabinet Office minister, said: “These claims are untrue.”Why did Labour Together orchestrate a smear campaign against journalists? – podcastRead moreThe emails, seen by the Guardian, lay out in detail what Simons and his team wrote to intelligence officials in an effort to get them to investigate the sourcing behind a story in theSunday Timesabout Labour Together’s failure to disclose political donations.When informed by the Guardian about what had been communicated about them to intelligence officials, some of those named in the emails accused Simons of orchestrating a “McCarthyite smear” campaign that left them feeling “violated”.Simons commissioned an American lobbying and public affairs agency, APCO Worldwide, in late 2023 toinvestigate the “sourcing, funding and origin”behind the story.He has in recent days claimed he was disturbed to find the APCO report had delved into unnecessary information about one of the Sunday Times journalists. But the emails show how, weeks after receiving the report, he was involved in naming the same journalist in an email to intelligence officials.Simons and his chief of staff at the thinktank, Ben Szreter, told the NCSC they suspected the Sunday Times article may be linked to a wider “coordinated effort to discredit” Labour Together in order to undermine Keir Starmer and his then chief adviser, Morgan McSweeney.View image in fullscreenMcSweeney at the Labour party conference in 2025.Photograph: Ryan Jenkinson/Ryan Jenkinson/ShutterstockSimons has been facing calls to resign over his decision to commission the APCO report into the story, which revealed fresh details about the £730,000 of undeclared donations to Labour Together.The Electoral Commission had fined the thinktank more than £14,000 for failing to declare the donations. At the time of the undeclared donations, Labour Together was run by McSweeney. He used it in an effort to defeat Corbyn’s leftwing faction of the party andpropel Starmer to power.Simons is under investigation by the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team, which is looking into his role in commissioning and disseminating the APCO report. His spokesperson declined to say whether Simons had disclosed his emails with intelligence officials, which cover a two-week period in January and February 2024, to the Cabinet Office team investigating him.Facing growing pressure in recent days, Simons has said in statements to the press that he was “surprised”, “shocked”, “distressed” and “furious” to discover the report he commissioned had “extended beyond the contract by including unnecessary information about Gabriel Pogrund”, a journalist at the Sunday Times. He added that the information relating to Pogrund had been “immediately removed” by Labour Together before the report was passed on to intelligence officials.However, the emails seen by the Guardian show that when Simons and Szreter passed the report to intelligence officials, they named Pogrund and his Sunday Times colleague Harry Yorke and suggested their story could be linked to a Russian disinformation campaign.View image in fullscreenGabriel Pogrund of the Sunday Times.Photograph: Aidan Synnott/ASV Photography LtdThey also passed on highly personal information about Paul Holden, a freelance reporter who was credited inthe Sunday Times report. In one email, Simons told officials that material published by the Sunday Times may be linked to “people known to be operating in a pro-Kremlin propaganda network with links to Russian intelligence”.There is no credible evidence any of the journalists were involved in a pro-Russian campaign, or that their story, published in November 2023, was anything other than a public interest report on the prominent thinktank’s breach of electoral law.‘Likeliest culprit is the Russian state’The emails show Simons approached the spy agency in January 2024 in an apparent attempt to persuade it to investigate the sourcing behind the Sunday Times story.Earlier that month, Simons had received the 58-pagedossier he had commissionedfrom APCO. The contract stipulated that APCO would, for £36,000, provide “a body of evidence that could be packaged up for use in the media in order to create narratives that would proactively undermine any future attacks on Labour Together”.As the investigative news site Democracy for Salerevealed earlier this month, APCO’s report suggested – without evidence – that the Sunday Times story was based on data hacked from the Electoral Commission, which it linked to Russia.On 23 January 2024, Simons contacted the NCSC with information. A source close to Simons told the Guardian the approach was “to report concerns” that information in Holden’s book may have been obtained following an illegal hack.When officials requested further information, the emails show, Simons replied: “I will review your questions with my team immediately and come back to you as soon as possible.”Two days later, his chief of staff, Szreter, emailed the intelligence officials a response to their questions, attaching a truncated version of the APCO report and copying Simons into the thread.Szreter’s email to the NCSC was written under the direction of Simons, according to a source close to the Labour minister. The chief of staff was “basically a PA”, the source said, and his emails to the NCSC paraphrased and quoted excerpts of the APCO report. A second source confirmed Szreter’s email was “drawn directly” from the report.The email sketched a theory about the origins of the Sunday Times’s story on Labour Together, which he wrote was a “thinktank close to senior Labour party figures including Sir Keir Starmer and his adviser, Morgan McSweeney”.The email noted the Sunday Times story had been “written by Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke” and pointed out it had credited Holden as having provided documents, which were also going to form the basis of a book by Holden and articles to be published by an American journalist.“We suspect that the articles may be a coordinated effort to discredit Labour Together in order to undermine Mr McSweeney and, by extension, Mr Starmer in the run-up to next year’s general election,” wrote Szreter, who is now a Labour special adviser.“We do not believe that any of the sensitive and closely guarded Labour Together information was leaked by an insider. We believe we have been the victim of a hack by ‘hostile actors’. As the information was disseminated to pro-Russian journalists linked to other ‘hack and leak’ operations, we believe that the likeliest culprit is the Russian state, or proxies of the Russian state.”By then, GCHQ had identified China – rather than Russia – as beingbehind the hack of the Electoral Commission. In their emails, Simons and Szreter made other spurious connections to Russia, based on Holden’s private life.“We understand that Paul Holden, the pro-Corbyn investigative journalist who obtained the documents, is currently living with Jessica Murray,” Szreter wrote. “Jessica Murray is daughter of Andrew Murray, a political adviser to Corbyn during his leadership of the Labour party. Andrew Murray is a highly controversial figure who is suspected of links to Russian intelligence by MI5.”In the author’s note of his recently published book, Holden discloses “in the interests of transparency” that he has a family relationship with Andrew Murray, who is his partner’s father.View image in fullscreenAndrew Murray (right) with Corbyn at a pro-Palestine march in 2025.Photograph: Matthew Chattle/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesHowever, at the time of Labour Together’s emails to the NCSC, Holden’s relationship with Murray’s daughter was not publicly known. Contacted by the Guardian, Holden said that due to his role working on sensitive investigations, he had taken steps to protect the identity of his home address.“It is hugely disturbing [that] this investigation even found out where I lived and with whom,” Holden said. He accused Simons of seeking to smear him in an “absurd and chilling” episode that “could have had real material consequences for ongoing sensitive work”.A source familiar with APCO’s investigation said that Trace IQ, a fraud investigation tool, had been used to identify Holden’s home address and the names of other residents living there. APCO has been approached for comment.In his emails with the intelligence officials, Simons also alleged that Holden, who is a member of the National Union of Journalists, was “part of a far-left network … which disseminates pro-Russian propaganda”.Holden told the Guardian the claims were absurd, saying he and his colleagues had “faced legal and extra-legal threats” as a result of their investigations into Russian oligarchs. He added: “[I think] it shows just how scared Labour Together were about my investigations into what really mattered: the deeply suspect circumstances around the failure to declare £730k in donations in violation of the law.”Holden’s partner, Jessica Murray, said she was a “private person” and felt “deeply violated and vulnerable” after learning of the efforts to find where she, Holden and their young family lived. “To then connect it to false allegations about Russian criminality, which are then relayed to the security services, is disturbing, creepy and deplorable,” she said.Andrew Murray said: “The allegation that I have or have ever had any links with Russian intelligence is a lie.”He added: “This appears to be a McCarthyite smear by Josh Simons, who is clearly unfit to hold any form of government or public office, to attempt to divert attention from the failures of Labour Together to comply with electoral law and to prompt a spurious security service investigation based on nothing more than innuendo and falsehoods.”Allegations briefed to papersAfter a brief assessment, the NCSC decided not to investigate the allegations made by Labour Together about the origins of the Sunday Times story. In the emails, Simons appeared frustrated when intelligence officials did not address his concerns.In an email on 31 January 2024, he told security officials: “Our evidence suggests that sensitive personal and political information obtained in this hack that was only held by the Electoral Commission and our lawyers has been disseminated to people known to be operating in a pro-Kremlin propaganda network with links to Russian intelligence.“This has serious implications for British democracy and national security. The information obtained, we believe, could be used to destabilise and disrupt the UK electoral process.” He implored the officials to take action, adding that Labour Together’s information revealed the risk of “an attack on the UK political realm ahead of a general election”.Simons added: “If NCSC do not wish to engage further, could you advise on the appropriate public body who can help to ensure Labour Together has not been caught up in a hack by a hostile actor on the regulator of UK election.”The Guardian understands that the NCSC had a meeting with Simons, but ultimately advised him they would not investigate his report. They also pointed out that information leaked to journalists could have been obtained in various ways.Simons appears to have been undeterred. In the following days, Labour Together and its representatives are understood to have briefed national newspapers – including the Guardian – with allegations about Holden, hacked material and Russia.At the time, Holden was approached for comment. None of the allegations Labour Together was circulating about him were published by any news organisation. Holden recently showed the Guardian his source materials, which indicate the story was based on files leaked from the Labour party by whistleblowers.Get in touchContact Henry Dyer about this storyIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Henry using one of the following methods:Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

She was 81.Murdoch-Mann’s death was reported Friday bythe New York Post, one of her ex-husband’s media properties.During 31 years of marriage, Murdoch-Mann was reported to have played an active role in the building of Murdoch’s media empire, News Corp. She and Murdoch also had three children: Elisabeth, James and Lachlan, who is now the chair of News Corp.View image in fullscreenAnna Murdoch-Mann with Lachlan Murdoch, James Murdoch and Rupert Murdoch (L-R) in New York City in 1987.Photograph: Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty ImagesThe pair split in 1998 after Rupert Murdoch’s affair with Wendi Deng, who became his third wife. Murdoch-Mann said she was forced off the News Corp board in the wake of that split.Their divorce was finalized in 1999, with Murdoch-Mann receiving a reported $1.7bn from the settlement. Just a few weeks after the finalization of the divorce, Rupert Murdoch married Deng on his yacht in the New York harbor.Murdoch family reaches deal to resolve succession fight over media empireRead moreIn October 1999, Murdoch-Mann married the Wall Street financier William Mann. They were married until Mann’s death in 2017. She then married Ashton dePeyster in 2019.Murdoch-Mann granted atell-all interviewwith Australian Women’s Weekly in 2001, opening up about the difficulties in her marriage to Rupert Murdoch. She said he was “extremely hard, ruthless, and determined that he was going to go through with this no matter what I wanted or what I was trying to do to save the marriage.“He had no interest in that whatsoever.”View image in fullscreenAnna Murdoch-Mann, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, photographed in 1988.Photograph: Paul Harris/Getty ImagesIn the same interview, Murdoch-Mann also expressed fear at the idea of her children competing to be their father’s successor, and she included her stepdaughter, Prudence, the daughter from Murdoch’s first marriage to model Patricia Booker, as one of those children.“I think they’re all so good that they could do whatever they wanted,” she said. “But I think there’s going to be a lot of heartbreak and hardship with this [fight for succession].”That dynamic inspired the hit HBO show Succession.In September 2025, it wasannouncedthat Lachlan Murdoch – Rupert Murdoch and Anna Murdoch-Mann’s eldest son – would secure control of the sprawling media empire that his father created, which includes Fox News, theWall Street Journaland the Times in the UK. His three oldest siblings were left to receive an estimated $1.1bn each for their shares in the business.Murdoch-Mann was born Anna Torv in Glasgow, Scotland. Her father, Jakob Torv, an Estonian merchant seaman, and her Scottish mother, migrated to Australia in 1944 when she was nine years old, settling in Sydney’s western suburbs. Biographers of Murdoch suggest the young Anna had a difficult childhood after her parents split, raising her younger siblings.But she rose to become a reporter at the Sydney Daily Mirror and later the Sydney Daily Telegraph. It was while working as an 18-year-old cadet journalist at the Mirror that she first met and interviewed her future husband, who had just bought the paper.She also authored three novels – In Her Own Image (1985), Family Business (1988), and Coming to Terms (1992)- and became involved in philanthropic causes benefiting children.View image in fullscreenAnna Murdoch-Mann with her son, James, in 1985.Photograph: Michael Brennan/Getty ImagesA devout Catholic, she often cited her faith as her anchor during the public unravelling of her marriage and her subsequent exit from the News Corp board.She held leadership roles at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Haiti’s Hospital Albert Schweitzer and in 1998 was made a Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II.Murdoch-Mann was also the aunt of multi-ward winning Australian actress Anna Torv. In a piece of life imitating art, the younger Anna Torv starred in the hit Australian series The Newsreader, portraying a high-profile news anchor navigating the cutthroat corporate media world of the 1980s - an era during which her aunt was the most powerful woman inside the real-life Murdoch empire.Explore more on these topicsUS newsRupert MurdochFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

At about that same moment, “early versions of true super intelligence” could emerge, Sam Altman, the co-founder ofOpenAI, said this week.It’s a looming coincidence that raised a charged question at theAI Impact summitin Delhi, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi: can India avoid returning to the status of a vassal state when it imports AI to raise the prospects of its 1.4 billion people?Modi’s hunger to harness AI’s capability is great. He compared it on Thursday to a turning point that resets the direction of civilisation, such as “when the first sparks were struck from stone”. The most common analogy heard among the thousands of visitors to the summit was the dawn of electricity, but Modi was talking about fire.View image in fullscreenVisitors at the AI Impact summit in Delhi.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyHis desire to use AI to supercharge Indian economic growth is matched by that of the big US tech companies. OpenAI,Googleand Anthropic all played prominent roles at the summit, announcing deals to get ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude AIs into more people’s hands.The Trump administration, seeing AI as central to its battle for supremacy with China, was clearing the path for the three AI companies. The US government signed the Pax Silica, a technology agreement that bindsIndiacloser to US tech and away from Beijing.Countries that do not embrace AI could be left behind, says OpenAI’s George OsborneRead moreAt the signing, Jacob Helberg, the US under secretary of state for economic affairs, emphasised the threat from China if India should even think about looking elsewhere for its AI. “We have seen the lights of a great Indian city extinguished by a keystroke,” he said, in an apparent reference to asuspected Chinese cyber-attackon Mumbai in 2020.India lacks the semiconductors, power plants and vast gigawatt datacentres to go it alone. In common with most other countries, it faces a choice between US and Chinese AI models. Which they choose could have profound consequences for who controls India’s future, because if AI’s power emerges as predicted, it will not only tweak economic and social structures, but become their new bedrock.Stuart Russell, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, who closely follows India’s progress, said: “If we get to AGI [artificial general intelligence], AI is going to be producing 80% of the global economy. All manufacturing, most agriculture, all services will be just done; managed by AI, produced by AI.”View image in fullscreenThe US government signed the Pax Silica agreement, which binds India closer to US tech and away from Beijing.Photograph: Rajat Gupta/EPAImagine, he said, an Indian village priced out of having a health centre. In the future, AI could design the hospital and “along comes a bunch of giant quad copters carrying the materials, and a bunch of robots come and assemble everything. Two weeks later, you’ve got a hospital.”In this scenario, technology becomes integral to a country’s wellbeing. Elements of sovereignty can be fought over, but how successful that will be remains to be seen. AI’s power is such that its controller gains enormous leverage.Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, told the summit: “It may sound absurd, but AI can even help India achieve a standout 25% economic growth.” If that were to happen, it would take India to a per-capita GDP in a decade that is equivalent to Greece today. How could a leader resist?Modi’s tech secretary, Shri Krishnan, said India realised it must ally with like-minded countries to ensure it did not become “enslaved”. It is a high-stakes decision.India appears unlikely to turn to China, for now. It has the AI models, but there are tensions on the Himalayan border, and Chinese companies and leaders were scarce at the summit.Will India thrive with US AI?Silicon Valleycompanies talk of cooperation not control. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global policy, said: “We don’t see India as a customer, we see it as a strategic partner.”US officials framed the deal with India as an alliance of two nations that “broke centuries of colonial rule”, and as “two great democracies saying we will build together”.The Guardian asked Michael Kratsios, Donald Trump’s science and technology adviser, if India risked being controlled by the US under a form of digital colonialism.“I would say it is actually the opposite,” he said. “Any country that builds on top of the American AI stack will have the most open, independently controlled, secured stack the world has to offer. And that is why we are soon keen to share it with so many countries that are prioritising their AI sovereignty.”View image in fullscreenA visitor takes part in a virtual reality demonstration at the summit.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyRussell sees another possibility. “I think the American companies want to get in at that high-school and middle-school level to create basically a bunch of AI addicts who can’t tie their shoelaces without the help of AI,” he said. “Silicon Valley has always been about eyeballs.

The news shook markets, which werealreadyfebrileover concerns that AI agents would replace jobs and decimate the market for global software companies.In the new arrangement,Nvidiawill invest in OpenAI in return for its stock, with no commensurate commitment for OpenAI to buy its chips.OpenAI’s next funding round will reportedly raise about $100bn and involveinvestmentsfrom Amazon, SoftBank and Microsoft, the Financial Times reported. The expected $730bn valuation would put the maker of ChatGPT just behind SpaceX as one of the world’s most valuable privately held companies.However, questions remain over its ability to turn a sustainable profit out of its sky-high investment, especially given that it is burning through cash while losing market share to competitors. ChatGPT’s market share has declined from 86.7% to 64.5% in the past year, and it is nowtrailingAnthropic in the market for enterprise software.OpenAI has started to testadstargeted to users of ChatGPT, but it is unclear if this is a clear path to profit – and resulted in Anthropic, its rival,attackingthe practice in a series of high-profile advertisements earlier this month.SoftBank, one of OpenAI’s main backers, said on an earnings call last week that “nothing has been decided” on the subject of its anticipated forthcoming investment in OpenAI, although it madebillionsof dollars last year on its current holdings in the company.Meanwhile, OpenAI appears to be diversifying beyond Nvidia’s graphics processing units, announcing deals with rival chipmakersincludingAMD andBroadcom.At least one of those deals also has a question hanging over it, however, after Broadcom’s chief executive, Hock Tan,toldinvestors in December that the company did “not expect much in 2026” over the OpenAI investment.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaOpenAIAI (artificial intelligence)Technology sectorChatGPTnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the final cost will be far higher once inflation is taken into account as EDF gives its cost estimates in 2015 prices.The chief executive of EDF, Bernard Fontana, said the new forecasts were “more realistic” and added the 2030 startup was “within a range that has not changed” since 2024,when it said operations would start between 2029 and 2031.Once operational, Hinkley Point is expected to generate about 7% of Britain’s electricity demand. EDF’s successor project at Sizewell C in Suffolk is expected to generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of 6m British homes.UK energy bill payers are expected topay more than £2bn a year in subsidiesto EDF for the electricity generated at the nuclear plants once they are online. The fixed price is subject to a government contract, meaning it will not rise to cover an increase in costs.The first new nuclear plants to be built in the UK since the 1990s are considered a central plank in the government’s plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels to meet its legally binding climate targets.But the projects have faced criticism by running over time and over budget. EDF’s only other nuclear project using the same reactor type, at Flamanville in France, reached full operations in December after a delay of more than 12 years, in which costs ballooned from an initial estimate of €3.3bn to more than €13.2bn.The one-year delay at Hinkley Point contributed to a slump in full-year earnings for EDF, which is under financial pressure as it prepares to start construction on six new reactors in France, and complete the Sizewell C project – where it holds a 12.5% stake.The company reported full-year earnings of just over €29bn for 2025, down sharply from €36bn the year before. The decline was due primarily to a fall in generation across the UK, France and Italy, combined with lower wholesale market prices.EDF’s full-year earnings from generating electricity in the UK fell by a third from the year before to €2.3bn after longer unplanned outages, particularly at its Hartlepool nuclear plant, and a busier maintenance programme combined with lower market prices.Get in touchContact the Guardian Business teamThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

It was double the surplus recorded in January 2025.Retail sales in Britainsurged by 1.8% in January, the largest monthly increase in almost two years and partly driven by sales of artwork and antiques sales in January, alongside continued strong sales from online jewellers.Rounds of heavy discounting and post-Christmas sales drew customers back to bigger-ticket purchases, with furniture and tech among the biggest-selling categories over the past three months.On both fronts there were caveats. January is traditionally a strong month for self-assessed tax receipts, potentially flattering the public finance numbers, while retail sales got an artificial bump from jewellers seeing “unprecedented” levels of demand, the ONS said, amid soaring gold prices.But the figures were further boosted by polling that showed momentum across the UK’s private sector, with a survey showing the fastest rise in activity since April 2024.The flash poll of UK purchasing managers by S&P Global found there was “a robust and accelerated upturn in new work” at UK companies this month, with companies in the manufacturing and services sectors reporting solid rates of business activity expansion.That work upturn followeda fall in inflation to 3%in January from 3.4% in December, fuelling expectations that the Bank of England will soon cut interest rates again.“The economy started the year looking a lot healthier and will give the chancellor something positive to point to in her fiscal statement on 3 March,” said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at CapitalEconomics.It adds up to give Reeves more headroom at the spring statement, with government borrowing running about £8bn below the OBR’s full-year forecast and government borrowing costs having fallen since November.Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the chancellor could “probably bank on having a bit more headroom than she had in the autumn budget” as a result.But Wood cautioned that the economic outlook beyond the spring statement was less certain, amid plans toraise fuel dutylater this year for the first time in 15 years, with the revenue impact difficult to predict.The government will also have to navigate the Gorton and Denton byelection in Greater Manchester on 26 February, in what will be a significant test for Keir Starmer.“Politically, the situation is still difficult,” said Horsfield. “There are plenty of hurdles yet to be overcome.”While the cooling of inflation has raised hopes of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England, analysts also cautioned that any cuts would themselves be a product of an economy still struggling for momentum.Unemploymentrose to a five-year highof 5.2% in the final quarter of last year, particularly among young people, while Friday’s PMI data showed job losses continuing for the 17th consecutive month in February as firms responded to higher employment costs.“One swallow does not make a spring,” said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. “Fundamentally the UK economy remains weak and vulnerable and the high levels of unemployment, particularly amongst the young, hint at a difficult future ahead.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsRachel ReevesOffice for Budget ResponsibilityEconomic policyGovernment borrowingInterest ratesnewsShareReuse this content"

What a career. I sincerely believe Duvall was the best actor in a generation of best actors: De Niro, Pacino, Hoffman, Nicholson and more. What made Robert stand above these other figures was how he disappeared into a part. There was no Duvall persona. He was invisible. There were just the characters he played. He could do loud and angry – see his sublime turns inThe Great Santinior his seminal Colonel Kilgore in Apocalypse Now. Yet I loved his quieter performances more, which would slowly sneak up on you, pull you close and then blow you away with the brilliance of his choices and the risks he took.Particularly later in his career, when his fellow luminaries were busy cashing cheques playing parodies of their most famous characters, Robert was still pushing the boat out. Check out his turn in The Judge, or the complexity of his performance in The Apostle. Over the next few days, there will be the usual encomiums, which will focus on a handful of roles, and yet there is so much more to Duvall’s legacy that I urge readers to seek these other, less famous performances out. I would also add Frank Hackett inNetwork, or Scott Briggs in Wild Horses (which he directed), Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies (for which he deservedly won an Oscar), or Earl in A Family Thing. Or at least revisit his most famous role: Tom Hagen in The Godfather. What a performance.

I was a beginner in the thriving tango scene. One evening at La Nacional, a popular milonga, my partner and I noticed that Robert Duvall and his Argentine partner were in attendance. Here was the legendary Robert Duvall guiding his elegant partner through the crowd, confirming the rumour that he loved tango. Later in the evening, my partner and I ended up just behind them in tango’s counter-clockwise meander around the floor. Suddenly Duvall changed course just as my partner was extending her leg behind her in an embellishment. It took all of my nascent milonguero skills to guide her narrowly past Duvall’s new path. In that near-collision all I could picture was his struttingKilgorefrom Apocalypse Now, raining curses on me. I think he would have understood my beginner’s misstep, but to this day I’m thankful not to have collided with him!Eric, 50, Berlin‘A sheer variety of roles’I’ve always admired the sheer variety of roles thatRobert Duvallwas able to cover so well – from Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, to his western roles, where I believe he excelled. His acting was so superb, it was easy to buy into his character completely, which only makes a film so much better. His kind does not often come our way.Brian Thompson, Portland,Oregon, US‘He treated us graciously as fellow artists’An actor’s actor without being a type. He was his roles. The roles were not him. Back in 1977, me and my friend Barry Lane, both of us university theatre students, met backstage with Duvall after his performance in American Buffalo. We spent about an hour with him talking about acting. He was genuinely interested in our theatre studies and treated us graciously as fellow artists. Such an incredible actor and human being.Edward Schneider, 72, Berkeley, California, USView image in fullscreenRobert Duvall as Boo Radley with Mary Badham as Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird.Photograph: Universal/Allstar‘Packs a punch no other actor could match’An aspiring actor friend of mine told me how he was in awe of Duvall’s ability to make an impact on a movie, no matter how small the part. Boo Radley was one example, he said, but another, less appreciated performance he pointed to is in The Conversation. It’s a tiny, uncredited role but the way Duvall delivers a line like: “Just, put it on the table” packs a punch no other actor could match.When I was in college I worked as a furniture mover in New York City. One day in 1984, soon after Robert Duvall won the Oscar for Tender Mercies, I was working a job on the Upper West Side. It was a lovely spring day and the job was winding up. I was standing on the back of the nearly empty truck looking down the street, and lo and behold I saw Robert Duvall walking towards me. He had a cowboy hat on and was walking with a woman by his side. As he approached the truck, I said quietly in his direction: “Hey, congratulations.” He glanced up, gave a little grin in my direction, said, “Thanks!” and kept walking.David, UK‘He will be terribly missed in Virginia’Besides always loving his movies, with lots of favourites including To Kill a Mockingbird, Open Range, Something To Talk About, Secondhand Lions and, of course, Lonesome Dove, I lived in the area of his beloved farm. I would see him occasionally at local restaurants and horse shows, though I never got up the courage to approach him. He was just one of the folks that lived here in God’s country.

Joining Oscar Wilde and Noël Coward on the list was an actor and raconteur singled out by Allen as “a big hero of mine”, and feted by everyone from Orson Welles to Judy Garland, Maggie Smith to Morrissey.“I wanted to mentionKenneth Williamsbecause he was so profound,” Allen tells me. “And yet, because he was also funny, that profundity hasn’t been acknowledged. As a child, I connected with his outsiderness. Rather than trying to fit in, he went in the opposite direction. Not only did he not apologise for being different, but he was queer in every sense, truly at odds with the world in which he found himself.”View image in fullscreenComedian Tom Allen.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverWilliams, born to working-class London parents 100 years ago, on 22 February 1926, was close to ubiquitous in British culture in the second half of the last century. On stage, screen and radio, from bawdy comedies to chatshows and children’s entertainment, his adenoidal voice was inescapable. Up and down the class scale it slid, swanee whistle-style, from sandpapery cockney to Sandringham pomp, the elasticated vowels so capacious you could run around in them.Physically, too, he was unique. He described himself as a “dried-up prune-like poof” but the reality was more arresting: he was like a living Gerald Scarfe caricature, the flared nostrils wide as shotgun barrels, the twitching eyebrows telegraphing disdain, prurience or relish, the pinprick eyes glinting at whichever punchline or put-down was coming over the horizon. When he tipped his head back and peered at the audience down his knife of a nose, he had the look of an anteater about him. But his species of comedy – erudite and highfalutin one moment, vulgar the next – put him in mind of an altogether different creature. “Perhaps it’s my duty to be a sort of mosquito,” he said. “Someone’s got to continually remind people that we are animal.”Michael Sheen, who played him in the 2006 BBC filmKenneth Williams: Fantabulosa!, believes this was a vital part of his appeal. “He would be chatting about something intellectual and high-class, then suddenly be talking about his bumhole,” he says. “That lent him a sort of danger and spontaneity. He’s like a commedia dell’arte character, or the fool or trickster in mythology – he delights in pricking pomposity and turning expectations upside down. It’s about saying: ‘This is what is respectable. Buthereis the murky stuff underneath.’ There was nobody better at doing that than him. What David Lynch did for America, Kenneth Williams did for Britain, but in the form of light entertainment.”double quotation markWhat David Lynch did for America, Kenneth Williams did for Britain, in the form of light entertainmentWilliams is best known today as a mainstay of the coarse, innuendo-drenchedCarry On films. He whinged, snorted and scoffed his way through 26 of them, including Carry On Cleo (“Infamy, infamy, they’ve all got it in for me!”) and Carry On Camping, which distilled his curdled, priggish essence into one indelible image: Barbara Windsor’s bikini top being catapulted on to his horrified face during an overenthusiastic morning workout.His final contribution to the series came in 1978 in the dismal Carry On Emmannuelle [sic], in which he plays the French ambassador, continually refusing sex with his young wife (Suzanne Danielle) on account of an injury sustained during a naked parachuting accident. His co-star – now Suzanne Torrance – remembers him as kind and cheerful. “He was the ultimate professional,” she says. “He treated me so well and never acted like the star.” His nude scenes – he drops his underwear twice within the film’s first 10 minutes – were a particular delight for him. “Oh, he loved showing his bum.Lovedit. He joked about his bottom hanging in pleats.”View image in fullscreenWilliams with Hattie Jacques – and Barbara Windsor’s bikini top – in Carry On Camping, 1969.Photograph: LMKMEDIAThere was far more to Williams, though, than his Carry On tomfoolery. In 1950, he understudied Richard Burton as Konstantin in a Swansea production of The Seagull. Orson Welles, who directed Williams on stage in London in Moby Dick, tried to persuade him to come to New York to play the Fool in King Lear. Judy Garland knew his sketches by heart, having “worn out the grooves” of the vinyl recordings of his 1959 theatrical revue, Pieces of Eight (in which hisunderstudy was firebrand-to-be Ken Loach, who later said of him: “He was very nice … but he could be capricious. Sometimes, he just cut you dead”).View image in fullscreen‘The ultimate professional’ … Williams with Suzanne Danielle and Jack Douglas in Carry On Emmannuelle.Photograph: Danton Rank Organisation/RGR Collection/AlamyPeter Cook, who wrote some of the material in that show, predicted Williams “could be the funniest comic actor in the world”, while the critic Kenneth Tynan saluted his “matchless repertory of squirms, leers, ogles and severe, reproving glares” and anointed him “the petit-maître of contemporary camp”. After Williams’ death in 1988, Morrissey praised “his bomb-shelter Britishness, his touch-me-not wit, his be-ironed figure, stylishly non-sexual” and noted that “his facial features were as funny as anything he ever said”.Maggie Smith, who became Williams’ close friend after starring with him in the 1957 revueShare My Lettuce, called him “an enormous influence” and admitted: “I pinch from him all the time.” Until she worked with him, said Smith, she had “never thought of colouring things as vividly as Kenneth does. I’d never thought that one could make a speech that alive.” More than two decades after his death, he was still inspiring her. The biographer Roger Lewis credits the comic as one of the sources of Smith’s performance in Downton Abbey. The desiccated, withering Dowager Countess of Grantham, Lewis wrote, amounts to “Lady Bracknell as played in drag by Williams”.As a youth and during his national service, Williams worked as an apprentice cartographer. But what put him on the comedy map were his stints on nationally adored radio shows such as Hancock’s Half Hour and, later, Round the Horne. On Hancock’s Half Hour, which drew listeners in the millions, Williams played a rogues’ gallery of irksome neighbours and popularised a snivelling catchphrase: “Stop messin’ about!” He proved such a hit that the show’s star,Tony Hancock, jealously demanded he be written out.On Round the Horne, Williams and Hugh Paddick played the camp duo Julian and Sandy, whose banter, written by Marty Feldman and Barry Took, consisted entirely of double entendres and the gay slang Polari. A prohibition on explicit language facilitated some of the filthiest innuendoes ever heard on British radio. Called upon by the avuncular host, Kenneth Horne, to spruce up the surroundings, Williams exclaimed: “Interior decor? Oh yes, Mr Horne, we’ll shove a couple of creepers up your trellis.”View image in fullscreen‘Stop messin’ about!’ …  Williams in 1971.Photograph: Don Smith/Radio Times/Getty ImagesFirst broadcast in 1965, two years before the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality between males over 21 in England and Wales, the sketches were subversive as well as funny. “The whole thing was outrageously rude and queer,” says Allen. “In a subtle, mainstream way, he changed attitudes hugely in this country. He was a queer person who people could love through laughter, and that was massive.” Not that Williams’ relationship with his sexuality was straightforward. Squirming shame had always been part of his comedy, and he often recoiled from effeminacy in other men.Reviewing his autobiography, Just Williams, in 1985, George Melly wrote: “Someone who disliked him intensely couldn’t have done a better hatchet job.” But the extent of Williams’ self-loathing became apparent only with the posthumous publication, in 1993, of an edited collection of the diaries he had been keeping since his teens. Most of his vitriol was turned on himself, though others came under fire, too, whether colleagues (special enmity was reserved for his fellow Carry On regular Sid James, as well as for Hancock) or people of colour: “[Enoch] Powell was right, they should have stopped immigration years ago,” he wrote in 1979.Now the world also knew the tortured, if barren, state of his sex life. “He would always say he was homosexual by nature, not practice,” says David Benson, who first played him on stage in 1996 in Kenneth Williams: Think No Evil of Us and is now touring My Life With Kenneth Williams. “He was celibate, and this intense internal pressure and conflict was partly what drove his comedy.” Sheen agrees: “The sense of not wanting to be penetrated by anything is central to him,” he says. “I don’t just mean sexually. He created this baroque personality that could so easily collapse if touched. It was to be admired only from the outside. There’s something wonderful about that but also tragic because it required that nobody get too close.”No one did. Though that doesn’t mean he was a cold fish. Glyn Grimstead, who was 18 when Williams directed him in a 1981 London revival of Joe Orton’s four-hander, Entertaining Mr Sloane, remembers him as “absolutely delightful. Ken and I would catch the train home together. He’d get off at Great Portland Street and I’d go on to Plaistow. For me, it was a Professor Higgins/Eliza Doolittle relationship. I was very cockney, Ken wasn’t. He would teach me new words, correct my grammar. I loved it. Only later did I realise he came from the Caledonian Road [in London] and was as rough as I was. He was always jolly and lively. You would never have suspected he was desperately unhappy until you read the diaries.”View image in fullscreen‘His adenoidal voice was inescapable’ … Williams on TV in 1970.Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty ImagesTurning misery into comedy had always been Williams’ speciality. “He would go on chatshows and say, ‘Ooh, I had a terrible night with my bowels. Agony, it was!’” says Benson. “People would fall about laughing but this was real pain he was talking about, as we know from the diaries. It wasn’t a joke, but he made it one, which is admirable.”Williams had vague plans for his dotage. “I pay in a pension fund for when I’m over 60,” he said in 1967. “I’d like a cottage by the sea.” In fact, he died in his spartan London flat in the block where his beloved mother lived, less than two miles from where he was born. He was 62, the same age at which his father, a gruff hairdresser who scorned his son’s plummy tones and camp manner, had died. Williams always maintained that his father’s death from drinking poison had been suicide rather than an accident. An equivalent ambiguity hung over his own death from an overdose of barbiturates; the coroner recorded an open verdict. The final line in Williams’s diary (“Oh – what’s the bloody point?”) has been widely interpreted as a suicide note, though it was also a familiar expression of the despair that surfaced repeatedly throughout the millions of words in those journals.“He regretted not being taken seriously,” says Allen. “The great tragedy is he did something enormously serious through his comedy, which he could never realise or acknowledge. He wasn’t seen as an activist, and would probably hate to have been. What we sometimes forget, though, is that radical action comes in many forms.”‘The second night, he wore a deerstalker like Sherlock Holmes’: Ian McShane on working with WilliamsIn 1965, Williams playedInspector Truscottin the first production of his friend Joe Orton’s black comedy,Loot. After56performances, during which the cast had to learn three different drafts while touring, the production closed inWimbledon, south London. Williams called it “the most painful period of my life”. The cast included a 22-year-old Ian McShane. His recollections today contrast with Williams’ contemporaneous diary entries.View image in fullscreenIan McShane in 1962, about to make his screen debut in the Ralph Thomas film The Wild and the Willing.Photograph: Michael Hardy/Express/Getty ImagesIan McShane:Ken was funny and charming. He and I got on very well. A couple of times we had dinner together at his favourite restaurant, The Seven Stars, in Joe Lyons’ Corner House. An Angus steak, a prawn cocktail and a black forest gateau: the height of sophistication. I also went back to his “rooms” as he called them, near Regent’s Park, and we had tea and a chat and worked on our lines. I was very fond of him.Kenneth Williams:Ian McShane came back … He is v. willing and greatly talented. I like him. This morning I corrected him on a wrong reading of a line and said, “If you’d read the script properly, you wouldn’t make such a mistake …” and he said he’d been hurt by my shouting that at him in rehearsal. I apologised. One continually forgets how sensitive people are.(27 January 1965)IM:Rehearsals were terrific until a couple of weeks in, when I think Ken started to get scared. I remember during one heated discussion, I said, “Can’t we just do the play?” and that earned me a withering look from Ken. There were constant calls for rewrites. That didn’t faze Joe, because he could come out with that dialogue in his sleep.KW:Script in rags. Cast is utterly demoralised. I shouldn’t have set foot near this rotten mess.(10 February 1965)IM:The production was overshadowed by Ken wanting to be funny all the time. If he wasn’t getting a laugh, he would resort to sticking his bum out or doing 17 different accents. The first night was bizarre. We opened in Cambridge and he came out dressed in a black raincoat. It was like, “What the fuck is he doing?” He looked like the Gestapo! The second night, he wore a deerstalker like Sherlock Holmes. He was genuinely funny – he just got nervous about the material. It was meant to go to the West End, so it was sad to finish in Wimbledon of all places.A West End production in 1966 was a hit.

Unsurprisingly, there is no happy ending.Although every character in the novel is stalked by tragedy, few suffer as much as Isabella Linton. Unaware of Heathcliff’s vindictive motives, she becomes trapped in an intensely abusive marriage, one she is only freed from by fleeing to London. While she is undoubtedly a victim, in the end the character also has agency; Isabella is able to escape her abuser, though not without considerable scars. It’s a pivotal moment for her character, and one that she’s been stripped of in Emerald Fennell’s quote-unquote “adaptation”.Fennell is no stranger to courting controversy, with much criticism directed at the film, chiefly regarding theconspicuous “whitewashing” of Heathcliffanderasure of regional authenticity. Having already expunged Heathcliff’s ethnicity to facilitate a romantic fantasy, Fennell has reduced Isabella to a willing BDSM participant; chained and treated like a dog, she consents to this humiliation. Though this may seem like a tantalising scene for those unfamiliar with the source material, Isabella has essentially become the dog that Heathcliff hangs in the novel. Once you have that context, it’s rather difficult to look past the fetishisation of Isabella’s degradation.Wuthering Heights is at its heart a story of class and race. Emerald Fennell has got it all wrong | Rhiannon Lucy CosslettRead moreWhile some have argued that Fennell’s creative decision gives Isabella agency rather than removing it, the film Isabella is a narrative tool for Heathcliff rather than developing in her own right. She becomes yetanother victim of “fridging”, a term coined by Gail Simone that references the way in which many female characters are disposable, depthless plot devices who are only there in service of another – usually a man.Fennell has rejected suggestions she significantly altered the source material.In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, the director argued that while she “visually added some things” to the dog scene, it is “almost all Brontë”. Jacob Elordi offered an alternative view of the scene, remarking on how it depicts Heathcliff and Isabella going “off the deep end” as they live in a “kind of hell” of their own making. Interestingly, Elordi also adds how Heathcliff’s relationship with Isabella emphasises how his obsession with Cathy has devolved into “rabid desperation”, as if that excuses Isabella’s fetishisation. Yet, if anything, it only reaffirms that her character affects Heathcliff, with her bondage an extension of his experience and not her own.Even more troubling is that Isabella’s so-called consent mirrorswhat is termed the “rough sex defence”. For decades, defendants have argued that they caused harm, sometimes lethally so, through willing acts of rough sex. The onus is placed on the victim; they’re the cause of their pain because they apparently consented. It’s one of numerous ways of excusing violence against women, and while legal reform has come about because of its flagrant misuse, abusers still readily pass the buck of blame.For abuse survivors, to see Isabella become an objectified caricature is alarming. Whether intentional or not, it sends a worrying message to viewers whose only interaction with Wuthering Heights is through Fennell’s girlypop smut rather than Brontë’s gothic masterpiece. Fennell’s execution is deliberate. It’s designed to shock – a cheap, sexually charged attention grab, and one that misses the point of the generational trauma Brontë explores through Heathcliff’s actions towards Isabella. A crucial piece of the puzzle is eradicated. By turning Isabella into a consenting submissive, Fennell implies that Heathcliff’s actions, while still perverse, are easier for audiences to swallow. His behaviour seems less monstrous. Sexy, even.View image in fullscreenBreaking boundaries … Alexander Skarsgård and Harry Melling in Pillion.Photograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentUnfortunately, romanticising abusive relationships isn’t a feature of Fennell’s work alone.The recent film Pillion, based on Adam Mars-Jones’s Box Hill, also removed the tougher material of the original book to make it more palatable. What was originally described as rape in the book becomes a consensual exchange, albeit one that still lacks clear boundaries. Ultimately, what was intended as a dilution of Box Hill’s murky waters ends up only muddying them further. In a bid to remove accusations of sensationalism, the excision of Box Hill’s rape scene romanticises abuse. It’s less explicit, but the message is still there.Still, Pillion is uncomfortable to watch, with the extreme dynamics of the relationship between Ray and Colin making for a more unvarnished portrayal than what we witness in Wuthering Heights. Fennell has repeatedly cited her teenage reading of the book, and this has coloured her interpretation; with its lavish cinematography and extravagant design, her film contains no transgressive complexity nor genuine discomfort.Brontë’s Wuthering Heights is a story of violation. It isn’t meant to be arousing or provocative; it’s about unhealed trauma that poisons everyone it touches. Brontë’s world of anguish cannot and should not be reconciled with the kind of fanciful naivety that Fennell espouses. The film-maker has robbed Isabella of her story to sell a grotesque sexualisation of a domestic abuse survivor.Explore more on these topicsFilmWuthering HeightsEmerald FennellFilm adaptationsEmily BrontëSexcommentShareReuse this content"

He dots the I’s and crosses the T’s; the film-making is forthright and wholehearted though not unsubtle.The film is set inSingapore, criticising the city-state’s conformism and infatuation with the rich and western prestige, and satirically showing the high-wire dangers of its entrepreneurialism, as attempted by the poor. Koh Jia Ler plays Junyang, a goofy, good-natured but shiftless twentysomething guy who lives with his widowed father Boon Kiat (Andi Lim) in a cramped rented flat. Junyang is about to finish his military service and now needs to figure out what to do with his life – but he certainly doesn’t to work on his dad’s noodle stall, that humble business that puts food on their table. His girlfriend Lydia (Regene Lim) is far more aspirational, a gifted pianist with her sights set on university. Lydia’s stern, churchgoing single mother – hardened by her own husband walking out on them both – does not approve of Junyang one bit.Chen shows us a romantic crisis in the lives of father and son happening in parallel. Junyang and Lydia opt to lose their virginity in a massively expensive one-night stay at Singapore’s mega luxurious Marina Bay Sands hotel, the icon and centre of its international prestige. That results in pregnancy for Lydia, and her mother grimly insists Junyang does the right thing and marries her. At the same time, shy, decent-minded Boon Kiat falls in love with one of his drinks waitresses or “beer aunties” – the smart, kindly, seen-it-all Bee Hwa (Yeo Yann Yann). I was reminded of a maxim from film-maker and critic Mark Cousins: if you want your film to be a success, include a wedding scene. Chen exuberantly gives us two, for father and son.So now the two couples, one with a baby, have to live together in the tiny flat – a far cry from Marina Bay Sands and the glitzy beachfront apartments that Junyang is now selling in his new job as flashy estate agent. (He has the western name of “Steve”, after Steve Jobs.) Tellingly, Junyang/Steve gets drunk while celebrating a supposed sale to a smooth buyer whose promised deposit hasn’t yet come though – and bizarrely tries to use the bathroom in the show apartment, only to discover the water doesn’t work. Similarly illusory is the promise of easy money by selling medicines via social media.There’s some addictively brash storytelling here from Chen, with a page-turning novelistic energy and a marvellous sympathy for the whole cast.We Are All Strangers screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSingaporeFamilyRomance filmsAsia PacificBerlin film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

You’ve probably heard about this thing: it’s the new movie that’s based on bits and pieces of JRR Tolkien’s esteemed high-fantasy epic that were only mentioned in passing during the three original three-hour movies, and didn’t get much more of a mention in the extended cuts that came out later.In the original novels, Gandalf reveals to hobbit Frodo Baggins that he and Aragorn, AKA Strider, AKA the future King of Gondor and Arnor, searched for decades for the creature Gollum in an effort to find out what might have happened to the ring he once held. In the new movie, though, things will be different. According to McKellen, Aragorn will take charge of the quest to find Gollum, while Gandalf will operate more like a wizardly mission controller. “The script is designed to appeal to people who like Lord of the Rings,”McKellen told the Times. “It’s an adventure story, Aragorn trying to find Gollum with Gandalf directing operations from the sidelines.”So it seems the wizard will be putting his feet up while his Númenórean pal does most of the heavy lifting.Meanwhile, earlier this month,the Tolkien fan site TheOneRing.net revealedwhat it insists is an official synopsis for the new Andy Serkis-directed film:“Before the Fellowship, one creature’s obsession holds the key to Middle-earth’s survival – or its demise. In The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, we meet young Sméagol – an outsider drawn to trinkets and mischief – long before The One Ring consumed him and began his tragic descent into the tortured, deceitful creature Gollum. With the ring lost and carried away by Bilbo Baggins, Gollum finds himself compelled to leave his cave in search of it.Gandalf the Grey calls upon Aragorn, still known as the ranger Strider, to track the elusive creature whose knowledge of the whereabouts of the ring could tip the balance toward the Dark Lord Sauron. Set in the shadowed time between Bilbo’s birthday disappearance and the Fellowship’s formation, this perilous journey through Middle-earth’s darkest corners reveals untold truths, tests the resolve of its future king, and explores the fractured soul and backstory of Gollum, one of Tolkien’s most enigmatic characters.Directed by original cast member Andy Serkis, produced by Peter Jackson, and written and produced by Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens – the creative team behind the Oscar-winning trilogy – this live-action movie bridges the beloved films with new characters, returning heroes and a deeply engaging origin story that resets the stage for, and changes everything you know about, the legendary Lord of the Rings trilogy.”There’s much to unpick here, if the synopsis is to be considered genuine. Firstly, this sounds almost like a Gollum biopic rather than the scattered fragments of backstory we were told in passing during the original trilogy. Sméagol was only briefly described, retrospectively, as “young” in Tolkien’s books, and only appeared on screen in his hobbity, pre-ring-grizzled state during the opening of The Return of the King film, where he stole the One Ring from the doomed Déagol because the latter had the misfortune to find it on his birthday.View image in fullscreenTricky comeback … Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn in The Return of the King in 2003.Photograph: New Line Cinema/AllstarThe writers can of course go wherever they want. Perhaps we will meet Gollum’s mum and dad, a gently bickering riverside couple, or maybe we’ll see his first day at hobbit primary school. And why stop there? If modern franchise logic holds, this could be just the first instalment in the Sméagol Cinematic Universe, perhaps to be followed into multiplexes by Gollum Begins, Gollum: The Reckoning, and Sméagol v Shelob: Dawn of Snacktime. By 2035 we may well be watching a six-part prestige drama on Now TV about the early economic conditions of the Gladden Fields, narrated in solemn tones by Cate Blanchett.All of which rather underscores what The Hunt for Gollum actually represents, and it’s not pretty. Tolkien wrote vast, elliptical, gorgeously expansive and detailed mythic histories in which entire wars are summarised in half a paragraph and crucial events occur off-page because the author had the good sense to know that not everything needs dramatising. Hollywood, however, has developed a horror of empty space. If a character once spent three sentences doing something, that now constitutes at least one feature film, two streaming spin-offs and a tie-in podcast. This, sadly, is the trap into which Serkis, Jackson and the rest of the once-garlanded Lord of the Rings team have fallen – and the danger is that, in trying to wring every last story from Middle-earth, the franchise may end up leaving Tolkien’s world feeling rather like Bilbo himself under the ring’s influence: thin, stretched, and scraped like butter over too much bread.But back to Gandalf. Once a roaming wizard of mystery and myth, he now finds himself reduced to Middle-earth’s first remote operations manager, dispatching Aragorn while monitoring his mate’s progress from the high-fantasy equivalent of a group chat. And yes, it’s probably a better idea than recasting the role, but the suspicion is that Serkis et al. knew they couldn’t get away with that after Viggo Mortensen politely pointed out thathe would only be up for returningif the character’s age somehow tallied with his own – which, given the timeline, rather complicates matters since he is now 67. Recasting a single major character, for a movie most Tolkien fans never actually asked for, would be one thing. Replacing two would start to look like a Middle-earth tribute act wheeled out because the nostalgia mines must be kept operational at all costs. The unfortunate suspicion is that this is exactly what happened.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekLord of the RingsJRR TolkienIan McKellenAndy SerkisPeter JacksoncommentShareReuse this content"

It encapsulates the rule-breaking, improvisational spirit of the French New Wave – all jump-cuts, handheld camerawork and blithe indifference to typical plotlines – as Jean-Paul Belmondo’s impulsive, on-the-run criminal Michel woos Jean Seberg’s American student Patricia in a vividly depicted Paris.Sunday 22 February, 12.35am, Talking Pictures TVPaul McCartney: Man on the RunView image in fullscreenPath finding … Paul McCartney: Man on the Run.Photograph: PrimeAnother day, another Beatles film. But Morgan Neville’sdocumentaryis a fascinating time capsule, covering the period from 1969 – when the Fab Four split – to 1980 – when John Lennon was murdered. Voiceover interviews with McCartney, his family and fellow performers, plus home movies and private photos, provide an intimate look at an effortlessly creative if only intermittently brilliant musician trying to find his way as a solo artist. And despite recreating the band format (rather profitably) in Wings, it’s clear he was really just playing at being equal.Friday 27 February, Prime VideoIn the Blink of an EyeView image in fullscreenConnections … Rashida Jones and Daveed Diggs in In the Blink of an Eye.Photograph: Kimberley French/Searchlight PicturesThere are major 2001: A Space Odyssey vibes to Andrew Stanton’s new live-action sci-fi adventure, though Darren Aronofsky’s epic, muddledThe Fountainalso springs to mind. The WALL.E creator’s ambitious film about life, death and humanity crosscuts between three timelines: a Neanderthal family; a present-day love story betweenRashida Jones’s anthropologist and a fellow student (Daveed Diggs); and a 25th-century scientist (Kate McKinnon) on a spaceship en route to colonise a new planet.Friday 27 February, Disney+Dead of WinterView image in fullscreenCharming  … Emma Thompson as Barb in The Dead of Winter.Photograph: Vertigo/PAIf you’ve a yearning to see Emma Thompson packing heat, then this is the film for you.

Thompson plays tackle shop owner and recent widow Barb. Her ice-fishing trip at a remote lake is interrupted when she finds a young woman (Laurel Marsden) being held captive by a gun-toting couple (Judy Greer and Marc Menchaca).

A leftwing congresswoman even introduced abillto grant him the title of “honorary citizen”, claiming it would “build another cultural bridge between Brazil and its Spanish-speaking sister nations”.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny at his Super Bowl performance in California earlier this month.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesThe DJ Rafael Takano, 40, has been hosting Latin music parties in São Paulo since 2016 and said demand has never been as high as it has been since last year. His party !SÚBETE! now has a carnival street-bloc edition and will host parties after Bad Bunny’s concerts.“Especially withDeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS[whichwonthis year’s album of the year Grammy], Bad Bunny conveyed a message and an aesthetic that are very universal for Latin America … and has made it easier for Brazilians to see themselves as Latin,” said Takano.Brazilians were exultant when Bad Bunny said “God bless America” before naming almost every country in Latin America and the Caribbean – Brazil included – during his Super Bowl performance, and manyidentified deeplywith symbols such as the young boy sleeping across three chairs at a wedding.“Bad Bunny brings a cultural weight, and we end up recognising ourselves in his narrative,” said Leandro Rodrigues, 28, one of six volunteer administrators of the fan accountBad Bunny Brasil, who will travel 1,550 miles from the Amazonian city of Belém to São Paulo for the concerts.Thiago Soares, who coordinates a research group on Music and Pop Culture at the Federal University of Pernambuco, said that unlike the “more commercial appeal” of Shakira – who was recently announced as the headline act at this year’s free concert on Rio de Janeiro’s Copacabana beach – Bad Bunny broke through in Brazil “in a different way, aligned with a more anti-American agenda of emancipation”.The heightened interest among Brazilians in anoutspoken criticof Donald Trump’s anti-immigration policies may have been fuelled by the US president’s tariffs and his attempts to interfere in Brazil’s judiciary, whichinflamedBrazilian nationalism, as has happened in other countries targeted by the White House.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny performing in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Photograph: Gabriel Sotelo/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“When Bad Bunny began to succeed abroad, I doubted he would fill a stadium here. And now he is filling two consecutive nights,” said Soares, who nevertheless added that the artist was “not yet mainstream”.“Unlike Shakira or Ricky Martin in the past, he doesn’t have songs in soap operas and does not collaborate with Brazilian artists … He is a social media phenomenon which is more closely associated with a certain Brazilian cultural elite.”At the Super Bowl, Bad Bunny challenged the meaning of ‘America’Read moreEven so, Bad Bunny became the first non-Brazilian Latin artist to place a solo track in the country’s Billboard Hot 100 list – others had done so before, but only in collaborations with Brazilian singers.“It moves me because I recognise that in Brazil people listen more to Brazilian music, and I didn’t even do something like collaborate with artists from there,” Bad Bunny recentlysaidin a joint interview with Vogue and GQ Brasil.Brazilians do love their own music – there were no foreigners among the 10 most-streamed artists in 2025 on Spotify. The language barrier could be a factor, given that fewer than 1% of Brazilians are estimated to speak Spanish or English fluently, yet anglophone artists were still more widely listened to and accounted for all five of the most-streamed foreign acts.For Takano, this is a result of US “soft power”: Brazilians are taught from an early age to look more towards the US than to their Latin American neighbours.“The US culture has always been heavily marketed to us, promoting the so-called American way of life. Now, because of the internet, we have access to other things as well, and we are seeing the emergence of a Latin way of life,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnySuper BowlPuerto RicoBrazilAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She explains why she’s fighting for her fellow council estate kidsSupported byAbout this contentFri 20 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAlthough she is on course for pop stardom, with two nominations at next week’sBrit awards, 22-year-old Skye Newman lives in a cabin at the bottom of her sister’s garden in London. It’s the backdrop for the music video to her song Hairdresser, which has 7.5m views on YouTube. In the clip, she is made up, her hair in rollers, lounging with a gaggle of friends. Licking her fingertips to roll a joint, she laments a one-sided friendship with another woman: “When I’m needed, know I’ll be there first / You don’t reciprocate and, girl, that hurts.”It’s typical of Newman’s songcraft: ballad-driven contemporary soul that goes beyond romantic heartbreak to cover all kinds of pain and recrimination.The cabin gives Newman independence, but also proximity to family in the main house – which is where she is sitting today, barefaced, barefoot and drowning in an oversized black tracksuit. Her sister, who is also Newman’s manager, pops my tea on to the table and hovers nearby. The sisters each have their blond hair slicked back into topknots. Today is a busy day and tomorrow they fly to the US where Newman has two sold-out shows.Watch a video for Skye Newman: HairdresserNewman’s family is the subject of her biggest song to date, Family Matters, which is nominated for song of the year at the Brits (she is also up for breakthrough artist). It lays bare the pain that she experienced growing up: phone calls from the police, drug abuse in her home, a brush with death. “At school, weed was my perfume,” she sings. “Then my brother’s drugs got harder / It became substance abuse, so he’s a stupid bastard.”Understandably, she guards the details of her family history closely, but the accumulation of stresses that she and her siblings were living with contributed to her having two life-threatening seizures, being admitted to hospital and having tests for a tumour or bleed on the brain. As for the situation she sings about in Family Matters, she says: “We all just tried to love him, because that’s all you can do. It’s weird to grieve for someone who is still alive.” In the comments for the song on YouTube, fans earnestly offer support to Newman and compare her to Amy Winehouse and Adele.Newman shares some qualities with those two generational talents: a voice that could move a rock, energy that fizzes as she speaks and that magical ability to distil a sentiment in a way that feels completely personal to an audience of millions. One key difference is that she was twice rejected from the Brit school, the performing arts institution from which both Adele and Winehouse graduated.Instead, as a teenager she started posting performance videos on social media, which blew up during the Covid lockdown. She was initially hesitant to reply to the calls that soon followed from A&Rs and record labels. “I come from a vulnerable background and there are vultures in this world,” she says. “People jump on that.”The council estates she grew up on taught her a lot more besides, and she attributes her storytelling to the range of people she saw as she moved around south-east London living with various family members: “Life can be hard but I love the way I grew up because I got to experience and understand people,” she says. “It made me very empathetic.”She is passionate about putting a spotlight on people who grew up in similar environments. “There could be so much more love and education put into people who have less because there is so much knowledge in those places; there’s so much talent but they don’t get the same opportunities.”View image in fullscreenNewman on stage with Ed Sheeran in Ipswich, his home town, last July.Photograph: Mark SurridgeAnother artist who shares these sentiments isEd Sheeran, who recently made a plea to the governmentto invest more in music in the school curriculum. He asked Newman to do a support set at his Ipswich homecoming in 2025, where they also performed together. “He’s the sweetest man. He’s just so normal, same as Lewis,” as in Capaldi, who she supported on tour last year. “I’m drawn to them people, because that’s how I am. I’m not above nobody, nobody’s above me.”Ahead of our interview, her team shared some unreleased music including The Woman I Am, a flawless piano ballad about the female relationships that have held her through difficult times. Here, Newman’s voice sounds softer and more controlled than it is on her breakthrough songs.I ask about the times when she needed that support. “My whole life,” she says with another laugh. “My whole life, I feel like there’s been …” Then her voice wobbles and there are tears. Her sister shuffles over in her slippers and wraps her arms around Skye.double quotation markThere’s no better feeling than knowing that something I’ve gone through has done something for others“I hate saying it because I feel like it sounds like ‘poor me’,” Newman says, still crying. “I’m good; I’m a very fucking strong person, I’ve got lots of strong women around me. But it’s never-ending. That’s the circumstances that I’m in, with family and things.”Again, she holds back from outlining those exact circumstances. She gathers herself: “I’m grateful, because it means I can write so much music that helps so many other people.” A lot of them have told her as much. “It breaks my heart every time I have to hear that, especially from kids,” she continues. “But there’s no better feeling than knowing that something I’ve gone through has done something for them. I feel powerful. It makes me feel great to know that they’re not alone. That I’m not alone.”She also writes vividly about the toxicity that can tear relationships apart. On Out Out, she pleads with a closed-off partner: “Is it really that hard to just love me loudly?” It’s the sort of relatable sentiment that speaks to women of her age, and older. “Not having solid role models to look up to in the space of men, it’s quite hard to then pick the right person,” she says. “I feel like I attract hurt and I attract brokenness. I also fight for things that I shouldn’t.”View image in fullscreenNewman  at Koko, London, in September.Photograph: Jessie MorganOn her recent single Lonely Girl, Newman speaks to teenage girls like an older sister: “Please don’t let him take control / He’s far too old / To be the one that takes you home.” The song was inspired by a friend of hers who, aged 15, was involved with a 21-year-old. Newman says many friends have experienced such predatory behaviour, and she herself was chased and intimidated by men when she was as young as 12.“I got more attention from men, builders, from the age of 12 to 16, and then it just got less and less as I got older,” she says. Then she asks: “As a grown woman, do you really get catcalled in the street as much as you did as a child?” The question takes me by surprise, but the answer is no. “A lot of it is about control,” Newman concludes. “There’s men that do it that are paedophiles, and then there’s the men that do it because they’re like: well, you can’t do anything about it.”double quotation markWe’re in hell, mate, and we need to work our way to find inner peace. On the other side of that is heavenA fire gets going inside her. “Most men think that a woman is frail, weak and dependent. No, we’re not. A feminine woman is independent.” She moves from having her feet tucked under her to stretching out and gesticulating. “It winds me up. We need to go back to women ruling the world.”During The Woman I Am, she sings “our cycles are in sync, it’s bigger than you think”. “We’ve been knocked off of our fucking cycles [by men]. We’re meant to be in sync with the Earth and nature: it’s Mother Nature for a reason,” she says, carrying on riffing, pointing out that there are species that procreate without male input. “I honestly do believe women used to be like that. We got fucking bored and we created the man. Because what are you? You are half of what we are. You’re just our chromosomes with a leg knocked off.”She says she believes in another power above her, though not a male God figure. “I don’t believe that this” – our world – “is everything. If anything, I think this is hell. We’re in hell, mate, and we need to work our way to find inner peace. On the other side of that is heaven.”View image in fullscreenSkye Newman after performing for Radio 1’s Sound of 2026 live sessions, with the station’s presenter Jack Saunders.Illustration: James Watkins/BBCIt’s enjoyable watching her go off like this, with a power she has evidently snatched back for herself and channelled into her songs. That process has probably saved her life, she thinks. After experiencing those near-death seizures, brought on by emotional distress, she then “flipped my thinking” and stopped bottling things up. She started writing. “It’s how I let everything out healthily. I don’t know what I would do without it.” One of the songs she wrote then, not yet released, is a real tearjerker as she sings: “I’m going to be selfish with my life, because it’s mine.”‘Addiction teaches you a lot’: breakout pop star Lola Young on sex, substances and self-loathingRead more“I felt like that song was God, the universe, my auntie, whoever, showing me that if you think about yourself, and you put good back into yourself, then your body will naturally give back to you,” she says. “That’s just what happened.” She was signed to a major label and in January she topped the BBC’s Sound of … poll, the breakthrough artist contest won in recent years byChappell RoanandPinkPantheress. “Hairdresser went off, Family Matters went off, everything just went. People say: how do you do it? And I’m like: your thoughts are so fucking powerful!”As her star power also increases, she says she is mindful of “not falling into the whirlwind of this”. With so much turbulence in her life before this new chapter, she is happy to be close to her sister with her own space to breathe – “I enjoy sitting in my cabin with my friends, smoking weed, watching films and that’s it” – and she’s finding that in an industry that can be slippery and attract people with ulterior motives, she wants to protect herself. “I feel like a lot of this world is just kind of an exchange, and not in a good way. Scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours – and I’ll do it when needs be. But I just don’t feel the need to put myself in all of it. I’m quite happy with the people I’ve got in my life. I’m quite happy with my life the way it is. Quite happy with my cabin.”Skye Newman’sUK tourbegins 11 April at Mountford Hall, Liverpool. The Brit awards are on 28 February, screening on ITV.

The enigma suits the music he has been making and sharing under the alias since early last year: dark, dubby and complete with obscure vocal samples and titles such as Always Liked Scarecrows and Cursed Moor.Before he adopted the Paralysis name in 2025, the Bradford-based producer released music under Miles Henry for several years but that functional, techy production style has since taken a left turn. His new sound isswampy and gothic, and said to be inspired by northern folklore and mysticism– themes evoked in his chugging rhythms and cosmic flourishes. Recent tracks such as Eavesdropper, from his Folktronic EP and Snicket Rhythm, from Turf Step (both released via his own imprint Crying Outcast), sound as fit for a seance as they do a dancefloor. The deep low end lurks menacingly, as physical as it is audible.This month, Paralysis will release his new EP Don’t Forget the Ritual on the DIY label Emotional Especial. As the title suggests, the record is suitably eerie and hypnotic, with industrial clangs and whispers perforating the whirring synths and skittish percussion. Despite the concept, there’s plenty of variation here as big-room house music and shuffling big beat coalesce with post-punk, dub and new wave – an expansive approach that echoes the musicians who influence him, from Andrew Weatherall to African Head Charge. It’s a brilliant, assured record from a producer who is hitting his stride.Safi BugelThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenUnsettling … Lana Del Rey.Lana Del Rey – White Feather Hawk Tail Deer HunterLana makes the spooky intimacy of Disney’s early scores even more unsettling as she sings about how her embrace of domesticity may seem strange after years of “some trouble”.

The group’s debut album combines influences from Bulgaria to Bali, Ireland to Georgia, and establishes its mood of knotted, hypnotic locked groove from its opening track, Sterretjie (named after an Afrikaans word for the coastal tern bird, which also means “little stars”). Brett’s violin passes the track’s melody to Wolf-Light’s clarinet and Elliott’s accordion with a bright, sparkling swiftness.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for HederaMany other moments of joy, lithe and spring-like, lift these 12 tracks. Roberts’ waltz about a Cornish meadow, Mayflies in June, travels from minor key to major and back again, buoyed along by Elliott’s harp-playing. (Elliott similarly impressed on 2023’s So Far We Have Come, her Anglo-Egyptian album with oud player Tarek Elazhary.) Sekar Jagat (Balinese for “flower of the universe”) twitches sweetly into life on prepared harp and plucked strings, then makes hay with a melody originally written for gamelan; on Shen Khar Venakhi, a 1,000-year-old Georgian hymn that survived Soviet purges, all five women’s voices join together in a dense, glowing mass.Wolf-Light’s contributions on woodwind are particularly moving, often adding tension and dolour. Her bass clarinet playing in Threnody, a startling example of a taqsim (an improvised introduction in traditional Arabic and Middle Eastern music), is a highlight, while soulfulness burns in her breaths at the beginning of Koga Me Mama Rodila, a Bulgarian tune that ends with the women humming in harmony, then slowly fading into silence. When so much music fusing global traditions can drain it of its specificity, this is an album that masterfully twists together its influences, intensifying their colours. Like its ivy namesake, it clings to what it meets, embraces new places and keeps growing.Also out this monthPeiriant’s third album, Plant (Recordiau NAWR), named after the Welsh word for children, foregrounds Rose Linn-Pearl’s folk-inspired fiddle melodies against husband Dan’s startling palette of twisted, processed guitars and Moogs. The mood thrums with dark magic and melancholy.Finn Collinson’s third album, Byway (Old School Music), documents journeys and songs from across the UK and highlights an instrument rarely featured in traditional music: the folk recorder. Its gentle calls feel part of nature in tracks like Tune for a Linnet, strangely wise in The Complaint, and staunchly alert in Hare for Twenty.Pefkin’s Unfurling (self-released) also explores nature, but to more startling effect, using sounds from her viola, harmonium and electronics to map transformations of the land from winter into spring. Don’t miss its terrifying 12-minute track, My Breath the Sea, all eerie vocals and drones, evoking the journey of Irish saints crossing to Scotland by coracle.Explore more on these topicsMusicFolk album of the monthFolk musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

As neighbours arrive and music plays, we gradually learn the backstories of the main characters, from teenage Hanna, who is planning to run away from her pale, preoccupied father and house-proud, socially ambitious mother, to mysterious Rita, newly arrived from Australia to begin a new life, and shell-shocked ex-soldier Steve, whose paranoia is exacerbated by the shadowy figure watching the street. Like Godfrey’s debut,The List of Suspicious Things, this is not so much a whodunnit as a wonderful slow-burn story about friendship, community, and secrets within families, the choices we make and the lies we tell to protect ourselves and others, with the bonus of a terrific built-in soundtrack and a nostalgic vibe.View image in fullscreenA Sociopath’s Guide to a Successful Marriageby MK Oliver(Hemlock, £16.99)Former headteacher Oliver’s first novel centres on yummy mummy Lalla Rook, who lives with her banker husband Stephen and their young children Nelly and Nathan in the leafy north London suburb of Muswell Hill. It’s a privileged existence, but Lalla, who is not only admirably resourceful but also manipulative and utterly lacking in empathy, has her eye on a larger house in considerably pricier Hampstead as well as a place at an exclusive school for Nelly, who is already demonstrating that the antisocial apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Murder, body disposal, blackmail – Lalla will stop at nothing to achieve her ends, but things get complicated when it begins to looks as if the intruder she dispatched with a kitchen knife minutes before the start of four-year-old Nathan’s birthday party was trying to uncover her murky past. Told with gusto, plus wonderfully twisty plotting and lashings of lifestyle porn, this satirical thriller is the perfect antidote to the winter blues.View image in fullscreenA Bad, Bad Placeby Frances Crawford (Bantam, £16.99)Set in the late 1970s in the Possilpark district of Glasgow, an area riven by poverty, crime and sectarianism, Crawford’s superb debut is told from two points of view: 12-year-old Janey, who is walking her dog when she stumbles upon the body of a young woman; and her grandmother Maggie, who has cared for Janey since she was rescued, as a baby, from the gas explosion that killed her immediate family. Janey is afraid to tell the police all she knows, but finds herself caught up in the machinations of the grownup world. Maggie, who has secrets of her own, is desperate to protect her granddaughter, but poverty and lack of choice make her vulnerable, and the dead woman has connections to a well-known criminal family. A well-observed, well-told account of trauma, grief and the concomitant magical thinking, this coming-of-age mystery has flashes of humour and pathos that provide fuel for real suspense.View image in fullscreenHoly Boyby Lee Heejoo, translated by Joheun Lee (Picador, £14.99)Given that “parasocial” was Cambridge Dictionary’sword of the yearfor 2025, the first novel from this young Korean writer to be translated into English is nothing if not topical. Four women, each with an obsessive imagined connection to a handsome K-pop idol, band together to kidnap him, holding him captive in a mansion in the mountains surrounding downtown Seoul. As their backstories unfold, we learn the reasons for their delusions of intimacy with this complete stranger whom they compete to nurture and protect, but things become increasingly complicated when the son of the ringleader’s old acquaintance shows up unexpectedly. It’s a terrific premise, and although the storytelling is somewhat convoluted, Lee Heejoo does a wonderful job creating an unhinged, febrile tension and ramping up the sense of foreboding. However, the translation, which is stilted, overliteral and occasionally downright confusing, does the story no favours.View image in fullscreenA Stranger in Corfuby Alex Preston (Canongate, £18.99)For his latest novel, Preston has repurposed the tiny Ionian island of Vidos, from which both Corfu and Albania are visible, as “spyland”. It’s a sunlit version of the purgatory of Mick Herron’s Slough House, where compromised or burnt-out members of MI6 are “neither detained or precisely free”. In 1995, six years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Nina Woolf is sent there, suffering from PTSD. When shots are fired at her and an older agent as they walk in the woods, she accepts the explanation of trigger-happy Corfiot poachers, but when another of the old guard is found drowned, it looks as if the past may, at last, be catching up. The story then rewinds 50 years to a group of idealistic Oxford students who resolve to dedicate their lives to advancing the cause of communism from within the British establishment. This story of betrayal, disillusionment and the terrible cost of adherence to ideology is both compelling and humane.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupThrillersCrime fictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

He is off to read history at Wadham College, Oxford, one of the youngest in his cohort because national service is being phased out. Another World starts here, picking up the story left off in Back in the Day, Bragg’s previous memoir about his childhood and youth in this small Cumbrian town.Oxford to Bragg seems “more a theatre than a city, a spectacle rather than a habitation”. After his prelims, the weeding-out exams in his second term, he is left alone until his finals. He discovers Ingmar Bergman and has many earnest pub conversations about whether Pasternak will get the Nobel prize, or jazz is superior to rock’n’roll. He goes on the Aldermaston march and joins the anti-apartheid movement – although in hindsight he sees this as inspired by a residual faith in empire, with South Africa as Britain’s moral responsibility. Even after Suez, he owns a pencil sharpener in the shape of a globe on which the empire is “a continuous governing blur of pink”.Fortunately for the student Bragg, but less fortunately for this book’s narrative jeopardy, he fits right in at Oxford. The city’s cat’s cradle of narrow streets and ginnels reminds him of Wigton. The “shovel them in, feed them up and usher them out” ethos of Wadham’s dining hall evokes family holidays at Butlin’s. He soon abandons his Presley quiff for the same neat crop as everyone else, and adopts the unofficial undergraduate uniform: grey flannels or cords, sports jacket or blazer (the student body is overwhelmingly male). He has a knack for getting on with everyone, from dully decent Tories to artier types.View image in fullscreenMelvyn Bragg’s graduation photo, 1961Apart from a brief bout of homesickness when he hitchhikes back to Wigton and is treated as “a messenger from Olympus”, the three years pass without calamity. Our hero’s worst ordeals are an out-of-body experience while reciting the Latin grace before dinner at Wadham, and a brief depressive episode after he breaks up with Sarah. His tutor, the early-modern historian Lawrence Stone, is scrupulous and kindly, although the college warden Maurice Bowra’s explanation of his admissions policy (“Clever boys. Pretty boys. No shits!”) would raise eyebrows today.There is still the class system to negotiate, evident in subtle variations in the dress code (cavalry twills are the giveaway for the toffs) and the rooms allocated in college. One day Bragg bumps into the future TV dramatist Dennis Potter, who declares in his ripe Gloucestershire tones: “They say there’s three real working-class men here. There’s me. And you. Where’s the other bugger?” But Bragg demurs from the class chippiness of Potter’s 1960 book The Glittering Coffin (mentioned twice and confused, I think, with the Potter-fronted BBC TV documentary Between Two Rivers, one of a few repetitions and misrememberings in a book that could have done with a firmer edit). Mostly, aside from the Bullingdon Club’s casual nastiness, he finds the class system suspended for the university’s scholarly purposes. The snobbery, he decides, is “neither bruising nor even mildly offensive” and “easy to ignore”.Another World is at its best when viewing the university with the outsider’s eye of an amateur anthropologist. For this Oxford truly is another world, before the great university expansion of the 1960s, when the word “student” was not even much used. Bragg is an astute reader of the semiotics of his rooms overlooking the quad, and of the weekly tutorial, where he reads an essay out loud to Stone and awaits a reaction, like “the versicle and responses in medieval prayer”. The book would have been better for sticking to this anthropological impulse throughout, instead of turning, as it does, into another volume in the autobiography of Melvyn Bragg. Digressions on the subsequently stellar careers of his peers blur the focus. Still, the young Bragg is a winning protagonist, who presents much like his older self: thoughtful, open and generous in celebrating his contemporaries’ talents, while forgiving their foibles.Another World by Melvyn Bragg is published by Sceptre (£22).

And it worked. Once I’d entered a book, I didn’t want to come out. I remember how Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Match Girl turned my heart upside down. I was living with my grandmother at the time, and I cried under the blanket, terrified that one day she, too, would die.My favourite book growing upI read greedily and indiscriminately, picking books at random from my parents’ library. Thomas Mayne Reid’s adventure novels were favourites, especially The Headless Horseman. Jack London’s Martin Eden, too. Clearly, the idea of being both a hero and a writer appealed to me. Writers were not usually heroes. I also loved a textbook on criminology, which explained how to make invisible ink, what traces criminals leave behind, and so on – matters of extraordinary importance to any 10-year-old boy.Theauthorthat changed me as a teenagerAll novels that contained erotic scenes – because of the acute shortage of eroticism in the late socialist Bulgaria of the 1980s. Also around that time I discovered JD Salinger. I reread his stories obsessively, without being sure I understood everything. At 17, I decided to write him a letter, trying to provoke him into breaking his silence. Of course, I never sent it. Much later, that story found its way into my memoir, The Story Smuggler.The writer who changed my mindJorge Luis Borges. When the first translations of his work appeared in Bulgaria, I was 21, shortly before the wall fell – a crucial moment. It was as if I suddenly understood what literature is capable of, and how there are no real borders between genres. I had an exhilarating sense of freedom, but also of a shared secret. Memory, erudition, heart, science and myth – all of it was there.The book that made me want to be a writerThe poems of two tragic Bulgarian poets: Peyo Yavorov and Nikola Vaptsarov. I began writing poetry in secret. Later, I was found out.The book I rereadHomer’s Odyssey. We probably mentioned it or read parts of it at school, and perhaps that was what put me off it for so long. After turning 40, I began to truly understand it – and to reread it, seeing it differently each time. The theme of the father increasingly drew me in, the bond between father and son. Then there’s the great theme of return – not only the return home but also to the past – and memory, the question of who remembers us unconditionally and recognises us, like the dog. In my last two novels I have been in dialogue with this book again and again.The book I discovered later in lifeThomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain. It always stood out on my bookshelf, but for years I never reached for it. I imagined it would be very gloomy, heavy, full of endless reflection. When I read it in my late 40s it wasn’t love at first sight, but the story didn’t let me go. I love books I can converse with, even enter into Socratic arguments with. It was very important to me while I was writing Time Shelter. You think you write in solitude, but in truth you are in constant dialogue with other books and authors.The book I am currently readingThe Books of Jacob by Olga Tokarczuk.

The pair live in London but often travel, drawing the eyes of other guests, their skin glowing, their limbs artfully at ease. She writes affirmations on hotel stationery; he claims to taste notes of bark and tobacco in his chianti. As Sean Gilbert’s dark, observant debut opens in Istanbul, this apparently perfect couple bicker and sweat, for secrets lurk behind their facade – and one of them might be murder.An unexpected reunion gets their sightseeing off to a shaky start. The unnamed narrator and his wife, Elle, have not seen Benny for 15 years when they cross paths outside the Hagia Sophia. An irksome university acquaintance who has become a second-rate rapper, Benny has the grip of a limpet. As the trio browse stalls and pull on saliva-slicked shishas, talk turns to the past.Gilbert intersperses his Istanbul chapters with flashbacks to their university years at Cambridge, where we see the three in the orbit of charismatic cad Raph, who shines at the debating society. Elle goes out with him and is betrayed. The narrator pretends indifference, but watches him like a hawk. Benny lusts after Raph, but tells himself he couldn’t possibly be gay. In exam season in his third year, Raph is found dead in a punt on the Cam from an apparent overdose, a bottle of Puligny-Montrachet in his right hand, a rotting picnic at his feet and a recording of Titus Andronicus blasting from a speaker.The narrator is keen to get shot of Benny, but Elle is strangely reluctant to ditch him and the three end up on an excursion to a lonely Anatolian hostel, where gap year students strut their stuff and the tension becomes overwhelming. By now, Gilbert has detailed other traumas: a cruel sex tape, a disastrous social media post, a death in the family. We listen as the couple discuss violent urges – would they be able to bludgeon a nearby diner with a crowbar, or would poison work better? We learn that Raph confided in Benny before his death. But what does Benny know? And will the unhappy couple kill him for it?Gilbert has produced a clammy story of obsession that recalls American Psycho and The Talented Mr Ripley. It never matches the heights of either, but this unsettling work is at its best when he zooms in on his dysfunctional couple. He has a fine ear for their snipping, chiding dialogue and shifting codependence. An endless rehearsal of glamour and happiness has caught up with them: their routines are empty, their kisses “strangely contractual”. He claims he cannot live without her; she downs Xanax and vodka and thrashes in the night.No one here is happy: Gilbert’s thirtysomething trio exist in a world of shallow friendships in which families are cruel or absent. The younger group in the hostel are simply at an earlier point on the same road. Corporate work is grim (“You should love your cofounder more than your wife,” says one nearby digital nomad), but the attempts to satirise it, whether in Benny’s lumpen raps or tacky street art, fall flat. The book itself can struggle to make anything seem meaningful or appealing: Benny never overcomes his status as a bit-part player, while Raph, the apparently compelling catalyst of the Cambridge drama, feels devoid of charm or interest, and the university sections fall a little flat.Yet for a book about going through the motions, I’ll Be The Monster builds up a head of steam. There are great set-pieces: the bravura opening, in which Elle watches porn in a hotel lobby, looking for a familiar face; Benny’s social suicide backstage at a gig; Raph’s final voyage. Above all, the relationship at the novel’s heart is rendered with a sure touch. The question of the couple’s guilt bubbles nicely throughout: the troubled pair are perfectly credible as both unhappy fantasists and grim psychopaths. Their crumbling relationship drives this absorbing debut: the perfect surface, the curdled underbelly, the desperation and disdain.I’ll Be the Monster by Sean Gilbert is published by Duckworth (£18.99).

It’s ironic that the most technologically obsessed art form on the planet is just as watery-eyed about the past as cinema and music. And to prove it here is the new version of the legendary QuickShot II, a plasticky joystick from the early 1980s that wasn’t eventhatgood the first time round. It was, however, cheap and it resembled an actual fighter plane control stick with its multiple fire buttons and ergonomic shaft. If you wanted a rugged and precise controller you’d go for the Competition Pro, but that one didn’t let you pretend to be in Star Wars or Airwolf. Plus, the QuickShot II had suckers on its base so you could stick it to your cockpit control panel – sorry, I mean MDF computer table.The new QuickShot II from RetroGamesand Plaion Replai is almost an exact replica in terms of its dimensions. You can grasp it in your fist and wrap your thumb and forefinger around its large red buttons. Yes, you can stick it to your table; the designers have even included the original auto-fire switch at the rear for players who weren’t prepared to hit the fire button repeatedly while playing Green Beret.View image in fullscreenBurst of nostalgia … playing Truxton with the QuickShot II.Photograph: Bitwave Games/ToaplanIt has been tastefully updated, though. The two fire buttons on the stick can now be separately configured – a feature I yearned for as a youngCommodore 64fanatic so that I could independently control the laser and bombs in Skramble. There are also six buttons on the base, which align with standard joypad layouts, and the USB cable means you can plug it into a PC or any of the modern computer remakes released by Retro Games, such as the C64 or Spectrum. I tested it with the latter and have already spent many hours blasting through Ant Attack, Pheenix and Head over Heels.In terms of build quality, it’s a good balance of necessary updates and respectful nonaction. The stick itself has plenty of travel (you have to push it quite far to register movement), which is just as I remember. This made the QuickShot famously unsuitable for joystick-waggling titles such as Daley Thompson’s Decathlon as you had to move it a long way left and right, often causing damage to the joystick and indignity to yourself. At least now the designers have added microswitches so you get a nice click when the stick moves. The fire buttons, however, still have the same old soft click, and the sound and feel of them is one of the most warmly nostalgic parts of the whole thing. I spent so many hours of my teen years pressing those buttons – the sound is as hardwired into my memory as the smell of school dinners or the wash of the ocean against a pier.I also tried the QuickShot II withSteamand it worked absolutely fine after some simple calibration – although the auto-fire proved problematic. It was lovely to play the Steam version of classic shooter Truxton with this stick, returning me to memories of playing arcade games in Blackpool then going home and pretending my computer desk and joystick were an arcade cabinet. You think these feelings are gone but it doesn’t take much to bring them hurtling back – sometimes just a hunk of plastic will do it.If you’re looking for a serious modern joystick, this isn’t it. It’s low-budget and awkward and, despite an hour of configuring, I couldn’t get it to work with PC emulation platform RetroArch, which was a shame, though others may manage it. But this is the point: the QuickShot II was not the best joystick, it was the one we could afford. And it looked cool.I respect that the remake is true to that spirit. It is affordable and a little compromised. But if you owned one back in the day, it is a fun thing to have, and the fourth star in my review is for the absolute raw nostalgia of it. Every time I see it sitting there beside my hi-tech PC and big HD monitor, I smile. It’s good to have you back, old friend, with all your flaws and shortcomings.The QuickShot II is available now, £30.95.Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

In others, the clothes are collected, stained and stretched across towering steel frames resembling planes, trains or organic forms.Yin is showing a selection of these works in Heart to Heart,an exhibition occupying the lower floor of London’s Hayward Gallery. “Worn clothing acts as a narrator in my work … the lived experience is embedded in the fabric,” she says.View image in fullscreenYin’s Dress Box.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Beijing Commune.This sentiment is somewhat shared by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota, whose exhibition, Threads of Life, runsconcurrently on the second floor of the gallery. Using thread as her primary material, the Berlin-based artist weaves found objects such as suitcases, keys and letters into monumental web-like installations. “I want to create this feeling of shared experience and existence,” she says. “Memory exists inside each person, but it is also connected to objects in our daily life.”The two artists have exhibited on the same programme at biennials, but never in such close proximity. While their exhibitions are distinct, Hayward Gallery’s senior curator Yung Ma hopes that the artists’ overlapping interests will resonate between the gallery walls. “Both artists explore how textiles and found objects can carry identity and lived experience,” he says. Although they are roughly 10 years apart in age – Yin was born in 1963, and Shiota in 1972 – they rose to the international stage at around the same time in the late 90s. “Two female artists … with such strong overlapping interests – that feels significant,” says Ma.View image in fullscreenYin Xiuzhen’s Thought.Photograph: Yin Xiuzhen/Beijing Commune/Pace GalleryMemory and material are the most evident parallels in their work, but they approach it from different positions. “We use similar materials and objects, like suitcases, and an interest in various aspects of human existence within society, but our exhibitions have different focuses,” says Shiota.Both artists work with textiles, but Shiota’s use of yarn is more abstract. She started working with material in the 00s, but before that she was a painter and then a performance artist studying under Marina Abramović in Berlin. “With painting, you’re working in two dimensions, but by using thread, I could draw throughout the entire space,” she says. “As I continued working with it, the act began to feel very close to human relationships … Sometimes the thread looks like it’s connecting people; at other times, when my work becomes very tangled, it reflects moments when my own feelings are confused or unsettled.”View image in fullscreenChiharu Shiota’s Breathing from Earth.Photograph: Sabine Klem/DACS/Chiharu ShiotaThis material is the literal and figurative thread that ties collective memories and experiences together, represented by objects that Shiota collects from flea markets and donation boxes. Her work is deeply emotive and engulfing, crafted entirely by hand on site using thousands of balls of yarn. However, the result is not always inviting. During Sleepis an installation with a performance element in which women lie in hospital beds encased in a dense black thread. The performance, which will take place monthly across the run of the Hayward exhibition, represents Shiota’s interest in mortality and the fragility of life.These are themes that draw from her personal battles with ovarian cancer – first in 2005 and again in 2017. The first diagnosis was a “huge shock”, she says, arriving just as the artist was planning to have a child with her husband of three years. “The fear that I might not be able to give birth was very painful,” she says. After intense chemotherapy and surgery, Shiota recovered and was able to have a child. But after a 12-year remission, the doctors found a malignant tumour. “The second time was different,” she says. “At that point, it wasn’t a question of what to do next – it was a real possibility that I might die.” Shiota was just starting to work on her landmark solo exhibition, The Soul Trembles, at Tokyo’s MoriArtMuseum. “It was incredibly hard … I thought deeply about what happens to the soul and where it goes if I disappear.” The 2019 show became the second-most visited exhibition in the institution’s history. “I truly could have died,” says Shiota, whose cancer is now in remission. “Just being able to have that exhibition felt incredibly special in itself.”View image in fullscreenChiharu Shiota’s The Key in the Hand.Photograph: Sunhi Mang/DACS/Chiharu ShiotaWhile Shiota’s craft is informed by her inner landscape, Yin’s work is often a reaction to the changing world around her – “the perceptions and reflections of an individual life within the vastness of the world”, as she puts it. For her, clothing is a medium that is deeply intertwined with her personal life and her country’s history. Yin grew up during the Cultural Revolution, in a planned economy where new garments were a rarity. Luckily, her mother worked in a clothing factory, and every Chinese lunar new year she brought home scraps of fabric to sew new clothes for the family. Through her mother, Yin developed a kinship with textiles, and after graduating high school in 1981 she set her heart on studying art. She spent the next four years working as an interior painter while preparing for entrance exams, eventually enrolling in the Department of Fine Arts at Beijing’s Capital Normal University in 1985.Yin’s earliest work to feature clothing is Dress Box(1995). The artist gathered 30 years of her own clothes, placed them in her father’s wooden chest and sealed it with cement. Inside the lid on a bronze plaque are the following words: “These clothes are the clothes that I’ve worn over the past three decades; they carry my experiences, memory, and physical traces of time.” Yin is entombing the past, while reflecting on the transformation she has witnessed throughout her life. The artist has seen multiple tower blocks displace traditional houses and alleys; she has been forced out of her own studio more than once.View image in fullscreenYin Xiuzhen’s Thought.Photograph: Yin Xiuzhen/Beijing Commune/Pace GalleryPortable Citiesis an ongoing series that reflects on urbanisation. She collects clothes from people all over the world and repurposes them into miniature soft sculptures of their cities, housed in an open suitcase. For the Hayward show, she presents eight iterations of the project, including Beijing, New York and the latest edition, London. In the lead-up to the Hayward show, Yin collected nearly 180 items of clothing through a donation box at the Southbank Centre. “It forms a tactile map of the city in my heart,” she says. “Those who donated garments may be able to locate their personal contribution within the work.”Both exhibitions make full use of Hayward’s expansive space, featuring floor-to-ceiling installations visitors can walk through. Through collected objects, they map the experiences that connect us – and preserve the stories embedded in everyday things, long after we’re gone.Chiharu Shiota’s Threads of LifeandYin Xiuzhen’s Heart to Heartare at the Hayward Gallery, London, to3 May.Explore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It deserves to be heard again, for its remarkable feat of resourcefulness, prodigious child’s intelligence and great, against-the-odds narrative arc. A Malawian boy living through a climate of floods and drought that left his village facing famine, he builta wind turbine out of scraps, as a 13-year-old, to life-saving effect for his community.Following Kamkwamba’s memoir, co-written with Bryan Mealer, andChiwetel Ejiofor’s film, along with a much viewed and celebrated Ted Talk by Kamkwamba, this musical version of the story is its own distinct thing. Directed by Lynette Linton, it is an exuberant creation, filled with warm light, humour, a gorgeous grass-roofed set design by Frankie Bradshaw as well as vivid costumes (patterned fabric, bright colours, great headdresses) and vibrant African sounds and movement.View image in fullscreenAlways good-natured … Alistair Nwachukwu as William.Photograph: Tyler FayosePerformers excel in energetic choreography by Shelley Maxwell and it contains a big, loud West End energy that seems to expand beyond the edges of this stage and spill over. There is a nice rapport between the always good-natured William (Alistair Nwachukwu) and his friend, Gilbert (Idriss Kargbo), the cheeky son of the village chief who aids William’s learning after he has been dismissed from school for not being able to pay the fees. There is romance too, not only the warm, comfy chemistry between William’s parents but also between his older sister Annie (Tsemaye Bob-Egbe) and schoolteacher Mike (Owen Chaponda).This leavens the harder edges of the story but things stay too insistently feelgood, even in the face of hunger and famine when drought arrives, and the lack of nuance in tone becomes limiting. We do see William’s mother (Madeline Appiah) struggling with malaria, as well as his clashes with his father(Sifiso Mazibuko) and death all around the family. But the production glances at this darkness and withdraws from it too quickly, as if scared to diverge from the musical’s high mood. A re-emerging hyena (Shaka Kalokoh) symbolises the sense of danger in the village but simply stalks on and off, looking like an extra from The Lion King and carrying little threat.There is some superb percussion and drums, with songs variously filled with lamentation or celebration, along with spirited ululations. But while Tim Sutton’s music is always big on sound, with a few strong songs including Mphala Boys Power and This I Know, there are too many unmemorable numbers and some ropey singing voices too, along with an often bland book by Richy Hughes that renders characters rather too simplistic.William remains strangely unknown, as if eclipsed by the song and dance. His friendship with an adopted neighbourhood dog, exquisitely played by Yana Penrose, is another sweet feature, but you do not feel the emotional tragedy when it comes. At well over two hours long this drama of immense suffering – alongside a boy’s incredible determination to find a solution for it – is certainly life-affirming. But it does not get you in the gut, or squeeze the heart, as it surely should.AtSwan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 28 March.

Luckily, pianist Tamara Stefanovich had something else in mind.Titled Labyrinth, Stefanovich’s recital proposed an essay in sound in which Kurtág’s short piano works (many from ongoing series Játékok) were woven into and out of works by Debussy, Liszt and JS Bach. Performing this 90-minute cycle without pause, smudging the edges between pieces, Stefanovich paid homage to a composer whose sound world is alive with musical ghosts, drawing out its echoes and exposing its palimpsests.Bach’s early Capriccio for the departure of a beloved brother – an unusual, programmatic sequence of musical tableaux – stared into the mirror of Kurtág’s mercurial Eight Piano Pieces, No 3’s slippery interplay of voices glancing back to Bach’s counterpoint (now receding in the fog), but also reaching out towards the chalky impressionism of Debussy. Apple Blossom (one of Játékok’s many musical games) was a Schumann or Mendelssohn folk song that had strayed from the homeward path, wandering directly into Liszt’s late Nuages gris in a sleight of hand that left you questioning your own ears. Surely these persistent, unresolved storm clouds belonged to another century?Not content with blurring repertoire, Stefanovich also smeared styles. Kurtág was theatrical, almost Romantic in the scope of its gestures, Debussy all negative space and modernity. Heavily pedalled, often strident, her Bach won’t have been for everyone, but with so much musical aphorism and impermanence you can understand Stefanovich casting him as earth wire, or thread through the maze.Her decision to close with the final Contrapunctus from The Art of Fugue – suddenly broken off at the place Bach left it unfinished – was inspired: a jagged fragment ripped from the book in real time. Kurtág’s Pantomime saw Stefanovich’s hands approach the keyboard by way of coda, before coyly darting away without a sound struck. Wit and silence; the only possible birthday tribute to a singular musical voice.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Mark’s flirting with Derek’s new girlfriend, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), leads his old pal to punch him in the face.Another member of staff gives Mark the nickname “McSteamy”, a more raunchy variation of the “McDreamy” name coined for Derek because of his good looks and charm.This paved the way for Dane to become a cast regular in the third series. He first made an impact stepping out of a hotel shower, soaking wet. “The towel scene has definitely done something for me,” Dane said at the time. “I guess nobody has to guess what is under my T-shirt any more … That image has been everywhere. I can live with that!”Dane had previously played a doctor, Wyatt Cooper, in another American medical drama, Gideon’s Crossing, which ran for only one series (2000-01). “I don’t know why the audience responds to certain things,” he said. “I guess it was just the wrong time for that show. When it comes to Grey’s Anatomy, I guess people can identify with the characters because they are so horribly flawed.”After Mark joined the team at Seattle Grace hospital, the womanising surgeon set pulses racing all the way through to Grey’s Anatomy’s ninth series, in 2012. A central storyline was his on-off relationship with Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith’s younger half-sister, but Mark also dates nurses and other staff, including Callie Tores (Sara Ramirez), with whom he has a daughter.Mark and Lexi split up before a plane crash that leaves them both injured. Tending her in the debris, he confesses his love for Lexie before she dies. Left in a critical condition himself, Mark later dies in hospital. Dane returned to the programme briefly in season 17 for a dream sequence.View image in fullscreenDane in series four of The Last Ship. He fell in love with acting after appearing in Arthur Miller’s All My Sons as a teenager.Photograph: Tnt/Kobal/ShutterstockHe was born in San Francisco, the elder son of Leah (nee Cohn), a travel agent, and William Dane Melvin, an architect and interior designer who became a real estate broker. When he was seven, his father died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.While attending high schools in Sequoia, Redwood City, and San Mateo, he was a keen water polo player. “My season was short and I ended up getting roped in to playing Joe Keller in [the Arthur Miller play] All My Sons. Dead serious. And I fell in love with it. I was, like, ‘This is the greatest feeling ever!’”.Dane moved to Los Angeles, took acting classes and soon began to get small roles on television in series such as Saved by the Bell (in 1991), The Wonder Years (1993), Married with Children (1995) and Roseanne (1996), before disappointment with Gideon’s Crossing.Some consolation came with the role of Jason Dean, both the boss and, briefly, boyfriend of Phoebe (Alyssa Milano), the youngest of the three sister witches, in two series of the fantasy drama Charmed (2003-04).After Grey’s Anatomy, Dane starred in The Last Ship (2014-18) as Tom Chandler, commanding officer of the USS Nathan James, a guided‑missile destroyer entrusted with pulling back the human race from the brink of extinction following a global pandemic.More than just McSteamy: Eric Dane was masterful in Grey’s Anatomy – the real man of everyone’s dreams | Anna Spargo-RyanRead moreThen, in the teen drama Euphoria (2019-26), he had a leading role as Cal Jacobs, the bisexual father of a high-school football player.In the film X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), he created lighthearted relief from the action playing Jamie Madrox, AKA the Multiple Man, a mutant with the ability to make duplicates of himself, but often simply creating chaos.His other film roles included Sebastian, a newspaper journalist working with Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson’s dog-owning characters in Marley & Me (2008), and Sean Jackson, an American football player coming out as gay in the romantic comedy Valentine’s Day (2010).Dane announced last year that he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a type of motor neurone disease. He will be seen in a wheelchair during the forthcoming third series of Euphoria.In 2004, Dane married the actor Rebecca Gayheart.

But when I spied a copy of Ivan Kramsky’s portrait in the film Sentimental Value, it opened a door to an untold case of life imitating artVladimir RaevskyFri 20 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 11.39 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleSentimental Value is one of those films you have to watch very closely. In the Norwegian directorJoachim Trier’s latest work, which swept the board at the European film awards and is nominated for eight Baftas and nine Oscars, stories are hidden in closeups, half-tones and peripheral objects. Some of these stories are so well hidden, in fact, that they aren’t even apparent to the people who made the film.In one scene, roughly an hour in, the camera glides down a corridor, and suddenly there she is: a woman’s portrait on the wall. Anyone who grew up in the Soviet Union and laterRussiabetween the 1950s and 2000s, like me, would recognise her instantly. She has been endlessly reproduced: as prints, embroideries, portrait medallions, even on boxes of chocolates. In Britain, people may have encountered her on the covers of various editions of Anna Karenina.View image in fullscreenIn wide circulation … a Russian postage stamp from 2012 shows Portrait of an Unknown Woman.Photograph: Alexander Mitrofanov/AlamyPortrait of an Unknown Woman is a painting by Ivan Kramskoy, a celebrated Russian portraitist. Kramskoy began his career as a provincial retoucher before being admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts in St Petersburg. There, he went on to lead the Revolt of the Fourteen – a protest over the right to choose their subject for the Academy’s gold medal competition. The rebels later became known as theperedvizhniki, or the Wanderers, a group of artists who continued their protest by organising travelling exhibitions across the Russian empire.In 1883, Kramskoy paintedNeizvestnaya(the Romanised Russian for Portrait of an Unknown Woman), quietly hoping it would end up with Pavel Tretyakov, the founder of the Tretyakov Gallery – Russia’s leading museum of national art – and the guardian angel of the Wanderers. It didn’t.To understand why, one has to look at the Unknown Woman through the eyes of her contemporaries. The woman is seated alone in an open carriage against the misty backdrop of St Petersburg – she is beautiful, but also carries an air of arrogance. For a woman, sitting alone was already a faux pas. The clothes made it worse: a fashionable velvet hat, a coat and muff trimmed with ribbons, gold bracelets. She had put on her Sunday best – something a society lady would never have done.View image in fullscreenScreen print … a copy of Portrait of an Unknown Woman, left, as it appears in Sentimental Value.Photograph: Jørgen Stangebye LarsenReviewers called her “a cocotte in a carriage”, “a costly camellia”, and “one of the monstrous offspring of the great metropolis”. Tretyakov, who came from a conservative merchant background, was hardly eager to plant any monstrous camellias in his own house.Portrait of an Unknown Woman was later acquired by a collector in Kyiv, and then by Pavel Kharitonenko, a Ukrainian sugar magnate. After the revolution, his property was taken over by the state. His Moscow house became the residence of the British ambassador – and the Unknown Woman eventually entered the Tretyakov Gallery, in violation not only of private property rights but also of Tretyakov’s own wishes.After the second world war, the Soviet state sought to compensate the population for its immense suffering by granting a modest expansion of cultural life. With no real art market to speak of, private life became furnished with millions of cheap reproductions in gilt frames. The Unknown Woman was the runaway hit. She was mysterious amid the blunt visual language of Soviet symbols, bourgeois against the backdrop of grim everyday reality, and even a little sexy in a country whose official culture was resolutely prudish. She hung in almost every Soviet flat.View image in fullscreenRunaway hit … the Unknown Woman in one of many appearances as the cover star of  Anna Karenina, shown here in a Serbian bookstore in 2023.Photograph: Jerome Cid/AlamySo when I spotted Kramskoy’s painting in Trier’s film, I was intrigued and wanted to find out more. What was the meaning of the Unknown Woman here? I decided to investigate, and sent a message to the film’s production designer, Jørgen Stangebye Larsen. His reply told the story of an unknown woman who became a known woman almost instantly.As it turns out, this was not the first time the portrait had appeared in Trier’s films. In Oslo, 31 August – Trier’s second film, from 2011 – the heroin addict Anders returns to his family home at the end of the last day of his life. The house is about to be sold. As the camera glides through the rooms, the portrait briefly floats past, still hinged to the wall.Fifteen years later, the same wooden house in Oslo returns at the centre ofSentimental Value, housing the members of a troubled family from the early 1900s to the present day. The portrait appears again, this time in a flashback to the 1930s: a young woman comes of age, joins the resistance during the war, is arrested and tortured, and years later takes her own life in the same house.The portrait in Trier’s film is not one of the countless cheap Soviet reproductions but a loose copy after Kramskoy, painted by a close friend of Larsen’s stepmother, long before he became one of Trier’s collaborators.View image in fullscreenUnknown … Hedvig Broch, who painted a loose copy of Kramskoy’s portrait.Photograph: Family photoShe was called Hedvig Broch, and this is the story he told me about her. Broch had wanted to become an artist since childhood, but her father insisted she find a “real” profession, so she enrolled at university instead of the academy. After majoring in sociology, she was admitted to the art academy in Copenhagen – but her husband forced her to choose between her studies and their marriage. She chose her husband.Larsen told me she later became a very special presence in his life – a trusted adult figure – when he was a child. On Zoom, her daughter, Tiril Broch Aakre, recalls how Larsen used to perform magic tricks for her, while she, in turn, became a confidant of his teenage secrets. Broch and Larsen’s mother also had a ritual of their own: a Friday book club, just the two of them, sitting together and discussing whatever they were reading. Dostoevsky was among their favourites.When she turned 50, Broch finally did what she had dreamed of for decades. She left her job and returned to painting in earnest. Russian artists such as Kramskoy had long been admired by Norwegian and Finnish painters, and one day Tiril came home to find a striking portrait of a young woman her mother had just completed. “It had, you know, a kind of soulfulness and vulnerability,” she tells me. “It just struck me.”Hedvig’s Portrait of an Unknown Woman is very different from Kramskoy’s. The arrogantdemi-mondaineturns into a figure that is still mysterious, but far more melancholy. The crew’s return to the wooden house in Oslo 15 years later was not the only reason Larsen chose to use the portrait again. Between the two films, Hedvig Broch – just like the protagonist of Oslo, 31 August and the mother figure in Sentimental Value – took her own life.I called Trier and asked him whether this was life imitating art. He told me he had known nothing about the portrait’s history, and that its use in the film had not been intentional. Then he quoted a line from Goethe’s Faust to me:man merkt die Absicht und man ist verstimmt (“you work out what their intention is and it breaks the spell”).Yet memory, unlike art, sometimes survives by intention alone.Explore more on these topicsPaintingArtRussiaLeo TolstoySentimental ValuefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Clarinettists who could cope with both the harmonic and technical demands of this more advanced genre were rare, as were opportunities, so much so that Peplowski seemed destined to follow a more traditonal route in Dixieland jazz, where good clarinet players were still in demand.Having arrived in New York as a 21-year-old from Cleveland, Ohio, and with a considerable reputation, he threw off these restrictions and flourished. His solo career blossomed, nationally and internationally, so much so that the BBC’s Russell Davies described him as “arguably the greatest living jazz clarinettist”, the evidence captured on over 70 “name” albums, and many more on which Peplowski appeared as a sideman.He was born in Garfield Heights, a suburb of Cleveland with a strong Polish affiliation, where his father, Norbert, was a police officer and an amateur accordion player, and his mother, Estelle, was a homemaker. Ken’s older brother Ted played the trumpet and their father created a family polka band called the Harmony Kings, with Ken assigned to the clarinet. “It wasn’t my choice. I was just given the instrument but I liked it straight away,” he said.Hired around Cleveland to play for Polish weddings and the like, the band gave 10-year-old Ken his start as a professional musician. “I just fell in love with music and playing for people and entertaining,” he told the US writer Chip Deffaa.Increasingly interested in jazz and inspired by Benny Goodman’s recordings, he made sure to hear all the visiting big bands that came to Cleveland, as well as Goodman himself, the great man usually fronting a small group. Having acquired a tenor saxophone and finding that much of his clarinet technique could transfer to the larger instrument, Peplowski immersed himself in the entire lexicon of jazz, from ancient to modern, practised the classical repertoire and made sure later to study with the bebop saxophonist Sonny Stitt.He formed a quartet while studying at Cleveland State College, and was offered the chance to appear at the city’s jazz festival. This pitched the quartet opposite the trio led by the ex-Goodman pianist Teddy Wilson, and the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, a legacy swing band directed by the trombonist Buddy Morrow. Peplowski clearly impressed Morrow, who called him to join the Dorsey band, and he stayed on the road between 1978 and 1980 playing lead alto saxophone.Morrow gave him room to play clarinet features and later talked up Peplowski’s skills to his New York contacts. Once there, Peplowski hoovered up gigs, often subbing at Eddie Condon’s Dixieland club or sitting in with rehearsal big bands, and gained recognition as a neo-mainstreamer rather than a strict traditionalist. This aligned him with other like-minded players such as the cornettist Warren Vaché, the tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton and a fellow clarinettist, Kenny Davern, with all of whom he went on to forge a strong connection on record and on tour or, increasingly, in weekend jazz-party line-ups.View image in fullscreenKen Peplowski at the Vienne Jazz festival, France, in 1995. His solo career blossomed after he moved to New York at the age of 21.Photograph: David Redfern/RedfernsIn 1984, the saxophonist Loren Schoenberg recruited Peplowski for his all-star big band, which was taken over by Goodman a year later for the King of Swing’s final hurrah. Goodman, who was always encouraging to Peplowski, evidently concurred with Schoenberg’s assessment of his clarinet playing.“He had that rare combination of virtuosity and velocity and outright swing that made him unique,” Schoenberg said, while also praising his Zoot Sims-style saxophone playing and his propensity for bandstand humour, calling Peplowski a natural showman. “I take the music very seriously, but I have fun doing it,” Peplowski explained.The 1980s and 90s were a period of extraordinary success for Peplowski. His contract with Concord Records yielded more than 40 albums and there were tours to Japan withMel Tormé(1988 and 1992) and with the pianistHank Jones(1992), and an ongoing association with the eccentric singer-songwriter Leon Redbone.Recordings burgeoned, including an album withPeggy Lee, and a series of friendly encounters with British players with whom he often toured, including the pianistBrian Lemon(1996) and two albums (in 2009 and 2010) with the saxophonist Alan Barnes. He was regularly in the UK for Swinging Jazz Party in Blackpool and festival engagements, including a memorable clarinet pairing with Davern at the Brecon festival, and there was also an acclaimed collaboration with the clarinettist Julian Marc Stringle, which led to two albums (2015 and 2016).All seemed well until he suffered a severe case of Covid in 2020 and was diagnosed in 2021 with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer, whose debilitating effects sidelined him for three years. He had only recently begun to play again in public, the cancer in remission; his comeback album, Live at Mezzrow, was recorded at the New York club in 2023 and released the following year, followed by Unheard Bird, based on the celebrated recording Charlie Parker With Strings.At the time of his death, Peplowski had been playing on board a week-long jazz cruise in the Gulf of Mexico, and had just completed a set on its final day with two other world-renowned jazz clarinettists, Anat Cohen and Paquito D’Rivera, to considerable acclaim and at full tilt.Three marriages ended in divorce. Peplowski is survived by his companion, Pam Stark, a son, Marty, and daughter, Juliana, and his brother, Ted.Kenneth Joseph Peplowski, jazz musician, born 23 May 1959; died 2 February 2026Explore more on these topicsJazzobituariesShareReuse this content"

Drama is great, but style is a huge piece of why we buy fashion,” said Mario Arena, the creative director of Joseph, at its first catwalk show in eight years.Arena has a subversive idea to re-energiseLondon fashion week. More polish, less pantomime: clothes that sell, rather than clothes that scream.“Buyers will say they come to London for innovation, and they go to Italy and France for style. But London used to be a style capital, and it should be again,” Arena said on Friday. He is the Australian-born creative director of the brand founded by the late Joseph Ettedgui, which was beloved in the 1980s and 1990s for flattering black trousers, chic leather and knit, and the see-and-be-seen in-store restaurant, Joe’s Cafe. “Women want clothes that work what we call the three Ds: desk, dinner, walking the dog when they get home,” he added.“Totally agree,” said Laura Weir, the chief executive of the British Fashion Council. “London fashion week has been at its best when it has that wickedly potent combination of the creative but also the commercial; think of BodyMap and Jasper Conran, in the 1980s.”Burberry, which shows at the old Billingsgate fish market on Monday evening, is already making the case for real clothes on the London catwalk, hitting its stride with a pivot away from edgy streetwear and toward classic outerwear.There is drama to be found off the catwalk. On Thursday morning, the last-minute appearance of a single armchair with a silk cushion among the wooden benches announced a surprise visit by King Charles. British-Nigerian designer Tolu Coker’s audience, which included fellow designer Stella McCartney and rappers Skepta and Little Simz, were asked to stand for the entrance of the monarch, who appeared to enjoy the distraction from news headlines about the arrest of his brother.View image in fullscreenKing Charles with the British Fashion Council chief, Laura Weir (L), and designer Stella McCartney (R) on the front row of Tolu Coker’s show at London fashion week.Photograph: Richard Pohle/The Times/PAOn a concrete catwalk deep within Tate Modern on Friday, Joseph’s signature minimal chic was updated with new fabric technology. A glazed leather jacket was laser cut to create a snakeskin effect, which “will look better the more you wear it, because as it softens the little scales will start to lift”, Arena said. YouTube clips of Ungaro, Saint Laurent and Dior shows from the 1970s and 1980s inspired faux-fur coats spliced with horizontal leather bands, to mimic traditional furs constructed from pelts. “I wanted that luxury look, but without killing anything cute and fluffy.”The industry mood is about reality checks, not fantasy frocks. Financial pressures have seen names dropping off the schedule of fashion weeks in London, New York and Paris. Weir said: “I had one designer email me just the other day because their sponsor had pulled out and they couldn’t afford to show.” With the cost of even a small-scale show running at about £50,000, “not putting on a show is sometimes the right decision. If it’s going to put you into loads of debt, don’t do a show. There are other ways to reach people.”Roksanda Ilinčić celebrated her brand’s 20th birthday with a catwalk show in a grand hotel ballroom six months ago, but is sitting out this season after deciding to channel resources into a three-floor pop-up store in Knightsbridge. “Financially and logistically, we couldn’t do both the shop and a show, and we chose the shop,” said Ilinčić, who closed a Mayfair boutique after the pandemic but said she hoped to open another permanent store soon.This season, publicity for her latest collection will come via dinner at Claridges hotel, where actor and artist “friends of the house” will be dressed in the latest Roksanda. Skipping the catwalk had nudged her away from showstoppers and toward easier pieces, Ilinčić said. “Customers have been asking for that for a while, but if I’m doing a show I feel like I need the drama of the bigger pieces. Not showing has allowed me to explore a more wearable direction.”London fashion week has a full diary, on and off the catwalk. Mulberry, the heritage British leather goods company, will celebrate 55 years of its Bayswater handbag with the release of 55 unique bags in never-seen-before fabric combinations, such as pony-printed calf with neon leather trim, using deadstock fabric. Han Chong, the designer behind the successful Self-Portrait label, is staging a film screening and dumplings-and-karaoke party instead of a show.“It is always a fight for this industry to get heard,” said Weir, “but there is increasing appetite for fashion in media coverage over the past year. It is my view that in a world as volatile as this, with so many challenges to our values and humanity, there is even more of a need to platform creativity, making and British success stories.”Explore more on these topicsLondon fashion weekFashion weeksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereChloe Mac DonnellFri 20 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 02.01 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleWithin the first 20 minutes ofLove Story, Ryan Murphy’s new take on the often tumultuous relationship between John F Kennedy Jr and Carolyn Bessette, the youngest son of the former US president is depicted wearing five different caps. They include a Kangol flat cap as he cycles to a newspaper kiosk in uptown NYC to read the latest headlines about himself, a Yankees cap as he runs topless on a treadmill and a navy baseball cap as he joins his mother, Jacqueline, for dinner, where she promptly reminds him “no hats at the table, please”.For Kennedy Jr, hounded by the paparazzi and tabloid press who nicknamed him “The Hunk” and more often than not “The Hunk Who Flunked”, you might think this penchant for peaked caps was thanks to the fact that they let him go somewhat incognito. But he preferred to wear his backwards, pulling the cap downwards over his signature flop of lush black hair, and leaving his full face on view.Just like silk slip dresses from Calvin Klein were synonymous with Bessette, a backwards cap has now become synonymous with Kennedy Jr, who toyed with the idea of how the son of a former president and first lady should dress. It’s no wonder costume designer Rudy Mance wanted to centre the character’s backward caps from the get-go. Less waspy, more preppy, he regularly offset old-money signifiers such as formal Armani and Calvin Klein suits, foulard ties and tweed blazers with a casual cap worn in a way more typically seen on Sylvester Stallone in Over The Top, or on the likes of 90s hip-hop stars Public Enemy and grunge artists Nirvana.James Lilliefors, author of Ball Cap Nation: A Journey Through the World of America’s National Hat, says: “JFK Jr adopted it, and adapted it, as a key aspect of his ‘high/low’ fashion look, giving it a kind of street chic and making this ‘heir to Camelot’ both cool and relatable.”Now, nearly three decades after Kennedy Jr’s death, the backwards cap is having a resurgence. Pinterest mood boards and social media are awash with images of the couple that millennials and gen Zers are using as styling inspiration. One shot of the duo taken in 1996 as they stroll down a Manhattan sidewalk, with Bessette in a grey slip dress, black coat and suede knee-high boots and Kennedy Jr in a formal black suit, fat knotted tie and green backwards cap, is particularly popular.“All my problems fade away when I see a man in a backwards cap,” reads one caption below a montage of Kennedy Jr sporting a variety of the aforementioned. “Watch my husband go from ‘dad’ to ‘daddy’,” adds another user as she films her partner turning his headwear around.View image in fullscreen​Style icons ... John F Kennedy Jr and Carolyn Bessette walking the streets of New York City.Photograph: Allan Tannenbaum/Getty ImagesLilliefors says 90s nostalgia is a driving force for this backwards cap revival but the original look goes much further back then that. During the 1800s, US baseball catchers styled their caps backwards for practical reasons: they needed to wear a catcher’s mask, which a forward-facing cap wouldn’t fit over, but they still wanted to protect their heads during the long hours spent in the sun. By the 1990s, the Seattle Mariners player Ken Griffey Jr had made it his dugout signature.Away from the pitch, backwards caps began to trend in wider popular culture thanks to Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, where denim and pastel coloured caps captured his easy but rebellious style. Around the same time, hip-hop artists including Jay-Z, andLimp Bizkit’s Fred Durst, were rarely seen bouncing around on MTV without one.View image in fullscreenNew flip side … Ralph Lauren’s fall/winter 2026-2027 look.Photograph: Alena Zakirova/Getty ImagesFast forward to today and celebrities can’t get enough of the flip and reverse method. In January, as Timothée Chalamet leaned into method dressing, The Complete Unknown starwore a black backwards capembroidered with the Bob Dylan lyrics “Don’t Think Twice, It’s Alright”. The Super Bowl’s latest half-time star, Bad Bunny, likes to wear backwards caps on and off stage. He follows in the footsteps of Kendrick Lamar, who has championed them ever since he topped off his Chanel look at the 2023 Met Gala with a 90s-style cap from Starter, an American brand that has made a high crown and a rounded, curved brim its signature. It’s also a look that is snapping back on the catwalks. At a recent Ralph Lauren show in Milan, the king of prep presented models in brightly coloured cotton caps deliberately styled backwards so the Polo logo was only visible from behind.With baseball caps now ubiquitous, seen everywhere from coffee shops to boardrooms (including on-screen versions in shows such as Succession and Industry), perhaps the move towards the backward cap hints at a desire to move the trend on from the status quo. A cheap update, all it takes is one flip and the confidence to pull it off or on.To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterJohn F Kennedy JrRyan MurphynewslettersShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When you consider that more than half of a typical household’s fuel bills goeson heating and hot water, findingalternative ways to keep warm– and heating the person, rather than the whole home – seems like a good idea. Many of the best electric blankets and heated throws cost about 2p to 4p an hour to run, so it’s hard to ignore their potential energy- and money-saving benefits.Electric blankets are ideal for using on your mattress, with the most convenient examples arriving with timers and auto-shut-off features for peace of mind, and dual control panels to keep both sides of the bed happy. Heated throws are better for snuggling on the sofa – they’re practical but also look good, with tactile finishes in materials such as bamboo and pure cotton.I was tasked with sleeping on the job to discover the best of both, testing the most popular electric blankets and heated throws from well-known homeware brands such as Silentnight, Slumberdown and Dreamland.

Over the years, I’ve tested just about everything from breadmakers and bedding to beehives and biscuits – thankfully, not all at the same time.Lately, my focus has been bedding, testing numerous mattresses, pillows, weighted blankets and bed linen – so I know what makes for a decent night’s sleep. Testing electric blankets was the logical next step.Whatever I’m testing, I’ll find practical and useful ways to rigorously measure the value of the product and dig deep to go beyond the marketing jargon.How I testedView image in fullscreenI used an infrared thermometer to determine how fast the blankets warmed up – and how evenly.Photograph: Emily Peck/The GuardianWithout a Cern-grade laboratory at my disposal, I tested 24 of the most popular electric blankets and throws at home. In bed. In my pyjamas. I wanted to assess how each blanket and throw felt while sleeping or resting, and judge its quality and durability.Alongside measuring the maximum temperature each blanket hit, I timed how long it took to get there – I have zero patience when cold, so quick and efficient heating is crucial. Using an infrared thermometer, I measured the temperatures on the highest settings at 10 minutes, 30 minutes and an hour after being switched on. Since the weight of your duvet and room temperature can affect the temperature of electric blankets, I kept things fair by using all the electric blankets on the same bed, and all the heated throws on the same sofa, with a consistent room temperature of 18C.No one wants a hot back and frosty feet, so I considered how evenly each blanket heated up by taking temperature readings at three different points after an hour on full power. I also used a plug-in power consumption meter to determine each blanket’s hourly running cost based on theOfgem price capas of 1 January 2026, which is 27.69p a kWh.Below you’ll find the 17best of the 24 models I tested.

It comes in single, double and king-size versions, and is made from polyester with a cosy fleece finish.Why we love itThe Carmen feels great, heats up effectively and is great value. It’s one of the easiest blankets to fit on to your bed, with a generous elastic skirt sewn on to it rather than the usual, clumsier straps. The skirt ensures the blanket secures neatly under each side of themattressand stays in place.It heats up quickly, reaching an impressive 28.1C in its centre after just 10 minutes – and this was without a duvet on top. I measured the heat at the sides a little cooler, but the temperature increased steadily over an hour, reaching 30.2C in its centre after 30 minutes and up to 33C after an hour. As soon as a duvet was placed on top, it got even warmer and retained its heat long after I had turned off the blanket.While it’s machine washable, the manufacturer recommends doing this only a total of three times in its lifespan, so it will mostly be a spot clean.It’s a shame that …there’s no timer.

After an hour on its highest setting, it reached a comfortable 29.5C – more than enough heat for me.When I measured the temperature across the blanket, I found it was hotter in the middle than on the sides. However, I didn’t notice any cold spots when my duvet was on top, trapping in the heat.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have a timer. The manufacturer suggests leaving this blanket on its lowest setting if you want to keep it on all night.Sizes available:small single,single,small double, double,king,super kingDimensions (king size):L150 x W142cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:noRunning coston maximum:3p/hour (0.094kWh)Temperature after an hour:29.5CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yesSlumberdownSleepy Nights (double)£15.74£15.74 at the RangeWhat we loveGenerous straps make it easy to fit on the bedWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t include a timerBest heated throw overall:Duux Yentl Cuddle heated overblanketDuuxYentl Cuddle heated overblanket striped greyfrom£99.99£99.99 at Duux£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s fluffy, thick and comfortingWhat we don’t loveIt can feel a little too hot on the highest settingPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£99.99 at Duux£99.99 at AmazonWith a soft faux-fur finish, this Yentl Cuddle overblanket is large enough to fit a king-size bed or three-seater sofa and comes in two neutral colours, beige and grey. The timer goes up to nine hours.Why we love itThe word cuddle seems fitting for this Duux heated throw, which is one of the most comforting heated blankets I’ve tried. Even when turned off, it felt warm and cosy due to its thickness and fluffy finish. At £99.99, it costs more than your average heated blanket, but for its size and the warmth it offers, it’s well worth the spend.It was quick to heat in my tests, and the thick material retains heat well. After 10 minutes on the highest setting, it measured a toasty 28C, and after 1hr 20mins it had reached an overly warm 40C. Of course, the temperature of the room and body heat will affect how hot it gets, but I’d recommend using the lower setting 3 and setting the timer to switch off after an hour – this feels just right.I really enjoyed using this blanket, whether it was on or off. I’ve been laying it over my duvet and turning it on at night to warm my bed before I get in. I then turn it off and sleep with it on top of the duvet to benefit from that extra layer of warmth. It works well, and the weight of it on my bed has also helped improve my sleep.It’sa shame that …it may feel too thick and heavy for some.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L200 x W200cmNumber of heat settings:nineTimer included:1-9 hoursRunning cost on maximum:2p/hour (0.086kWh)Temperature after an hour:39.2CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:remove the controller and wash at 30CDuuxYentl Cuddle heated overblanket striped greyfrom£99.99£99.99 at Duux£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s fluffy, thick and comfortingWhat we don’t loveIt can feel a little too hot on the highest settingBest budget heated throw:Dunelm Lenon fur electric throwDunelmLenon fur electric throw£40£40 at DunelmWhat we loveIts attractive burgundy faux fur finish that feels very soft to touchWhat we don’t loveThere’s no timer includedPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£40 at DunelmDunelm sells a range of heated blankets, and its stock changes regularly (including several times throughout the writing of this article), so you’ll have to be quick. This one comes in a beautifully soft faux fur polyester fabric in either white or burgundy.Why we love itI always opt for deeper colours for blankets and soft furnishings to hide the wear and tear better over time. I love the luxurious look of this blanket’s jewel-like burgundy finish, and I think it will age well.Like many Dunelm heated blankets I’ve tested, this throw feels good draped over my lap: it’s so smooth and tactile. It’s not too bulky either, so it’s easy to move around without its control cable getting in the way. It was the perfect size for one person or two sharing, if you don’t mind getting close – it worked well when my 11-year-old daughter was keen to snuggle up with me. It’s one of the thinner heated blankets I’ve tried – it does well to disguise the wiring inside, but it’s still noticeable.It didn’t retain the heat as well as some of the thicker blankets, but it did heat up effectively. It comes with a basic control panel with six heat settings and was quick to heat. It reached 27.5C after just 10 minutes on level six and 39.9C after an hour, which is impressive for such a slim blanket – and very welcome during recent cold snaps. It’s fairly efficient to heat, too – while the small print on the website states that it costs 3p an hour to use, my readings came out as 2p an hour.It’s a shame that …it has no timer, although it does automatically shut off after four hours.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L160 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:no, but has automatic shut-off after four hoursRunning cost on maximum:2p/hour (0.088kWh)Temperature after an hour:39.9CGuarantee:one yearMachine washable:yesDunelmLenon fur electric throw£40£40 at DunelmWhat we loveIts attractive burgundy faux fur finish that feels very soft to touchWhat we don’t loveThere’s no timer includedBest quilted electric blanket:Dreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanketDreamlandPure Comfort bamboo underblanket (king)from£99.99£139.99 at Boots£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt includes breathable bamboo materialWhat we don’t loveIt costs more than your average blanketKing, £139.99 at BootsKing, £99.99 at AmazonThe king-size version of this underblanket has dual control panels for operating each side independently. There are six heat settings to choose from, and three timer options for one, three or nine hours.Why we love itThis blanket reached 22C at its centre after just 10 minutes, and within an hour, temperatures had risen to a snuggly 32C. I found that the middle and end of the blanket heated well, but the top section remained cool to the touch, working well for under your head.It costs more than your average electric blanket, but is worth it for the quilted, breathable bamboo finish. The filling, like many other electric blankets, is polyester. The control panels on either side were easy to navigate, even when I was sleepy-eyed.It’s a shame that …there are no timer options between three and nine hours.Sizes available:single,double, king,super kingDimensions (king size):L200 x W150cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, one, three or nine hoursRunning coston maximum:4p/hour (0.129kWh)Temperature after an hour:32.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesDreamlandPure Comfort bamboo underblanket (king)from£99.99£139.99 at Boots£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt includes breathable bamboo materialWhat we don’t loveIt costs more than your average blanketBest luxury-feeling heated throwBeurer HD150 heated snuggle blanketBeurerHD150 heated snuggle blanketfrom£62.46£119.99 at Simply Be£62.46 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels very smooth and snuggly against your skinWhat we don’t loveIt can be awkward to fold and a little cumbersome to storePhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£119.99 at Simply Be£62.46 at AmazonIdeal for the sofa, this Beurer blanket has averysoft and sumptuous fleece finish. Its six heat settings are all adjustable via the central control panel. I tried the XXL design – a little oversized on my three-seater sofa, but ideal for sharing comfortably with another person. It also comes in asmaller 180 x 130cm size.Why we love itThe soft-to-touch surface of this heated blanket proved just the right level of cosy for a night on the sofa watching TV. Plus, it feels padded enough to disguise the heating elements inside the blanket – not something that can be said of all heated blankets.It heated up fast – reaching temperatures in the low 20s in just 10 minutes – yet it used surprisingly little energy. After an hour, it felt very hot, so I turned it down to setting two, which was more comfortable. Its three-hour automatic switch-off timer means that you can just set and forget about it.It’s a shame that …it didn’t heat up evenly. While the middle was warm, sections around the edges didn’t feel it at all – which might be a problem if you’re sharing it with a blanket hog.Sizes available:small, largeDimensions (large):L200 x W150cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:three-hour automatic switch-offRunning coston maximum:2p/hour (0.055kWh)Temperature after an hour:32.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesBeurerHD150 heated snuggle blanketfrom£62.46£119.99 at Simply Be£62.46 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels very smooth and snuggly against your skinWhat we don’t loveIt can be awkward to fold and a little cumbersome to storeBest heated fleece throw:Russell Hobbs microfleece heated throwRussell HobbsMicrofleece heated throwfrom£38.99£38.99 at Currys£39.99 at Robert DyasWhat we loveThe microfleece finish feels so softWhat we don’t loveIts darker shades might look harsh in some colour schemesPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£38.99 at Currys£39.99 at Robert DyasWith its soft microfleece finish, this heated blanket is large enough to cover one person comfortably and also works well for two. It features one digital control panel with multiple heat and timer functions, and an automatic switch-off function for peace of mind. If you intend to sleep with it, Russell Hobbs recommends using it on a lower heat mode, up to setting three.Why we love itThe first thing I noticed about this heated blanket, aside from its soft feel, was its generous 250cm cable. It meant I could drape the blanket over me comfortably on the sofa without accidentally tugging the plug out of the wall socket.The blanket’s microfleece finish felt tactile and comforting, and it was thicker than some of the standard fleece throws I tested, such as the Dunelm fleece electric throw (above). While I could feel the wiring lines inside this blanket, they’re well hidden in the blanket’s sumptuous design.The white digital control panel here is a little bulkier than some others on test, and stands out against the jet-black finish of the blanket I tested. Nevertheless, it was easy to use, with heat settings ranging from one to nine. If you want to use the blanket for more than an hour, the timer function lets you go up in one-hour increments up to nine hours and then jumps to a single 12-hour setting. On its highest heat setting, it reached 29C in 30 minutes and a toasty 41.9C after an hour. In addition, the heat seemed to distribute well across the blanket’s surface.It’s a shame that …the throw doesn’t come in pastel colours; the darker shades (such as the black I tested) could look harsh against some softer interior schemes.Sizes available:one sizeDimensions:L180 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:nineTimer included:yes, one-nine or 12 hoursRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.134kWh)Temperature after an hour:41.9CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yes, under 40CRussell HobbsMicrofleece heated throwfrom£38.99£38.99 at Currys£39.99 at Robert DyasWhat we loveThe microfleece finish feels so softWhat we don’t loveIts darker shades might look harsh in some colour schemesBest fluffy heated throw:Glamhaus heated throwGlamhausHeated throwfrom£24.99£24.99 at Robert Dyas£24.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt heats up quickly and feels great against skinWhat we don’t loveNo storage bag includedPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£24.99 at Robert Dyas£24.99 at AmazonAvailable in jewel-like colours, includingdeep pink,“scuba” blueandgreen, this electric over-blanket is reasonably priced at less than £50 (£24.99 at the time of writing). The blanket is made from polyester and has a white, fluffy trim that contrasts nicely against the vibrant hue of its main body.Why we love itIt may be standard polyester, but the velvety fleece-like finish of this blanket feels luxurious to touch. Its white trim instantly made my sofa look festive, but it will look great throughout spring, too, adding an extra layer of cosiness to your living room.It’s thick and feels more substantial than some other budget heated blankets I’ve tried, so it feels warming even when it’s not switched on. It heated up quickly, too, and within a minute, there was a satisfying amount of heat from its centre. The heat felt comfortable rather than scorching, with the heated wires nicely disguised within the throw. The heat also radiates out to the sides effectively, providing an even warmth across the surface. After 10 minutes, I measured the centre of the blanket at 27.2C on its highest setting, and it reached 34.2C after 30 minutes and a sleep-inducing 40.3C after an hour.The control panel is easy to use and doesn’t give you a bewildering number of heat and timer options – there are six heat settings and a three-hour timer, which feels plenty. It comes with the safety of an auto-shut-off feature and can be conveniently machine-washed at 30C too – both features I’d expect to find in a good-quality heated blanket.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with a storage bag, which would make it neater to store while not in use. It’s hard to fault this blanket, though, as it’s such good value.Sizes available:one sizeDimensions:L160 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, three hoursRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.096kWh)Temperature after an hour:40.3CGuarantee:one yearMachine washable:yes, at 30CGlamhausHeated throwfrom£24.99£24.99 at Robert Dyas£24.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt heats up quickly and feels great against skinWhat we don’t loveNo storage bag includedBest quick-to-heat blanket:Bedsure heated blanket electric throwBedsureHeated blanket electric throwfrom£35.97£68.99 at Wayfair£35.97 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels soft and heats up quicklyWhat we don’t loveDue to its white sherpa lining, it may need regular washingPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£68.99 at Wayfair£35.97 at AmazonThis Bedsure heated blanket comes in a soft dual-sided sherpa fabric, with 14 colours to choose from. The timer goes up to a generous 10 hours, and there are six heat settings and a preheat feature.Why we love itThis blanket’s smart memory function is a nice extra. Every time you turn on the blanket, it will heat up to the last used setting. Unlike other blankets I’ve tested, it also has a preheat button on its controller that sped up the heating process. Within two minutes of turning it on, the blanket became noticeably warm – a welcome feature when the room was particularly cold. When on the highest setting, I was surprised to see how efficient it is too – costing just 2p an hour to run.I found the blanket beautifully soft to touch on both sides, with a nice weight and thickness to it. It took about 30 minutes for the blanket to reach 29.8C, and after an hour, it was measuring a satisfying 35.6C. This kept me warm but didn’t feel too hot to touch. The heat was distributed evenly, and the blanket retained the heat effectively right up to the edges of the blanket, too.It’s a shame that …the underside of the blanket is finished in white, which I can imagine will look a little grubby over time and need regular washing.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L130 x W160cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:up to 10 hoursRunning cost on maximum:2p/hour (0.076kWh)Temperature after an hour:36.6CGuarantee:30-day return policy; no warranty period specifiedMachine washable:yes, remove the controller and wash at 30CBedsureHeated blanket electric throwfrom£35.97£68.99 at Wayfair£35.97 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels soft and heats up quicklyWhat we don’t loveDue to its white sherpa lining, it may need regular washingBest heated duvet:Dreamland Love Mornings heated duvetDreamlandHeated duvet (king)from£199.99£199.99 at Dreamland£199.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt offers soothing heat from above, which works wellWhat we don’t loveCables will hang out of the end of the duvet coverKing, £199.99 at DreamlandKing, £199.99 at AmazonDreamland offers a wide range of heated bedding products – I also have my eye on the brand’selectric heat padsfor specific areas, including your feet, neck, back and hands.Having tried the underblanket (reviewed above), I was keen to see how this heated duvet would compare. Like the underblanket, the duvet is machine washable with the controller removed, and can be tumble-dried, too.Why we love itI was instantly impressed by the tidy stitching and smooth finish of this heated duvet, which is filled with polyester and has a 100% cotton cover. With an October chill in the air, I set up the duvet on my bed, under a breathable cottonNectar duvet cover.The dual controls lead out at the end of the duvet, so you can run them up the side of the bed to plug them in. This means you’ll be able to use it with a buttoned cover, but not one that has a zip.Dreamland states the heat-up time as five minutes, and while it was slightly warm after a few minutes, I did have to go hunting for the warmer spots during my tests. After 10 minutes on the highest setting, I measured the temperature at 26.6C at the centre, and after an hour it was 36.3C, which felt comfortable – although this probably isn’t a heat level I’d like to sleep in all night.The duvet’s dual controls worked well for my partner and me: I could blast the heat on my side while he, who prefers cooler climes, didn’t need to have it on at all.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with a cover. Also, while having the heat filter down from the duvet above me felt cosy on a really cold night, I prefer the heat from an electric blanket underneath.Sizes available:single,double, king sizeDimensions (king size):L225 x W220cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, one, three and nine hoursRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.101kWh a side)Temperature after an hour:36.3CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yesDreamlandHeated duvet (king)from£199.99£199.99 at Dreamland£199.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt offers soothing heat from above, which works wellWhat we don’t loveCables will hang out of the end of the duvet coverBest heated foot warmer:Vonhaus grey electric foot warmerVonhausGrey electric foot warmerfrom£27.99£27.99 at Vonhaus£27.99 at the RangeWhat we loveIt’s fast to heat and versatile to useWhat we don’t loveThe grey design is uninspiring and there’s no timerPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£27.99 at Vonhaus£27.99 at the RangeThe Vonhaus grey electric foot warmer comes with a microfleece lining, three heat settings, an auto-shutoff and overcurrent protection – so the power will stop if the electrical current exceeds a safe limit.There are a few grey heated foot warmers available online that all look similar –SilentnightandLogiksell a design that looks close to this model, for example. Having never tried a heated foot warmer before, I was pleasantly surprised at how comforting the Vonhaus could be.Why we love itThe grey and white warmer looks basic in design, but I found it effective and spacious for my feet. It took a couple of minutes to heat, but I then enjoyed the sensation of sitting at my desk and having the extra warmth for my feet. With deadlines to meet, I found it stress-relieving too.It fits up to a UK size 12.5, and my size six feet sat neatly inside with plenty of room to wiggle my toes around. My partner has size 11 feet and found he had more than enough room, too. Body heat, of course, influences how hot it becomes, but after 10 minutes on full power, it reached an impressive 28C in my tests. The small print on the website states that it can get up to 65C, but after an hour, I measured it at 36.2C, which was plenty.It’s a shame that …I found the removable lining inside the warmer annoying – it’s flimsy and can get creased, which makes it harder to put your foot inside it.Sizes available:oneDimensions:W30 x H24 x D30cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:noRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.096kWh)Temperature after an hour:36.2CWarranty:two-year warranty (not guarantee)Machine washable:yes, foot warmer and cover at 30C; controller is non-washableVonhausGrey electric foot warmerfrom£27.99£27.99 at Vonhaus£27.99 at the RangeWhat we loveIt’s fast to heat and versatile to useWhat we don’t loveThe grey design is uninspiring and there’s no timerBest heated throw for one person:Vonhaus pink heated throw blanketVonhausPink heated throw blanketfrom£37.99£37.99 at Vonhaus£37.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIts silky finish and pretty pink hueWhat we don’t loveIt could be thickerPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£37.99 at Vonhaus£37.99 at AmazonWith nine temperature settings, this soft and silky pink blanket offers a good range of heat options up to a maximum of 43C. It has a one-hour default timer, plus one that can be set for up to nine hours in total. If you’re going to sleep with it or are using it for extended periods, Vonhaus recommends setting the heat to level 1 for the duration.Why we love itMeasuring 160 x 130cm, I found this heated blanket just the right size for one. While its vibrant pink finish might not go down so well with some, personally, I didn’t mind it. It’s machine washable at 30C (with the control panel removed) on a gentle cycle and low spin, and the 2.15m cord length should be long enough to reach a nearby socket.The blanket felt smooth underhand with an almost silk-like finish, but I could feel the wiring inside. Nevertheless, it was subtle, and the blanket’s layers of fabric are well structured to make it easy to fold or lay flat on the sofa or bed. It heated up evenly, but not as quickly or as hot as others on test, reaching 25.5C within 30 minutes and 34C after an hour.It’s a shame that …the pink colourway may not be to everyone’s taste.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L160 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:nineTimer included:yes, up to nine hoursRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.156kWh)Temperature after an hour:34CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yes, up to 30CVonhausPink heated throw blanketfrom£37.99£37.99 at Vonhaus£37.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIts silky finish and pretty pink hueWhat we don’t loveIt could be thickerBest heated cushion:Beurer HK48 cosy heated cushionBeurerHK48 cosy heated cushionfrom£34.99£34.99 at Currys£34.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThat it both props you up and heats you upWhat we don’t loveThe control panel is very basicPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£34.99 at Currys£34.99 at AmazonThis heated cushion, made by German brand Beurer, would make an excellent gift.Of its two sides, it’s the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 fleecy fabric that warms up for a soothing effect; the other side is a breathable cotton with a removable pad inside. The cover is removable and machine washable on a gentle wool cycle at 30C, but it can only be cleaned up to 10 times in its lifespan. For an extra £9.99,replacement covers are availablein five attractive colours, including green, red and orange.Why we love itAn alternative option to your standard heated throw, this cushion provides a more targeted approach to warming and could work well for general pain relief. It comes with three heat settings, and felt great positioned near the lower back and under the neck, upper legs, knees and ankles.The cushion was super-quick to heat, reaching 34C in 10 minutes, and a very warm 43.4C after an hour. It never really felt too hot, and the heat seemed to radiate to the sides nicely. The three heat settings are useful, but a timer alongside would have enhanced the design. That said, it does come with a 90-minute auto-shut-off feature.It’s a shame that …the control panel isn’t a little more hi-tech, but it does the job effectively.Sizes available:oneDimensions:H40 x W30cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:no, but it has 90-minute auto-switch offRunning cost on maximum: 0.6p/hour – less than 1p (0.023kWh)Temperature after an hour:43.4CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:the cover is machine washable at 30C wool cycle; the inner pad is not washableBeurerHK48 cosy heated cushionfrom£34.99£34.99 at Currys£34.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThat it both props you up and heats you upWhat we don’t loveThe control panel is very basicThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Good for transitional seasons when you don’t want anything too heavy’: the Silentnight luxury heated throw.Photograph: Emily Peck/The GuardianSlumberdown Elegantly Warm luxury heated throwSlumberdownElegantly Warm luxury heated throwfrom£27£60 at Argos£27 at AmazonWhat we loveIt gets satisfyingly hotWhat we don’t loveIts heat settings aren’t as intuitive as we’d likePhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£60 at Argos£27 at AmazonBest for:those looking for a stylish, neutral colourThis heated throw looks elegant and feels luxurious – just as the name suggests. My review sample arrived in the Mole colourway, which will suit both modern and traditional interiors.The blanket’s 10 heat settings allow for good control, although I found it difficult to “feel” a difference past heat setting six. The blanket reached a hot 31.9C after 10 minutes of being turned on; and while the borders didn’t get as warm, the heat did seem evenly distributed across the surface.Made from polyester, the blanket is washable at 40C on a wool cycle, but it can only be air-dried.It didn’t make the final cut because …when you turn it on, it starts at setting five.

The fastening straps for the corners and the blanket’s base material ensure a secure fit to the mattress.Two control panels let you tailor each quarter of the mattress to suit your upper and lower body, so it’s a great option for bed sharers or those who like to keep their feet at a different temperature from the top half of their body.

The heated graphene also emits far-infrared radiation (FIR), which claims to offer therapeutic warmth to benefit muscles, ease joints and promote restful sleep.I don’t have an adjustable bed, but I tested a single version of this blanket on my standard pocket-sprung mattress to see how effective it was at heating. While I can’t prove it had any positive effect on my body or sleep, I did find the gentle warmth it emitted comforting. On the downside, it felt a little thicker and rustled more than other electric blankets I’ve tried: I could tell I was sleeping with something underneath me. I like that I couldn’t feel any wires through the sheets, though.There are a lot of buttons on the control panel, but it allows you to heat the upper and lower parts of the blanket independently. It also comes with a flexible 12-hour timer for each section.I found the blanket heated up slowly, but got warmer as the night went on and my body temperature rose. After 10 minutes, I didn’t notice much difference in heat, but after 30 minutes, it was measuring 25C, and rose to 29C after an hour. I like this slow and steady pace as I never felt as if I was overheating.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pricey and only comes in a small single and small double. Its smart app is still in development.Sizes available:small single, small doubledimensions:L200cm x W75cm;number of heat settings:six;timer included:yes, up to 12 hours;running cost on maximum:2p/hour (0.060kWh);temperature after an hour:29C;warranty:three years;machine washable:no, top surface can be wiped clean with warm soapy water and a soft cloth when disconnected from mains supplyOperaFlexi adjustable bed electric blanket (small double)£354£354 at OperaWhat we loveIt’s energy efficient and a good alternative to traditional wiresWhat we don’t loveIt only comes in two sizesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenHow much do electric blankets cost to run?In my tests, the average king-size electric blanket costs 3p an hour to run. This shows that even if used for a few hours a day, it could cut down on your heating use and save you money over the year – depending on how much you spend on the blanket in the first place, of course.“There are factors to consider when calculating the costs, as not all electric blankets are the same,” says John-Paul Drake, energy expert atLove Energy Savings. “Some come with timers, different heat settings and various efficiency ratings. But it could be wise to take advantage of both an electric blanket and a lower thermostat setting as an optimal way to save money on energy bills this winter.”How much should you spend on an electric blanket?Prices for an electric blanket range from about £30 to £140, depending on the size. Expect to pay anything from £20 to £150 for a heated throw.Are electric blankets safe?Electric blankets should be used with caution, and never by young babies and toddlers. Most manufacturers do not recommend use by young children, unless they’re supervised by an adult and have a clear understanding of how to use them safely. Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe use. Not always obvious on the box, but the latest electric blankets should have passed electrical safety checks. Look for safety marks such as “BEAB approved” (British Electrotechnical Approvals Board) or “KEMA-KEURsafety tested” for peace of mind. For more advice on electric blanket safety,read this advice from London Fire Brigade.Consider safety features such as an automatic switch-off timer that will turn off the blanket after a set time, or overheat protection, which switches off the device if it senses it’s getting too hot.An electric blanket should fit securely on your mattress, starting just below the area beneath your pillow to stop your head from overheating. It shouldn’t be folded or creased, as this can damage the wiring inside. The safest place to leave your blanket when it’s not needed is flat on your bed.Is my electric blanket compatible with my mattress?Electric blankets are compatible with most mattresses, but can potentially cause damage to some mattresses made from memory foam or latex. “Memory foam mattresses are heat-sensitive, and there has been a concern in the past that they could soften too much when heated by an electric blanket, damaging the foam’s structure and reducing support,” says Chelsea Brown, lead product adviser atOpera Beds.“Most modern electric blankets shouldn’t reach high enough temperatures for this to be an issue, but you should use them with caution. Memory foam is designed to mould to your body, so directly placing an electric blanket on top can also prevent the mattress from fitting your body snugly. Consider using a mattress topper under the electric blanket or keeping it on a low heat to prevent damage to your mattress.”For more, read thebest weighted blanketsand thebest electric heatersEmily Peck is alifestyle journalist who’s been writing and editing for more than twodecades.

These tools can be creators, destroyers and connectors, with functions (depending on the type of drill) including screw driving, hammer-drilling into brick or stone, mixing building materials, and plain-old drilling.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.MostDIYdrills are powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery – so there’s no cause to swear at an innocent power cable as you accidentally yank it from the plug socket. Usually, the same battery can also be used across a brand’s range of tools, including Bosch, Makita and Ryobi.If you’re interested in DIY, or if you’re a fully fledged home renovator, then owning a good cordless drill is a must. The most versatile type – and the one we’ve focused on here –is a combi drill, which features drill, hammer drill and screwdriver modes. SDS or SDS+ hammer drills, purpose-designed for breaking or drilling hard materials, are handy for home renovation, so you’ll see some of those, too.At a glanceBest cordless drill overallMakita DHP490Z 18V LXT brushless combi drillRead more£68.50Buy at B&QBest budget cordless drillGuild 18V cordless impact drill with 100 accessoriesRead more£48.75Buy at ArgosBest lightweight cordless drillRyobi 18V One+ HP compact cordless brushless combi drillRead more£109.99Buy at RyobiBest cordless hammer drillMakita DHR202 cordless rotary hammer drillRead more£119.98Buy at ToolstationWhy you should trust meI’ve been renovating my home for the past seven years, and I’ve used all sorts of drills – from lightweight combi drills, SDS+ drills and even a kango demolition drill – to help me do it. The experience has taught me plenty, from how to use the torque settings on a combi drill to the types of drill bits needed for each task. (I shudder to recall all the time I wasted trying to drill into brick without a masonry bit.)As a seasoned product reviewer, I’ve also tested cordless drills on several occasions. These tools are more varied than they may appear at first glance – in drilling and battery performance, as well as in design – so I’ll highlight what’s special about each model in my reviews.How I testedView image in fullscreenLet the (Drillympic) games begin!Photograph: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianI first tested using scrap wood and breeze blocks to weed out my least favourite of an initial group of 12, then challenged the best nine cordless drills to a multifunctional gauntlet of workstations – a challenge known affectionately among our team as the “Drillympics”.I timed how quickly each combi drill could complete a series of drilling, screw-driving and hammer-drilling challenges, while larger SDS+ drills faced having to drill multiple holes in a breeze block. In doing so, I was able to evaluate drill speed, ease and comfort in use, and how effectively they completed each task. The best performers could then take a moment to bask on a concrete podium, while I shivered in my sportswear, slightly regretting my commitment on such a chilly day.The Drillympics put our test subjects through a gauntlet of workstations. Video: Christian HopewellWith some top performers identified, I put the best drills through additional tests on my home renovation, drilling screw holes into brick and screwing skirting boards on to the walls. I considered performance across all functions, as well as battery runtime and ease of use.A few of the tool brands didn’t want their drills back after testing, so I donated these to the facilities team atMap Charity, a Leeds-based creative alternative education provider. The charity works with young people who have difficulties accessing mainstream schooling, and it offers creative opportunities from its home at the Grade II listed Hope House and Foundry.The best cordless drills for home DIY in 2026View image in fullscreenNo drill test is complete without a homemade podium.Photograph: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianBest cordless drill overall:Makita DHP490Z 18V LXT brushless combi drillMakitaDHP490Z 18V LXT brushless combi drillfrom£68.50£68.50 at B&Q£76.95 at AmazonWhat we loveUnrivalled performance and convenienceWhat we don’t loveLess battery cross-compatibility than some competing brandsPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£68.50 at B&Q£76.95 at AmazonI might have known that Makita, my engineer father-in-law’s brand of choice, would come out on top. This combi drill from the well-regarded Japanese tool maker is a DIY-appropriate model, with drill, hammer drill and screw-driving functions, plus excellent specs relative to the average consumer-grade power tool.Why we love itThe Makita proved to be the fastest performer in my “Drillympics”, and the best all-rounder in DIY use – and it’s not even particularly expensive. It blazed through all sorts of tasks, including installing and uninstalling screws, drilling into masonry, and neatly boring through wood – clocking faster times than any other model.You can feel this drill’s power as it races through material and blasts air out of its ventilation outlets, making what should theoretically be tough drilling tasks feel manageable. And between the two gears, a reliable chuck and brilliant LED work light, the user experience is exemplary.I found this drill a great help when mounting skirting boards to my spare room’s brick walls using screws, as I could switch between the highly effective hammer drill and screw-driving modes with minimal effort.It’s a shame that …the required battery and charger are additional purchases, as is true of several other drills featured here.You can buy the Makita battery and charger as a bundle for £57.99.Drillympics time and ranking:4:51 (gold medallist)Type:combiFunctions:drill, hammer drill, screwdriverMaximumspeed:1,900 RPMMaximumtorque:56NmBattery capacity:3Ahand5Ahoptions available (sold separately)Weight without battery:1kgMakitaDHP490Z 18V LXT brushless combi drillfrom£68.50£68.50 at B&Q£76.95 at AmazonWhat we loveUnrivalled performance and convenienceWhat we don’t loveLess battery cross-compatibility than some competing brandsBest budget cordless drill:Guild 18V cordless impact drill with 100 accessoriesGuild18V cordless impact drill with 100 accessories£48.75£48.75 at ArgosWhat we loveDecent performance at an excellent priceWhat we don’t loveNot great at hammer-drilling into brickPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£48.75 at ArgosThis Guild bundle includes everything you need for a pretty comprehensive range of drilling tasks in a beginner-friendly set. Pop open the hard case, and you’ll find the drill itself – a lightweight, well-made tool – along with its 2Ah lithium-ion battery, a charger, and a wide selection of drill bits.Why we love itI’ve had mixed experiences with budget brand Guild, but this cordless combi drill kit proved impressive. It’s comfortable to hold, the controls work smoothly, and it performs a decent range of drilling tasks (albeit not as swiftly as some of the swankier models I tested). The selection of drill bits included is focused on wood drilling and screw-driving tasks, and – perhaps not coincidentally – these are the drill’s strengths.I wouldn’t recommend this model to a hardcore home renovator who will be doing lots of repetitive drilling work, but for DIYers tackling lighter tasks, it’s a fantastic budget pick. The 2Ah battery will easily power you through putting up a shelf, for example.It’s a shame that …there are, understandably, some performance trade-offs with this affordable set. For instance, the chuck can only take drill bits up to 10mm in diameter, while 13mm is more typical in a mid-market or premium combi drill.Drillympics time and ranking:07:34 (fifth place)Type:combi (kit)Functions:drill, hammer drill, screwdriverMaximumspeed:1,600 RPMMaximumtorque:30NmBattery capacity:2Ah (battery included)Weight without battery:855gGuild18V cordless impact drill with 100 accessories£48.75£48.75 at ArgosWhat we loveDecent performance at an excellent priceWhat we don’t loveNot great at hammer-drilling into brickBest lightweight cordless drill:Ryobi 18V One+ HP compact cordless brushless combi drillRyobi18V One+ HP compact cordless brushless combi drillfrom£109.99£109.99 at Ryobi£113.30 at AmazonWhat we loveCompact and user-friendly, with great screwdrivingWhat we don’t loveFor a Ryobi tool, it’s unusually expensivePhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£109.99 at Ryobi£113.30 at AmazonI’ve always found that Ryobi strikes a good balance between fair pricing and competent performance – and to say that this drill ticks those boxes feels like an understatement. It sits at the top of this brand’s range, with a powerful, efficient brushless motor and solid construction.Why we love itThis drill has been one of my go-tos for years. Its compact design and ease of use make it ideal for quick tasks or working in confined spaces, and my wife appreciates the handle’s modest size – a rare example of power tool design that seems geared towards smaller hands.I’ve had good experiences with this drill when wall-mounting fixtures or assembling flat-pack furniture, so I was unsurprised when it performed well in my “Drillympics” tests. It demonstrated impressive torque, turning screws until they were flush, and powerfully drilled into hard materials such as concrete when used in hammer-drill mode.In addition to the drill, you’ll need to buy a Ryobi 18V battery and charger, which are available in several variants, individually or as abundle. These can also be used acrossRyobi’s vast One+ 18V cordless tool range. I’ve found that Ryobi 18V batteries perform well for more than five years, which is excellent.It’s a shame that …the price will be a bit much for some users.Drillympics time and ranking:5:56 (bronze medallist)Type:combiFunctions:drill, hammer drill, screwdriverMaximumspeed:1,700 RPMMaximumtorque:60NmBattery capacity:many options from 2Ah to 12Ah, sold separatelyWeight without battery:1kgRyobi18V One+ HP compact cordless brushless combi drillfrom£109.99£109.99 at Ryobi£113.30 at AmazonWhat we loveCompact and user-friendly, with great screwdrivingWhat we don’t loveFor a Ryobi tool, it’s unusually expensiveBest cordless hammer drill:Makita DHR202 cordless rotary hammer drillMakitaDHR202 cordless rotary hammer drillfrom£119.98£119.98 at Toolstation£119.99 at B&QWhat we loveExcellent capabilities to drill or break hard materialWhat we don’t loveSurplus to requirements for most DIYersPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£119.98 at Toolstation£119.99 at B&QMost DIYers will get by perfectly well using a combi drill, but those undertaking extensive demolition or structural work will need something with more power. An SDS+ drill – a type of hammer drill that accepts larger, specialised drill bits – is just the ticket. This cordless model from Makita offers powerful drill and hammer-drill functions, as well as a straightforward hammer mode that turns the tool into a power chisel.Why we love itThis drill made light work of all the tough tasks I set for it during testing, from chasing out old mortar between bricks to drilling holes in breeze blocks. Despite its power, it’s simple to use and impressively stable. A safety button on the mode selector ensures you make a mindful choice of setting before you start drilling.You’ll need to buy the battery and charger separately. I found that Makita’s5Ah 18V LXT batterycharges quickly via the brand’sLXT Fast Charger, and the drill got through plenty of work on a single charge, despite its power-intensive action. Given the fast charge-up, you could get away with using just one high-capacity battery (5Ah) and taking well-earned breaks while it recharges during longer DIY sessions.It’s a shame that …the cost really racks up when you factor in a battery, charger and SDS bits.Drillympics time and ranking:01:25 (winner – shorter SDS drill challenge)Type:SDS+Functions:drill, hammer drill, chiselMaximumspeed:1,100 RPMMaximumblows per minute:4,000Battery capacity:3Ahand5Ahoptions available (sold separately)Weight without battery:3.2kgMakitaDHR202 cordless rotary hammer drillfrom£119.98£119.98 at Toolstation£119.99 at B&QWhat we loveExcellent capabilities to drill or break hard materialWhat we don’t loveSurplus to requirements for most DIYersThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Drills powerfully into wood or plaster’: the Bosch UniversalImpact 18V-60 combi drill.Photograph: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianBosch UniversalImpact 18V-60 combi drillBoschUniversalImpact 18V-60 combi drillfrom£99£99 at Wickes£109 at CurrysWhat we loveThoughtful design and superb ease of useWhat we don’t loveHammer drill performance is good, not greatPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£99 at Wickes£109 at CurrysBest for:a user-friendly cordless combi drillBosch divides its power tools into consumer (Home and Garden) and contractor-grade (Professional) ranges, and I’ve always found that its green-coloured consumer models are especially easy to use.This proves to be the case with the UniversalImpact, which feels highly controlled when screw driving, drills powerfully into wood or plaster, and has some design advantages over competing models – including a silky-smooth direction selector. The 2Ah batteries charge speedily, and you can always use one while the other recharges.It didn’t make the final cut because …its hammer drill function got the job done but was too slow for my liking.Drillympics time and ranking:06:12 (fourth place);type:combi;functions:drill, hammer drill, screwdriver;maximumspeed:1,900 RPM;maximumtorque:60Nm;battery capacity:2 x 2Ah;weight without battery:990gBoschUniversalImpact 18V-60 combi drillfrom£99£99 at Wickes£109 at CurrysWhat we loveThoughtful design and superb ease of useWhat we don’t loveHammer drill performance is good, not greatDraper D20 20V brushless combi drill set (with battery and charger)DraperD20 20V brushless combi drill set (with battery and charger)from£124.13£124.13 at Power Tools Direct£130.99 at Robert DyasWhat we loveWell adapted for hammer-drilling into hard brickWhat we don’t loveScrewdriver mode doesn’t get screws totally flushPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£124.13 at Power Tools Direct£130.99 at Robert DyasBest for:a high-powered combi drillIf you want a combi drill that’s well suited to repeatedly drilling into brick or other hard materials, this 20V Draper model is an excellent choice.During “Drillympics” challenges and actual DIY, I found this model powerful and effective, with its heavy chuck providing a flawlessly secure grip on all sorts of drill bits. The auxiliary handle can attach to the drill in either a left- or right-handed configuration, providing a stable, two-handed grip for intensive hammer-drilling tasks.It didn’t make the final cut because …its screw-driving mode wasn’t quite as effective as its other functions in tests.

If you’d prefer a beginner-friendly option, this Bosch would be my recommendation. The controls are clear and easy to use, the drill is relatively lightweight, and the battery and charger are included in its reasonable price.This drill was only marginally slower in completing a special breeze block drilling challenge than the Makita SDS+ model reviewed above, so if your priority is user-friendliness without sacrificing much power, this could be the better option for you. I appreciated its all-round drilling capabilities: using the rotary drill mode, it made its way through softer materials such as wood with ease and control.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s slightly prone to losing hold of its drill bit within the workpiece during hammer-drilling.Drillympics time and ranking:time 01:34 (second place – shorter SDS drill challenge);type:SDS+;functions:drill, hammer drill, chisel;maximumspeed:2,000 RPM;maximumblows per minute:5,400;battery capacity:2.5Ah;weight without battery:2.4kgBoschUniversalHammer 18Vfrom£125.99£141.99 at Robert Dyas£125.99 at AmazonWhat we loveBest-in-class usability and good performanceWhat we don’t loveIts occasional tendency to lose hold of the drill bitBlack+Decker cordless hammer drill 18VBlack+DeckerCordless hammer drill 18Vfrom£41.99£41.99 at Currys£59.98 at B&QWhat we loveCompact and convenient, with fast bit changeWhat we don’t loveThe hammer-drill mode is ineffectivePhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£41.99 at Currys£59.98 at B&QBest for:a compact drill at a bargain priceThis bargain-priced Black+Decker drill is an affordable, beginner-friendly option for screw-driving tasks and drilling into softer materials such as wood or plaster. I found it easy to turn the collar and rapidly switch between drill bits during tests, making it perfect for assembling flat-packed furniture, for example. With a neat carry case and a small battery charger that plugs into the battery, it’s a handy model to use in a snug home.It didn’t make the final cut because …the hammer drill function on this combi drill is ineffective. I couldn’t drill through a breeze block with it, so I’d recommend it for lighter work only.

It’s simple to use, with easy mode and torque selection via independently moving parts on the collar, and an LED battery status indicator built into the drill itself. The handle-housed battery makes the drill highly manoeuvrable in tight spaces (which will come in handy when you’re mounting complicated wall brackets for fixtures, such as shelves or a cooker hood).It didn’t make the final cut because …it drills too slowly for my liking – but if you only have a few holes to make or a few screws to install, this won’t be a major problem.Drillympics time and ranking:8:03 (sixth place);type:combi;functions:drill, hammer drill (in theory), screwdriver;maximumspeed:1,300 RPM;maximumtorque:30Nm;battery capacity:1.5Ah;weight without battery:837gDraper12V combi drill 70256from£48£49.72 at B&Q£48 at AmazonWhat we loveBeginner-friendly, lightweight designWhat we don’t loveDrills too slowly for lengthy tasks (or impatient users …)What you need to knowLet’s drill down into what you need and what you don’t. Video: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianWhat type of drill do I need?This depends on the work you intend to do with your cordless drill. Most models are of the following types:Combi drill:a multifunctional type with different modes for drilling, hammer drilling (which adds a back-and-forth motion to drill into masonry) and screw driving. If you’re only going to get one cordless drill for DIY, I’d recommend a combi drill: it will cover most tasks.Drill-driver:similar to a combi drill, but without a hammer-drilling mode. They’re marginally less expensive and suitable for woodworking or lighter DIY tasks. However, they’re not for drilling into brick, which will be a major disadvantage for many DIYers.Hammer drill:a higher-powered drill designed for hammer-drilling tasks. If you’re likely to do a lot of drilling into walls, which is a common task for home renovators, then a dedicated hammer drill will be useful. I’d definitely recommend one if your property has walls made from very hard brick or stone.SDS drill/SDS+drill:a large-format hammer drill that accepts special drill bits called SDS bits. I use a corded SDS+ drill –this highly rated model from Clarke– for heavy-duty tasks, such as mixing grout or demolition work.For the average DIYer who isn’t embarking on major renovation work, one good combi drill should be sufficient.What are the key cordless drill features to look out for?Pay attention to thebattery specifications, as this affects how much work you can do with the drill before it needs recharging. Battery storage is measured in amp hours (eg 2Ah or 4Ah), with higher ratings theoretically offering longer runtimes. The main downside to using a higher-capacity battery is that this will make the drill heavier.The design of thechuckis also important. This is the opening that holds the drill bit in place, and some examples are more secure than others. Most DIY drills have a keyless chuck that’s simple to tighten by hand, but you might prefer to use a drill with a keyed chuck for heavy-duty tasks. These use a key accessory to tighten and tend to be more secure.A cordless drill’svoltageis a good guide to its likely power. Some entry-level combi drill models are 12V, while 18V cordless drills are the industry standard for DIY use; 20V cordless drills can provide a meaningful advantage in power during intensive work.There are various useful, nice-to-have features that can make a drill well suited to certain tasks or users, too. A depth stop and auxiliary handle can help with accurate, steady hammer-drilling into walls, while an LED light at the front of the drill will aid visibility. For screw-driving, it’s useful to have a wide range oftorque settings(denoted by numbers on the barrel of the drill) with which you can adjust the drill’s turning force to suit the task in hand.Which drill bits should I use?Most combi drills, drill-drivers and hammer drills (with the exception of SDS+ models) are compatible with standard drill bits. There are many types designed for drilling into different materials:Universal drill bitsdo a decent job of drilling into most materials, including plastics, woods and soft metals.Diamond-tipped drill bitsare best for drilling into shatter-prone materials such as ceramic tiles.Masonry bitsare essential for drilling into brick, stone or concrete. They’re distinguishable by their angular tips.HSS drill bitshave a heat-resistant coating that makes them well suited for drilling into metal. They often have a yellowish-gold colour.Wood bitsare specialised for accurate, effective drilling into wood. You can get away with using universal bits instead, but proper wood bits are superior for woodcrafts and carpentry.Screwdriver bitsare used to install or uninstall screws. They come with lots of different profiles to turn different screw types and sizes.Another useful type to have in your toolbox is acountersink bit. These have a mushroom-shaped tip that bores a dip into the top of a drill hole, so that a screw can be inserted without its head protruding. You can then apply filler over the countersunk screw to make it invisible.Most types of drill bits come in many sizes, and you’ll need a diverse selection to cater for a household’s worth of maintenance and DIY tasks. I use an affordable,246-piece VonHaus setto cover all bases, supplemented with higher-quality drill bits for frequent or important tasks. ThisBosch 103-piece setwould give you better quality from the off.For more:The best home storage hacksSpace-saving tricks to make small rooms feel biggerEasy ways to update your rental home on a budgetPete Wise is ajournalist from Leeds.

I sometimes add a few drops of fresh lime juice to sharpen the sweetness and make the fruit flavours really pop.

Instead of the traditional rubbing-in method, the crumble is made by pouring warm browned butter straight into the dry ingredients, creating a pebbly topping with a deeper toasted flavour. Leave out the crushed fennel seed, if you prefer, but this small addition, bloomed briefly in the butter, gives the whole thing a subtle aromatic lift.Rhubarb, pear and hazelnut crumble with browned butterPrep15 minCook1 hr 15 min, plus coolingServes680g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orange, plus 1 tbsp juice1½tbsp tapioca flour, or cornflour500g rhubarb, trimmed and cut into roughly 2cm pieces2 large, ripe pears, peeled, cored and cut into 2cm pieces1tbsp orange juice1 tsp vanilla bean pastePouring cream, vanilla ice-cream or thick yoghurt, to serveFor the crumble topping130g unsalted butter, plus 10g extra, softened, for greasing1 tsp fennel seeds, lightly crushed (optional)130g plain flour80g light brown sugar70g rolled oats70g toasted blanched hazelnuts, roughly chopped¼ tsp fine sea saltStart by making the topping: put the butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally until the butter has completely melted. Keep cooking until the butter smells nutty and turns golden; it will splutter and hiss at first, then quieten as the foam subsides. When dark brown specks form on the bottom of the pan, take the pan off the heat, stir in the crushed fennel seeds, if using, and leave to “bloom” for a couple of minutes.Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir the flour, brown sugar, oats, hazelnuts and salt to combine. Pour over the warm browned butter (including the brown sediments – they have great flavour) and stir until irregular clumps form; you want a mixture of both rubble and fine crumbs. Put the crumble mix in the fridge for now.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and lightly grease an oval ovenproof dish (I used a 28cm x 16cm one) with the extra 10g softened butter.For the filling, put the sugar and orange zest in a large bowl and rub firmly until it smells fragrant and the sugar is tinged orange. Stir in the tapioca flour, then add the rhubarb, pears, orange juice and vanilla. Toss gently to combine, then tip into the buttered baking dish. Scatter the crumble mix evenly on top, then bake for 45-50 minutes, until the fruit juices are bubbling up around the edges and the top is golden brown. Remove and leave to stand for at least 15 minutes, then serve with pouring cream, vanilla ice-cream or thick yoghurt.Explore more on these topicsDessertThe sweet spotFoodFruitVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkBakingNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"

She says: “It’s different from what you usually see, namely a lot of black, white, red and metallic gowns.

John Lewis hasembraced the colour for spring, while Depop reported that searches for green rose by 47% in January. John Lewis’s design director, Queralt Ferrer, echoes the idea that the shade may be edging out red. “Spring 2026 will introduce fresh pops of colour, with green taking centre stage as the season’s hero hue,” Ferrer says.For those hesitant to experiment, she advises starting small: “If you’re new to colour, try adding an accessory, like ballet flats, or make more of a statement by layering in a jumper or cardigan.”Explore more on these topicsFashionPamela AndersonNew York fashion weekFashion weeksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A world apart from Florence or Turin, Naples is a fascinating, lived-in city with a long history and a rich culinary tradition. The Spaccanapoli, which runs right through the core of the city, is a bustling place to walk along and experience Neapolitan life. The world-class sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum are nearby, as are Mount Vesuvius, Sorrento and the wonderful islands of Capri, Ischia and Procida. You can get to Naples by train from London via Paris and Turin or Milan in about 15 hours.Michael KuipersTake the ferry to CorsicaView image in fullscreenCorsica in spring offers wildflower-covered hillsides and snowy mountain peaks.Photograph: Jon Ingall/AlamyEurostar from London via an easy connection at Lille or a change in Paris takes between six and eight hours to arrive in Marseille.

From Bastia, catch the scenic mountain railway into this remarkably unspoiled island to explore its wild interior and coastal regions. Mid to late spring is best for southern Europe, when snow-melt replenishes streams and waterfalls that dry up in summer. The weather is sunny yet exceedingly pleasant, hillsides blanketed with wildflowers, wild animals nurturing their young and locals refreshed in mood.JakeProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

We took boat trips, including to Cochem, to take the chairlift opposite the castle up to the Pinnerkreuz viewpoint. Early April means wildflower-strewn meadows and fewer visitors.

I’ve always tried to live as peaceful a life as I can, outside the big cities. Now I am the last person left in England making clogs by hand. I spend most days in my studio in Kington, Herefordshire, carving green sycamore wood that I collect myself, hand-dyeing the leather and making sure the soles are as near perfect a match to someone’s foot as possible. I don’t think you can have a more peaceful life than that.I grew up in Ceredigion, surrounded by sheep. There were no jobs in the area and in 1976 I had to go on benefits. I developed extreme anxiety after breaking up with my first girlfriend. Convent schooling and boys’ boarding schools weren’t the best places to learn to develop relationships and I needed to find something therapeutic to do.I met a craftsman in an adjoining village called Tregaron. He was a clog maker called Hywel Davies. I began training with him as an apprentice. I found the craft fascinating. Clog carving knives are dangerous, so the activity demanded my complete attention: it was the perfect therapeutic outlet.I also taught myself to make other kinds of shoes, but I’ve always stuck by clogs. I can’t say I had any natural aptitude for the craft, but it’s mostly sheer will that gets you through.British clogs are made of a combination of wood and leather, not to be mistaken for the more well-known European all-wooden footwear. Each pair takes about 15 hours to make. Women’s and children’s shoes are easier as they’re generally smaller, but men make up most of my customers. Some of their feet are so big, I can only compare them to yetis’.Once, when I was in my 20s, I managed to make almost two pairs in a day, but they weren’t very good. Now I’m in my 70s, it takes me a lot longer. Collecting the wood and shaping it by hand is also very tough on my back. I don’t know how much longer I have left as a maker.I cut small trees myself around Offa’s Dyke, on the border between England and Wales. A man once told me he had a tree that needed felling, and asked if I could make him any clogs from the pieces. I made two pairs for him and a pair each for his wife and daughter.Experience: I am the Excel world championRead moreMy clogs have been sent around the world – as far as Tasmania – but my regular clients are mostly in the UK. I send customers the wooden soles to check they fit properly first. I wouldn’t even be able to begin counting how many clogs I’ve made over the years.Fifteen years ago, a client ordered seven pairs over a few months – he had more faith in my work than my longevity. He had flat feet and couldn’t bend them without being in pain, so I carved a curve into his clogs to help him. People think they’re difficult to walk in, but that’s a misconception. I only wear clogs that I’ve made myself. I’ve made pairs for morris dancers who have said they were the first shoes they could comfortably dance in, and even keep on for the rest of the day.I often get asked whether I’m worried about competing with machinery. Traditional clog making started dying out as early as the 1950s, and while I will never keep up with machines when it comes to quantity, my bespoke shoes will fit better.I’ve advised film and theatre companies on the history of clogs. I made some shoes for Carey Mulligan, who played the lead in the film Suffragette. Initially they’d asked me to make a pair of clogs which would have been wrong for that era – I was then tasked with producing something that was historically accurate.I have had to subsidise my income over the years, and have worked as a National Trails surveyor. But I have always returned to clog making, even writing a booklet about them. I’ve only successfully taught one person to properly and safely carve: now he works at a museum.While I don’t earn very much, that doesn’t matter. It’s not why I do it. I recently came across atrade journal from more than a hundred years ago, in which the author expressed surprise that clog carving was still being done by anyone. It’s of its time – soon to be a thing of the past.As told to Elizabeth McCaffertyDo you have an experience to share?

I’d see them as I was playing outside, or through the window from inside, and be baffled. What could they possibly be looking at?Fast-forward three decades and I’m the one pinching my mum’s clogs to inspect my parents’ dinky and beautifully appointed garden. My dad’s complaining about the hellebores, which haven’t naturalised as well as in the garden I used to watch him walk his father around.

They’re easily dismissed as rather frumpy, due to an unfortunate habit of appearing on greetings cards and embroidered on to handkerchiefs.

After the snowdrops, they’re the first spring flowers to appear in our boggy verges and woodlands – their name descends from the Latinprima rosa,for first rose. Monty Don said they’re his favourite flower, as they herald the start of spring. Shakespeare, meanwhile, looked to those big floppy leaves in Hamlet, when Ophelia warns against heading down the “primrose path of dalliance”, which sounds quite fun. Perhaps they’re more rock’n’roll than I’ve given them credit for.As with many over-familiar plants, whip primroses out of their traditional context and they become something else entirely. I remember being charmed by them popping up – because they do pop up, that’s one of the things that’s so great about them – in the artfully scrubby courtyard of a garden designer I visited last spring, alongside dandelions and daisies. How simple, how clever, how wonderfully un-twee.Veer away from the brightly coloured ones rammed into windowboxes and you’re on to a winner. Primroses love shade and hate to dry out, so plant them somewhere that will hold on to that winter damp. Leave them to go to seed and the wild ones will cross-pollinate, leading to clumps of white, brighter yellow and even pink-hued flowers to surprise you at the end of a long winter.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensWild flowersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To Jews it is the Temple Mount, the site of the 10th-century BC first temple and second temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in AD70.map of Jerusalem Old CityChanges in the status quo have historically shown the potential to ignite unrest and conflict in Jerusalem and the Palestinian occupied territories with repercussions across the world. A visit by the then Israeli opposition leader,Ariel Sharon, in 2000ignited the second Palestinian intifada, which lasted five years, and Hamas gave the name “al-Aqsa Flood” to its attack on Israel in October 2023 which killed 1,200 Israelis and triggered the Gaza war, claiming it was provoked by Israeli violations at the Jerusalem mosque.“Al-Aqsa is a detonator,” said Daniel Seidemann, a Jerusalem lawyer who has regularly advised Israeli, Palestinian and foreign governments on legal and historical issues in the city. “It’s usually around the same thing – a real or perceived threat to the integrity of sacred space. And that’s what we’re witnessing. There have been provocations frequently during Ramadan, but things are exponentially more sensitive now. TheWest Bankis a tinderbox.”View image in fullscreenIsraeli security forces stop Muslim worshippers from praying outside after they were banned from entering al-Aqsa mosque compound on Wednesday.Photograph: John Wessels/AFP/Getty ImagesTensions have escalated steadily around al-Aqsa mosque as far-right Israelis have taken up key security positions. The national security minister,Itamar Ben-Gvir– who had eight criminal convictions before taking office, for supporting a terrorist organisation and incitement to racism, among other charges – has said he wanted to raise the Israeli flag at the compound and build a synagogue there.Ben-Gvir has made inflammatory visits to al-Aqsa over the past year, and backed a series of unilateral changes to the status quo, allowing Jews to pray and sing in the compound. In January, he installed an ideological ally, Maj Gen Avshalom Peled, as the Jerusalem police chief, and with the reported backing of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, allowed Jews to take printed prayer sheets on to the site, in ever-more clearcut violations.“The status quo has collapsed because there are prayers on a daily basis,” Seidemann said. “In the past, the police were very strict about preventing any kind of provocation … but these measures are displays of ‘we’re in control here, get used to it or get out of the way’.”View image in fullscreenMuslim worshippers walk past Israeli security forces as they leave al-Aqsa mosque compound on Wednesday evening.Photograph: John Wessels/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the run-up to Ramadan this year, the Jerusalem Waqf, the Jordanian-appointed foundation charged with managing al-Aqsa’s site as part of the status quo agreement, has come under increasing pressure. Waqf sources said five of its staff had been put in administrative detention (detention without charge) this week by the Shin Bet, while 38 staff members had been banned from entering the site. Six imams from the mosque had also been denied entrance, they said.They said six Waqf offices had been ransacked in recent weeks and the staff prevented from rehanging doors or doing other repairs. The Waqf has been prevented from installing sun and rain shelters or temporary clinics for worshippers. Officials allege they have even been prevented from bringing toilet paper on to the site.The cumulative effect, the officials said, had been to strain the Waqf’s ability to cater to the 10,000 Muslims expected to come to pray at al-Aqsa mosque over the month of Ramadan.The Palestinian-run Jerusalem governorate provided different figures: 25 Waqf staff members banned, and four detained. Neither the Jerusalem police nor the Shin Bet responded to requests for comments on the allegations.View image in fullscreenPalestinian worshippers offer prayers on Wednesday evening next to the entrance of al-Aqsa mosque after they were prevented from entering.Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPAIn the first week of Ramadan the police extended the morning visiting hours for Jews and tourists from three to five, in another unilateral change to the status quo. On Monday, the imam of al-Aqsa, Sheikh Mohammed al-Abbasi, was detained inside the mosque courtyard, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, and social media posts showed the police raiding the compound again on Tuesday evening during the first night prayers of Ramadan.On Wednesday morning, an estimated 400 settlers entered the compound and, according to witnesses, sang, danced and prayed aloud.“There are so many ingredients that make this Ramadan especially dangerous,” said Amjad Iraqi, a senior Israel/Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group. “Last year was relatively smooth, but this year there are a confluence of so many factors on the Israeli and Palestinian sides that may incentivise the Temple Mount activists to try and create new alterations.”“If in the past the Israeli government felt compelled to engage with regional powers, today they care much less about what they have to say and think,” Iraqi added.“There has been a diffusion of impunity … Israelis have been able to accomplish a lot outside of the constraints they thought existed politically, militarily and diplomatically, in Gaza and the West Bank.

Most of the Wolf volcano tortoises had domed shells like those living on Isabela’s other volcanoes to the south, but some had a saddleback-shaped carapace more typical of the tortoises that evolved on Floreana.Acaptive “back breeding” programmebegan in 2017, for which 23 hybrid tortoises most closely related to the Floreana subspecies were chosen to recreate it as genetically close to the original as possible.More than 600 hatchlings had been born by 2025, and several hundred grew large enough to be returned to their ancestral island. Males can reach nearly 1.5 metres (5ft) in length.mapAlthough whalers wiped out the Floreana tortoise, it ironically endured on Wolf volcano because they also deposited live tortoises on other islands for safekeeping and sometimes tossed tortoise cargo overboard if they needed to lighten their load during their whaling missions.Floreana, the sixth largest island in the archipelago, was once home to a wealth of endemic wildlife, including spectacular species such as theFloreana mockingbird, theFloreana racer snake. But the arrival of sailors, whalers and then settlers brought invasive mammals including rats and feral cats that wiped out native fauna and flora,a pattern repeated on small islands across the world. When Charles Darwin reached Floreana in 1835, its giant tortoise population was in its death throes.Its reintroduction has been brought about by theFloreana Ecological Restoration Project, a partnership between theGalápagos national park directorateand a number ofcharitiesworking closely with the island’s 160 residents.An invasive species eradication programme, which began in 2023 and has removed most of the rats and feral cats on the island, paved the way for the tortoises’ return.TheGalapagos railhas since been rediscovered on Floreana after not being recorded since Darwin’s first visit, and there has been a resurgence in populations of ground finches and native geckos, lizards and snails.Verónica Mora, a Floreana community representative, said of the tortoises’ return: “This moment marks an important step toward a future where conservation and community wellbeing go hand in hand, because our livelihoods, from tourism to agriculture and fishing, depend on the health of this island.”View image in fullscreenThe Floreana giant tortoise.Photograph: PRThe island’s farmers have also reported much-improved harvests since rat numbers were drastically reduced.Giant tortoises are “keystone species”. Their grazing maintains open habitats, promoting the growth of native plants and creating conditions that benefit reptiles, invertebrates and birds. They also distribute native seeds across the island as they roam.“Habitats are the foundation for biodiversity, the home that allows species to move, live and evolve naturally over time,” said Rakan Zahawi, the executive director of theCharles Darwin Foundation. “Giant tortoises are a critical part of this system. By dispersing seeds, shaping vegetation, creating micro-habitats such as their well known wallows, and influencing how landscapes regenerate, they help rebuild ecological processes that many other species depend on.”Hugo Mogollón, the chief executive ofGalápagos Conservancy, said: “By identifying tortoises on Wolf Volcano with Floreana ancestry and breeding their descendants, we are returning this species to its island in a form that closely reflects the original lineage – laying a critical scientific foundation for the restoration of Floreana’s ecosystems and the future reintroduction of additional native species.”The next phase of restoration will seek to return species including the Floreana mockingbird, the Floreana racer snake, the vegetarian finch and thelittle vermilion flycatcher.Dr Jen Jones, the chief executive of theGalapagos Conservation Trust, said: “It’s a validation of the incredible efforts we’ve seen over the last 20 years from a whole ecosystem of conservation NGOs, local authorities, determined individual researchers and community champions.”Explore more on these topicsGalápagos IslandsReptilesWildlifeConservationBiodiversityEcuadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Missing Morales mystery as Bolivia’s ex-president goes to groundRead moreMorales,Bolivia’sfirst Indigenous president, who served from 2006 until his fraught 2019 ouster and subsequent self-exile, explained that he had come down with chikungunya, a mosquito-borne ailment with no treatment that causes fever and severe joint pain, and suffered complications that “caught me by surprise”.“Take care of yourselves against chikungunya — it is serious,” the 66-year-old Morales said, appearing markedly more frail than in past appearances.He dismissed rumours fuelled by local politicians and fanned by social media that he would try to flee the country, vowing to remain in Bolivia despite the threat of arrest underconservative president Rodrigo Paz, whose election last October ended nearly two decades of rule by Morales’ Movement Toward Socialism party.“Some media said, ‘Evo is going to leave, Evo is going to flee.’ I said clearly: I am not going to leave. I will stay with the people to defend the homeland,” he said.Paz’s revival of diplomatic ties with the US and recent efforts to bring back the Drug Enforcement Administration — some 17 years after Morales expelled American anti-drug agents from the Andean country while cozying up to China, Russia, Cuba and Iran — have rattled the coca-growing region that serves as Morales’ bastion of support.Paz on Thursday confirmed that he would meet Trump in Miami on 7 March for a summit convening politically aligned Latin American leaders as the Trump administration seeks to counter Chinese influence and assert US dominance in the region.Before proclaiming the candidates he would endorse in Bolivia’s municipal and regional elections next month, Morales launched into a lengthy speech reminiscent of his once-frequent diatribes against US imperialism.“This is geopolitical propaganda on an international scale,” he said of Trump’s bid to revive the Monroe Doctrine from 1823 in order to reassert American dominance in the Western Hemisphere. “They want to eliminate every left-wing party in Latin America.”Explore more on these topicsBoliviaEvo MoralesAmericasDonald TrumpVenezuelanewsShareReuse this content"

A statement by the government’s region 5 livestock office for Chiang Mai said the animals had been infected with canine distemper virus, with veterinarians also identifying mycoplasma bacteria as a secondary infection.Earlier, however, Somchuan Ratanamungklanon, director general of the department of livestock development within the Thai agricultural ministry, told the Thai outlet Matichon that the tigers had been infected with feline panleukopenia.“Treating sick tigers is very different from treating dogs and cats. Dogs and cats live closely with us, so when they show symptoms, we can respond and provide treatment right away. Tigers, however, aren’t living closely with humans. By the time we notice that something is wrong, the illness may already be advanced,” he said.The outbreak has affected two districts of Chiang Mai: the mountainous regions of Mae Rim and Mae Taeng. Dozens of tigers first began to show signs of illness on 8 February, media reported.Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai has been temporarily closed since the deaths. The zoo, which allows visitors to “hug, touch, and take photos up close with tigers”, is a popular tourist attraction.Kritsayarm Kongsatri, director of the wildlife conservation office in Chiang Mai, told Thai media the number of deaths recorded was “very unusual”.In other instances of tiger deaths, 47 died along with three leopards between August and October 2024 in south Vietnam after catching bird flu.In October 2004, an outbreak of bird flu spread in Sriracha tiger zoo in Chonburi province in eastern Thailand. A total of 147 of the zoo’s 441 tigers died or were euthanised to prevent possible spread to other animals. Fresh chicken carcasses fed to the animals were pointed to as the most likely source of infection.Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai could not immediately be reached for comment.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificAnimalsZoosnewsShareReuse this content"

Documents related to those lawsuits were found in his apartment, the police said.The retail entrepreneur, a British passport holder, co-founded Asos in London in 2000 with Nick Robertson, the great-grandson of the eponymous founder of the suit retailer Austin Reed. The business launched with the name As Seen on Screen, before switching to the Asos acronym in 2002. It was floated on London’s Alternative Investment Market in 2001 and grew to become one of the world’s largest online fashion retailers, with its designs worn by Rihanna and Michelle Obama. Griffiths left the company in 2005 but remained a large shareholder for nearly another decade.He later pursued several other ventures, co-founding the online furniture store Achica, the music-focused fashion retailer EBTM, and Adili, an ethical clothing website. EBTM later went into administration, whileAdili was sold for a nominal £1.Asked about Griffiths, the UK Foreign Office said it was supporting “the family of a British national who has died in Thailand” and was in touch with the local authorities.Asos said in a statement: “We’re saddened to hear about the passing of Quentin, one of our original co-founders. He played an important role in Asos’ earliest days and we’re forever grateful for his contribution. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.”Explore more on these topicsThailandAsosFashion industryRetail industryAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Renewing a 1.2 mile segment would cost about 500m yen, Kotani said.Osaka had 92 cases of water pipe leaks under city roads in the fiscal year ending March 2025, Kotani said.Concern over the safety of Japan’s waterworks systems grew after a truck fell into a sinkhole last year, killing the driver. It was linked to a damaged sewer in Saitama, north of Tokyo.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not fair, he [Danby] is still out there, there is no justice.”It emerged in his earlier court case that the 24-year-old driver had bragged in text messages that the man he killed was an “oxygen thief” and he would not go to jail.He called it a “two for one combo” and texted it was “pretty funny watching them roll around on the road after going over my bonnet”.Whitehurst said those words continue to hurt the grieving family, as she rubbished the new punishment.Prosecutors argued on appeal on 11 December that the text messages elevated Danby’s crime to the aggravated level.Prosecutor Pat Williams said a jail term of more than two years was required given the seriousness of the offending and public expectations.But defence counsel Jon Tippett said the sentencing judge had taken note of Danby’s text messages and while being appalled by them gave them appropriate weight.Supreme court justice Sonia Brownhill had given his client a chance of rehabilitation and counselling and he was abiding by his corrections order amid public condemnation of his actions, the defence said.“The renunciation in this case has been a tarring and feathering by the community,” Tippett said.“Courts shouldn’t sentence people on the basis of their stupidity or vile comments.”Whitehurst’s nephews often ask where their uncle is and remember him as a funny, humble and kind man.“They miss him,” Whitehurst said.Danby was not in court on Friday and Tippett declined to comment on the revised sentence outside court.NT attorney general, Marie-Clare Boothby, has come under fire over the Danby case, accused ofnot reporting a conflict of interestafter it emerged he was her sister’s stepson.Boothby said she never attempted to hide the fact Danby was an extended family member and at no time was she or her office involved in the criminal matter.Explore more on these topicsNorthern TerritoryCrime - AustraliaIndigenous AustraliansAustralian lawnewsShareReuse this content"

The wealth of the company’s Australian founders, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, has collectively dropped about $US8bn ($11.5bn) in a matter of weeks as the value of their large shareholdings collapse.What's behind the 'SaaS-pocalypse'?Ever since AI entered the public consciousness through ChatGPT, investors have piled into technology stocks, excited about its prospects as a genuine life-changing innovation.That euphoria was interrupted last year when traders started to consider how AI may affect software companies, a core component of the tech sector.Those fears were magnified at the start of 2026, when the US-based Anthropic rolled out releases allowing users to communicate with their computers in natural language to conduct complex tasks like data analysis and expense tracking.This is considered to be hugely disruptive to expensive SaaS applications that require the user to learn the language of the software.The potential for disruption is clear, with some software at risk of becoming obsolete in a similar way to how digital photography destroyed Kodak and touchscreens decimated Blackberry.Investors have also raised concerns over the future of the “per seat” charging model, a common billing model in the SaaS industry whereby a software company charges fees for every individual who has access to it.As Morningstar points out, in an AI-enhanced future, “if one person can now do the work of two, seat counts fall”.Australia’s technology index, which contains several big-name software companies including Xero and WiseTech, is down about 17% since the start of the year, and more than 25% over six months.The unease has captured other sectors, with investors considering whether portfolio construction, tax planning, insurance calculations and data analytics could be AI automated, making specialist firms in those fields redundant.Are the concerns overblown?Luke McMillan, the head of research at Sydney-based Ophir Asset Management, says investors have “shot first and asked questions later” by selling off SaaS businesses en masse.“The next stage that we’re getting to is actually understanding which businesses will be negatively impacted by this,” he says.Investment firms talk about “economic moats”, which refer to the structures a company has in place to protect its profits against rivals and market disruptions.McMillan says one of those moats is when a software company uses proprietary data that AI cannot access, as opposed to software that draws from public sources that could be easily replicated.“There’ll be some that actually have some moats that protect them from what these AI tools can do, and in fact, they’ll integrate AI into their businesses making them even better,” he says.Lochlan Halloway, the equity market strategist at Morningstar, says while the “rush for the exit” was a kneejerk response, there’s also a risk of investors underplaying the AI threat.“In this case, there will be winners and losers out of this,” he says.Halloway says companies with unique data, complex systems that are hard to replicate and software that connects multiple parties will be better protected against disruption.“We don’t want to dismiss the risks that AI poses to the software-as-a-service business model, but those are the things we’re looking for in trying to help identify which companies are more likely to stave off this threat,” he says.What happens next?The AI era and second term of Donald Trump have fostered a period of high volatility in global markets, with traders swinging between bouts of optimism and concerns over trade wars and a tech bubble.The narrative-driven movements, where stories determine investment decisions, differs from historical periods when stock movements are more closely aligned with company earnings.The “SaaS-pocalypse”, AI boom,“sell America”and “Taco” trades – the latter referring to the idea that“Trump Always Chickens Out”when facing a tariff-induced market backlash – are all examples of narratives.Investment firms expect markets will eventually work out how to price companies in an AI world, in the same way they did after the tech boom and bust of the late 1990s and early 2000s.Halloway points out the apparent contradiction between fears of a tech bubble and collapsing share prices of some software companies, given the former is based on the idea that AI’s promises will be unfulfilled, and the latter relies on AI being a major disrupting force.“It seems like markets found a reason to be worried about too little AI and too much AI at the same time,” he says.Explore more on these topicsBusinessBreaking News AustraliaAI (artificial intelligence)SoftwareexplainersShareReuse this content"

She said the document “reveals that the environment minister was essentially told by the mining company that this action was necessary to discharge Australia’s obligations under the critical minerals deal with the United States”.“This mining company got away with breaking the law for 15 years under successive Australian governments, illegally clearing in a global biodiversity hotspot and then, when it finally admitted it needed some paperwork to continue its destruction, applied for and was granted an exemption to the law within 19 days. It’s flagrant and it’s staggering,” she said.“In the twisted logic of Australia in the Trump age, the national interest lies not in honouring and protecting the beauty and richness of our natural heritage, but in sacrificing it to foreign mining companies.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWA’s northern jarrah forests are home to endangered species including the state’s unique Carnaby’s and Baudin’s black cockatoos.Alcoa has been mining for decades in the region, with the statement of reasons showing there had been a longrunning dispute between the company and the federal environment department over whether its operations were covered by “continuous use” exemptions from the law for activities predating the commencement of the EPBC Act in 2000.The document shows the department believed Alcoa’s clearing of the forest for bauxite mining had not been covered by these exemptions since 2011 and required an assessment for their impacts on protected species and ecosystems.In November last year, the federal parliament passed amendments to the EPBC Act that imposed tougher limits on the use of the continuous use exemptions. Clearing of vegetation older than 15 years would no longer be exempt from assessment and approval under the laws.After the changes, Alcoa “now accepts that it requires EPBC Act approvals for the Huntly and Willowdale mining operations” and submitted an application for the operations at both mines to be considered through a strategic assessment process, the document states.On 30 January, Alcoa made an application for a national interest exemption, arguing that without one it would not be possible to continue supplying bauxite to its refineries at Pinjarra and Wagerup and “is in the position of being unable to continue its operations”.Alcoa argued its application should be accepted to “avoid unintended consequences” of the EPBC reforms and that it would be unable to maintain supply of bauxite without more clearing “and if ongoing supply cannot be maintained this will impact future production of gallium”.Because the department had told Alcoa its operations were not exempt from the law since 2011, Watt did not accept that the new laws passed last year justified granting the company the national interest exemption.But he did accept that granting the exemption would be in the national interest because it would “enable mining operations to continue so as to preserve the viability” of the gallium project, which had the backing of the US and Japanese governments.He said it would help Alcoa to “sustain its operations and its financial viability” while its expansion proposals were assessed and would keep a workforce of about 6,000 people in employment. Watt also decided it would help Australia diversify critical minerals supply for the net zero transition and defence materials.The department’s spokesperson said it was the department’s view that intensified mining by Alcoa since 2011 required approval.“The limitations of the Act made resolving this long‑running non‑compliance complex, but these $55 million undertakings deliver a strong and lasting resolution,” they said.Australia and the US have signed a critical minerals deal to take on China’s monopoly. Here’s what you need to knowRead more“This case highlights the limitations of the current regulatory framework, where protracted investigations and constrained compliance tools have made enforcement slow and complex.”They said the recent reforms to Australia’s nature laws “respond to these issues by strengthening the regulator’s ability to act early, act decisively, and prevent long-running non‑compliance from occurring again”.An Alcoa spokesperson said the national interest exemption would allow the company to “fully modernise our approvals under the EPBC Act” and sustain thousands of jobs. They said the minister’s statement of reasons made clear that “Alcoa and the government have had a difference in position regarding our historical position in relation to our approvals under the EPBC Act”.“As noted in the statement, our operations pre-date the EPBC Act and Alcoa has continued operations on the basis that certain exemptions under the Act applied,” they said.“Alcoa has voluntarily entered into agreements (enforceable undertakings) with the government to reconcile this difference of position and importantly the associated investment is for conservation programs and research for the health of the Northern Jarrah Forest.”The WA Greens upper house MP Jess Beckerling said it was “staggering to read that Alcoa has been clearing illegally since 2011, that the department has been informing Alcoa of its obligations since that time, but that no penalty has been imposed until now”.“The notion that gallium production for the American military should afford Alcoa a national interest exemption from federal laws is farcical,” she said.Watt declined to answer specific questions, instead directing Guardian Australia to an interview with ABC radio in Perth this week in which he described the penalty as “an unprecedented amount for a company to pay after undertaking unlawful clearing”.He told the ABC: “This discussion has been going on between my department and Alcoa for around 10 years” and “there’s been this difference of opinion legally about whether they were required to get approvals or not, and that’s now been resolved as a result of our new laws.”He said the Albanese government had “beefed up its compliance efforts” and was “prosecuting a lot more people” than previous governments.Explore more on these topicsWestern AustraliaLogging and land-clearingTrees and forestsMiningBusiness (Australia news)Climate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them.”Companies affected by the tariffs should be able to demand refunds from the US administration, though the mechanism for doing this remains unclear.It is understood that tariffs on products such as steel will not be affected and are likely to remain in place. Some experts warned that the White House could switch to broader product-based tariffs affecting computer chips and agriculture, possibly adopting an even more draconian approach with higher tariffs.John Denton, the secretary general of the International Chambers of Commerce, said there was “fresh uncertainty” for companies seeking to trade with the US.“Many businesses will welcome the prospect of refunds following today’s ruling, given the significant strain that the IEEPA [International Emergency Economic Powers Act] tariffs have placed on corporate balance sheets in recent months.“But companies should not expect a simple process: the structure of US import procedures means claims are likely to be administratively complex.”William Bain, the head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that while the supreme court had clarified the use of executive powers to raise tariffs, it did “little to clear the murky waters for business”.“If he wants to, [Trump] could use the 1974 Trade Act to impose even higher tariffs than the additional 10% levies that the UK and Australia have already been affected by in many goods sectors.What will happen to Trump’s tariffs after supreme court verdict?Read more“We have recently agreed a good deal on pharmaceuticals, and we should focus on using the economic prosperity deal to ensure the UK gets the preferential treatment outlined there.”An aerospace industry insider said: “It’s a relief that this has been declared, but I don’t think it’s that helpful for geopolitical tensions.“We still have quite an unpredictable US administration, and I don’t think taking this sort of public chastising is going to go well for some trade relationships.”On the stock markets, the UK’s FTSE 100 index hit a new intraday high after the supreme court ruling was announced on Friday, and closed 0.56% higher.Exporters were among the risers, with the drinks company Diageo – whose Scottish whisky and Mexican tequila brands had been hit by Trump’s tariffs – jumping by 3.9%. The luxury fashion brand Burberry gained 3.3%.Some European carmakers also benefited: Stellantis, whose brands include Citroën, Fiat and Vauxhall, rose by 2%.US government bond prices fell, pushing up borrowing costs as investors anticipated a loss of income from tariffs and the possibility that US companies could be eligible for refunds on import costs.

An appeal against the ruling is expected.While professional mountain guides in many jurisdictions belong to certified bodies and can be held legally responsible for negligence in serious cases, and similarly for adults leading activities with minors, Hofer’s ruling suggests a novel and potentially complex duty of care: between more experienced and more novice participants in mountain sports.Climber convicted of manslaughter after leaving girlfriend on Austria’s highest peak to seek helpRead moreAt the heart of the case was Thomas P’s decision to climb a high-altitude, mixed snow and rock route on the 3,798-metre (12,461ft) Großglockner in poor weather with insufficient safety equipment, as well as errors of decision making, including failing to turn back late at night below the summit when it would have been safe to do so.The prosecution’s argument, accepted in part by the judge, was that Thomas P had made nine separate mistakes, the most serious being to take Kerstin G on the climb despite her inexperience and the fact she had never undertaken an alpine tour of this length, difficulty and altitude, and despite the challenging winter conditions.The court heard Thomas P had left his girlfriend alone and exposed in the open and pushed on alone, apparently believing he could secure assistance from a hut on the other side of the mountain. He had declined the offer of assistance from a rescue helicopter that had been sent to see if they required help.“You haven’t been convicted because you’re [the] better [climber],” Hofer told Thomas P, rather it was because he had met the threshold for what the court believed was “guiding out of courtesy” and the duties that involved. “You did not fulfil the leadership responsibilities you assumed in the manner required of you by law.”Whether Hofer’s ruling has a wider impact will depend on how it is seen in different jurisdictions with varying attitudes to regulation in the mountains, including how police investigate fatal accidents.In an interview withAustria’s Kurier newspaper, Andreas Ermacora, a former head of the Austrian Alpine Club, which is a major provider of mountaineering insurance throughout Europe, was sceptical the ruling would have a major impact. “I don’t think so, because every story is so unique. [But] it is perhaps groundbreaking that this is the first time in Austria that someone has been convicted as an unqualified guide,” said Ermacora, a lawyer who has represented professional guides involved in accidents.“The crucial point was that it was clear the woman would never have gone up there alone. For a mixed ice and rock climb like that in winter, you really need to know what you’re getting into. And I don’t think she knew that at all. He, on the other hand, had been up there several times before. She transferred her responsibility to him.”Where that becomes complicated, however, is that the main way in which many aspirant mountaineers gain skills is through the mentorship of more experienced partners.“One of the things that struck me was the big disparity in experience between the two,” said John Cousins, a British mountain guide and chief executive of Mountain Training, which runs training schemes for mountain activities.“We’re all on a continuum of experience. If someone is an absolute novice they can only be looked after. But once you get a way along that continuum, in my mind as a mountain guide, it very definitely becomes a negotiation. You want to be constantly checking in with the other person to see how it is going for them.”Checks would include whether the less experienced person was still within their comfort zone, and whether the more experienced climber might feel out of their depth, even if they say they are not. The latter issue was prominent in reporting around Kerstin G’s death last year and in the case itself.“I can’t think of a precedent,” said Cousins. “But I also don’t believe anyone goes into the mountains with a court in mind in the event of an accident.”Where it may have an impact, some observers suggest, is around whether some amateur climbers could feel nervous about being seen as responsible for a less experienced companion, a point made by Severin Glaser, a professor of criminal law at the University of Innsbruck.“This could shift the responsibility for yourself if you’re doing something dangerous,” hetold the New York Times. “The costs of mountaineering, the costs of expressing your freedom might rise, and maybe some people are not willing any more to pay this higher price.”A final issue apparent to climbers is the sometimes complicating issues of climbing partnerships where those involved are in a relationship, a situation where – regardless of gender – the dynamics of the need for approval or vulnerability can creep in.It is an issue coincidentally discussed in the current issue ofClimbing magazineby the climber Alice Hafer, on why she had decided not to climb with her “significant other” after a frustrating climb. “I looked back on … situations like this one and saw that I often deflected decisions to my partner and avoided empowering myself towards my own goals. Climbing, a place where I usually excelled, became tainted by the context of a relationship.”Explore more on these topicsMountaineeringAustriaEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

At 172.5 metres, the Sagrada Familia, to which the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí devoted the later part of his life, is Barcelona’s tallest building and theworld’s tallest church.As the Catalan and Vatican flags were raised, Jordi Faulí, the chief architect for the project, said: “It’s been a joyful day, wonderful for all the people who have made it possible.”A ceremony to mark the completion of the tower – the tallest of 18 conceived by Gaudí – is due to take place on the centenary of Gaudí’s death in 1926 on 10 June, 16 years after the church was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI.View image in fullscreenWorkers assemble the upper part of the tower of Jesus Christ’s cross on to the Sagrada Familia.Photograph: Enric Fontcuberta/EPAThe end to the building at the church is expected in about a decade with the construction of a striking south-facing facade.It was nevertheless a day full of emotion for a city that has lived with Gaudí’s unfinished work for generations and, although there remains much work to do, the temple now defines the Barcelona skyline as much as the Eiffel tower in Paris or the Empire State building in New York.For decades it was a building site open to the skies, where generations of stone masons and carpenters worked around the tourists who have ultimately funded the construction. It’s only in the past 15 years, since work began on the breathtakingly beautiful interior, that it has felt more like a church than a building site.Here Gaudí’s geometrical designs have created an oasis of light, with delicate, tree-like columns tapering off to the roof, the white stone of the interior picked out in colours from the stained glass windows.The basilica is loved and loathed equally by those who live in Barcelona. George Orwell described it as “one of the most hideous buildings in the world” and regretted the anarchists did not blow it up when they had the chance.View image in fullscreenThe Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona, Spain, is the city’s tallest building and the world’s tallest church.Photograph: Enric Fontcuberta/EPAThe anarchists did, however, destroy Gaudí’s drawings and the plaster model, which years later was painstakingly reconstructed. In the late 1970s, Mark Burry, a New Zealand architect, adapted rocket design software to realise Gaudí’s design.Europe’s housing costs akin to ‘new pandemic’, warns Barcelona mayorRead moreTo those who claim the basilica is nothing like what was originally envisaged, Burry’s retort was that Gaudí’s geometry is so precise that should there be any deviation from his plan, the building would collapse.It is, however, now the work of many hands. There are elements that jar, in particular the Passion façade, popularly known as Darth Vader façade, the work of the sculptor Josep Maria Subirachs, and yet overall it is unmistakably Gaudí’s work.Aside from finishing the details of the main tower, three artists – Miquel Barceló , Cristina Iglesias and Javier Marín – have been commissioned to present designs for the Glory façade, which is expected to take a further 10 years to complete.The Sagrada Familia is the city’s top tourist attraction, with about 5 million visitors a year and an annual income of roughly €150m (£131m), about half of which has so far been spent on construction.Explore more on these topicsBarcelonaAntoni GaudíSpainEuropeArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

Rahim Yagublu, 27, an Uber driver whose father is a politician imprisoned in Azerbaijan,told the Washington Posthe was struck in the jaw and kicked in the stomach. Adil Amrakhly, 35, said he injured his leg fleeing from the guards and that at least four others were hurt.“We intended to hold a peaceful protest to demand freedom for political prisoners in Azerbaijan,” Amrakhly, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, told the outlet.Asked for comment, DC Metropolitan police and the US Secret Service referred questions to the state department, which referred questions back to the US Secret Service and the DC Metropolitan police.Earlier on Thursday, the US Secret Service told the Washington Post the hotel was “part of the event security perimeter” because that was where the Azerbaijani delegation was staying, with its role limited to establishing security infrastructure for visiting heads of state.The incident drew immediate comparisons to a 2017 confrontation in Washington in which bodyguards for Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,attacked protestersoutside the Turkish ambassador’s residence, injuring 11 people including a police officer. A similar altercation involving Erdoğan’s security detail had occurred the previous year outside the Brookings Institution.Aliyev was in Washington for the first meeting of Trump’s Board of Peace, a new body the US president announced at Davos last month. Trump has described it as having “unlimited potential” to become “the most consequential international body in history”.The gathering, focused primarily on the fragile Gaza ceasefire and colonial-envisioned reconstruction efforts for the devastated coastal strip, drew more than two dozen world leaders – though some US allies including France, Germany and Italy chose only to attend as observers.Azerbaijan was among the countries Trump named as having contributed to a $7bn relief package tied to the initiative.

His lawyer described the death of the 33-year-old woman as a “tragic accident”.The court heard that after a gruelling day of climbing in freezing conditions in January 2025 , during which the pair had fallen well behind schedule, Kerstin G was exhausted, suffering from hypothermia and lacked the strength to continue. They were about 50 metres below the summit of the Großglockner mountain when night fell.Thomas P said the situation had been “very stressful”.He said he had left Kerstin G on a ridge exposed to strong winds when he went to seek help. He told the court he could not explain why he had failed to wrap her in the emergency blanket she was carrying or place her in a bivouac bag. When her body was later recovered, the items were found in her rucksack.View image in fullscreenWebcam footage shows Thomas P with a torch descending from the peak in stormy conditions in the early hours of 19 January 2025.Photograph: www.foto-webcam.euGiving evidence, a police officer on duty that night, who had called Thomas P on his mobile at 12.35am, after a helicopter had set off to monitor the couple two hours earlier amid concerns for their safety, said the defendant had told him: “We don’t need anything … everything’s fine”.The officer had advised Thomas P that the couple should keep moving. The discussion had ended abruptly. The officer attempted to call him twice more, and to find out if the pair needed help, and sent text messages, but had received no reply. Later, conditions became too dangerous for the helicopter to attempt a rescue.The prosecutor, Johann Frischmann, accused the defendant of failing to live up to his “de facto” role as leader of the tour, due to him being the more experienced climber.One expert witness referred to the defendant’s social media posts, including details of his previous feats, as one of the pieces of evidence that Thomas P was a better mountaineer than his girlfriend.The mistakes made, the court heard, included failing to recognise that Kerstin G was wearing the wrong type of footwear for the terrain, neglecting to adequately take into account the weather conditions for that time of year, and failing to turn back earlier given the conditions.Prosecutors based key parts of their accusations on an expert report, which analysed the data from both climbers’ smart watches, which documented a clear decline in their physical performances. This was evident even before the police helicopter had flown over at about 10pm. The defendant had failed to call emergency services in time and reacted too late to rescue attempts, they said.The court was filled with journalists, local people and representatives of mountain emergency response organisations from Austria and elsewhere inEurope.A former girlfriend, called as a witness, testified that she had also climbed the Großglockner with Thomas P in 2023. She said he had abandoned her on the route at night after her head torch ran out of battery, leaving her distressed. “So that was the last mountain expedition we undertook together,” she said.The court was shown webcam footage of Thomas P and Kerstin G ascending the mountain, as well as Thomas P descending alone. The beam of his torch lit up bright against the snowy mountainside.Judge Hofer, presiding, an experienced mountaineer who is active as a mountain and air rescuer (although he emphasised that had “no bearing on the case”) ruled that the defendant had been negligent in failing to recognise that Kerstin G would be unable to complete the climb well before the couple ran into difficulty.“I do not see you as a murderer. I do not see you as cold-hearted,” he told Thomas P while delivering the verdict, accepting that the defendant had gone to fetch help.However, he said that because Thomas P was “galaxies” more proficient as a mountaineer than his girlfriend, and because she had placed herself in his care, he bore responsibility for her death.The told Thomas P that with his alpine experience he should have recognised that his girlfriend’s abilities “were far from sufficient”.Hofer questioned Thomas P in detail as to why he had decided to leave Kerstin G just below the summit. Thomas P said he had himself been suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion at that time, suggesting an impairment in his ability to judge the situation.He told the court he had secured his girlfriend to a rock with a sling. He had intended to lie down next to her, but said she had screamed at him: “Go now, go!” He said in doing so she had “saved my life”.Hofer said he found this version of events “hard to believe”. The court was then shown a photograph of Kerstin G as she was found by rescue workers the following day, hanging from a rock face, her feet dangling, her crampons loosened. The court heard she had probably fallen.A forensic doctor, who had examined Kerstin G after her death, told the court she had died of hypothermia, listing the typical physical signs associated with that. The doctor added that she had found evidence that the woman was suffering from viral pneumonia and had taken ibuprofen. She said it was hard to assess whether this may have affected her performance and led to a sudden and unexpected decline in her physical state.Kurt Jelinek, the lawyer acting for Thomas P, rejected the premise that his client had been the more experienced climber, and therefore the “de facto” leader, saying he had no mountaineering qualification but rather had garnered his knowledge from videos and others sources and that the couple had acted “on a level playing field”.Kerstin G’s mother, Gertrud G, agreed, saying her daughter “would not have gone along blindly” with her boyfriend. Kerstin G was repeatedly described to the court as having been in excellent physical health and strong-willed. The defendant referred to other “challenging climbs” they had undertaken together, including the south face of the Dachstein (the Steinerweg) and the Watzmann east face, known as the Salzburger Weg.Jelinek also took issue with what he referred to as Thomas P’s “trial by media” before the court case, saying he had “already suffered enough” having lost his “beloved girlfriend”.Hofer said he had taken all this into account in his verdict, and emphasised he had not been influenced by the media coverage.The defendant asked the court for time to consider his options. It is believed he may appeal. As a result, the verdict is not yet legally binding.Explore more on these topicsAustriaMountaineeringEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Two security sources told Reuters that senior Hezbollah leader Hussein Yaghi was killed in the attacks.Yaghi is the son of former Hezbollah MP Mohamed Yaghi, and his funeral is set to take place on Saturday, according to Hezbollah media.Local television footage from the scene of one of the strikes showed the targeted site appeared to be an apartment building. Emergency crews were seen firefighting and searching for survivors.Earlier on Friday another Israeli strike hit a Palestinian refugee camp in the port city of Sidon, killing two people.The Israeli military said it struck a “Hamas command centre” in the Ain el-Hilweh camp. Hamas acknowledged that two of its members had been killed in the strike but said the claim it was a command centre was a “flimsy pretext”.It said the targeted building belonged to a joint security force made up of various Palestinian factions tasked with maintaining security in the camp.After 7 October 2023, Hezbollah began firing rockets from Lebanon into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024, before being reined in by a US-brokered ceasefire two months later.Since then, Israel has accused Hezbollah of trying to rebuild and has carried out near-daily strikes in Lebanon that it says target militants and facilities. Hezbollah has claimed one strike against Israel since the ceasefire.The death toll from Friday’s strikes was unusually high and comes at a moment of heightened tensions in the region with the US threatening to strike Iran – a backer of both Hezbollah and Hamas – if negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme fail to produce a deal.During last year’s Israel-Iran war, Hezbollah remained on the sidelines but many in Lebanon fear that the country will be pulled in should another war break out.Explore more on these topicsLebanonMiddle East and north AfricaHezbollahIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration appointee and former Arkansas governor discussed with Carlson interpretations of Old Testament scripture within the US Christian nationalist movement.Carlson – who recently made disputed claims that he was detained at Tel Aviv airport inIsrael– asked Huckabee about a biblical verse in which God promises Abraham that his descendants will receive land “from the wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates – the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites”.Carlson pointed out that this area in modern geography would include “like, basically the entire Middle East”.“The Levant …Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon – it’d also be big parts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq,” Carlson said.Huckabee said: “I’m not sure it would go that far, but it would be a big piece of land.”He continued: “Israel is a land that God gave, through Abraham, to a people that he chose. It was a people, a place and a purpose.”Pressed by Carlson on whether Israel has the right to that land, Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.”The interview with Huckabee was conducted in Israel on a trip that generated headlines when Carlsonclaimed he hadexperienced “bizarre” treatment at Ben Gurion airport. But Israeli and US officials said he underwent routine security questioning.Carlson has increasingly questioned US support of Israel, moving him from the center to the fringe of the Make America Great Again movement.Huckabee represents a more traditional pro-Israel conservative position.After Carlson’s aired his claims of unusual treatment in Tel Aviv, former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett said the former Fox News host was being “chickenshit”.“Next time he talks about Israel as if he’s some expert, just remember this guy is a phony!” Bennett said in anX post on Wednesday.Huckabee, inhis own post onX, said: “EVERYONE who comes in/out of Israel (every country for that matter) has passports checked & routinely asked security questions.”The Israel Airports Authority said in astatement posted to Xon Wednesday: “Tucker Carlson and his entourage were not detained, delayed, or interrogated.”Explore more on these topicsMike HuckabeeUS politicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaTucker CarlsonUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s military acknowledged using what it called “riot dispersal methods” after receiving reports of Palestinians throwing rocks but denied that its forces fired during the clashes.“When the settlers saw the army, they were encouraged and started shooting live bullets,” Abu Ali said. He added that they clubbed those injured with sticks after they had fallen to the ground.The Palestinian health ministry confirmed Abu Siyam’s death from critical wounds sustained on Wednesday afternoon near the village east of Ramallah.Abu Siyam’s killing is the latest in a surge inviolencein the occupied West Bank. Israeli forces and settlers killed 240 Palestinians last year, according to the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. Palestinians killed 17 Israelis over the same period, six of whom were soldiers.View image in fullscreenPosters with the name and picture of Nasrallah Abu Siyam.Photograph: Nasser Nasser/APThe Palestinian Authority’s Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission said Abu Siyam was the first Palestinian killed by settlers in 2026.Mukhmas and its surrounding area – most of which lies under Israeli civil and military administration – have become a hotspot for settler attacks, including arson and assaults, as well as the construction of outposts that Israeli law considers illegal.The Israeli military said late Wednesday that unnamed suspects shot at Palestinians, who were later evacuated for medical treatment. It did not say whether any were arrested.Abu Siyam’s mother told the Associated Press that he was an American citizen, making him the second Palestinian American person to be killed by Israeli settlers in less than a year.A US embassy spokesperson said they “condemn this violence”.Palestinians and rights groups say authorities routinely fail to prosecute settlers or hold them accountable for violence.The UN human rights office on Thursday accused Israel of war crimes and said practices that displace Palestinians and alter the demographic composition of the occupied West Bank “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing”.The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, citing findings collected November 2024 to October 2025, said Israel was engaged in “concerted and accelerating effort to consolidate annexation” while maintaining a system “to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians”.Residents of Palestinian villages and herding communitieshave been increasingly displacedas Israeli settlements and outposts expand. Since the start of the Israel–Hamas war, the Israeli rights group B’Tselem says about 45 Palestinian communities have been emptied out completely amid Israeli demolition orders and settler attacks.Additionally, the office said Israeli militaryoperations in the northern West Bank“employed means and methods designed for warfare” including lethal airstrikes and forcibly transferring civilians from their homes. It also said Israel“forbade” residents from returningto their homes in northern West Bank refugee camps. The operation, which Israel said was aimed against militants, displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians.View image in fullscreenMohammad Abu Siyam, the father of the victim.Photograph: Nasser Nasser/APThe report also accused Palestinian security forces of using unnecessary lethal force in the same areas, killing at least eight people, and noted that the Palestinian Authority had engaged in “intimidation, detention and ill-treatment of journalists, human rights defenders and other individuals deemed critical of its rule”.Neither Israel’s foreign ministry nor the Palestinian Authority responded to requests for comment. Israel has repeatedly accused the UN rights office of anti-Israel bias.Last year, the UN human rights monitor warned of what it called “an unfolding genocide in Gaza” with “conditions of life increasingly incompatible with [Palestinians’] continued existence”. Their report on Thursday also warned of demographic shifts in Gaza raising concerns of ethnic cleansing.Meanwhile, the Committee to Protect Journalists said that dozens of Palestinian journalists who were detained in Israel during the war in Gaza experienced conditions including physical assaults, forced stress positions, sensory deprivation, sexual violence and medical neglect.The CPJ documented the detention of at least 94 Palestinian journalists and one media worker during the war, from the West Bank, Gaza and Israel Thirty are still in custody, the CPJ said.Half of the journalists, the report found, were never charged with a crime and were held under Israel’s administrative detention system, which allows for suspects deemed security risks to be held for six months and can be renewed indefinitely.Israel’s prison services did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the report, but rejecteda similar report in January about conditions for Palestinian prisonersas “false allegations”, contending it operates lawfully, is subject to oversight and reviews complaints.The vast destruction across Gaza will take at least seven years just to remove the rubble, according to the UN Development Program.Alexander De Croo, the former Belgian prime minister who just returned from Gaza, said that the UNDP had removed just 0.5% of the rubble and people in Gaza are experiencing “the worst living conditions that I have ever seen”.De Croo said 90% of Gaza’s 2.2 million people live in “very, very rudimentary tents” in the middle of the rubble, which poses health dangers and a danger from exploding weapons.He said UNDP had been able to build 500 improved housing units, and had 4,000 more that are ready, but estimates the true need was 200,000 to 300,000 units. The units are meant to be used temporarily while reconstruction takes place. He called on Israel to expand access for goods and items needed for reconstruction and the private sector to begin development.Explore more on these topicsPalestineWest BankMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Those in theWest Bank, in Israeli prisons and the diaspora are also expected to cast ballots for delegates to the movement’s 50-member general Shura council, which ultimately chooses its politburo and a new interim leader. The process could last weeks.The new leader will have to decide how far to cooperate with a US-sponsored peace plan, whether to disarm and how much of its arsenal to give up, what to demand in return fromIsraelin terms of withdrawal from the territory and whether to press for inclusion in a new Gaza government or fade into the political background.Bitter dispute between Trump and EU over Gaza’s future breaks out into the openRead moreMuch of the Hamas leadership has been killed by Israel in a military campaign that also razed much ofGazaand killed more than 75,000 Palestinians over 28 months.Among those killed wasYahya Sinwar, the Gaza Hamas leader, andMohammed Deif, its military chiefwho led the shock attack on southern Israeli communities in October 2023,killing about 1,200 people, including more than 800 civilians.Israel also assassinated the movement’s deputy leader, Saleh al-Arouri, in Beirut in January 2024 and the overall political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024. Israel tried to kill much of the surviving leadership in a single airstrike on Doha in September last year when they had gathered to discuss a US peace proposal, but the key leaders survived.View image in fullscreenKhaled Meshaal is also believed to be one of the frontrunners in the leadership contest.Photograph: Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/ReutersThe two frontrunners in the leadership contest are thought to be Khalil al-Hayya and Khaled Meshaal, who both survived the Doha airstrike. Between them, they present a fairly clearcut choice on Hamas’s future direction.Al-Hayya leads the Gaza wing, though he lives in the Gulf, and is considered Sinwar’s heir – hardline, though not drawn from the military wing, and closest to Iran among Hamas’s foreign sponsors.Meshaal is a Hamas veteran, one of its founders, who served as overall leader for more than two decades. He now leads the movement abroad and is thought to live in Doha. He is viewed as being at the more flexible end of the Hamas spectrum, with stronger ties to Qatar and Turkey.“Meshaal wants to consider a political settlement with Israel – not a recognition but maybe a long-term settlement – and even reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority, and once again be part of the formal political system in the Palestinian arena,” said Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli military intelligence colonel now at Tel Aviv University.“These two represent two different camps, and different agendas about the future and the goals of Hamas.”It is unclear whether there are other significant candidates. The vote is taking place under conditions of maximum secrecy due to the danger of assassination faced by anyone identified as playing a leading role in Hamas.What is Trump’s Board of Peace and who is involved?Read more“Whoever is in the leadership – whether it’s the Shura council or the actual top leadership – the question is: who wants to be in that position, knowing that they will most likely be on an Israeli hitlist?” said Khaled Elgindy, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington.“It’s clear that this is going to be a new chapter for Hamas, and it may even be existential. Will Hamas survive? What will it look like? Obviously, they’re going to do anything and everything to avoid the optics of a surrender,” Elgindy said.“Meshaal will have better ties with the Arab states, certainly with the Qataris and the Turks, all of whom are going to be very influential,” he added. “I can see him making the case that Hamas’s reliance on Iran is going to have to diminish as Tehran is preoccupied with its own survival.“There’s so much anger and frustration with Hamas on the street, but has that translated to the membership, the people who are actually voting? I don’t have a sense of that.”UnderDonald Trump’s plan, a group of non-affiliated Palestinian technocrats, called the National Committee for Administration of Gaza (NCAG), are supposed to take over the immediate task of running Gaza, and overseeing Hamas’s disarmament.While Hamas leaders are reported to have indicated informally they would consider handing over heavier weapons, such as rockets and mortars, to a Palestinian body, its fighters are likely to refuse to surrender personal firearms, which they say are necessary for self-defence against Gaza’s multiple armed clans and criminal gangs, some of them backed by Israel.Reuters news agency has reported that Hamas has been busy rebuilding its organisation in recent weeks, collecting taxes on goods allowed into the territory under a ceasefire deal and replacing senior officials in Gaza ministries and district governors.Explore more on these topicsHamasPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaGazaWest BankDonald TrumpIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

NHS England subsequently announced children with gender dysphoria would no longer receive puberty blockers as routine practice, with their use confined to research settings.Sir Jonathan Montgomery, professor of health care law at University College London, said: “The letter to the investigators is clear that the discussions are intended to strengthen the protocol, not to stop the trial.“The letter also states that these are scientific issues and not a result of legal action.“The focus here is on safety, as it should be. This pause shows the regulatory process working properly and in the interests of participants.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchTransgenderHealthYoung peopleChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Police are understood to be seeking unredacted documents relating to Andrew from the US Department of Justice.In another significant political development, the government said on Friday it would consider introducing legislation to remove Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession once the police investigations have concluded.Mountbatten-Windsor spent 11 hours in a Norfolk police station on Thursday, during which his mugshot was taken. Thames Valley police searched his former home at Royal Lodge, Windsor, for a second day on Friday.The Metropolitan police, which provides highly trained protection officers to VIPs, said on Friday it was identifying and contacting current and former serving officers who may have worked closely with Mountbatten-Windsor in a personal protection capacity.“They have been asked to consider carefully whether anything they saw or heard during that period of service may be relevant to our ongoing reviews and to share any information that could assist us,” a statement said.The Met also said it would examine claims that airports in the London area were used by flights linked to Epstein to traffic women.Five other British forces are examining whether such claims about airports in their areas merit full criminal investigation. Airports the Met will look at include Heathrow, Biggin Hill, and RAF Northolt, which hosts private flights.The Met said: “Following the further release of millions of court documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein by the United States Department of Justice, we are aware of the suggestion that London airports may have been used to facilitate human trafficking and sexual exploitation.“We are assessing this information and are actively seeking further detail from law enforcement partners, including those in the United States.”As well as the Met, up to seven other forces so far are seeking the unredacted documents from the Epstein files held by US authorities as they intensify their pursuit of the disgraced financier’s links to British figures.The release of millions of documents held by US authorities about Epstein earlier this month led to the former prince and the former Labour cabinet minister Peter Mandelson being placed under criminal investigation for misconduct in public office after allegedly passing sensitive material to Epstein.Mountbatten-Windsor could not be contacted for comment but has in the past denied wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Mandelson has denied any criminal wrongdoing and apologised for his association with Epstein.A national coordinating committee has been set up for the various police investigations, led by a serving Met assistant commissioner, Louisa Rolfe, now on secondment to the NPCC.The Guardian understands a senior detective will be recruited by the committee to help coordinate issues such as getting the original documents from the US.The formal requests will be made by National Crime Agency, with some forces saying they will use artificial intelligence to help plough through the mountain of material held in the Epstein files.A senior source said: “There are millions of documents which we want unredacted. We need to turn that into evidence. It is a massive job. You are never going to get a conviction based on a few redacted emails.”The five forces considering claims about the Epstein flights into airports in their area are Norfolk, Essex, Bedfordshire, West Midlands, and Police Scotland. Surrey and Thames Valley police forces are considering claims of sexual wrongdoing by the former prince.The misconduct in public office allegations stem from his time as a UK trade envoy, a role he gained in 2001 before stepping down a decade later over his friendship with Epstein.It is understood the Cabinet Office is ready to provide any government documents connected to Mountbatten-Windsor’s time as a trade envoy if asked by police, although no request is believed to have been made yet.While his role was administered by UK Trade and Investment, a now defunct body co-run by the Foreign Office and the business department, the Cabinet Office is the lead department for such inquiries. It is sorting through documents due to be released about the appointment of Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the US.Mounbatten-Windsor was released on Thursday evening under investigation, which means there are no restrictions on his freedom.Detectives are yet to take formal early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, a spokesperson for the service said. That suggests any decision about whether the king’s brother will face charges is some time away.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

That needs to be banished from the debate.”There are lingering concerns among Labour MPs on several issues, including whether parents will still have the right to make a legal appeal if they feel their child is not being properly supported.One said: “There is understandable anxiety amongst parents, but if the reforms as a whole look to promise a better system with enough time for a smooth transition, then I think MPs will recognise that.“Where I think the challenges may come is on the legal redress issue – if parents have enough confidence that they can hold schools and local authorities to account on the support they are supposed to be giving.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsLabourDavid BlunkettRuth KellyAlan JohnsonSchoolsEducation policynewsShareReuse this content"

Our son Ethan tragically and unexpectedly passed away at just 17 years old, alongside his beautiful girlfriend.“No parent should ever have to write these words. No family should ever have to face this pain.“Ethan had his whole life ahead of him. He’ll never get to pass his driving test. He’ll never celebrate his 18th birthday. He’ll never reach the milestones we all assumed were waiting for him.“He was just beginning his journey into adulthood, full of plans, laughter, and a future that was taken far too soon.”Ethan was described as kind-hearted, warm, funny and protective.“He carried himself with a quiet strength and loyalty that made us so proud to call him our son. He was loved beyond measure.”Officers received call of concern for safety at the park on Wednesday. Some holidaymakers are understood to have been asked to leave the park, where families had gathered for the half-term school break.A cordon remains in place at the park and police said they were continuing to work in coordination with the health and safety executive alongside Humberside Fire & Rescue and East Riding of Yorkshire council.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood there are firm plans for this to happen after an investigation is complete.The Liberal Democrats had called on Friday for the issue to be considered. “The most important thing right now is that the police be allowed to get on with their job, acting without fear or favour,” Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said in a statement.“But clearly this is an issue that parliament is going to have to consider when the time is right – naturally the monarchy will want to make sure he can never become king.”Andrew Bowie, the Conservatives’ shadow Scotland secretary, made a similar argument, telling GB News it would be “the decent thing” for Andrew to be removed.Bowie said: “Of course, if he’s found guilty of this, I think parliament would be well within its rights to act to remove him from the line of succession.“But, let’s remember, he’s not been found guilty of anything just yet – he has yet to be charged with anything. So we have to let the police investigation run its course, and I think we should all act accordingly subsequent to that.”Among Labour MPs, Rachael Maskell, who represents York Central, said it seemed likely that parliament would need to act.“From the evidence already held in the public domain, it is clear that his position as a counsellor of state and with succession rights are removed, as well as all titles,” she said. “I trust that legislation can be passed to achieve this. I am glad that the king seeks to be as helpful as he can, and providing support to parliament to act would assist in this.”The SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, has also called for action to be taken to remove any risk of Andrew becoming head of state, while the Labour MP Richard Burgon called for an independent inquiry into what the wider royal family knew about Andrew’s links to Epstein, adding: “It’s time for a serious national debate about abolishing the monarchy.”Zack Polanski, leader of the Green party in England and Wales, which supports the abolition of the monarchy, said he believed Andrew’s case could hasten this moment.“When the public are ready to have that national conversation about the monarchy, I think issues like this certainly don’t help the monarchy’s case,” he told reporters while campaigning for next week’s Gorton and Denton byelection.Explore more on these topicsUK newsMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

She was 81.Murdoch-Mann’s death was reported Friday bythe New York Post, one of her ex-husband’s media properties.During 31 years of marriage, Murdoch-Mann was reported to have played an active role in the building of Murdoch’s media empire, News Corp. She and Murdoch also had three children: Elisabeth, James and Lachlan, who is now the chair of News Corp.View image in fullscreenAnna Murdoch-Mann with Lachlan Murdoch, James Murdoch and Rupert Murdoch (L-R) in New York City in 1987.Photograph: Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty ImagesThe pair split in 1998 after Rupert Murdoch’s affair with Wendi Deng, who became his third wife. Murdoch-Mann said she was forced off the News Corp board in the wake of that split.Their divorce was finalized in 1999, with Murdoch-Mann receiving a reported $1.7bn from the settlement. Just a few weeks after the finalization of the divorce, Rupert Murdoch married Deng on his yacht in the New York harbor.Murdoch family reaches deal to resolve succession fight over media empireRead moreIn October 1999, Murdoch-Mann married the Wall Street financier William Mann. They were married until Mann’s death in 2017. She then married Ashton dePeyster in 2019.Murdoch-Mann granted atell-all interviewwith Australian Women’s Weekly in 2001, opening up about the difficulties in her marriage to Rupert Murdoch. She said he was “extremely hard, ruthless, and determined that he was going to go through with this no matter what I wanted or what I was trying to do to save the marriage.“He had no interest in that whatsoever.”View image in fullscreenAnna Murdoch-Mann, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, photographed in 1988.Photograph: Paul Harris/Getty ImagesIn the same interview, Murdoch-Mann also expressed fear at the idea of her children competing to be their father’s successor, and she included her stepdaughter, Prudence, the daughter from Murdoch’s first marriage to model Patricia Booker, as one of those children.“I think they’re all so good that they could do whatever they wanted,” she said. “But I think there’s going to be a lot of heartbreak and hardship with this [fight for succession].”That dynamic inspired the hit HBO show Succession.In September 2025, it wasannouncedthat Lachlan Murdoch – Rupert Murdoch and Anna Murdoch-Mann’s eldest son – would secure control of the sprawling media empire that his father created, which includes Fox News, theWall Street Journaland the Times in the UK. His three oldest siblings were left to receive an estimated $1.1bn each for their shares in the business.Murdoch-Mann was born Anna Torv in Glasgow, Scotland. Her father, Jakob Torv, an Estonian merchant seaman, and her Scottish mother, migrated to Australia in 1944 when she was nine years old, settling in Sydney’s western suburbs. Biographers of Murdoch suggest the young Anna had a difficult childhood after her parents split, raising her younger siblings.But she rose to become a reporter at the Sydney Daily Mirror and later the Sydney Daily Telegraph. It was while working as an 18-year-old cadet journalist at the Mirror that she first met and interviewed her future husband, who had just bought the paper.She also authored three novels – In Her Own Image (1985), Family Business (1988), and Coming to Terms (1992)- and became involved in philanthropic causes benefiting children.View image in fullscreenAnna Murdoch-Mann with her son, James, in 1985.Photograph: Michael Brennan/Getty ImagesA devout Catholic, she often cited her faith as her anchor during the public unravelling of her marriage and her subsequent exit from the News Corp board.She held leadership roles at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Haiti’s Hospital Albert Schweitzer and in 1998 was made a Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II.Murdoch-Mann was also the aunt of multi-ward winning Australian actress Anna Torv. In a piece of life imitating art, the younger Anna Torv starred in the hit Australian series The Newsreader, portraying a high-profile news anchor navigating the cutthroat corporate media world of the 1980s - an era during which her aunt was the most powerful woman inside the real-life Murdoch empire.Explore more on these topicsUS newsRupert MurdochFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

The district attorney’s office would ultimately be the determining authority for any criminal charges to be filed.”The avalanche, the deadliest in California’s modern history, killed at least eight people and a ninth skier is still missing but is presumed dead.Blackbird Mountain Guides, which employed the ski guides that led the trek, said in a statement released on Wednesday that three of their workers died after the avalanche, and one of them survived.“This was an enormous tragedy, and the saddest event our team has ever experienced,” said Zeb Blais, founder of Blackbird Mountain Guides, in the statement. “We are doing what we can to support the families who lost so much, and the members of our team who lost treasured friends and colleagues.“There is still a lot that we’re learning about what happened. It’s too soon to draw conclusions, but investigations are underway,” Blais added in Wednesday’s statement.As the 15 skiers were coming back from their trip, which started on Sunday, avalanche warnings were already in place. Blackbird Mountain Guides seemed to be aware of the hazardous weather conditions, according toa social media videoposted on Sunday.During a press conference on Wednesday, Shannan Moon, Nevada county’s sheriff, said that the investigation includes learning why the ski trip was not cancelled.“Those are the decisions that the guide company clearly had made,” Moon said. “We’re still in conversation with them on the decision factors that they made.”Six of the 15 skiers survived and were rescued, including the fourth guide. Amid hazardous weather conditions, the avalanche victims have not yet been extracted from the mountain.“Adverse weather, coupled with ongoing avalanche danger, has hindered the recovery process,” astatementreleased on Friday by the Nevada county sheriff’s office said. A statement released on Thursday said “until the recovery mission is completed, the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office is unable to confirm the identifications, ages, affiliations, or cities of origin for the victims.”Family members have confirmed the identities ofsix of the eight peoplewho died in Tuesday’s avalanche. The identified victims – Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt – were part of a group which frequently went on ski trips together.The sheriff’s office also announced that avalanche mitigation was under way in California’s Sierra Nevada on Friday, consisting of controlled “explosive deployment to intentionally release unstable snowpack”. These measures aim to reduce avalanche risk and improve first responder safety as they recover victims.Explore more on these topicsUS newsCaliforniaAvalanchesUS weatherWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the first time the court has overruled one of Trump’s second-term policies.Trump blasted the justices who ruled against him at a press conference, calling them “a disgrace to the nation” and said the ruling had emboldened him to enact “very powerful alternatives” to the tariffs declared illegal.1:28Trump announces 10% global tariff after supreme court ruling – videoThe president promptly announced he would enact a new 10% global baseline tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to impose tariffs for 150 days. Trump said that the administration would initiate investigations into unfair trading practices that could lead to permanent tariffs.“While I am sure that they did not mean to do so, the supreme court’s decision today made a president’s ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs, more powerful and more crystal clear, rather than less,” he said. “There will no longer be any doubt that the income coming in and the protection of our companies and country will actually increase because of this decision.”The ruling was a significant blow for one of Trump’s boldest assertions of executive power since his return to the White House. Trump has used tariffs to aggressively reshape US trade policy, upending decades of agreements and collecting tens of billions of dollars from companies importing foreign goods.Trump tariff court ruling does little to end uncertainty for global businessRead moreTariffs typically need to be approved by Congress, which has sole authority under the constitution to levy taxes. Trump argued that he had the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency.But in its majority opinion, the court said the ability to enact tariffs during peacetime does in fact belong to Congress.The court cited the creators of the constitution, who “recognized the unique importance of this taxing power – a power which ‘very clear[ly]’ includes the power to impose tariffs”.“And they gave Congress ‘alone … access to the pockets of the people,” the opinion reads. “The Framers did not vest any part of the taxing power in the executive branch.”The court also cited what’s known as the “major questions doctrine”, a principle under which the executive branch cannot rely on ambiguous language in laws passed by Congress to justify consequential action.“These considerations apply with particular force where, as here, the purported delegation involves the core congressional power of the purse,” the court said. “When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms and subject to strict limits.”Because of this, the president “must ‘point to clear congressional authorization’ to justify his extraordinary assertion of that power”, the court said. “He cannot.”The court also pointed out that the White House conceded that the president “enjoys no inherent authority to impose tariffs during peacetime”, which is why it used the IEEPA to pass its tariffs.Voting to strike down the tariffs were the court’s liberal bloc – Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Joining them were Chief Justice John Roberts, along with Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, who were both appointed by Trump during his first term.In a dissenting opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued that the court’s opinion “is not likely to greatly restrict presidential tariff authority going forward” because the court essentially ruled that Trump just “checked the wrong statutory box by relying on IEEPA” instead of other laws to pass his tariffs.Instead, the ruling would “likely generate other serious practice consequences in the near term”, including whether refunds will be issued on the tariffs.“Refunds of billions of dollars would have significant consequences for the US Treasury. The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers,” Kavanaugh wrote. “That process is likely to be a ‘mess’, as was acknowledged at oral argument.”While the president has claimed that tariffs would fill US federal coffers, revitalize the country’s industrial heartlands and make the world economy more “fair” to the US, economists have repeatedly warned they risk raising prices further for Americans after years of heightened inflation.US economic growth slowed in fourth quarter of 2025 amid government shutdownRead moreIn a post on X, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called the decision a “victory for the wallets of every American consumer. Trump’s illegal tariff tax just collapsed – He tried to govern by decree and stuck families with the bill. Enough chaos. End the trade war.”The US’s major trading partners reacted cautiously to the news. William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chamber of Commerce, said: “While this decision gives clarity on the president’s executive powers to raise tariffs it does little to clear the murky waters for business.”The ruling relates to Trump’s use of the IEEPA, said Bain. “Different legislation has been used for other US tariffs, such as for steel and aluminium, and the president also has other options at his disposal to retain his current regime … For the UK, the priority remains bringing tariffs down wherever possible.”Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said her administration was reviewing the decision. “Not only are we the largest exporter to the United States, but we are also the largest buyer of US products,” she said at her daily morning conference. “What that shows is that beyond a particular policy of greater protectionism, it is very important for both countries to maintain the trade agreement.”Explore more on these topicsUS supreme courtTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationTariffsUS economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 3.0% pace. The survey was, however, completed before data on Thursday showing the trade deficit widening to a five-month high in December.The economy grew at a 4.4% pace in the third quarter. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the government shutdown would subtract 1.5 percentage points from fourth-quarter GDP through fewer services provided by federal workers, lower federal spending on goods and services, and a temporary reduction in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.US fixation on the hard-hat economy and making manufacturing great again makes little senseRead moreThe CBO forecast that most of the lost output would eventually be recovered, though between $7bn and $14bn would not.Before the release of the report,Donald Trumpposted on social media that the “Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That’s why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns! Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES.”The report, which was delayed by the record 43-day government shutdown, highlighted a jobless economic expansion as well as a “K-shaped” economy, in which upper-income households are doing well while lower-income consumers are struggling amid high inflation from import tariffs and stalling wage growth.Those conditions have created what economists and Trump’s opponents call an affordability crisis. Only 181,000 jobs were added last year, the fewest outside the pandemic since the 2009 Great Recession, and down from 1.459m in 2024.Growth in consumer spending slowed from the third quarter’s brisk 3.5% pace. Economists say spending has largely been driven by higher-income households and has been at the expense of saving as inflation eroded buying power.Consumer spending could get a tailwind from what economists anticipate will be larger tax refunds this year because of tax cuts. Economists estimated AI, including datacenters, semiconductors, software, and research and development, accounted for a third of GDP growth in the first three quarters of 2025, blunting the hit from tariffs and reduced immigration. The stale report will probably have no impact on monetary policy.Explore more on these topicsUS economyUS federal government shutdown 2025AI (artificial intelligence)InflationDonald TrumpTrump tariffsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The6-3 decisionon Friday to strike down his barrage of tariffs on imports from virtually everywhere based on the preposterous argument that they addressed national emergencies will reassure the world that the US’s system of government – based on the separation of powers, checks and balances, and the rule of law – has not collapsed entirely.But let’s hold the (imported) champagne. The court’s ruling will not restore the United States to its former place as a reasonable, trustworthy player in the world economy. The rules-based economic architecture that underpinned the integration of the world economy over the decades that followed the second world war remains fractured. Trump is still intent on its disintegration. And he retains power to do so.The court’s decision is good news, for sure, grounded on the fact that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) invoked by Trump does not, in fact, give him the power to raise tariffs. These are a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has sole authority.The ruling explicitly referred to tariffs justified by the “public health crisis”, due to illegal drugs from Canada, Mexico and China, and those to counter trade deficits the administration claimed “led to the hollowing out” of American manufacturing. But it will stop all the other supposed “national emergency” duties, including the one Trump attributed to the Brazilian government’s tussle with Elon Musk’s X and its jailing of former president Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup.The Swiss-basedGlobal Trade Alert estimatedthe supreme court’s call will reduce the United States’ average, trade-weighted tariff, to 8.3% from 15.3%, which will come as very good news for harried American consumers as well as businesses who rely on imported components.Barring any countervailing action by the White House, the average tariff against imports from China will fall from 36.8% to 21.2%, on a trade-weighted basis. It will fall from 26.3% to 6.8% on Brazilian imports and decline from 14.9% to 9.9% on Japanese goods.But before anybody calls this a win, it is worth noting that 8.3% is an extraordinarily high tariff, by recent historical standards. More importantly, the court had little to say about the corruption at the heart of Trump’s trade war: the incongruous, bullshit arguments Trump has deployed to justify aggression against the world.The court said nothing about whether the president should justify how tariffs would remedy the emergencies he claims they address. (The blanket “reciprocal tariffs” he imposed on “Liberation Day” last April notably failed to curb the trade deficit, which grew by 2% in 2025, fuelled by a surge in imports to a record high of $4.33tn.)The Court did not limit the president’s ability to justify government action by saying whatever he wants, however mendacious it may be. Apparently, it’s fine for him to say that Bolsonaro’s arrest or theinternational criminal court’s investigation of US and Israeli officials is a “national emergency”. He just can’t use that argument to impose a tax.The court’s decision, in fact, adds to economic uncertainty, as deals Trump struck with other countries are upended by the decision. He needs another source of revenue to fill the budget hole created by the foregone custom duties. CapitalEconomicsestimates that levies collected so far under the now invalidated national emergency pretext amount to about $120bn, or half a percent of gross domestic product.And as Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted in his dissent, the supreme court did nothing to remove all the other weapons Trump has to continue on the offensive.“We have very powerful alternatives,” a visibly frustrated president said in a rambling press conference after the decision was announced. “We’ll take in more money.” He immediately announced a 10% blanket global tariff “over and above our normal tariffs already being charged”, under section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows temporary tariffs to address “large and serious” balance-of-payments deficits.So here we go again but maybe there is reason to cheer. Perhaps the court’s ruling will protect the international economic architecture from Trump’s tantrums. Section 122 requires congressional approval to extend the tariffs beyond 150 days, and must not discriminate among countries – meaning Trump can’t tweak them in the pursuit of bilateral deals.Trump could resort to section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which permits tariffs to retaliate against unfair trade practices, and which he deployed against China in his first term. He could invoke section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which he used to put levies on steel, aluminum, lumber, semiconductors and autos on national security grounds. But these also come with limits.Before retaliating under section 301, for instance, the US trade representative must perform an investigation, consult with the country in question and publish its proposed action and the factual findings on which it is based.Even if he can eventually replace the tariffs that the court struck down, Trump can no longer credibly threaten tariffs every other day to advance this or that foreign policy objective.Who knows whether world trade has been granted a true reprieve. What is certain is that Trump will not simply eat this defeat. Many countries around the world must now negotiate some new trade deals with the United States. It’s unclear whether the supreme court’s decision will make that process any easier.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEconomicsUS economyDonald TrumpTariffsUS supreme courtanalysisShareReuse this content"

She said the document “reveals that the environment minister was essentially told by the mining company that this action was necessary to discharge Australia’s obligations under the critical minerals deal with the United States”.“This mining company got away with breaking the law for 15 years under successive Australian governments, illegally clearing in a global biodiversity hotspot and then, when it finally admitted it needed some paperwork to continue its destruction, applied for and was granted an exemption to the law within 19 days. It’s flagrant and it’s staggering,” she said.“In the twisted logic of Australia in the Trump age, the national interest lies not in honouring and protecting the beauty and richness of our natural heritage, but in sacrificing it to foreign mining companies.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWA’s northern jarrah forests are home to endangered species including the state’s unique Carnaby’s and Baudin’s black cockatoos.Alcoa has been mining for decades in the region, with the statement of reasons showing there had been a longrunning dispute between the company and the federal environment department over whether its operations were covered by “continuous use” exemptions from the law for activities predating the commencement of the EPBC Act in 2000.The document shows the department believed Alcoa’s clearing of the forest for bauxite mining had not been covered by these exemptions since 2011 and required an assessment for their impacts on protected species and ecosystems.In November last year, the federal parliament passed amendments to the EPBC Act that imposed tougher limits on the use of the continuous use exemptions. Clearing of vegetation older than 15 years would no longer be exempt from assessment and approval under the laws.After the changes, Alcoa “now accepts that it requires EPBC Act approvals for the Huntly and Willowdale mining operations” and submitted an application for the operations at both mines to be considered through a strategic assessment process, the document states.On 30 January, Alcoa made an application for a national interest exemption, arguing that without one it would not be possible to continue supplying bauxite to its refineries at Pinjarra and Wagerup and “is in the position of being unable to continue its operations”.Alcoa argued its application should be accepted to “avoid unintended consequences” of the EPBC reforms and that it would be unable to maintain supply of bauxite without more clearing “and if ongoing supply cannot be maintained this will impact future production of gallium”.Because the department had told Alcoa its operations were not exempt from the law since 2011, Watt did not accept that the new laws passed last year justified granting the company the national interest exemption.But he did accept that granting the exemption would be in the national interest because it would “enable mining operations to continue so as to preserve the viability” of the gallium project, which had the backing of the US and Japanese governments.He said it would help Alcoa to “sustain its operations and its financial viability” while its expansion proposals were assessed and would keep a workforce of about 6,000 people in employment. Watt also decided it would help Australia diversify critical minerals supply for the net zero transition and defence materials.The department’s spokesperson said it was the department’s view that intensified mining by Alcoa since 2011 required approval.“The limitations of the Act made resolving this long‑running non‑compliance complex, but these $55 million undertakings deliver a strong and lasting resolution,” they said.Australia and the US have signed a critical minerals deal to take on China’s monopoly. Here’s what you need to knowRead more“This case highlights the limitations of the current regulatory framework, where protracted investigations and constrained compliance tools have made enforcement slow and complex.”They said the recent reforms to Australia’s nature laws “respond to these issues by strengthening the regulator’s ability to act early, act decisively, and prevent long-running non‑compliance from occurring again”.An Alcoa spokesperson said the national interest exemption would allow the company to “fully modernise our approvals under the EPBC Act” and sustain thousands of jobs. They said the minister’s statement of reasons made clear that “Alcoa and the government have had a difference in position regarding our historical position in relation to our approvals under the EPBC Act”.“As noted in the statement, our operations pre-date the EPBC Act and Alcoa has continued operations on the basis that certain exemptions under the Act applied,” they said.“Alcoa has voluntarily entered into agreements (enforceable undertakings) with the government to reconcile this difference of position and importantly the associated investment is for conservation programs and research for the health of the Northern Jarrah Forest.”The WA Greens upper house MP Jess Beckerling said it was “staggering to read that Alcoa has been clearing illegally since 2011, that the department has been informing Alcoa of its obligations since that time, but that no penalty has been imposed until now”.“The notion that gallium production for the American military should afford Alcoa a national interest exemption from federal laws is farcical,” she said.Watt declined to answer specific questions, instead directing Guardian Australia to an interview with ABC radio in Perth this week in which he described the penalty as “an unprecedented amount for a company to pay after undertaking unlawful clearing”.He told the ABC: “This discussion has been going on between my department and Alcoa for around 10 years” and “there’s been this difference of opinion legally about whether they were required to get approvals or not, and that’s now been resolved as a result of our new laws.”He said the Albanese government had “beefed up its compliance efforts” and was “prosecuting a lot more people” than previous governments.Explore more on these topicsWestern AustraliaLogging and land-clearingTrees and forestsMiningBusiness (Australia news)Climate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

It also has employees in Berlin, Brussels, Doha and Singapore.Administrators at Interpath said Global Counsel had “no option” but to enter administration after anumber of its clients cut ties with the business, despite its attempts to distance itself from Mandelson and its other co-founder, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser.The crisis hit Global Counsel after it emerged that Mandelson had sought Epstein’s advice on setting up the business in 2010, shortly after leaving office whenLabourlost the general election.Will Wright, the chief executive of Interpath and joint administrator, said on Friday: “While Global Counsel had grown over the past 15 years to become one of the UK’s leading public affairs consultancies, the rapid and sudden loss of clients over recent weeks has had a monumental impact on the business.“We will now undertake a detailed review of the company’s assets and liabilities and explore the best route to realise the company’s assets.”Interpath added that the immediate focus would be on supporting staff in the UK.Wegg-Prosserstepped down as chief executiveearlier this month.Files released by the US Department of Justice showed that Wegg-Prosser had met Epstein and shared the company’s business plan while Epstein was under house arrest in New York.Global Counsel was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinLabourLobbyingnewsShareReuse this content"

But Unai Emery’s side have struggled of late in games where the pressure is on and the onus is upon them to be the aggressor. After exitingthe FA Cup to Newcastle, Marco Bizot’s moment of madness all but ending their hopes of reaching the fifth round, it is back to league duty. They eked outan ugly win over Brighton, just the kind of result they would be happy with this weekend, but recently they also lost at home to 10-man Brentford and to Everton. Before that they drew at lowly Crystal Palace, though Oliver Glasner’s side have been a bogey team for Villa. This week Bizot apologised for his rush of blood. Which Villa will turn up against Leeds?Ben FisherAston Villa v Leeds, Saturday 3pm (all times GMT)2Hürzeler urgently needs an impactFor a time,Brentfordwere depicted as a junior relation to Brighton. That idea was helped along by their owners, Matthew Benham and Tony Bloom, being former colleagues. This season, Benham holds the superior hand. Keith Andrews is on course to surpass the highest points total achieved by Thomas Frank, previously thought irreplaceable. Brighton, meanwhile, begin to look over their shoulder. Many supporters are unhappy with Fabian Hürzeler’s in-game management and selections, but how strong a squad does he command? Was the money received for Alexis Mac Allister, Moisés Caicedo and João Pedro actually spent well by a club widely admired for its recruitment? Carlos Baleba is the £100m-rated heir apparent to Caicedo but incapable of seeing out 90 minutes, and about £90m was spent on a callow bunch last summer. Hürzeler’s team have not won in the top flight since 3 January, when they beat Burnley, and that was their only league victory since November. The head coach needs players making an impact sooner rather than later.John BrewinBrentford v Brighton, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenAll is not well at Brighton.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Nigel French/Apl/Sportsphoto3Walker could be given the runaroundThis season has become a struggle for Kyle Walker, forcing him to learn about football at the other end of the table after spending so many years at the top. He has looked susceptible against players with pace, with his own speed starting to let the 35-year-old down. Considering the array of wingers available to Liam Rosenior, he could be in for a tough afternoon at Stamford Bridge but Walker is someone who likes a challenge. An afternoon up against Alejandro Garnacho, for example, would be a true test of Walker’s capabilities and an examination of whether he still has the same attributes that made him one of world’s best right-backs. If he is given the runaround it could be the final indication that Walker’s time in thePremier Leaguewill end, perhaps along with Burnley’s. However, if he can roll back the years, it could offer some much-needed inspiration for a club facing a third top-flight relegation in succession.Will UnwinChelsea vBurnley, Saturday 3pm4West Ham green with transfer envyAndoni Iraola answers each question on his future with an enigmatic shrug, but the situation will play out soon enough. Should the Basque have just 12 games left in charge of a club where he has won hearts and minds, he will leave the next manager a considerable legacy, inheriting a talented squad. As with Antoine Semenyo, Iraola honed a Football League talent, converting Alex Scott’s raw materials into a player capable of dominating opponents, adding doggedness to grace. Rayan’s performances since arriving have caught the eye but Eli Junior Kroupi’s explosive finishing and the speed of Amine Adli have added attacking dimensions. Another January arrival, the Hungarian attacking midfielder Alex Toth, 20, was much coveted. Bournemouth’s agility in transfer dealings comes as a thudding point of comparison to the short-termism that hobbles West Ham. Taty Castellanos has been a minor hit since his January switch but Hammers fans can only dream of the sensible, ordered recruitment in train at Saturday’s opponents.JBWest Ham v Bournemouth, Saturday 5.30pmView image in fullscreenTaty Castellanos has been a minor hit for West Ham since arriving in January.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/Shutterstock5A strike partner for Haaland?Finding opportunities to rest Erling Haaland has not always been easy for Pep Guardiola. A knock helped rule him out against League Two Salford City for what turned out to bea laborious 2-0 win, giving the Norwegian the chance of a free weekend. In the recent Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Saturday’s opponents, Newcastle, Haaland started on the bench and watched as City made light work of a confused visiting defence. Guardiola knows how to cause damage against Eddie Howe’s side and reinstating Haaland to the lineup can only be an advantage considering his ludicrous goal record since arriving in England. It is a wonder, however, if Guardiola will start with the same setup that reaped rewards the last time the two met, with a striking partnership that was almost operating as wingers, pulling the centre-backs around to create space for midfielders. Haaland being on the right would give him a better angle to run in behind and leave Newcastle pondering how to stop him and either Antoine Semenyo or Omar Marmoush.WUManchester City v Newcastle, Saturday 8pm6Buoyant Wolves knocking at Palace’s doorOnly Wolves have fewer home wins than Crystal Palace this season, with supporters last able to celebrate a Premier League victory back on 1 November. Eight games without a win is Palace’s worst run in the top flight at Selhurst Park since they went 15 in 1998 and finished rock bottom under Attilio Lombardo as caretaker. Oliver Glasner’s approach is much better suited to hitting teams on the break and they are vulnerable against sides who like to employ the same tactics when they arrive in south London. Afterletting a 2-0 lead slip against Burnleylast week, Palace will be desperate to put some daylight between them and the relegation zone against Wolves on Saturday. But havingtravelled to Mostar on Thursdayin the Conference League, they will have a 24-hour preparation disadvantage against the team thatproduced a stirring comeback against Arsenalin their last outing.Ed AaronsCrystal Palace v Wolves, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenWolves visit Selhurst Park off the back of Tom Edozie’s late equaliser against Arsenal.Photograph: MB Media/Getty Images7In-form Wirtz a new threat for ForestNow that Florian Wirtz has settled into the Premier League and is flourishing as a No 10, he will face an intriguing battle at the City Ground against Ibrahim Sangaré. When on his game, the Forest central midfielder makes his team more stable and difficult to break down, but he will be severely tested against the Germany international, who is smart in his movement and passes. After a tumultuous week in Nottingham, Vítor Pereira needs to show he has created an organised structure. Considering Forestwon 3-0 at Anfieldthree months ago under Sean Dyche, the result on Sunday will be a strong indicator of where things have regressed amid the constant uncertainty. Wirtz did not play that day, so it will provide a new problem for Sangaré and Elliot Anderson, the most likely pairing. If they cannot cope, it feels as if the game will be Liverpool’s for the taking.WUNottingham Forest v Liverpool, Sunday 2pm8‘Crown jewel’ Le Fée proves his worthSunderland are expected to be without their captain, Granit Xhaka, once again when Fulham visit the Stadium of Light on Sunday but at least Régis Le Bris has Enzo Le Fée available to occupy Xhaka’s customary deep midfield role alongside Noah Sadiki. On the ball, Le Fée is Sunderland’s most gifted player but, off it, the 5ft 7in Frenchman has proved a perhaps unexpected hive of industry, controlling Sunderland’s press while contributing an impressive litany of interceptions and tackles as he chases and harries opponents. Above all, his reading of the game is, like his passing, superb. When he coached Le Fée at Lorient, Le Bris described the midfielder as his “crown jewel” and, after beginning this season on the bench, a player he first coached as a child in Lorient’s academy has variously shone on the left, in a playmaking No 10 role and, lately, as a fluid No 8/No 6 hybrid. While the excellent Xhaka rightly remains the leading candidate to become Sunderland’s player of the season, Le Fée is likely to be very much part of the conversation.Louise TaylorSunderland vFulham, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenEnzo Le Fée has provided plenty of industry in a deeper role for Sunderland.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty Images9Spurs embark on Tudor era in derbyIgor Tudor will mark his first game in charge of Tottenham by facing not only the club’s fiercest rivals but also the best team in the world, according to Pep Guardiola. Thomas Frank was sacked after two wins in 17 Premier League matches, leaving the club in some relegation strife, so starting the turnaround againstArsenalis a tricky proposition. On the upside, the players should be somewhat refreshed after 12 days without a game and time to work with the Croat on the training ground. Having favoured a back three during his career, Tudor will need to concoct a plan B. Cristian Romero is suspended, while Ben Davies and Kevin Danso are injured, leaving him with limited centre-back choices, in addition to the wing-back Destiny Udogie being out and Pedro Perro potentially only just returning from a hamstring problem. Arsenal have the league’s second-most prolific attack and plenty of momentum going forward, which spells danger for Tudor and his coaching merits.WUTottenhamv Arsenal, Sunday 4.30pm10Supersub Sesko pushing for a startAfter failing to win for the first time in his five games in charge, Michael Carrick will naturally wonder if he needs to change something, not that there was any great shame indrawing at West Ham. One potential option for him is to start Benjamin Sesko after he came off the bench to score a sublime equaliser in east London. Since Ruben Amorim left, Sesko has five goals in six matches andlooks a different strikerto the one who had lumbered to two in 21 for club and country this season. Considering the aerial capabilities of Everton’s defenders in both boxes, the prospect of a little extra height could help United, while also allowing Carrick to keep Amad Diallo on the bench to test tiring legs late on, while moving Bryan Mbeumo out to the left. If Sesko is not given a chance from the start, he knows how to make an impact off the bench and being a trusted substitute would give him a marked role under the new regime.WUEverton vManchester United, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal2732582Man City2630533Aston Villa2610504Man Utd2610455Chelsea2617446Liverpool266427Brentford265408Everton26-1379AFC Bournemouth26-23710Newcastle2603611Sunderland26-33612Fulham26-53413Crystal Palace26-43214Brighton2603115Leeds26-93016Tottenham Hotspur26-12917Nottm Forest26-132718West Ham26-172419Burnley26-231820Wolverhampton27-3210Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendAston VillaLeeds UnitedBrentfordBrighton & Hove AlbionChelseaBurnleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her journey culminated in a medal, but it was about much more than thatBryan Armen Grahamat the Milano Ice Skating ArenaFri 20 Feb 2026 10.35 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 18.13 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAlysa Liu made her way through a mixed zone teeming with hundreds of reporters at a quarter past midnight early Friday morning, an Olympic gold medal draped around her neck, the sequins in her color-coordinated dress glimmering beneath the klieg lights and crush of television cameras. The 20-year-old from West Oakland had just become thefirst American woman to win figure skating’s biggest prizein 24 years, drilling seven clean triples to leapfrog a pair of Japanese rivals from third place after Tuesday’s short program and gatecrash her sport’s most rarefied air. But to hear Liu tell it, her second gold in 12 days was merely a passing footnote in a Milan fortnight she doesn’t want to end.Liu’s carefree mindset should and will be studied in the weeks, months and years after these Olympics – especiallytheseOlympics– as a counterpoint to the results-obsessed mindsets that have shattered the mental wellbeing of so many athletes thrust into the pressure-cooker of the world’s biggest sporting event. She spoke candidly and insightfully on how her unique journey from child prodigy to burnout case to second-act skater gave rise to an indifference to scores or placements. All she wanted in the end was a chance to make the US team and share her artistry on the world stage.Only a few meters away stood Kaori Sakamoto, the silver medalist and one of the most joyful people ever to skate on Olympic ice, dabbing away a steady stream of tears with a wrinkled tissue, brought down by the cold arithmetic and brutal reckoning of this unforgiving sport. The 25-year-old from Kobe, who is retiring after this season, had won a shock bronze medal four years ago at the Beijing Olympics only when a nailed-on favorite who’d never lost a competition at the senior levelwent to pieces in the free skate. She’d backed up that breakthrough with a run of three world championships in the years since. But a couple of faint mistakes on Friday night – a wobbly landing on a triple flip, a missed triple toe in a combination – left her short of Liu’s marker and lamenting the storybook ending that might have been. Sometimes third can feel like first. Other times second can feel like nothing at all.Alysa Liu wins Winter Olympics gold to end US women’s 24-year figure skating droughtRead moreLiu’s journey since Beijing, where she’d finished sixth on her Olympic debut, was different. She’d vanished from the sport only months after the 2022 Games citing mental fatigue, making itInstagram-officialbefore anyone could talk her out of it. She started school at UCLA and studied psychology. She went hiking in the Himalayas with friends. She discovered herself outside a sport where she said she’d felt boxed in sincewinning US nationals at the age of 13, when her 4ft 6in frame left her too short to reach the top of the podium without a hand from the other medalists.“I really hated skating when I quit. Like, I really didn’t like it,” Liu said in the run-up to Milan. “I didn’t care about competitions. I didn’t care about places. I didn’t care about skaters. I didn’t care about my programs. I just wanted to, like, get away. I wanted nothing to do with that. I hated fame. I hated social media. I didn’t like interviews. Like, I hated all of it.”View image in fullscreenGold medalist Alysa Liu celebrates alongside silver medalist Kaori Sakamoto and bronze medalist Ami Nakai of Japan.Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty ImagesBut a chance reconnection with her love for movement while gliding down the mountain during a Lake Tahoe ski trip led her back to the ice.Gradually at first, once a week at public sessions at the Toyota Sports Performance Center in El Segundo, where she found the complex jumps that had propelled her rise had not completely abandoned her. Over time she rediscovered a love for skating not as a competitive pursuit but a vehicle for self-expression. She soon fixed her sights on a comeback, but only under certain conditions. Her father, Arthur, who had poured untold sums into molding his daughter into the next Michelle Kwan – another Chinese-American skating icon from California – would no longer be part of the team. Alysa Liu would be the CEO of Alysa Liu Inc, having final say over everything from her costumes to her music to her diet to her training schedule. Most importantly, the results wouldn’t matter.Enter Alysa 2.0: a term she dislikes, but an accurate shorthand for the complete reinvention of a skater on her own terms. Sporting an eye-catching frenulum piercing and a bleached tree-ring hairstylethat has required years to cultivate, she has embraced a nonconformist streak that’s made her a darling of outsiders everywhere. But the transformation runs far deeper than aesthetics.“Protecting my identity is my main goal,” she said in Thursday’s aftermath. “I know exactly what it’s like to not have that. My experience with it before has taught me how I should guard myself. I don’t go online that much. I hang out with my friends and family as much as possible. Being grounded is really what keeps me. I love exploring other hobbies, doing side-quests and what not. It keeps me curious and I’m protecting that.”View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu seemed to be enjoying herself during her gold medal winning routine.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianLiu first signaled her comeback was for realat last year’s world championshipsin Boston, when she became the first American to win figure skating’s biggest competition outside the Olympics since Kimmie Meissner in 2006. The bumps in the road since then have ranged from the prosaic to the macabre. There weremusic rights headaches. Dress issues. Her planned short program music for the Olympic seasonwas scrappedwhen the artist was found at the center of a police investigation after the remains of a teenage girl were discovered in the trunk of his impounded car. (Regular figure skating things.)Alysa Liu left figure skating behind. She came back better than ever | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreTo hear Phillip DiGuglielmo put it, the Olympic gold was a “kind of taboo” subject and didn’t even enter open conversation until November. One half of the thrice-fired, thrice-rehired coaching duo – along with Massimo Scali – that have been with Liu from the start, DiGuglielmo reflected on how their skater’s reframed expectations have rubbed off on the team. Stress management ahead of Thursday’s free skate, for instance, meant two glasses of Pol Roger champagne before their walk over to the rink.“We did a little pre-celebratory thing, like we learned from her,” he said. “Third place or fourth place would have still been an incredible accomplishment. I can’t sit here and say shehasto win. That doesn’t jibe with her values. And as a coach you have to amplify the values of the athlete.”He added: “Her goal was about showing her art. We get a lot of flak. Pretty hair and pretty dresses and sequins. It’s a sport. It’s a hard sport. It’s a split-second timing sport. You get a little bit of adrenaline and it changes your timing. Her internal clock is just ticking along. Her goal was to just make the Olympic team. That was really the big deal for her.”View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu shows some love to the fans alongside coaches Phillip DiGuglielmo (left) and Massimo Scali (right) after receiving her score.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianDiGuglielmo, who was initially skeptical of the comeback and tried to talk her out of it, had stood alongside Liu through her dizzying, unfulfilling first chapter, giving him a unique perspective for how far she has come.“When she was younger, she has no memories of any of the places she went to, or any of the competitions she did,” he said. “She was so not happy that she wound up compartmentalizing. She does not remember that she went to junior worlds, or that she went to the junior Grand Prix final. She doesn’t remember any of that. So last year’s tagline wasmaking memories.If we’re in Japan, we’re getting ramen. We wanted to say, ‘Here we are, this is what we’re doing.’”‘If there was no one on Earth, I would still skate’: Alysa Liu on her remarkable figure skating comebackRead moreThat odyssey culminated on Thursday night, when an arena once headlined by Whitney Houston and Lady Gaga gave rise to a new American original, an unthinkable outcome two years ago when Liu was off the grid roving the trails around Mount Everest with skating firmly in the rear view. She is now the reigning world and Olympic champion, flying home from Italy after Saturday’s exhibition gala with two golds followinglast week’s team eventas the face of US figure skating, if not the sport itself. But more importantly she’s offered proof that joy, not pressure, can prove the sharper edge.“My story is more important than anything to me, and that’s what I will hold dear,” Liu said. “This journey has been incredible. I have no complaints, and I’m so grateful for everything. It’s just how my life has gone. Everything in general has led me to this point.”Explore more on these topicsAlysa LiuWinter Olympics 2026US sportsFigure skatingWinter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He set a time of 1min 31.992sec, eight-tenths clear of the second-placed McLaren of Lando Norris and a second up on Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Mercedes’George Russell.Domenicali pleads for calm over fears new rules will wreck Formula OneRead moreNonetheless, Russell and Mercedes will head to Australia with no little confidence, having been consistently quick across all three tests, and Russell remains the early favourite. He felt there was more to come but remained wary of the threat from Red Bull, McLaren and in particular the blistering paceFerrarihave demonstrated in practice starts.“The car’s feeling good. The new power units are feeling fast,” he said. “We’re making improvements every single day. However, we need to keep on improving the reliability. I think we’ve got a lot of potential beneath us.”What was striking by the close of the last test was how quick theFerraris of Lewis Hamiltonand Leclerc were off the line as the FIA trialled a new race start procedure. Russell by comparison has been sluggish and he said it was an area he and Mercedes would have to address.“To win a race, you’ve also got to get off the line quite well,” he said. “Two starts I’ve made this week were worse than my worst ever start inFormula One. And Lewis down in P11 got into P1. So at this stage I don’t think it matters how quick you are. The thing that’s going to trip you up is going to be that tallest hurdle. And that’s what we’re trying to get our heads around right now. We’re stumbling on some at the moment.”Aston Martin ended what has been a hugely disappointing pre-season at a low point. With the designer Adrian Newey at the helm this season, optimism was high but the team have endured a harsh wake-up call. They were late completing their car,missing the opening of the first test, and have struggled with a litany of problems restricting their running time.On Thursday Fernando Alonso lost three hours of running after a battery problem and on the final day in Bahrain there were more difficulties. Their engine manufacturer, Honda, was forced to concede it had worked through so many parts it had in effect run out by Friday and the team could run only very short stints with half-hour breaks in between. They completed just six laps and called a halt over two hours before the end of the final session.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Formula OneMotor sportFerrariCharles LeclercGeorge RussellMercedes GPnewsShareReuse this content"

She won two golds and a silver atthe 2022 Beijing Gamesand has claimed two silvers at the Milano Cortina Games, with one more medal event set for Saturday in the halfpipe.Gu was born in San Francisco to an American father and a Chinese mother. In 2019, she requested a switch to compete for China instead of the US, a decision that has turned her intoa lightning rod.How citizenship row clouded Eileen Gu’s OlympicsRead moreIn an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Vance suggested that American-born athletes should represent the US in international competition.“I certainly think that somebody who grew up in the United States of America, who benefited from our education system, from the freedoms and liberties that make this country a great place, I would hope that they want to compete with the United States of America,” Vance said. “So, I’m going to root for American athletes, and I think part of that is people who identify themselves as Americans. That’s who I’m rooting for this Olympics.”Asked specifically about Gu, Vance said he had “no idea what her status should be” and that it “was up to the Olympic committee”.When asked about Vance’s comments after a qualifying run on Thursday, Gu said, perUSA Today: “I’m flattered. Thanks, JD! That’s sweet.”She said she wasn’t offended by Vance’s comments and agreed with a suggestion that she had become a “punching bag” for US political debate.“So many athletes compete for a different country. … People only have a problem with me doing it because they kind of lump China into this monolithic entity, and they just hate China. So it’s not really about what they think it’s about.“And also, because I win. Like if I wasn’t doing well, I think that they probably wouldn’t care as much, and that’s OK for me. People are entitled to their opinions.”Vance led the US delegation at these Olympics,appearing at several eventsand attending the opening ceremony on 6 February in Milan, where he was met withboosin the San Siro stadium.Earlier in the Games, Gudefended American freeskier Hunter Hessafter he expressed ambivalence over representing the US – comments that were attacked by Donald Trump in a social media post that called Hess a ‘real Loser’.“As someone who’s been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,” she said then.US skier Hess describes ‘hardest weeks of my life’ after Trump’s ‘real loser’ commentRead moreAhead of these Olympics, Gutold Time magazinethat “the US already has the representation,” and “I like building my own pond.” In 2022, she said she felt “just as American as I am Chinese”.The Olympic charter says “a national of two or more countries at the same time may represent either one of them”. Gu has declined to publicly share her citizenship status, and China does not permit dual citizenship.More than 15 American-born athleteshave won medals at these Games competing for other countries. On the other side, at least 13 foreign-born athletes have medaled competing for Team USA.Gu won gold in the halfpipe at Beijing 2022 and is a favorite to medal again.“I have said, I do what I do because I want to inspire the next generation of young women. I’ve said this since I was 10. No one was paying me when I was 10. No country wanted me to ski for them when I was 10. I’ve had the same principle since I was literally prepubescent. And so if people don’t believe me, at a certain point, that’s just on them,” she said Thursday (perAustralia’s ABC Sport).“I can’t convince you. I have all the evidence. If you just close your eyes, what am I going to do about that? So I’m not bothered by it … I just wish that people would adopt the Olympic spirit more. That’s what this contest is about. It’s about bringing people together. It’s about using sport as a spirit of communication. And if they want to focus on the wrong things, they just have a sad little life.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSkiingUS sportsJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

No opponents for the matches had been confirmed.However, the Bundesliga club decided to cancel the visit amid growing concerns about the actions of ICE, after two US citizenswere shot deadby federal agents in Minnesota last month.“It is correct that we cancelled a planned trip to Minnesota in the United States. There were sporting, economic and political reasons for this,” a Werder Bremen spokesperson said.“Playing in a city where there is unrest and people have been shot does not fit with our values. Furthermore, it was unclear to us which players would be able to enter the USA at all due to the stricter entry requirements.”Bremen’s struggles in theBundesliga, where they are battling to avoid relegation as they languish in 16th place, which is the relegation playoff spot, were also a factor in making the decision, the spokesperson said.“We are currently facing a very challenging sporting situation, which also makes planning such a trip difficult. There have also been certain economic risks,” he added.Bremen, without a win in their last 12 Bundesliga matches, have 19 points ahead of Sunday’s visit to second-from-bottom side St Pauli, who have 17 also from 22 games.Explore more on these topicsFootballBundesligaUS sportsEuropean club footballWerder BremennewsShareReuse this content"

The US made far lighter work of Slovakia in the nightcap to set up the heavyweight clash, strolling to a 6-2 win after Jack Hughes and Jack Eichel scored in a 19-second span during the second period to blow things open, ensuring the Americans no worse than silver and their first men’s hockey medal in 16 years.USA roar back from brink to beat Canada in overtime and claim Olympic women’s ice hockey goldRead more“When we started this journey last summer and got together for an orientation camp, our goal was to be in the gold medal game,” Eichel said. “That’s where we are at.”The Americans are targeting their third ever Olympic title in men’s hockey and first since theMiracle on Iceteam of 1980, while Canada can win a record-extending 10th. The eagerly awaited matchup will mark the third time the border rivals have met in the gold medal game and the first since 2010, when Sidney Crosby etched his name into Olympic loreby scoring in overtime to seal a 3-2 winover the Americans on home soil.Crosby, 38, is still in the Canada squad four Olympics later, but he did not dress for Friday’s game after leavingWednesday’s quarter-final win over the Czech Republicin the second period with a lower-back injury. No details about the two-time Olympic gold medalist’s injury have been released and the severity remains unclear, but Canada coach Jon Cooper said “he’s got a better chance of playing in the gold medal game than he had of playing in tonight’s game”.“We are a deep team, and we have leaders up and down the lineup,” Canada star Connor McDavid said. “It does not matter who is wearing the C, everybody can play and play a big role and lead.”Canada found themselves staring down elimination on Friday for a second straight knockout game after Erik Haula’s short-handed goal fired the Finns to a 2-0 lead early in the second period.But forward Sam Reinhart pulled one back before the second intermission for the Canadians, while defenseman Shea Theodore notched the third-period equalizer. Then after MacKinnon drew a high sticking penalty from Niko Mikkola, the Colorado Avalanche star fired home the winner in the final minute, improving Canada’s dominant power play to 7-for-16 (43.75%) in the tournament.“It’s everything,” said MacKinnon, the NHL’s leading goalscorer. “It’s the gold medal at an Olympic Games. We are very lucky to be here and it’s a great opportunity. We have got to be ready.”The US ran out to a 5-0 lead behind goals from Dylan Larkin and Tage Thompson in the first period, then Hughes (twice) and Eichel in the second. The Slovaks narrowed the gap in the third through goals from rising Montreal Canadiens star Juraj Slafkovsky and Pavol Regenda, but Brady Tkachuk’s breakaway goal with nine minutes left kept matters on course.“It’s the two best teams in the tournament, both undefeated, and we’ve got an opportunity to go win a gold medal.” Hughes said. “I’m really excited about the opportunity we have on Sunday. We’re one shot away [from gold], but the line between winning and losing is so fine in tournaments like this.“Both teams have earned their right to be in the final game and a chance to play for a gold medal. Here we are, we’re going to find out who the best team at the Olympics is.”The US and Canada are two of the only three teams in the Olympic tournament, along with quarter-finalists Sweden, made up exclusively of NHL players.The matchup comes one year after the North American rivals played twice in the 4 Nations Face-Off, which was the first international tournament to feature the NHL’s best players since 2016. The Americanswon 3-1in the round-robin contest played at Montreal’s Bell Centre that sawthe US anthem booedand featuredthree fights in the first nine seconds, while Canadawon the final 3-2 in overtimeat Boston’s TD Garden.“It’s best on best, it’s what every American and Canadian grows up watching, grows up hearing about,” Matthew Tkachuk said. “This is the pinnacle of the sport. This is as good as it gets, a rivalry that’s as good as it gets. There will not be one TV without this game on in the United States and Canada. That should get you pretty fired up.”The elder Tkachuk may not be exaggerating. No sooner had Canada punched their ticket for the final than Ontario premier Doug Fordannouncedall restaurants in the nation’s most populous province can serve alcohol beginning at 6am on Sunday ahead of the scheduled 8.10am ET start.Italian media outletshave been humming for dayswith reports that US president Donald Trump has mulled flying in for the final and the closing ceremony in Verona.

The 31-year-old Goepper had switched to halfpipe for this Olympic cycle after winning two silvers and a bronze in slopestyle in the previous three Games.View image in fullscreenAlex Ferreira completes his second run of Friday’s final.Photograph: Marko Đurica/ReutersGoepper gave the crowd a scare on his final run when he smashed into the deck. But he was up in a few moments and appeared to be unhurt.Lee Seunghun of South Korea did not compete in the final after he crashed making a warmup run.When Ferreira’s skis smacked down lightly on the fifth of five butter-smooth landings in the contest winner, he started whipping around his right ski pole – his signature move in what now goes down as his signature win.A few minutes later, his sisters and parents were crying and he was on the top step of the podium, singing out loud as the Star-Spangled Banner played for the first time at the Livigno Snow Park.He used to be the best freeskier in the world without an Olympic title. Not any more.“He had the silver, the bronze and he needed the gold,” said Alex’s mother, Colleen Ferreira. “He was driven. A year ago, he said he was going to do this, and he did it.”In freeski halfpipe, as in snowboarding, competitors take turns zooming up and down the curved surface and launching into a series of acrobatic leaps that are scored for their difficulty and execution. Only their best of three runs counted.The halfpipe at the Livigno ski resort hosting these Olympic events measures 220m (240yds) in length, 22m (24yds) in width, and rises to 7.2m (23.6ft) in height.American Elizabeth Lemley won gold in women’s moguls freeski at the Winter Games, but the moguls events are held at a separate venue in Livigno.

However, the 27-year-old was unable to further rub Trump’s nose in it, as he failed to get a clean run and finished 10th.The Estonian Henry Sildaru, who took silver, and the Canadian, Brendan Mackay, who won bronze, both had cases for gold. However, it was another American, Alex Ferreira, who emerged triumphant. And after collecting his gold medal he firmly backed his teammate. “Hunter is a member of our team,” he said. “He’s a great guy. Others may disagree. But I stand by my teammate.”Afterwards, Hess admitted that despite abuse he had received from Trump – and the online attacks that followed – he had no regrets about speaking out about the problems back home. “I worked so hard to be here,” he said. “I sacrificed my entire life to make this moment happen. I’m not going to let controversy like that get in my way.View image in fullscreenTeam GB’s Gus Kenworthy, who has also been targeted by threats, has offered Hunter Hess support.Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty Images“I love the United States of America. I cannot say that enough. In my original statement, I felt like I said that, but apparently people didn’t take it that way. I’m so happy to be here, so happy to represent Team USA and ride as much as I can. I stand with what I said.”However, Hess admitted that at times it had not been easy. “There was a lot of noise and I’ve never been subject to that type of criticism,” he said. “But with my family’s help, I was able to get through it. And skiing has saved my life, time and time again, and it seems to have done so again. It was probably the hardest two weeks of my life.”Britain’s Gus Kenworthy, who was born in the UK but moved to the US when he was young, had also created controversy before the Games because of an Instagram image that went viral. After finishing sixth in the final, Kenworthy admitted that the outrage over his post, which had apparently been written in urine on the snow and read “Fuck ICE”, a reference to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, affected him.“But I don’t care what these people are saying,” said Kenworthy. “It is our constitutional right as Americans to say what we feel, have freedom of speech, speak truth to power. No one wants to read bad things about themselves, things that are threats and violent and scary and homophobic. But I also took it with a grain of salt. I couldn’t imagine writing something like that about someone, especially on a public forum, anyone who does that has something wrong with them. I think I’m on the right side.”Hess and Kenworthy also trained together before their event in Laax, Switzerland, where they shared their similar experiences.“We just chatted about it, kind of how we got through the hardship,” said Hess. “He gave me some pointers, which was really nice. And he just helped me have a little bit of an avenue to get out of the pain and focus on the good.”The dangers of the sport were illustrated when the event favourite, Finley Melville Ives, needed treatment for several minutes after a heavy crash in qualifying. In the final there was another serious crash as Nick Goepper landed hard on his back after a big trick, but he too was able to walk away after medical treatment.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBUS sportsSkiingUSA Olympic teamnewsShareReuse this content"

It has given me the chance to really be present and feel the excitement and anticipation that sport brings, not to mention the importance it has in giving us something else to focus on in difficult times.As a TV pundit, it was hard to keep my emotions in check watching Great Britain’s skeleton success because I knew what it meant to Matt Weston and Tabby Stoeckerto become Olympic champions– Matt twice, of course. Their achievements are not only historic but the day-to-day impact will be so meaningful to both of them. I remember seeing kids’ drawings of me and people dressing up as “Lizzy” and now I’m seeing it from a different perspective. I’m incredibly proud of them.Winter Olympics 2026: ski cross, halfpipe and more on day 14 – liveRead moreWinning gold with your teammate, as Matt and Tabby were able to experience in the new mixed event, is something special. In the individual events, you wait in the changing room and storm out when it is your turn. But this time the athletes lined up like aeroplanes on a runway, supporting their teammates before following them down the ice. I would have liked to have had Matt Weston as my teammate.There is a sense that some athletes have been in the right place at the right time in 2026. Austria’s Janine Flock won skeleton gold for the first time at the age of 36. She led the standings going into the final heat when I defended my title in 2018 but ended fourth. Elana Meyers Taylor of Team USAwon her first goldin the monobob aged 41. Her teammate Kaillie Humphries, 40, took bronze. It’s a joy to see women in their prime in their 40s.Even through all of my physical issuesafter Pyeongchang 2018, I was very pleased to be able to retire on my own terms. Dave Ryding, now 39, was representing Team GB at his second Games at Sochi 2014 and, as a first-time Olympian, I looked up to him as a more mature athlete. Dave was always so smiley and generous. I appreciated that. He has said he would ski until his legs fell off. “I think they pretty much have,” he said this week afterfinishing 17th in the slalomin his final Games.View image in fullscreenTeam GB’s Kirsty Muir endured two fourth-placed finishes, but at 21 her disappointment can fuel future medal tilts.Photograph: Action Press/ShutterstockThe level at which athletes are willing to go out and give their best continues to astound me. Whether it isthe bravery of Lindsey Vonn, who we’ve seenlying in bedwith a contraption on her leg after crashing out in the downhill, or the determinationin the eyes of Kirsty Muirat the top of the freeski ramps as she considered what was needed to reach the podium. Fourth place can be the greatest fire to light ambition for the future.The Olympics always looks glamorous. People will message you: “Are you having the best time? It looks so fun!” But I think there is this very human reality. I was really drawn to the image ofAtle Lie McGrath lying in the woods– the isolation, the reflection – after straddling a gate in his second run of the slalom and missing out on gold, all while mourning the death of his grandfather. People are captivated by the human side of elite athletes: they feel joy in your success but also empathy in those moments of failure.View image in fullscreenIlia Malinin put his falls in the free skate down to the ‘endless insurmountable pressure’ of being at the top of his sport.Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesI reallyfelt for the figure skater Ilia Malinin, who has spoken of the “endless insurmountable pressure” of being at the top, after his falls in the free skate cost him a medal having been the overwhelming favourite for gold. The Games can ask so much of you. There can be this loss of who you might have been had you won or what life might have been like in this moment. It’s like sliding doors, a moment of change.Charlotte Bankes, one of Britain’s great medal hopes, showed the power of human endeavour after the disappointment of her individual snowboard cross campaign, where she exited the competition at the quarter-final stage. In a matter of days, she changed that moment of frustration into the triumph ofwinning gold in the mixed team event with Huw Nightingale.From a British perspective, the three golds going in to the final weekend, including a first on the snow, are brilliant. But the fact of the matter is that UK Sport hadhoped for up to eight GB medalsat these Games. Even as we talk about the ups and downs of the human Olympic experience, there is still a cold reality of the outcome relating to funding.However, the fourth places of Muir, ofJen Dodds and Bruce Mouat in the mixed curlingand of Freya Tarbit and Marcus Wyatt in the mixed team skeleton demonstrate the potential for the next four-year cycle. As for now, I have been captivated by all the highs and lows thus far from Milano Cortina 2026. The full range of human emotions on show at the Olympics is what makes it so wonderful to watch.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicscommentShareReuse this content"

That kept Santos-Griswold from advancing through the quarter-final round.Winter Olympics 2026: men’s 5000m relay final, Norway break record for golds and more – liveRead moreThe race was paused while Sellier received attention, a large white sheet blocking her from the crowd that was packed into the arena to see the final night of short-track speedskating. She eventually gave a thumbs up to the crowd as she was taken away, leaving a trail of blood in the final corner of the track that workers had to clean up during the break.Polish officials said Sellier’s eye was OK. She received stitches at the arena before going to the hospital for more tests.Fontana’s skinsuit was nicked up and she received some help from her physiotherapist on her left hip during the pause. She wound up finishing second to Hanne Desmet of Belgium, sending her through to the semi-final round.She later advanced into the finals, narrowly edging Zhang Chutong at the finishing line.Fontana, the reigning Olympic silver medalist in the 1500m, was trying to move into a tie with Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen as the most decorated Winter Olympian.

The fortifying ruggedness of the terrain, the apple-crisp air, the high-albedo dazzle of sunlit snow: at altitude, it seems, everything is thinned to its essence. TheWinter Olympicsfrequently play on this mythology of purity, but rarely has culture’s quadrennial ascent up the switchbacks felt as clarifying as it has this year. Propelling us into heights untroubled by the compromises and tradeoffs that blight sport’s lower zones, Milano Cortina has delivered images so brilliant and sharp they’ve also served to expose how ugly – and morally murky – most non-Olympic team sports have become over the past four years.As a TV spectacle, the excellence of this Olympiad has been defined as much by absence as presence. No gambling ads, no live betting odds gunking up the screen, no win percentage trackers, no janky little segments in which the hosts joke about whatthe prediction markets are doing: these Games have brought delight and relief to a tired public’s eyes in equal measure. Cleaned of clutter and slop, sport, it turns out, can still be a thing of wonder and mystery, agony and beauty. Who would have thought?The unpolluting of the TV screen has made room for what matters in Olympic competition: the efforts of the athletes, above all, their mad contorsions and feats of ludicrous risk. But it’s also created a kind of acoustic space, drawing our attention to the percussion that Olympians produce while throwing their bodies against the mountain, into the track, and around the rink. The crisp of these Games is sonic as much as it is visual.Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 day 13 – in picturesRead moreThat’s not to say that NBC’s coverage in the US has been flawless: there’s been the usual overtalking from the commentators; the adenoidal whine of the camera drones has been as offputting as the footage they’ve yielded has been sublime; and thanks to the host network’s commitment to explaining the minutiae of each sport’s rules, viewers probably know more now aboutthe politics of curling’s hog linethan we ever wanted to. But in the not infrequent moments when the action has been given clear air, the results have brought a frizz of sonic wonder to these Games. The Olympics have officially joined the ASMR era, butunlike ASMR as it exists on social media, there’s been no rattling of nails on chip packets or spooning of random goop to keep us engaged. Instead viewers have thrilled to the sweetest music of all: the sound of other people working.Motion, steel, fiberglass and ice are the basic ingredients of the Winter Olympic soundscape, but in Milano Cortina the audio has been so detailed that we’ve been able to appreciate even the tiniest gestures: the fastening of the straps on the helmet in the monobob, the twitchy click of the downhill skiers’ poles at the top of the run, the corporal clip of the gates as the slalomers shin through their obstacles, the thunk of the tumbles in the free dance, the collagenous pump of the mogul racers’ knees.What exactly is going on here? Volume, the acoustic scientists tell us, decreases with altitude: the blast of a horn will sound softer and foggier at the top of Mount Everest than it does at sea level. But thinner air can also facilitate the production of a stickier soundscape: academic researchsuggeststhat ejective consonants, which have a viscous, glottal quality to them, aremore commonamong languages spoken at higher altitudes than in the breathy idioms closer to the sea. Whatever the state of the science – and I’m no expert in this area, in case that’s not already obvious – the explanation for the quality of the soundscape in Milano Cortina may have less to do with physics, altitude and air density than money. For these Games, NBC hasinvestedin immersive microphones and a fleet of on-site trucks to ensure the soundscape that’s piped into our living rooms is as rich and textured as possible. More money in sports broadcasting should go into useful things like this rather than partnerships with AI and gambling companies that no sane fan wants.In the speed skating, the scrambling of the skaters at the beginning of each team race has produced a metallic clashing similar to the tinny ring of a volley of parries in Olympic fencing. The brutality of ice hockey, perhaps the most aurally overstimulating of the winter sports, has been emphatic in the cranial crack of puck against stick, the frathouse chorus of 10 players driving across the ice as one, the Perspex warble of each collision into the glass.Sound has been as critical as vision to the most electric moments in these Games: think ofChoi Gaon’s feathery landingsin the last run of the women’s halfpipe, or Johannes Høsflot Klæbo sprinting up the final rise in the men’s skiathlon, the leathering of his skis on the snow producing an audible marker of his obvious distinction over the triers struggling for air behind him. Even the silences have been amplified in this high-fidelity spectacular of sound: the pause after thedeliveryof the video review verdict in the 1500m short-track speed skating final, for instance, was a small masterpiece of sporting theater, punctuated by the official’s wry smile as he skated off amid the eruption of a jubilant crowd.And what of the stranger sounds, those journeys into the acoustic unexpected? It’s to the extra-sporting realms that we must look to understand them. In the skeleton, the drag of the face shield on the ice produced a cosmic vibrato vaguely reminiscent of the unsheathing of a lightsaber in Star Wars. The drilling crescendo of the long hockey-stick descent in the ski jump has reminded me, at times, of a pot of milk boiling over, a foamy excess that resolves into the brief quiet of aerial suspension, then concludes with the padded clap of skis making contact with snow. The pulpy thrash of the cross-country skiers striding and double poling across the flats? A kind of juicing. The furious squidge of the brooms in the curling, as the sweepers strain to coax the stone into their preferred trajectory? The closest professional sport comes to replicating the sonic effect of biting into a slice of halloumi. Curling’s colonization of approximately 90% of the total Olympic program (a rough estimate I just came up with) has been made more enjoyable by the granularity of the team deliberations, shouted commands,and trash talkpicked up by the sheet mics. In no other sport is the instructional language (“Hold the line, hold the line HARD HARD HARD HAAAAAAARD, HAAAAAAAARD!”) so assaultively audible; in no other sport can you enjoy such a rich taxonomy of grunts.Despite all the problems and controversies that continue to dog the International Olympic Committee, the 2026 Olympics have shown sport at its most powder-light and lovable. Even the great conspiracies and embarrassments of these Games – thejudging in the ice dance final,contested touchingon the curling hog line, Sturla Holm Lægreid’stearful apologyafter winning bronze in the 20km biathlon, thecondom shortage– seem quaintly homespun next to the industrial venality of modern professional sports, a throwback to an earlier era of artisanal corruption, innuendo-fueled intrigue, and après-ski hanky panky. Enhancing these happy vibes has been the TV screen’s jazz of drags, snaps, pops, and stops, a soundtrack so hypnotic it’s made Milano Cortina a marvel for the ears as much as the eyes.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If both stay relatively healthy and perform up to capabilities, there’s no way the race between them for some honor (Golden Boot? MVP? Both?) won’t be fascinating to see unfold.AAWhatever the league does – or doesn’t do – tocapitalize on the World Cup.We’re just months away from arguably the biggest moment in the history of American men’s soccer and it’s still not entirely clear (schedule shift aside) what the league is doing to exploit it. It will be years, probably, before we figure out whether MLS succeeded or not – let’s hope the ad wizards in the boardroom have something figured out.PMA likely decision on the future of the Vancouver Whitecaps.By and large, 2026 looks like a year for quiet fine-tuning before a schedule change. It feels like the stadium standoff in Vancouver iscoming to a head. Will the Whitecaps be around for a fall-to-spring schedule? This writer hopes so, though he can’t afford land in British Columbia.JRMLS’s response to the World Cup. 2026 was meant to be the year of opportunity. The catalyst American soccer had been waiting for. The boom. So now that it’s here, why does it feel so underwhelming? The league is cutting coverage of itself. Broadcast talent has been chopped. Having waited this long for The Big Plan to be presented to us all, it’s now safe to assume there isn’t one.GRThe MVP will be …Lionel Messi. The Argentinian has made the MVP conversation boring from the moment he won it in 2024 despite only appearing in half of Inter Miami’s games. That’s about as big a statistical knock you can count on him taking for something like this, and it didn’t matter. Assuming he stays healthy, he’ll be the first three-time MVP.AASon Heung-min.It feels incredibly dumb to bet against Messi at this point, but watching Son withLos Angeles FCin the back half of 2025 gave me hope that the Argentinian may get a run for his money this year. Messi is also seemingly growing more injury-prone by the minute, which would leave just a bit of daylight for Son to wrap his hands around this award.PMSon Heung-min.There’s potential for voter fatigue on Messi, but if Son (or anyone other challenger) wins MVP, it’ll be entirely deserved. Son projects as more likely to play 30-plus games this year, and he should be front and center for the next era of LAFC. Keep an eye on Cristian Espinoza, one of the league’s best chance creators, who moved from overlooked San Jose to a very strong Nashville side.JRLionel Messi. Even if it shouldn’t be, it’ll be Messi because of the way these things work. The World Cup will probably disrupt his 2026 campaign, but the greatest of all-time remains the best in MLS and a third-straight MVP award will underline that fact.GRView image in fullscreenSon Heung-min could lead Los Angeles FC on a run to the MLS Cup final this season.Photograph: LM Otero/APThe Golden Boot winner will be …Kévin Denkey.The scorer of 15 regular-season goals last year, FC Cincinnati’s Togolese striker has very little internal competition and one of the league’s best playmakers behind him in Evander. If recent transfer interest results in a summer move away, though, I’ll revert to Son.AASon Heung-min.For many of the same reasons he’ll be the league’s MVP. The idea of a full year of Son and Denis Bouanga has me salivating, respectfully, and Messi will probably score fewer goals in a retooled Miami XI that will probably see him sitting a bit deeper.PMSam Surridge. The former Bournemouth striker nearly won this award last year, bagging 24 goals to finish joint-second with Bouanga behind Messi. He’ll enjoy even better service this time around with Espinoza joining Andy Najar along Nashville’s right flank, and his interplay with 2022 MVP Hany Mukhtar is well established at this stage. Helps to play Montréal and DC twice a year, too.JRDenis Bouanga. The World Cup could impact Messi’s output assuming he misses some games over the summer. The same could be true for Son. Bouanga, however, will be World Cup-free and he’s already started fast with a hat-trick in the Concacaf Champions League.GRMLS’s calendar flip is coming.

They could easily have won it last year and still improved on every line. They also have the best 1-2 attacking punch in the league (unless you count Messi + anyone else), and a new coach in Marc Dos Santos who appears willing to let them go out and attack games when needed. Knockout competitions are weird and a lot will happen between now and then, but LAFC seem to have that special something, for now.AAInter Miami.Writing the same thing over and over again is starting to get old. Miami just put together arguablythe most prolific offseason in MLS historyand are fundamentally better at almost every position. This is MLS, and anything can happen, but I’m not betting against the deepest team the league has ever seen.PMIn a rematch of last year’s Leagues Cup final, theSeattle Sounderswill do Sounders things and ramp up to be in peak form come playoff time. With a squad boasting considerable depth and impressive continuity, they’re built to match up against any opponent – and already have beaten Messi’s Miami in one cup final, should he be the final boss in wait.JRInter Miami. Boring, I know. But Inter Miami’s depth might be unlike anything ever seen before in MLS history. They have second- or third-string players who would be stars for other teams. Plus, y’know, that Messi guy. It’s been 12 years since an MLS Cup winner went back-to-back. I predict Inter Miami will do it in 2026.GRView image in fullscreenInter Miami won the Supporters’ Shield last season.Photograph: David Santiago/APThe Supporters’ Shield winner will be …LAFC. I think they’ll get more points overall against the West’s ocean of “meh” than Inter Miami will against the top-heavy East.AAInter Miami.Let’s not waste time here, just see my comments above.PMI have my concerns aboutInter Miami, but even if Messi needs a post-World Cup breather, there’s ample talent for Javier Mascherano’s side to control the proceedings of every match. I don’t see an extension of their 2024 points record, but they’re constructed to reclaim the Shield.JRInter Miami. Doubly boring, but this is a team that plugged all its gaps over the off-season. Inter Miami set a regular-season points record in 2024 with a squad that wasn’t as stacked as this one. Their season won’t be defined by whether or not they win a trophy, but by how many they win.GRThe Wooden Spoon ‘winner’ will be …Sporting Kansas City.It’s hard to predict anything else for a team that had a mere 16 field players (and four goalkeepers) signed to first-team contracts a week before the start of the season. There are a couple decent players in that group, but not nearly enough.AADC United.DC have only marginally improved a roster that was downright unwatchable last season. Led by a journeyman head coach and a first-time sporting director plucked straight from the boardroom, it’s easy to imagine United repeating as bearers of the spoon. If they manage to make the playoffs, they can tape this blurb up in the locker room.PMSporting KC’s issue isn’t just that they lack enough players to field a full squad; it’s that they lack the top-end talent needed to compete in MLS these days. The West’s mid-table teams largely improved this winter, which doesn’t bode well for a team slowly coming together.JRSporting KC. Do they even have a team to field? A rebuild couldn’t come quickly enough after 2025 and David Lee has done a good job of clearing the decks since then, but SKC haven’t gotten round to actually replacing the players they allowed to leave.

I think that could make the end of season and playoffs as unpredictable a period as we’ve ever seen.AAIts lack of an impact.For years, MLS has touted the power of the “World Cup bump,” but none of us have any idea what that even means. The league’s revenues are largely kept under lock and key (as are its TV ratings), which makes it largely impossible to judge any real impact. It’s hard to imagine the tournament changing the league’s fundamental reality in any tangible way.PMMLS has alwaysstruggled to stay front-of-mindduring its regular season, where jeopardy and stakes vary wildly by the matchup.

Arteta recognised his side had played a role in their own downfall against a team with only 10 points but backed them to bounce back against struggling Spurs.Arsenal were described as “bottlers” by some pundits but Arteta said: “It’s not part of my vocabulary and I don’t see it like this because I don’t think anybody wants to do that as an intention. I wouldn’t use that word, but that’s me.“That’s individual opinion, perspective. You have to respect that.That’s what I said afterin the press conference. You lose two points against Wolves in the manner that the game played out, you have to take it on the chin.“What I’m very interested in is the next one, what we are made of, what we love about this and how we write our own destiny from here.”Arteta said the captain, Martin Ødegaard, and Kai Havertz could return from injury against Tottenham and that Bukayo Saka was available after being substituted against Wolves as a precaution. The manager said he had not read his players the riot act after such a disappointing result and had been showing them love.“That’s not a choice I have to make. I love them and that’s it, like my kids, regardless of how. It’s not what I try to give them, it’s what they need. They need the truth. There is a really important diagram: the level of support and the demands you put on them. If you want the demands to be really, really high, the support [has to be] as well. Or it doesn’t work.“Believe me, the demands are super high. They know. They have known for a long time. It’s not going to be an issue. When we haven’t been at our standards, I take full responsibility for that. I don’t think I have ever pointed at a single player or the team. If there is anyone responsible, that’s me.”Arsenal’s technical director, James Ellis, has surprisingly left his post only seven months after being appointed. The 46-year-old joined from Fulham in 2021 and was promoted from his previous position as head of recruitment last summer but will depart as part of ongoing restructuring plans behind the scenes at the Emirates.Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

He offered a curt “100%” in response to questions on his confidence in Spurs’s survival. The Croat’s tenure begins on Sunday with a north London derby at home to the wobbling Premier League leaders, though a lengthy injury list leaves him with only 13 fit senior players.‘Ferryman’ Igor Tudor has the record to steer Tottenham to safetyRead more“What I saw this week was the quality of the players,” said Tudor, contracted until the end of the season afterreplacing the sacked Thomas Franklast weekend. “We have enormous quality in the squad.”A coach presiding over 12 remaining league matches, the Champions League being a lower priority with Spurs five points off the relegation zone, made no promises of living up to the club’s attacking traditions.“When you start pre-season and then you have 50 days in pre-season and you have 20 players, of course then we see the style,” Tudor said. “This is an emergency, an emergency situation, when you need to find fast what suits the 10 plus three players and it’s totally different.”Tudor tries his best to avoid league tables. “When I coach I never watch the classification. Maybe it sounds strange. I don’t watch where we are. It’s a process. If you ask me what we are going to see on Sunday, I believe that we are going to see something concrete, something good that the people will like.”Arsenal have won three from eight league matches in 2026 so Sunday offers Spurs opportunity to sabotage their bitter rivals and forge a path towards safety. Tudor said he had “big respect for [Mikel] Arteta who made an amazing team, one of the best in the world with the style of play and amazing mentality in the team, with 11 players behind the ball, pressing from the back. So it is a big challenge for us. Maybe at the moment it is not the best one but you never know in football.”View image in fullscreenIgor Tudor takes charge of his first game this weekend against Arsenal.Photograph: Chloe Knott/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockTudor pledged his total commitment. “I came here not to visit the city. I have come here to do a job at a very difficult moment for this club. We work every day, like all coaches do. Every day, focus on the work and live it 24/7. Even if you go to the restaurant or a museum, you are thinking about how to make the team play better. It’s a strange job.“This is an era of information. Everybody speaks, everybody has comments, everybody has discussions. Sometimes you can lose yourself in listening to too much information. In my life, generally, especially when I work in a club, I never read nothing in the newspaper, on television, nothing. I just want to focus on this, enjoy this, because to think about other things, what others think about you, can give you nothing.”Alongside Tudor will be Bruno Saltor, a former coach at Brighton, Chelsea and West Ham. Tomislav Rogic, the new goalkeeping coach, and Riccardo Ragnacci, the physical coach, have worked with Tudor on previous assignments.Tudor has his first job in the Premier League having coached four clubs in Serie A plus Marseille, Galatasaray and Hajduk Split. “I believe in Italian coaches,” said the former Juventus and Siena midfielder. “The way I feel is half-Italian, half-Croatian in the way of football education because I played there. Italian football gives you something that maybe some other leagues don’t give you. Of course, tactical preparation and I believe they are the best about mentality things.”Frank failed to get the best out of Tottenham’s squad. Tudor requires a quick fix. “We need to become a team, we need to become a group of the people who are available, who will give something more. Who will not watch themselves, but each other.“I never speak about results. I never speak about what we need to achieve at the end of the season. I don’t believe in this. I believe in today’s training. This is all I want the players to think about.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

I think the more a manager wins, the more aura he has. I don’t know if you agree with Wayne Rooney, by the way, but if this would be the general opinion then I think people would probably tell you last season I had more aura than this season.“But maybe he’s the only one who has this opinion; I don’t know, you tell me. It’s the first time that I heard this but I think it’s fair to say that Jürgen definitely has an aura. I can talk about him, not about myself, but he definitely had that. But a winning manager has an aura as well.”In the reverse fixture three months ago against Forest, then managed by Sean Dyche, Liverpool lost 3-0. At the City Ground Slot will come up against Forest’s fourth head coach of the season, Vítor Pereira. Dyche’s strained relationship with Forest’s players was a key factor in costing him his job, indicating where the balance of power is in the modern game.“I like to do what I’m doing now and that’s enough for me,” Slot said. “It doesn’t matter who’s the most important person or not at the club. I think it’s always the owners, isn’t it? They have to hire the sporting director, they have to hire the head coach. If they make the right decisions then it’s a better chance to be successful.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotWayne RooneynewsShareReuse this content"

Parish is believed to have been disappointed with Glasner’s reaction in Friday’s press conference to preview Sunday’s home game against Wolves when the 51-year-old said he was unsure whether he would see out the season.However, Parish has decided against making an immediate change given the importance of the match against the Premier League’s bottom side with Palace still not clear of relegation trouble and the second leg of their Conference League playoff to come on Thursday.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Another issue is believed to be their reluctance to pay off the remainder of his contract, which is thought to be worth nearly £2m and expires at the end of the season, should he depart early. It remains to be seen whether Glasner – who said “maybe I would sing the same” when asked about fans chanting “you’re getting sacked in the morning” in Bosnia and Herzegovina – sees out the campaign given the animosity towards him after a run of one win in 15 games in all competitions.“Let’s see what the future brings,” he said on Friday. “You never know. I’m always realistic and we’re not in the best moment. I understand and I take responsibility for everything because I’m responsible for the whole team.“Right now, I’m just not good enough to replace the players we sold. I’m just not good enough to integrate the new players in a way to play the same way like we did and I’m not good enough that we can cope with the schedule we had.”Glasner, who ledPalace to the FA Cup last season, their first major trophy, and secured the Community Shield, said: “It’s my responsibility to get the turnaround. I can’t expect [positivity] from the players if I’m not that way. But right now I just can’t do it because it’s how I feel.”Thomas Frank, sacked by Tottenhamlast week, is believed to be a contender to take over in the summer. Palace would also be interested in Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola, whose contract expires at end of June. The former Republic of Ireland forward Robbie Keane, who is managing Ferencvaros, and Rayo Vallecano’s Iñigo Pérez have also been mooted as potential replacements.Palace have been given a £50,000 fine for a banner that appeared in the crowd at Selhurst Park in August, depicting the owner of Nottingham Forest, Evangelos Marinakis.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

They have endured so much misery for so long that even Sunday’s potential relegation-sealing Steel City derby has lost some of its old significance.“If you win it’ll be like kicking a cat,” Dan Fudge, host of the Wednesday Week podcast and YouTube channel says to Nick Wylie from the Sheffield United Way in this week’s broadcast. “We’ve got bigger things to worry about than bragging rights.”Sheffield Wednesday takeover in limbo while EFL checks source of bidders’ fundingRead moreSo how did it come to this? Why are Wednesday, four times English title winners and three times FA Cup winners, staring at a February relegation to League One, at Bramall Lane, this weekend?On a purely statistical level, the title of a recent edition of the Wednesday Til I Die podcast offers a helpful clue: “We scored a goal.” That references Wednesday’s first goal in 11 games. It cameagainst Millwall last Saturday, a game Henrik Pedersen’s young and inexperienced side lost 2-1, in the process suffering a 10th consecutive defeat. Wednesday’s last Championship point was collected on 29 December, in a goalless draw against Blackburn. The season’s sole league triumph, a 2-0 victory at Portsmouth, arrived in September.Such feeble form comes in the context of the off-pitch travails that resulted in Wednesday being docked 12 points for entering administration after their former owner Dejphon Chansiri agreed to end his near 11 years at the helm and sell up in October. A further six points were deducted in December for repeated late payment of wages, leaving Wednesday bottom of the Championship on minus seven points. That sets the scene for an ignominious fall from grace on Sunday, although results elsewhere on Saturday could dictate Wednesday are already down by the time they make the short journey across the city.“From a symbolic viewpoint, it [relegation] happening at Bramall Lane is not something we want, but most fans have been expecting relegation for some time now,” says Steve Chu, secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Supporters’ Trust. “One hundred per cent of the blame [for this] lies at Mr Chansiri’s door. There’s been massive underinvestment in core infrastructure and we’re living with the consequences.”No English Football League club have previously been relegated in February yet this unwanted record, not to mention the indignity of its potential rubber stamping at Bramall Lane, worries Wednesday fans less than the apparent stalling of the club’s long-mooted takeover. A source involved in the due diligence process has said the proposed buyout is in danger of “unravelling”.Chansiri’s decision to sell triggered a two-month auction run by experienced football administrator Begbies Traynor. It announced its recommended preferred bidders on Christmas Eve. Athree-man consortium, comprising the former professional gambler James Bord, German AI entrepreneur Felix Roemer and Jordanian businessman Alsharif Faisal Bin Jamil, is understood to have paid a multimillion pound deposit and agreed a fee in excess of £30m to take control at Hillsborough.View image in fullscreenSheffield Wednesday are closing in on becoming the first English football league club to be relegated in February.Photograph: Harriet Massey/Getty ImagesSignificantly their proposed takeover has still to be ratified by the EFL, with the consortium’s assessment under the mandatory Owners’ and Directors’ Test (ODT) believed to be at an early stage. The EFL was only given written notice of the preferred bidders’ identities on 9 January, and did not receive the first tranche of documentation from the consortium until several weeks later.Last month it was reported that there were concerns theprocess could drag on until the summerdue to queries regarding the consortium’s source of funds. These questions have been magnified by two of the three members possessing backgrounds in the gambling industry. A spokesperson for the bidders has described the offer as “privately funded”.To complicate matters further, the newly formed Independent Football Regulator (IFR) is also conducting inquiries before assuming responsibility for administering the ODT, backed by parliamentary statute in May. A source said that the IFR has reservations about the bidders but there are also concerns about a lack of viable alternatives.The administrator warns that, without a sale, Wednesday will be declared bankrupt. That would place the prospect of their involvement in League One next season in serious jeopardy. Thankfully the club have sufficient funding to complete this season after offloading the talismanic Barry Bannan to Millwall in January, when they also received £500,000 from Chelsea for 17-year-old defender Yisa Alao.While Begbies held serious talks with at least six interested parties during the auction period, including the former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, Bord’s consortium submitted by far the biggest bid. No losing bidder appears keen to return to the negotiating table. The investment required to upgrade Hillsborough is believed to have concerned several, with one saying that renovating the dilapidated stadium would cost £85m and upgrading the training ground a further £15m.Pedersen, promoted from assistant manager when Danny Röhl departed last July, wants new practice pitches. “We need to move the ball quickly so we can challenge the brain and technique of opponents,” he says. “But we can’t play quickly on our training pitch.” Chris Wilder, his playoff-chasing counterpart from across town, remains unmoved. “There’s sympathy for people who haven’t been paid,” he says. “But football’s a ruthless business. There’s a lot on the line for us, too.”Although Begbies remains confident Wednesday’s sale will be eventually completed, four months in administration tells its own story. “It’s taking time but we’d rather proper due diligence is done,” says Chu. “Wednesday’s still a big club with incredible support but we’ve been out of the Premier League for 26 years and this decision needs to be right.”Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Behind them, Bobby’s bar is bustling and above the club logo on a wall behind one of the goals are four unmissable words: “If I can dream …” Helping to manifest that dream is the shiny Women’s FA Cup trophy, temporarily on display in the boardroom. The group of players who have just finished a day’s work are about to begin their training session at 8.30pm.Chatham Town Women, the lowest-ranked side in the fifth round of the Women’s FA Cup and one of only two sides remaining from below the second tier, are preparing for the game of their lives, against big-spending Birmingham City at St Andrew’s on Saturday, live on television, vying for a place in the quarter-finals. Chatham cover their players’ expenses but do not pay football salaries, unlike their full-time opponents.Controversial Women’s FA Cup plans on hold after pushback from clubs, players and fansRead moreChatham, who play in the fourth tier, entered the competition in the third qualifying round in September and have won five ties, two on penalties away to third-tier opponents, AFC Wimbledon and Exeter City.The run has earned the Kent club £107,000 in prize money and they will get another £20,000 if they lose on Saturday, or £80,000 if they can stun Birmingham. Chatham’s manager, Keith Boanas, estimates that the £107,000 “sustains and helps build the women’s game here for at least the next two to three years”.The prize pot is vastly different from the £5,000 reward that went to the Cup winners in 2005 when Boanas managed Charlton to glory. He led the club to the final four times between 2003 and 2007, including three in a row that culminated with their victory, when an 18-year-old Eni Aluko’s goal gave a Charlton side that also included the Canada head coach, Casey Stoney, and the club’s current manager, Karen Hills, a 1-0 win over Everton.View image in fullscreenChatham Town have two training nights a week and do not pay their players. Saturday’s opponents are full-time footballers.Photograph: Rachel O’Sulllivan/The GuardianBoanas’s assistant that day at Upton Park was Matt Beard, the former Liverpool, Chelsea and West Ham manager who died last September at the age of 47. It is clear Beard has been in Boanas’s thoughts through this Cup run.“I do look to the side of me when I’m on the touchlines sometimes – I feel him there,” says a visibly emotional Boanas, before taking a deep breath and having to pause his answer. He later says: “When we won with Charlton, I collapsed on my knees and looked up, at that time, to my mum. This time, if we win on Saturday, I’d say: ‘Cheers, Beardy.’”The duo were great friends and what Boanas and Beard achieved together has granted Boanas the deep respect of his squad. Chatham’s former England youth defender Ellie Perkins, who had a spell at Arsenal, says of Boanas: “He’s so full of wisdom, expertise, experience, and I think everyone here just absorbs that from him. Everything he says, take it on board, because he’s been there and done it. So we get behind every decision he makes.”Quick GuideSkinner delighted Cup overhaul on holdShowThe Manchester United head coach, Marc Skinner, said it was \"great news\" that the Football Association hasput the brakes on plansto make radical changes to the Women's FA Cup, such as seeding the top teams. He thinks big teams going head-to-head in earlier rounds is good for the competition.United travel to face the holders, Chelsea, in the fifth round on Sunday, a repeat of last year's final. The tie that would not have been possible  next season before the semi-finals under proposals put forward by the Football Association, which were due to go to the FA board in April. But the Guardian revealed on Thursday that the FA, after receiving negative feedback, has extended the consultation period and there will be no changes to the format until at least 2027-28.“Great news, great news,\" Skinner said. \"We play one of the best teams in English history on Sunday in an early round, but that’s the draw, that’s the beauty of the game. I watch competitions because there’s an element of luck. For us to play Chelsea is rough luck but it’s part of the game and it allows the beauty of the Cup.”An FA spokesperson told the Guardian: “While we will continue to review the Women’s FA Cup and the ways it can evolve, we have listened to the feedback and no changes will be implemented for the 2026-27 season. We understand how much the competition means to clubs, players and fans across the pyramid, and it is important that all parties have enough time to share their views. As a result, we will be extending the consultation phase to allow for further engagement informed by the questions and comments raised.”Tom GarryWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Perkins, who works as an estate agent, says Chatham will try to keep everything as “normal as possible” this week. “We’re anticipating them being that bit more athletic, that bit faster, that bit stronger than us, just because they have the facility to do this as a day job,” she says of Birmingham. “For us it’s a case of doing your nine-to-five through the week, getting home from work quickly, getting your Chatham clothes on, having a quick dinner and getting straight back in the car to go to training. So we’ve got to try and do what we can from the mental and technical side of the game.”There have been many heroines during this Cup run, such as the midfielder Elle Jeffkins, who has scored from outside the box four times, and the goalkeeper Simone Eligon, a Trinidad and Tobago international, who has made shootout saves. In the league, they are mixing it with bigger-name clubs such as Fulham and Norwich towards the top of the Women’s National League Division One South East and sit fourth.View image in fullscreenChatham Town’s co-captain Grace Coombs says the Cup run has brought the players closer together.Photograph: Rachel O’Sulllivan/The GuardianThe co-captain Grace Coombs says of the Cup run: “It’s brought us closer together every single game. Our [fourth-round] win here was absolutely amazing – that feeling was probably one of the best feelings of the girls’ careers.”Coombs, who works in project management for the NHS, says: “My job is not as physical as a lot of the other players’ are, and I don’t have a long commute or a long route to training compared to some of the others, who have it a lot harder than me. We have two training nights a week and then we get ourselves to the gym and do workouts around our work schedule. We’ve got great resources here that we can tap into but it’s in our own time around our schedules. You make it work because you love it.”About 200 fans are expected to travel to Birmingham for a game shown on TNT Sports 1 & discovery+. It would have been significantly more but for the men’s team having a home fixture on the same day. The excitement around this community club, sandwiched between Rochester and Gillingham, the town whose name this team carried until a rebrand in 2023, is clear. Before training the players gather excitedly for selfies with the trophy, while the staff lay out the cones on one half of the pitch, with the men’s team training in the other half.Boanas’s wife, the former England goalkeeper Pauline Cope-Boanas, a police officer, has been helping with goalkeeper coaching when time allows. Her husband, 66, is juggling an extensive list of other football roles on top of managing Chatham, including coaching boys via a Millwall community project, coaching the England colleges national side and the English Universities women’s side (both voluntarily), tutoring coaches doing their Uefa B and C licences and being president of the Surrey Football Coaches Association. “I should be retired,” he says, chuckling.View image in fullscreenKeith Boanas holds a variety of coaching roles in addition to managing Chatham.Photograph: Rachel O’Sulllivan/The GuardianHe has taken charge of the Estonia women’s national side and clubs such as Watford and Millwall Lionesses and he says this run with Chatham makes him almost as proud as winning the Cup with Charlton.“Even getting this far has come really close to that,” he says. “I mean that, genuinely. I was a little bit unwell a couple of weeks ago because I had kidney stones. I think if we win on Saturday, you’ll probably need the ambulance at St Andrew’s to come and pick me up off the pitch for different reasons.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is one of six Britons who could do battle when AS Trencin host Zemplin Michalovce on Saturday in a battle of eighth v sixth in the Slovakian top flight.Trencin have Goss, Roshaun Mathurin, a graduate of Tottenham’s academy, and Cody David, who went through the ranks at Everton. Zemplin’s squad includes two players who started at Arsenal, Kido Taylor-Hart and Ben Cottrell, and Kai Brosnan, who had played non-league football until joining them last summer. There are further British links at Trencin because Markus Poom, the son of the former Estonia goalkeeper Mart, was born in Derby.“I always wanted to play abroad,” says Goss, who spent 18 months in Greece before moving to Trencin, one of Europe’s capitals of culture this year. “When I was at United a lot of coaches and players always used to tell me it would suit me a lot more. When I got older when I was training with the first team, there were players telling me that as well.”View image in fullscreenSean Goss spent 18 months in Greece before moving to Trencin.Photograph: AS TrenčínIn a post-Brexit world, it is more difficult for British players to find work abroad but opportunities remain. Meeting employment thresholds in the Netherlands and Belgium has become problematic but the requirements in eastern Europe are often lower, making it easier to obtain work permits in countries such as Slovakia.Taylor-Hart had a brief spell in Greece with PAS Giannina after being released by Arsenal before he headed to Slovakia. He was able to get advice from Cottrell, a former Arsenal teammate. “Not that I wasn’t looking in England but I was mainly asking agents or agents were coming to me with more abroad options,” Taylor-Hart says. “I’m not saying that it’s a step back, but sometimes you’ve got to go to a lower level and get your playing time. It’s not that I fell out of love with the game, but just found that love for the game again.”The opportunity for development in Slovakia makes it an attractive proposition. The average age of Trencin’s squad is 23 and Goss, at 30, is a guide there. Clubs in Slovakia are operating smarter and bringing in youngsters from all over the world, offering them the chance to test themselves in a first division, including against teams playing in Uefa competitions. Last weekend Trencin beat Slovan Bratislava, who have won the league seven times in a row, away from home. In January they sold the 19-year-old Suleman Sani to RB Leipzig for a fee that could rise to €6m (£5.24m) and Damir Redzic left another Slovakian club, DAC 1904, for RB Salzburg for €5m.View image in fullscreenCody David is with Trencin after being part of the academy at Everton and playing elsewhere in England and Scotland.Photograph: AS Trenčín“I’ve never seen a club give opportunities to young players like this club has,” says Goss. “In England, you come in and if you’re not doing the business then you’re out, whereas at Trencin they give them a lot of games and time to settle. You can see them building every week with their performance … With the rumours we heard about who was watching Sani, they have the opportunities and they are in the shop window every week.”Young British players are becoming more open-minded about what is available abroad. They are brought up in academies that implement a style reflected across Europe but not in the English lower leagues. Phones mean they have easy access to information about the game in other countries and how compatriots have fared.Brosnan was at part-time Hemel Hempstead Town in National League South last season, while working as a recruitment consultant. After half a year with Zemplin he is being tipped as someone who could earn a move.Taylor-Hart says: “Playing in a league like this, or surrounding areas, is a fast track. I feel like there’s moves you can get from Slovakia that you can’t get from Leagues One and Two, even though the level might be similar.”View image in fullscreenZemplin Michalovce’s Ben Cottrell is, like Kido Taylor-Hart, an Arsenal academy graduate.Photograph: MFK Zemplín MichalovceDropping down the leagues in England is regarded as the natural route to first-team football but players enter a world of grind, regularly playing twice a week. A league campaign in Slovakia consists of 32 games, allowing more rest and a greater chance to be coached, and facing teams who play in Europe is preferable for some to Tuesday nights in the EFL.Heading to places such as Slovakia is never likely to be motivated by money. Players can make a comfortable living but it is a career decision, thinking more long-term, that takes players to Europe. It is not a coincidence that clubs are targeting Britons for their attributes, attitude and education. Previously British footballers were not regarded as good travellers but that label is being eroded.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Brazilian praised Pereira for creating “magic” despite having only three training sessions. Murillo said the Portuguese head coach, who has a contract until 2027, had transformed the spirit within an underperforming squad. The 57-year-old, who rescued Wolves last season, is Forest’s fourth head coach of the season.“Four managers, four different ideas, it’s difficult,” Murillo said. “But I think Vítor is going to stay with us until the end of the season and he can give his idea to overcome the bad moment that we were going through. Now I think it is the light at the end of the tunnel.“The gaffer passed to us this confidence. I think the winning spirit we had last season has come back. Everyone knows we have a good team, good attack, young players, we had a lot of things to improve and I think with Vítor we’re going to do a good job and go back towards the top of the table.”View image in fullscreenMurillo challenges Fenerbahce’s Sidiki Cherif (right) for possession during Nottingham Forest’s victory in Istanbul on Thursday.Photograph: Emrah Gürel/APSeveral Forest players grew tired of Sean Dyche’s methods across his 114 days in charge, and Dyche’s predecessor, Ange Postecoglou, lasted only 40. Nuno Espírito Santo, who led the club into Europe for the first time since 1995-96, was sacked in August.Forest host Liverpool on Sunday after one league win in five matches. Forest head into the weekend 17th, three points above West Ham, who occupy the final relegation place.“We have to keep working hard, that’s the main point, run a lot, more communication inside the pitch,” Murillo said. “We did this [against Fenerbahce]. Believing in his [Pereira’s] work is most important. We had some problems with the last gaffers but now we have to keep looking forward and grab his idea so that we can come back towards the top again.”Morgan Gibbs-White praised Pereira for immediately fostering an identity, a sentiment echoed by Murillo. “The most important thing is we’ve got his idea. Before the game he had everybody together, all the players, staff, physios. That is the most important thing. It makes the team stronger. It is just the beginning but I think he will do a great job.”Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s nice to be back with positive vibes, we’ve got lots to look forward to and lots of decisions to make.“One thought this would tell us roughly what we would do and this does open up a lot of doors, doesn’t it? We have to think long and hard. It would be lovely to say ‘We will do this’, but I don’t think we can at the minute.”Michael Buckley, Constitution Hill’s owner, has suffered more than anyone as a horse who was already established as one of the finest hurdlers of all time has had a series of setbacks. The possibility of Constitution Hill running on the Flat at all would have been unthinkable just 11 months ago, when he went to post as the 1-2 favourite for the Champion Hurdle.After afall at the fifth at Cheltenham, his career has lurched from one disappointment to the next, culminating in athird fall in four starts in Newcastle’s Fighting Fifth Hurdlein November. That early exit, at the second flight after taking off too early at the first, suggested that the nine-year-old had lost all confidence in his ability to get from one side of an obstacle to another.“It sounds a silly thing to say after what’s happened in the last year,” Buckley said, “but we’ve always known he was special. And I think with all the problems and heartbreaks we’ve had, now everybody knows how special he is. He’s a nine-year-old horse, but he sure is good.”View image in fullscreenOisin Murphy was motionless in the saddle as Constitution Hill strode away to victory at Southwell in his first Flat race.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAConstitution Hill had drifted in the betting in the days running up to Friday’s race, but he set off as the 6-4 favourite after a rush of money in the hours beforehand and was roared to victory by a near-record crowd for an evening meeting at Southwell.The same fixture 12 months ago drew just 320 spectators, but there were 3,520 racegoers on Friday, as confirmed fans eager for a glimpse of Constitution Hill were joined by a large contingent from the “Invades” initiative, there as part of racing’s new Friday Night Live programme to attract a younger audience to the sport.The bumper crowd and the jubilant reception for Constitution Hill as he returned after his facile success was a huge vindication for Southwell’s decision to create the £40,000 event for novices, following a suggestion by Henderson that Constitution Hill could benefit from a spin on the Flat after his latest setback at Newcastle.There were fears earlier in the week, when the big purse attracted a bumper entry including a runner from Willie Mullins’ yard in Ireland and several from top Flat stables, that Constitution Hill would be balloted out, and his place in the lineup was confirmed only on Wednesday morning.“Putting on that prize money made the race far too competitive for my liking, with all these fancy Flat horses turning up,” Henderson said. “But what can you say, he was unbelievable.”Kdeux Saint Fray can put a dent in Mullins’ Kempton recordWith pre-Cheltenham purdah fast approaching, the Ladbrokes Trophy Handicap Chase at Kempton on Saturday could well be the most competitive betting heat for the next two and a half weeks and Emmet Mullins’ decision to field two runners in the 13-strong field adds a further layer of complexity to the puzzle.Mullins has a well-earned reputation for sliding contenders into handicaps at Cheltenham and Aintree on very competitive marks, but his Kempton record – three wins from five runners – is not too shabby either.Eight of those 10 winners set off as favourite, so money for either Rising Dust – three-from-three over fences and with the champion jockey, Sean Bowen, booked to ride – or Chance Another One, a course-and-distance winner in November, would be significant.As things stand, though, neither Rising Dust nor Chance Another One is an obvious blot on the handicap, and even the unbeaten Rising Dust is making a big jump in class after an 11lb rise in the weights.Several rivals have very similar claims on the book, including last year’s 15-length winner, Katate Dori, and the ultra-consistent Hoe Joly Smoke, but neither makes as much appeal as the progressive six-year-oldKdeux Saint Fray(3.35), at around 7-1.Kdeux Saint Fray was five lengths behind Jordans Cross at Cheltenham last month but finished with running left after getting caught behind a tiring rival at a vital stage.

The governing body has decided not to take any action other than to remind Ratcliffe of his responsibilities when taking part in media interviews.Ratcliffe did offer a qualified apology, saying he was sorry if his “choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe”.Earlier, Michael Carrick refused to comment directly on Ratcliffe’s claims but insisted that Manchester United stand for diversity and respect. “Sir Jim made his statement and the club made a statement on the back of it,” United’s interim manager said. “It is not my place to add to that. Enough has been said in that regard.”Carrick then spoke about his 12 years as a United player and previous three as a coach. “I have been around this club many years and we always make a huge impact globally and we are really responsible for that,” he said. “Throughout the years, as a player and member of staff and as a supporter, we are really proud of the environment and culture we’ve got at the club.“Equality and diversity and respect for each other is something we look to carry through every day. I have travelled the world and know what this club means to an awful lot of people.  I am fully aware of the responsibility and we try to carry that out every day. I am proud of what the club stands for and has done for so long.”United travel to Everton for Monday’s 8pm kick-off, havingdrawn 1-1 at West Hamin their last league outing.Jamie Jackson2.Mourinho made ‘huge mistake’ – KompanyJosé Mourinho made a “huge mistake”in his post-match commentsfollowing alleged racist abuse of the Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior, believes the Bayern Munich head coach, Vincent Kompany.The Brazilian reported an instance of alleged racial abuse to the referee François Letexier after scoring in Tuesday’s Champions League playoff tie against Benfica, with the Spanish club later singling out Gianluca Prestianni as the subject of the complaint. Prestianni denied making racist comments in a post on Instagram, while his club spoke of a “defamation campaign” against him. Letexier activated anti-racism protocols, suspending play for 10 minutes, and Uefa has initiated an investigation into the incident.Mourinho, the Benfica head coach, was criticised for his post-match comments, saying that “something happens, always” in matches where Vinícius plays.Kompany, the former Manchester City defender and Burnley manager, addressed the issue before Bayern’s Bundesliga match against Eintracht Frankfurt, and issued an impassioned defence of Vinícius, stressing his reaction “cannot be faked”.View image in fullscreenVincent Kompany backed Real Madrid’s Vinícius Júnior, stressing his reaction ‘cannot be faked’.Photograph: S Mellar/FC Bayern/Getty Images“For me, even worse, is what happens after the game,” said Kompany, who recalled his own experiences of racism as a young player which included Real Betis fans “doing monkey chants” at him and his then Anderlecht teammate Cheick Tioté.“After the game, you have the leader of an organisation, José Mourinho, who basically attacks the character of Vinícius Júnior by bringing in the type of celebration to discredit what Vinícius is doing in this moment. For me, in terms of leadership, it is a huge mistake. It is something we should not accept. I am very clear on that.“The one thing you can’t do is dismiss a person and attack the character of a person who’s complaining about something he experienced and something that must be very painful to that person. There is something that needs to happen.”Kompany added: “I know 100 people who have worked with José Mourinho. I have never heard a person say anything bad about José. I understand he is fighting for his team and his club. You cannot be a bad person and have all the ex-players you have had talk so positively about you. I don’t need to judge him as a person but I know what I have heard and I understand maybe what he has done, but he has made a mistake.”The Brazilian football confederation meanwhile has written to Uefa and Fifa stressing the need to “identify and punish” anyone guilty of racially abusing Vinícius. It has been reported that the Uefa inquiry, headed up by an ethics and disciplinary investigator, could take up to three weeks to conclude. That means Vinícius and Prestianni could come face to face again in the second leg of the playoff at the Bernabéu on Wednesday with the case still unresolved.PA Media3.Guardiola: City rushed Rodri back too soonPep Guardiola has admitted Manchester City rushed Rodri back into action too soon after a cruciate ligament injury. The midfielder has struggled to rediscover his best form, hindered by further injuries.The Spaniard’s performances have improved of late, helped by greater support in midfield. Rodri, who was charged with misconduct by the Football Association for comments after the draw at Tottenham, remains available for Saturday’s visit of Newcastle.“In our desire to get him back, we came back too early and that’s why it took longer [to find form],” Guardiola said. “It’s a good lesson. There are players that can recover earlier, like Bernardo [Silva] for example, or Phil [Foden]. And others need more time. He needed proper time to recover. He’s a special player.”Rodri sustained his knee injury against Arsenal in September 2024 and did not feature until the final game of that season. He then played at the Club World Cup, where he had a setback. The 29-year-old, who has 18 months on his contract, has missed 28 games through injury this season.Guardiola is eager for Rodri to extend his stay. “I would love it desperately,,” he said. “A player like he is, as much age as he has, he’s wiser, understands the game more. There are players that are defined on the bigger stages, in the difficulties and Rodri is one of them.”Guardiola is boosted by the return of Erling Haaland and Savinho as City look to close the gap to the leaders, Arsenal, who play Tottenham on Sunday, to two points. Arsenal drew at Wolves on Wednesday, meaning City will be champions if they win their remaining games, including against the Gunners at the Etihad Stadium in April.“Arsenal dropped points but they can win a lot of games in a row,” Guardiola said. “That’s why my focus is not to change. If we win these 12 games we will be champions; it’s good news, but who knows? I could not assure you in the past when it happened against Jürgen [Klopp], both teams winning a lot of games.”Will Unwin4.Howe happy with Gordon’s selfish streakEddie Howe has told the in-form Anthony Gordon to carry on being selfish following his Champions League heroics in Qarabag. The 24-year-old England forwardplundered four goals inWednesday’s 6-1 playoff first-leg victory in Baku to take his tally in this season’s competition to 10, making the most of his deployment as a central frontman.He completed his haul with a second penalty at the Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium, having waved away exhortations from his captain, Kieran Trippier, to allow Nick Woltemade to take it, just as Alan Shearer had done to the youngster Paul Robinson as he scored five in an 8-0 Premier League victory against Sheffield Wednesday in September 1999.View image in fullscreenAnthony Gordon hammers home his fourth goal in Wednesday’s one-sided victory.Photograph: Firudin Salimov/Sports Press Pho/ShutterstockAsked if he wanted Gordon to have a selfish streak, Newcastle’s head coach said: “There were really big positives to take from that incident. Moments like that get blown out of all proportion, it was a very minor issue. It was great from Anthony that he’s got that strong enough resolve that he wants to score in every moment – and you’d want that from any player – so I’ve got no issue with him.“I’ve got no issue with Kieran also, trying to think of the team and trying to lead in his way and be the aspiring leader that he is in every moment. I actually thought it was a real positive on all sides. The good thing is we scored the penalty, so that in itself is another positive. I think it showed that all the players care and we want to do well.”PA Media5.Moyes set for season’s toughest runDavid Moyes wants to use the most difficult spell of Everton’s season to prove they are a club who have put relegation worries behind them and can challenge for Europe. Monday’s visit of Manchester United starts a spell of nine matches in which they face five of the current top six – there are other games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City – plus Newcastle.The team head into the weekend in eighth on 37 points, only five points behind their Merseyside neighbours in sixth, and Moyes has no worries about avoiding the drop. “This time last year, the nine games I had to play I’d have been saying; ‘My goodness, how am I going to get any wins to stay in the Premier League?’” the manager said.“I think we’ve probably got over that completely and the challenge now is, can we change mentality? Can we change the whole direction we are going in so we’re not going to be that team any more. At the moment we are in a batch of big games. We have got everyone fit bar Jack Grealish so we’re probably in as good a physical shape [as possible], as far as that goes.“We have a bit of disruption with game times, in terms of when we’re playing. We might have 10 or 12 days off and then we might have three games in eight days so we haven’t a particularly consistent calendar but we’ve certainly got hard games to come.”PA Media6.Emery still wants to be No 1Unai Emery says Aston Villa are still dreaming of winning the Premier League. Villa were in the thick of the title race after a brilliant run before Christmas in which they beat Arsenal and Manchester City. They have stuttered since but could move to within five points of the Gunners if they beat Leeds on Saturday.“Of course, we are feeling so, so comfortable, third in the league,” Emery said. “We are so, so happy but we know we must be so, so demanding to keep it and to dream. To dream in football, and to dream expecting to achieve something important, is very important as well, and to have this objective or this motivation I like a lot.“Of course, if we are winning tomorrow we are closer with Arsenal but how they are performing, how they are showing everybody their power, not only Premier League. Of course they draw against Wolverhampton but Wolverhampton is a good team and we beat them here but we struggled a lot, and we are playing next week against them, it’s a good example.“And in the Champions League, how they are performing and winning matches, I think the power they have now and the favourites they are now, Arsenal, no doubt. And then it’s City. City always is performing fantastic and being so, so consistent.”PA Media7.Murillo has faith in Pereira’s survival skillsMurillo says there is “light at the end of the tunnel” as Nottingham Forest began life under Vítor Pereira in style. The defender was on the scoresheet along with Igor Jesus and Morgan Gibbs-Whiteas they thumped Fenerbahce3-0 in the Europa League playoff round first leg.Pereira is the fourth manager of the season, following in the footsteps of Nuno Espírito Santo, Ange Postecoglou and Sean Dyche, and Murillo says it has been a challenging season. However he is confident Pereira, the former Wolves manager, can keep them up.“We know how difficult it is because four managers, four different ideas, it’s difficult,” said the Brazilian before Sunday’s visit of Liverpool. “But now I think Vítor is going to stay with us until the end of the season and I think he can give his idea to overcome the bad moment that we were going through. Now I think it is the light at the end of the tunnel. We can see it. I think just believing in him is important.“We have to keep working hard, that’s the main point, run a lot, more communication inside the pitch. We did this [at Fenerbahce]. Believing in his work is most important. We had some problems with the last gaffers but now we have to keep looking forward and grab his [Pereira’s] idea so that we can come back towards the top again.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedThe talkJim RatcliffePep GuardiolaJosé MourinhonewsShareReuse this content"

Yeah, we’re a very disappointed group.”Neither could Zampa be consoled by his player-of-the-match award as he scolded himself his own part in the early exit.“To be honest with you, mate, it’s been a rough few days,” he said. “There’s a few quiet voices around the team at the moment. Looking back, I think I could have done more in the Sri Lanka game.’View image in fullscreenOman’s Shafiq Jan is bowled by Australia’s Adam Zampa.Photograph: Ishara S Kodikara/AFP/Getty ImagesAustralia, already beaten by Zimbabwe and co-hosts Sri Lanka, had never lost to an Associate nation in T20 cricket, and from the first ball, set out their stall to at least ensure they were spared that indignity.With Marsh having opted to field first, Xavier Bartlett’s first delivery was a superb inswinger that smacked into the leg-stump of Aamir Kaleem via a faint inside edge and it set the tone for Australia.Zampa’s 20 balls of legspin proved too troublesome for the Omani batters as he ran through the middle-order and was helped by the excellent Bartlett (2-27 off his four overs) while Glenn Maxwell made up for a dropped slip catch off Bartlett in the opening over to chip in with 2-13.Nathan Ellis (1-14) and Marcus Stoinis (1-16) both grabbed a wicket each before Marsh then went to work mercilessly, crashing 14 runs off the first over to set his stall and mowing seven fours and four sixes in all during his 33-ball assault.Oman, utterly outclassed, still enjoyed the most comically heartwarming moment when 38-year-old left-armer Shakeel Ahmed caused Travis Head to miscue after he had raced to 32 off 19 balls and raced wildly to take the caught-and-bowled, even barging wicketkeeper Vinayak Shukla out of the way to enjoy his moment of glory.Marsh’s side ended up finishing third in their group, the first time they’ve been eliminated in the prelims of a global event for 17 years. It left Marsh to reflect: “We’ll look at it as players and as a team to ensure, if we’re lucky enough to have the opportunity as a group again, that we’re better.“When you fail, there’s always great learnings. We couldn’t be more disappointed in the way that it’s panned out – but we go home and we reflect and move on.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026Australia cricket teamOman cricket teamTwenty20T20 World CupCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

They crowded around a big screen with eyes locked on Team USA – and on one of their own, Cleveland Heights native Laila Edwards. For once, the tension in the room wasn’t the familiar Cleveland sports dread. It was the kind that comes with watching a home town kid play for something bigger.Still, the old reflex surfaced when Team USA fell behind to Canada early, and stayed behind deep into the game. Cleveland knows heartbreak, the kind that defined the city for decades before theNBA’s Cavaliers broke through in 2016.Then the room flipped.USA roar back from brink to beat Canada in overtime and claim Olympic women’s ice hockey goldRead moreTeam USA tied it late on a goal set up by Edwards,then won it 2-1 in overtime. People leapt to their feet, shouting and hugging as if the moment belonged to all of them.“My heart is pounding,” said Dena Bufford, a Cleveland Heights resident. “I’m so excited for the team, but to be able to watch the victory as it happened and for this to happen for one of our locals is just phenomenal. My mind is blown. This is awesome.”On the screen, the Americans poured off the bench. The folks at the community center stood, cheered, and chanted “U-S-A, U-S-A”. A few kids ran around the rink.To the people in the room, it wasn’t just Team USA winning. It was about Cleveland Heights – a suburb of about 40,000 that prides itself on being tight-knit and diverse – taking a lap with them.“This city shows up,” said Jessica Schantz, the director of communications for Cleveland Heights. “It’s absolutely thrilling. The pride that Laila’s hard work has evolved in people is immense. We’ve been promoting these watch parties and sending her love through social media. The amount of comments and likes we’ve been getting is more than we’ve had. The engagement – the sense of pride that has blanketed the city – it’s a lot of good will.”That pride has been building for months, long before the gold medal came down to one overtime winner. Edwards’s Olympic run turned into a shared project back home. Ahead of the Games, a GoFundMe helped her family cover travel costs. And in a twist that only made the story feel bigger,a major contributioncame from Cleveland Heights natives Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs and his brother Jason Kelce, the former Philadelphia Eagles center, who had already celebrated Edwards when she became the first Black woman to represent the US women’s hockey team.In Cleveland Heights, the Kelce donation landed like a signal flare: people outside the city were paying attention, too. But nobody inside the watch party treated it like a miracle. They treated it like confirmation.“No one from Cleveland Heights was surprised with the outpouring of support,” Schantz said. “We have a lot of engaged residents that won’t sit in their house and not engage.”The community center was an example of that pride and love. It was just after 1pm. On Thursday, the place brought not just retirees with flexible schedules, but also families, kids, and working people carving out time to be there. They not only came for Team USA. They came for Edwards, who began playing hockey at the age of 4 in the Cleveland Heights Youth Hockey program. She was motivated by her father, who played in high school. She’d develop into an elite player, which led her to the University of Wisconsin. She has won two titles there.Cleveland Heights mayor Jim Petras was pleased with the results for Edwards and his city.“So much energy in this city,” Petras said afterward. “It made its way across the country. Can’t be more proud of her.”Petras said the city plans to celebrate Edwards with a parade in April after her college season ends.Winter Olympics 2026: Norway break own record for golds won in single Games after biathlon triumph – liveRead moreIris Williams, who sat in the front row, tried to put words to what it felt like to experience a Cleveland sports moment without the usual dread attached to it.“So many times in Cleveland sports it’s maybe next time and how hard they tried,” Williams said. “But not this time. It’s a solid win heard around the world.”For Bufford, the moment hit on two levels at once: home town pride and something deeper.“I’m over 60 years old and I’m inspired,” she said. “Talking about the discipline, the vision – it inspires me to be physically active and supportive of what young folks can do. The sky’s the limit.”She connected Edwards’s rise to her own memories of breaking barriers. “I was one of the first Black cheerleaders in my high school,” Bufford said. “I remember how my parents were so proud. My school was proud. It’s just a wonderful feeling to be put in position to inspire someone else.”Then she said the part that several people in the room nodded at, almost instinctively: the historical weight of this, happening right now, in public, on the biggest stage.“What Laila is doing for hockey … it’s 2026,” Bufford said. “To be the first Black [woman on the US team] – and she won a gold medal. I’m elated for her family and how she represents and inspires our community. And it’s Black History Month too? This is a time when we really need encouragement. Our ancestors are celebrating. I’m just so happy.”As the crowd filtered out, several fans replayed the moment to each other, swapping details, telling kids to remember what they saw, and texting friends who couldn’t make it.“People know she grew up here,” Schantz said. “They know her story. They know her family. This is what Cleveland Heights does.”On Thursday afternoon, they did it again – together, on a random weekday, for a gold medal, and for a home town name that suddenly belongs to the world.Explore more on these topicsUSA ice hockey teamWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsIce hockeyUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Mind says it will aim to shape a safer digital mental health ecosystem, with strong regulation, standards and safeguards.Google AI Overviews put people at risk of harm with misleading health adviceRead moreThe launch comes after the Guardian revealed how people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews. The AI-generated summaries are shown to 2 billion people a month, and appear above traditional search results on the world’s most visited website.After the reporting, Googleremoved AI Overviewsfor some but not all medical searches. Dr Sarah Hughes, chief executive officer of Mind, said “dangerously incorrect” mental health advice was still being provided to the public. In the worst cases, the bogus information could put lives at risk, she said.Hughes said: “We believe AI has enormous potential to improve the lives of people with mental health problems, widen access to support, and strengthen public services. But that potential will only be realised if it is developed and deployed responsibly, with safeguards proportionate to the risks.“The issues exposed by the Guardian’s reporting are among the reasons we’re launching Mind’s commission on AI and mental health, to examine the risks, opportunities and safeguards needed as AI becomes more deeply embedded in everyday life.“We want to ensure that innovation does not come at the expense of people’s wellbeing, and that those of us with lived experience of mental health problems are at the heart of shaping the future of digital support.”Google has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.But the Guardian found some AI Overviews served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. The investigation uncovered false and misleading medical advice across a range of issues, including cancer, liver disease and women’s health, as well as mental health conditions.Experts said some AI Overviews for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”.Google is also downplaying safety warnings that its AI-generated medical advice may be wrong,the Guardian found.Hughes said vulnerable people were being served “dangerously incorrect guidance on mental health”, including “advice that could prevent people from seeking treatment, reinforce stigma or discrimination and in the worst cases, put lives at risk”.She added: “People deserve information that is safe, accurate and grounded in evidence, not untested technology presented with a veneer of confidence.”Quick GuideContact Andrew Gregory about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Andrew using one of the following methods.The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

She said: “Users had a good chance of clicking through to a credible health website that answered their query, and then went further – offering nuance, lived experience, case studies, quotes, social context and an onward journey to support.“AI Overviews replaced that richness with a clinical-sounding summary that gives an illusion of definitiveness. They give the user more of one form of clarity (brevity and plain English), while giving them less of another form of clarity (security in the source of the information, and how much to trust it). It’s a very seductive swap, but not a responsible one.”A Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.“For queries where our systems identify a person might be in distress, we work to display relevant, local crisis hotlines.

But as headlines mounted abouttech layoffsand AI’s potential toreplace entry-level coders, he began to question whether that path would actually lead to a job.When the 20-year-old interviewed for a datacenter technician role that June and never heard back, his doubts deepened. In December, Ramirez decided on what he thought was a safer bet: turning away from computer science entirely. He dropped his planned major to instead apply to nursing school. He comes from a family of nurses, and sees the field as more stable and harder to automate than coding.“Even though AI might not be at the point where it will overtake all these entry-level jobs now, by the time I graduate, it likely will,” Ramirez said.Ramirez is not alone in reshaping his career out of anxiety over AI. As students like him arereconsidering their majorsover concerns that AI may disrupt their employment prospects, more established workers – some with decades of experience – are rethinking their trajectories because they’re encountering AI at work and share the same unease. Some workers are eschewing it entirely; others are embracing it.It’s not clear when AI will become advanced enough to replace certain white-collar workers and just how many jobs it will be capable of taking over. But jitters around its potential impact are already pushing people to change course, reshaping the labor market before automation fully arrives.What is clear is why workers are feeling on edge. TheWorld Economic Forumprojects that AI could displace 92m roles worldwide by 2030, including many white-collar positions. In the US, employers cited AI as a factor in nearly 55,000 job cuts in 2025, according toChallenger, Gray & Christmas, a consulting firm, as job seekers navigate a tougher market.While AI is still just one factor among many that are leading to layoffs, ADP, the largest payroll company in the US, found that professional and business services roles, alongside information services jobs in media, telecom and IT,collectively lost 41,000 jobs in December 2025. In that same month, employment grew in healthcare, education and hospitality, per the firm’s data.Many of those white-collar roles involve writing, data analysis and coding – tasks generative AI tools can increasingly perform. Hands-on, people-facing work remains less exposed.Jobs that emphasize interpersonal and hands-on skills are increasingly appealing to young people who are wary of automation, according to Dr Jasmine Escalera, a career development expert at Zety, a professional development platform.She pointed toresearchshowing that 43% of gen Z workers who are anxious about AI are moving away from entry-level corporate and administrative roles and toward careers that rely on what she calls “human skills”, including creativity, interpersonal connection and hands-on expertise.In that same report, 53% of young respondents said they were seriously considering blue-collar or skilled trade work. Escalera said it was a move that workers were making to reduce their exposure to AI and one that theWall Street Journal, the paper of record of white-collar work, had recently urged its readers to consider.But the pivot may come with sacrifices. Many of the white-collar roles that workers worry could be automated – from software development to financial analysis – are paid median salaries well above $75,000 a year, with developers raking in about $133,000, according to theBureau of Labor Statistics. Blue-collar jobs pay less. Many skilled trades, like electricians and plumbers, receive closer to$60,000 a year. These types of jobs also often require in-person work, physical labor and less predictable schedules – all trade-offs workers may accept in their attempts to future-proof their careers.For some job seekers, any mention of AI is a red flag in job listings, so they’re skipping them entirely.After getting laid off last January, Roman Callaghan, 30, spent nine months hunting for his next job. As a medical coder at a medication access firm for four years, Callaghan handled administrative tasks like calling insurance providers and entering medical data. After his employer started rolling out AI across the company to streamline workflows, he wondered whether the move would one day affect his job. When he was laid off two years later, he suspected his fears had come true, though his employer didn’t specifically cite AI as a reason.When he looked for new work, he avoided any roles that mentioned phrases like “integrating AI”, “AI-first” or “developing AI” in job descriptions. Callaghan wanted a new job, but his AI anxiety steered him away from roles that now felt short-term to him. He just didn’t want to risk being laid off again because a future employer would eventually use AI to cull its ranks.In the past nine months, he said, he applied to at least 100 jobs across data entry, medical coding, call centers and paralegal work, while deliberately skipping 30 to 40 postings that referenced AI. While he searched, he took odd gigs to make ends meet, first at a local fish store and later at a call center. He stayed there until mid-October, when he landed a data entry job.Avoiding AI-centric jobs “felt like it narrowed the amount of companies I could work for”, Callaghan said. “Even though my options were limited, sticking to my convictions felt worth it.”​​Recruiters say that kind of avoidance is becoming more common. Marshall Scabet, the CEO of Precision Sales Recruiting, which helps manufacturers hire sales professionals, said that roughly a quarter of sales candidates he spoke with over the past six months were trying to pivot away from software-as-a-service (SaaS) jobs.Many clients told him they worried their tech sales roles could be replaced by AI, Scabet said, and believed selling industrial equipment was safer from automation. Doing so, he said, required building human relationships with vendors.“In their opinion, there was less likelihood of that job being taken by AI,” Scabet said. “AI isn’t just going to walk into a factory and give a pitch about a machine.”For more experienced workers, their encounters with AI in the workplace are pushing them to reconsider entire industries or build new skill sets.Liam Robinson, a 45-year-old animation artist, says he is actively avoiding jobs in the mobile gaming industry he has worked in for more than a decade. In his last role as an art director, his employer encouraged staff to use generative AI to speed up production. Robinson, who refused to use AI in his own work, said he watched the quality of animation suffer around him as his colleagues began relying on the tech.Last September, after disclosing in a self-evaluation survey that he wasn’t using AI, Robinson was laid off. It left him disillusioned with the direction of the industry. He believes AI flattens creativity, erodes craftsmanship and hurts the environment, fueling his resistance to work for companies building or deploying it.He is not actively applying for new roles and instead is focused on creatingwebtoon comics. But if money runs dry, he said, he would take on other work, from driving for Uber to trash disposal. “As long as I’m useful and making a little money, that’s enough,” Robinson said.As professionals like Robinson confront the possibility that skills they spent years mastering are no longer highly valued, many are redefining what stability looks like, according to Arianny Mercedes, founder of the career strategy firm Revamped.Rather than chasing prestige or high salaries, Mercedes said her job-seeking clients increasingly prioritize roles tied to regulated or essential parts of an organization, such as healthcare administration, education or compliance.“The objective isn’t to avoid AI,” Mercedes said. “It’s to be in roles where AI changes the tools of work without undermining authority or decision-making.”For others, the safest response to AI is to lean into it.After designing and developing websites for four years, Dmitry Zozulya decided to leave his work behind. As AI tools have proliferated and make it possible to code and create branding at a fraction of what it used to cost, the 29-year-old found it increasingly difficult to sell website and landing page work.Instead, Zozulya began offering AI-driven automation services, helping businesses streamline workflows. He now runs a small consultancy while building personal projects to deepen his experience.“I believe it’s very important to adapt,” Zozulya said. “Even when it’s uncomfortable.”Whether the rise of AI is steering workers away from entire industries or just certain roles, it is disrupting many people’s calculus for what their future at work will look like – and it’s happening abruptly.For Ramirez, that recalculation began before he had even entered the workforce. He believes switching from computer science to nursing means he’ll find work after graduation, even if it means letting go of the future he once imagined.“When you throw AI into the picture, the likelihood of healthcare jobs disappearing is slim as of right now,” Ramirez said. “I can’t speak for the future, but in the next few years, they’re still going to be there.”"

AWS has won 189 UK government contracts worth £1.7bn since 2016, theGuardian reportedin October.The AI-caused outages were smaller events, said the company, and only one affected customer-facing services.Amazonconfirmed plans to cut 16,000 jobsin January, after itlaid off 14,000 stafflast October. In January its chief executive, Andy Jassy, reportedly said these cuts were about company culture, and not about replacing workers with AI.However, Jassy haspreviouslysaid that efficiency gains from AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce in the coming years, and AI agents will allow it to “focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences”.In a statement to the Financial Times, Amazon said it was a coincidence that AI tools were involved in the outages, and that there was no evidence that such technology led to more errors than human engineers. “In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” it said.Amazon told the Guardian that there was just one incident that had affected AWS, rather than two.Several experts were sceptical of this assessment. A security researcher, Jamieson O’Reilly, said: “While engineering errors caused by traditional tools and humans are not a rare occurrence, the difference between these and mishaps where AI is involved is that ‘without’ AI, a human typically needs to manually type out a set of instructions, and while doing so they have much more time to realise their own error.”AI agents are often deployed in constrained environments and for specific tasks, O’Reilly said, and cannot understand the broader ramifications of, for example, restarting a system or deleting a database – which may have led to the error at Amazon.“They don’t have full visibility into the context in which they’re running, how your customers might be affected or what the cost of downtime might be at 2am on a Tuesday,” he said.“You’ve got to continually remind these tools of the context – ‘hey, this is serious, don’t stuff this up’. And if you don’t do this, it starts to forget about all the other consequences.”Last year, an AI agentdesignedby the tech company Replit to build an app deleted an entire company database, fabricated reports, and then lied about its actions.Michał Woźniak, a cybersecurity expert, said it would be nearly impossible for Amazon to completely prevent internal AI agents from making errors in future, because AI systems make unexpected choices and are extremely complex.“Amazon never misses a chance to point to ‘AI’ when it is useful to them – like in the case of mass layoffs that are being framed as replacing engineers with AI. But when a slop generator is involved in an outage, suddenly that’s just ‘coincidence’,” he added.A spokesperson from Amazon said: “This brief event was the result of user error – specifically misconfigured access controls – not AI.”They said the “service interruption was an extremely limited event last year” when a tool used to visualise costs for its customers was affected in parts of China.They added: “This event didn’t impact compute, storage, database, AI technologies, or any other of the hundreds of services that we run.“Following these events, we implemented numerous additional safeguards, including mandatory peer review for production access. Kiro puts developers in control – users need to configure which actions Kiro can take, and by default, Kiro requests authorisation before taking any action.”Explore more on these topicsAmazonCloud computingTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Now robots are coming to the kebab shop, alongside self-service screens and loyalty apps, as takeaways look for ways to tackle rising costs.German Doner Kebab (GDK), a perhaps surprisingly British-owned chain that has been springing up across the country, has turned to technology to keep its fast food business buzzing in the face of rising costs and tough times on the high street.With households cooking at home more often to save money, and restaurants facing increases in energy bills, business rates, national insurance and hourly pay, profits are under pressure despite rising prices at the till.“It is survival of the fittest,” says Simon Wallis, the CEO of the brand, which operates via dozens of franchise partners running 155 outlets in the UK and nearly 40 more overseas including in the US, Dubai, Ireland and Sweden.The Glasgow-based company serves up chicken, beef and vegetarian kebabs, as well as burritos and rice bowls, in snappily branded outlets more akin to McDonald’s or KFC than the traditional kebab shop.The business expects to open at 25 new sites in the UK this year, and there are longer-terms plans for 900 outlets worldwide, as Wallis says his tweaks to operations have “given partners confidence to invest” despite pressure on hospitality businesses.“My number one priority is to make the franchisees profitable,” he says as he enjoys a GDK chicken burrito at its hectic outlet on St Martin’s Lane in central London.“Labour has had the biggest impact on costs, and we have really leaned in to improve productivity,” says Wallis, who previously held senior roles at the rival fast food chains Domino’s, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut and KFC.View image in fullscreenA robotic kebab-slicer at a GDK outlet.Photograph: German Donor KebabA robotic kebab-shaver, a gadget that automatically slices meat grilling on a vertical rotisserie, is just one of the gambits he has drawn on to improve productivity in the stores.Wallis says the technology, which GDK has been trialling at its outlet in Bedford and is looking at installing in new outlets later this year, not only reduces labour hours but is more efficient than its human counterparts, as the machines cut the meat from rotating skewers more precisely and consistently.GDK is also slicing away labour hours with equipment that preheats bread so that it takes less time to toast, and by using a central kitchen to mix the group’s signature sauces.In the last three years, the chain has also introduced at least three self-service screens in each restaurant, with the newest outlets hosting four so that the devices now ring up about two-thirds of transactions.Wallis’s “smart kitchen” innovations also include removing a barrier between the kitchen and the counter so that one person can prepare and serve food at quiet times – in a similar fashion to traditional takeaways.The owners, led by True Capital, a British investment company that owns stakes in a number of consumer groups from the Hush clothing brand, the Cotswold Company and Bedfolk homewares to Warpaint cosmetics, are fully behind the plans.double quotation markIt is wrong to say the high street is dead. In some pockets, high streets are coming back and you have got to be smart about the right locationSimon WallisTrue bought its 60% stake last year from Hero Brands, a company controlled by Athif Sarwar, the brother of the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar. Hero had acquired the brand in 2015 from its founder, Farshad Abbaszadeh,after Athif Sarwar was impressed by GDK when on holiday in Dubai. The United Arab Emirates city was the site of the company’s first outlet in 2013 when Abbaszadeh imported the concept and the ingredients to create the German-style doner kebabs he had enjoyed back home.Now the owners are backing investment in a loyalty app that will entice consumers to spend their money in restaurants rather than ordering deliveries.Despite cost of living concerns, GDK’s delivery sales were up by more than 10% last year, but these sales are less profitable for restaurant operators, especially when ordered via such apps as Deliveroo or JustEat, which come with a number of fees.So, GDK is planning to tempt punters back to restaurants with special dine-in-only menu items and promotions, while geolocation technology is being deployed to help find the best areas where high streets are regenerating.“It is wrong to say the high street is dead. In some pockets, high streets are coming back and you have got to be smart about the right location,” said Wallis.The company is also bringing in healthy and trendy options that will particularly appeal to younger diners.Wallis says 57% of the menu, which is heavily geared towards chicken, is already compliant with the government’s so-called HFSS rules, which limit advertising on food that is high in fat, salt or sugar, and GDK is aiming to increase that to about 66%.The company’s plans come amid nervousness across the industry about the effects of GLP-1 appetite-suppressing drugs, which are expected to hit sales at fast food restaurants. Wallis says: “We like to think our business is a bit immune. We target gen Z. People taking the jabs tend to be older.”In the St Martin’s Lane outlet, GDK is pumping out edgy dance music designed to appeal to youngsters, and Wallis says proposed new kebab flavours follow the success of an extra-spicy dish that gained traction on social media.“We have got to be worth it,” Wallis says “People are being more discerning about spending money.”Explore more on these topicsRobotsFood & drink industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is about a company that gives pedophiles powerful tools to prey on innocent and unsuspecting children,” Los Angeles County lawyer Dawyn R Harrison said.“The trauma that results is horrific, from grooming to exploitation to actual assault. This needs to stop.”In a statement to AFP, Roblox rejected the allegations in the suit, insisting the platform was built “with safety at its core.”“We have advanced safeguards that monitor our platform for harmful content and communications, and users cannot send or receive images via chat, avoiding one of the most prevalent opportunities for misuse seen elsewhere online,” a spokesman said.The company said it takes swift action against people found violating its rules and works with law enforcement to hold them accountable.“There is no finish line when it comes to protecting kids and, while no system can be perfect, our commitment to safety never ends.”Explore more on these topicsRobloxGamesLos AngelesChildrenInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

The US government signed the Pax Silica, a technology agreement that bindsIndiacloser to US tech and away from Beijing.Countries that do not embrace AI could be left behind, says OpenAI’s George OsborneRead moreAt the signing, Jacob Helberg, the US under secretary of state for economic affairs, emphasised the threat from China if India should even think about looking elsewhere for its AI. “We have seen the lights of a great Indian city extinguished by a keystroke,” he said, in an apparent reference to asuspected Chinese cyber-attackon Mumbai in 2020.India lacks the semiconductors, power plants and vast gigawatt datacentres to go it alone. In common with most other countries, it faces a choice between US and Chinese AI models. Which they choose could have profound consequences for who controls India’s future, because if AI’s power emerges as predicted, it will not only tweak economic and social structures, but become their new bedrock.Stuart Russell, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, who closely follows India’s progress, said: “If we get to AGI [artificial general intelligence], AI is going to be producing 80% of the global economy. All manufacturing, most agriculture, all services will be just done; managed by AI, produced by AI.”View image in fullscreenThe US government signed the Pax Silica agreement, which binds India closer to US tech and away from Beijing.Photograph: Rajat Gupta/EPAImagine, he said, an Indian village priced out of having a health centre. In the future, AI could design the hospital and “along comes a bunch of giant quad copters carrying the materials, and a bunch of robots come and assemble everything. Two weeks later, you’ve got a hospital.”In this scenario, technology becomes integral to a country’s wellbeing. Elements of sovereignty can be fought over, but how successful that will be remains to be seen. AI’s power is such that its controller gains enormous leverage.Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, told the summit: “It may sound absurd, but AI can even help India achieve a standout 25% economic growth.” If that were to happen, it would take India to a per-capita GDP in a decade that is equivalent to Greece today. How could a leader resist?Modi’s tech secretary, Shri Krishnan, said India realised it must ally with like-minded countries to ensure it did not become “enslaved”. It is a high-stakes decision.India appears unlikely to turn to China, for now. It has the AI models, but there are tensions on the Himalayan border, and Chinese companies and leaders were scarce at the summit.Will India thrive with US AI?Silicon Valleycompanies talk of cooperation not control. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global policy, said: “We don’t see India as a customer, we see it as a strategic partner.”US officials framed the deal with India as an alliance of two nations that “broke centuries of colonial rule”, and as “two great democracies saying we will build together”.The Guardian asked Michael Kratsios, Donald Trump’s science and technology adviser, if India risked being controlled by the US under a form of digital colonialism.“I would say it is actually the opposite,” he said. “Any country that builds on top of the American AI stack will have the most open, independently controlled, secured stack the world has to offer. And that is why we are soon keen to share it with so many countries that are prioritising their AI sovereignty.”View image in fullscreenA visitor takes part in a virtual reality demonstration at the summit.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyRussell sees another possibility. “I think the American companies want to get in at that high-school and middle-school level to create basically a bunch of AI addicts who can’t tie their shoelaces without the help of AI,” he said. “Silicon Valley has always been about eyeballs. You monetise later and it works. Google and Facebook generate vast amounts of money.”Could India build its own AI? It is investing billions in datacentres and semiconductor capacity, but it takes years to come online.View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi with Emmanuel Macron in the audience at the AI Impact summit.Photograph: Stéphane Lemouton/Sipa/ShutterstockIndia can press US tech companies to adapt their AIs to its kaleidoscope of languages and cultures, and attempt to insist on guardrails. There is much at stake.As the summit came to a close, Joanna Shields, a former Facebook and Google executive and ex-UK minister for internet safety, warned: “If we have a world where we are accepting models from just the global north, we will lose so much of our cultural diversity, our uniqueness as people, wherever we come from … We don’t want to develop a monoculture based on a handful of models that everybody uses around the world and we lose that richness of who we are, what makes us human.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingOpenAIGoogleAlphabetSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When you consider that more than half of a typical household’s fuel bills goeson heating and hot water, findingalternative ways to keep warm– and heating the person, rather than the whole home – seems like a good idea. Many of the best electric blankets and heated throws cost about 2p to 4p an hour to run, so it’s hard to ignore their potential energy- and money-saving benefits.Electric blankets are ideal for using on your mattress, with the most convenient examples arriving with timers and auto-shut-off features for peace of mind, and dual control panels to keep both sides of the bed happy. Heated throws are better for snuggling on the sofa – they’re practical but also look good, with tactile finishes in materials such as bamboo and pure cotton.I was tasked with sleeping on the job to discover the best of both, testing the most popular electric blankets and heated throws from well-known homeware brands such as Silentnight, Slumberdown and Dreamland. Here are my top picks.At a glanceBest electric blanket overallCarmen C81190 fitted electric blanket (king)Read more£49Buy at DunelmBest budget electric blanketSlumberdown Sleepy Nights (double)Read more£15.74Buy at the RangeBest heated throw overallDuux Yentl Cuddle heated overblanket striped greyRead more£99.99Buy at DuuxBest budget heated throwDunelm Lenon fur electric throwRead more£40Buy at DunelmBest quilted electric blanketDreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanket (king)Read more£139.99Buy at BootsBest luxury-feeling heated throwBeurer HD150 heated snuggle blanketRead more£119.99Buy at Simply BeWhy you should trust meI’ve been a lifestyle journalist for more than two decades. Over the years, I’ve tested just about everything from breadmakers and bedding to beehives and biscuits – thankfully, not all at the same time.Lately, my focus has been bedding, testing numerous mattresses, pillows, weighted blankets and bed linen – so I know what makes for a decent night’s sleep. Testing electric blankets was the logical next step.Whatever I’m testing, I’ll find practical and useful ways to rigorously measure the value of the product and dig deep to go beyond the marketing jargon.How I testedView image in fullscreenI used an infrared thermometer to determine how fast the blankets warmed up – and how evenly.Photograph: Emily Peck/The GuardianWithout a Cern-grade laboratory at my disposal, I tested 24 of the most popular electric blankets and throws at home. In bed. In my pyjamas. I wanted to assess how each blanket and throw felt while sleeping or resting, and judge its quality and durability.Alongside measuring the maximum temperature each blanket hit, I timed how long it took to get there – I have zero patience when cold, so quick and efficient heating is crucial. Using an infrared thermometer, I measured the temperatures on the highest settings at 10 minutes, 30 minutes and an hour after being switched on. Since the weight of your duvet and room temperature can affect the temperature of electric blankets, I kept things fair by using all the electric blankets on the same bed, and all the heated throws on the same sofa, with a consistent room temperature of 18C.No one wants a hot back and frosty feet, so I considered how evenly each blanket heated up by taking temperature readings at three different points after an hour on full power. I also used a plug-in power consumption meter to determine each blanket’s hourly running cost based on theOfgem price capas of 1 January 2026, which is 27.69p a kWh.Below you’ll find the 17best of the 24 models I tested. Those blankets and throws that brands didn’t want returned will be donated toHope for Food– a Bournemouth-based charity supporting local families in need.The best electric blankets and heated throws in 2026View image in fullscreenComforting: the appropriately named Duux Yentl Cuddle heated overblanketBest electric blanket overall:Carmen C81190 fitted electric blanketCarmenC81190 fitted electric blanket (king)£49£49 at DunelmWhat we loveIt’s easy to fit on to the bed and heats quicklyWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t have a timerKing, £49 at DunelmThis electric blanket includes two controllers so you can operate each side of the bed independently – always a good thing when you’re sharing. It comes in single, double and king-size versions, and is made from polyester with a cosy fleece finish.Why we love itThe Carmen feels great, heats up effectively and is great value. It’s one of the easiest blankets to fit on to your bed, with a generous elastic skirt sewn on to it rather than the usual, clumsier straps. The skirt ensures the blanket secures neatly under each side of themattressand stays in place.It heats up quickly, reaching an impressive 28.1C in its centre after just 10 minutes – and this was without a duvet on top. I measured the heat at the sides a little cooler, but the temperature increased steadily over an hour, reaching 30.2C in its centre after 30 minutes and up to 33C after an hour. As soon as a duvet was placed on top, it got even warmer and retained its heat long after I had turned off the blanket.While it’s machine washable, the manufacturer recommends doing this only a total of three times in its lifespan, so it will mostly be a spot clean.It’s a shame that …there’s no timer. But for peace of mind, it does have overheat protection that will automatically shut it down if the built-in thermal fuse detects a hotspot or fault in the heated cables.Sizes available:single,double, king sizeDimensions (double):L193 x W137cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:no, but it does have auto-shut offRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.078kWh each side)Temperature after an hour:33.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesCarmenC81190 fitted electric blanket (king)£49£49 at DunelmWhat we loveIt’s easy to fit on to the bed and heats quicklyWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t have a timerBest budget electric blanket:Slumberdown Sleepy NightsSlumberdownSleepy Nights (double)£15.74£15.74 at the RangeWhat we loveGenerous straps make it easy to fit on the bedWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t include a timerDouble, £15.74 at the RangeGenerous straps for easy positioning and three adjustable heat settings make this electric blanket a good budget buy. It comes in six sizes, can be machine washed for easy maintenance, and arrives with a two-year guarantee.Why we love itFeeling super soft against the skin, this microfibre blanket was simple to set up, with bonus points awarded for the long cord.The lengthy, elasticated straps meant I didn’t have to wrestle too much with the corners of my thick Sealy mattress to position the blanket securely, plus it stayed in place nicely.The blanket heated up to 22.1C in just 10 minutes and 25C in 30 minutes. After an hour on its highest setting, it reached a comfortable 29.5C – more than enough heat for me.When I measured the temperature across the blanket, I found it was hotter in the middle than on the sides. However, I didn’t notice any cold spots when my duvet was on top, trapping in the heat.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have a timer. The manufacturer suggests leaving this blanket on its lowest setting if you want to keep it on all night.Sizes available:small single,single,small double, double,king,super kingDimensions (king size):L150 x W142cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:noRunning coston maximum:3p/hour (0.094kWh)Temperature after an hour:29.5CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yesSlumberdownSleepy Nights (double)£15.74£15.74 at the RangeWhat we loveGenerous straps make it easy to fit on the bedWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t include a timerBest heated throw overall:Duux Yentl Cuddle heated overblanketDuuxYentl Cuddle heated overblanket striped greyfrom£99.99£99.99 at Duux£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s fluffy, thick and comfortingWhat we don’t loveIt can feel a little too hot on the highest settingPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£99.99 at Duux£99.99 at AmazonWith a soft faux-fur finish, this Yentl Cuddle overblanket is large enough to fit a king-size bed or three-seater sofa and comes in two neutral colours, beige and grey. The timer goes up to nine hours.Why we love itThe word cuddle seems fitting for this Duux heated throw, which is one of the most comforting heated blankets I’ve tried. Even when turned off, it felt warm and cosy due to its thickness and fluffy finish. At £99.99, it costs more than your average heated blanket, but for its size and the warmth it offers, it’s well worth the spend.It was quick to heat in my tests, and the thick material retains heat well. After 10 minutes on the highest setting, it measured a toasty 28C, and after 1hr 20mins it had reached an overly warm 40C. Of course, the temperature of the room and body heat will affect how hot it gets, but I’d recommend using the lower setting 3 and setting the timer to switch off after an hour – this feels just right.I really enjoyed using this blanket, whether it was on or off. I’ve been laying it over my duvet and turning it on at night to warm my bed before I get in. I then turn it off and sleep with it on top of the duvet to benefit from that extra layer of warmth. It works well, and the weight of it on my bed has also helped improve my sleep.It’sa shame that …it may feel too thick and heavy for some.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L200 x W200cmNumber of heat settings:nineTimer included:1-9 hoursRunning cost on maximum:2p/hour (0.086kWh)Temperature after an hour:39.2CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:remove the controller and wash at 30CDuuxYentl Cuddle heated overblanket striped greyfrom£99.99£99.99 at Duux£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s fluffy, thick and comfortingWhat we don’t loveIt can feel a little too hot on the highest settingBest budget heated throw:Dunelm Lenon fur electric throwDunelmLenon fur electric throw£40£40 at DunelmWhat we loveIts attractive burgundy faux fur finish that feels very soft to touchWhat we don’t loveThere’s no timer includedPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£40 at DunelmDunelm sells a range of heated blankets, and its stock changes regularly (including several times throughout the writing of this article), so you’ll have to be quick. This one comes in a beautifully soft faux fur polyester fabric in either white or burgundy.Why we love itI always opt for deeper colours for blankets and soft furnishings to hide the wear and tear better over time. I love the luxurious look of this blanket’s jewel-like burgundy finish, and I think it will age well.Like many Dunelm heated blankets I’ve tested, this throw feels good draped over my lap: it’s so smooth and tactile. It’s not too bulky either, so it’s easy to move around without its control cable getting in the way. It was the perfect size for one person or two sharing, if you don’t mind getting close – it worked well when my 11-year-old daughter was keen to snuggle up with me. It’s one of the thinner heated blankets I’ve tried – it does well to disguise the wiring inside, but it’s still noticeable.It didn’t retain the heat as well as some of the thicker blankets, but it did heat up effectively. It comes with a basic control panel with six heat settings and was quick to heat. It reached 27.5C after just 10 minutes on level six and 39.9C after an hour, which is impressive for such a slim blanket – and very welcome during recent cold snaps. It’s fairly efficient to heat, too – while the small print on the website states that it costs 3p an hour to use, my readings came out as 2p an hour.It’s a shame that …it has no timer, although it does automatically shut off after four hours.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L160 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:no, but has automatic shut-off after four hoursRunning cost on maximum:2p/hour (0.088kWh)Temperature after an hour:39.9CGuarantee:one yearMachine washable:yesDunelmLenon fur electric throw£40£40 at DunelmWhat we loveIts attractive burgundy faux fur finish that feels very soft to touchWhat we don’t loveThere’s no timer includedBest quilted electric blanket:Dreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanketDreamlandPure Comfort bamboo underblanket (king)from£99.99£139.99 at Boots£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt includes breathable bamboo materialWhat we don’t loveIt costs more than your average blanketKing, £139.99 at BootsKing, £99.99 at AmazonThe king-size version of this underblanket has dual control panels for operating each side independently. There are six heat settings to choose from, and three timer options for one, three or nine hours.Why we love itThis blanket reached 22C at its centre after just 10 minutes, and within an hour, temperatures had risen to a snuggly 32C. I found that the middle and end of the blanket heated well, but the top section remained cool to the touch, working well for under your head.It costs more than your average electric blanket, but is worth it for the quilted, breathable bamboo finish. The filling, like many other electric blankets, is polyester. The control panels on either side were easy to navigate, even when I was sleepy-eyed.It’s a shame that …there are no timer options between three and nine hours.Sizes available:single,double, king,super kingDimensions (king size):L200 x W150cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, one, three or nine hoursRunning coston maximum:4p/hour (0.129kWh)Temperature after an hour:32.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesDreamlandPure Comfort bamboo underblanket (king)from£99.99£139.99 at Boots£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt includes breathable bamboo materialWhat we don’t loveIt costs more than your average blanketBest luxury-feeling heated throwBeurer HD150 heated snuggle blanketBeurerHD150 heated snuggle blanketfrom£62.46£119.99 at Simply Be£62.46 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels very smooth and snuggly against your skinWhat we don’t loveIt can be awkward to fold and a little cumbersome to storePhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£119.99 at Simply Be£62.46 at AmazonIdeal for the sofa, this Beurer blanket has averysoft and sumptuous fleece finish. Its six heat settings are all adjustable via the central control panel. I tried the XXL design – a little oversized on my three-seater sofa, but ideal for sharing comfortably with another person. It also comes in asmaller 180 x 130cm size.Why we love itThe soft-to-touch surface of this heated blanket proved just the right level of cosy for a night on the sofa watching TV. Plus, it feels padded enough to disguise the heating elements inside the blanket – not something that can be said of all heated blankets.It heated up fast – reaching temperatures in the low 20s in just 10 minutes – yet it used surprisingly little energy. After an hour, it felt very hot, so I turned it down to setting two, which was more comfortable. Its three-hour automatic switch-off timer means that you can just set and forget about it.It’s a shame that …it didn’t heat up evenly. While the middle was warm, sections around the edges didn’t feel it at all – which might be a problem if you’re sharing it with a blanket hog.Sizes available:small, largeDimensions (large):L200 x W150cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:three-hour automatic switch-offRunning coston maximum:2p/hour (0.055kWh)Temperature after an hour:32.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesBeurerHD150 heated snuggle blanketfrom£62.46£119.99 at Simply Be£62.46 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels very smooth and snuggly against your skinWhat we don’t loveIt can be awkward to fold and a little cumbersome to storeBest heated fleece throw:Russell Hobbs microfleece heated throwRussell HobbsMicrofleece heated throwfrom£38.99£38.99 at Currys£39.99 at Robert DyasWhat we loveThe microfleece finish feels so softWhat we don’t loveIts darker shades might look harsh in some colour schemesPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£38.99 at Currys£39.99 at Robert DyasWith its soft microfleece finish, this heated blanket is large enough to cover one person comfortably and also works well for two. It features one digital control panel with multiple heat and timer functions, and an automatic switch-off function for peace of mind. If you intend to sleep with it, Russell Hobbs recommends using it on a lower heat mode, up to setting three.Why we love itThe first thing I noticed about this heated blanket, aside from its soft feel, was its generous 250cm cable. It meant I could drape the blanket over me comfortably on the sofa without accidentally tugging the plug out of the wall socket.The blanket’s microfleece finish felt tactile and comforting, and it was thicker than some of the standard fleece throws I tested, such as the Dunelm fleece electric throw (above). While I could feel the wiring lines inside this blanket, they’re well hidden in the blanket’s sumptuous design.The white digital control panel here is a little bulkier than some others on test, and stands out against the jet-black finish of the blanket I tested. Nevertheless, it was easy to use, with heat settings ranging from one to nine. If you want to use the blanket for more than an hour, the timer function lets you go up in one-hour increments up to nine hours and then jumps to a single 12-hour setting. On its highest heat setting, it reached 29C in 30 minutes and a toasty 41.9C after an hour. In addition, the heat seemed to distribute well across the blanket’s surface.It’s a shame that …the throw doesn’t come in pastel colours; the darker shades (such as the black I tested) could look harsh against some softer interior schemes.Sizes available:one sizeDimensions:L180 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:nineTimer included:yes, one-nine or 12 hoursRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.134kWh)Temperature after an hour:41.9CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yes, under 40CRussell HobbsMicrofleece heated throwfrom£38.99£38.99 at Currys£39.99 at Robert DyasWhat we loveThe microfleece finish feels so softWhat we don’t loveIts darker shades might look harsh in some colour schemesBest fluffy heated throw:Glamhaus heated throwGlamhausHeated throwfrom£24.99£24.99 at Robert Dyas£24.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt heats up quickly and feels great against skinWhat we don’t loveNo storage bag includedPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£24.99 at Robert Dyas£24.99 at AmazonAvailable in jewel-like colours, includingdeep pink,“scuba” blueandgreen, this electric over-blanket is reasonably priced at less than £50 (£24.99 at the time of writing). The blanket is made from polyester and has a white, fluffy trim that contrasts nicely against the vibrant hue of its main body.Why we love itIt may be standard polyester, but the velvety fleece-like finish of this blanket feels luxurious to touch. Its white trim instantly made my sofa look festive, but it will look great throughout spring, too, adding an extra layer of cosiness to your living room.It’s thick and feels more substantial than some other budget heated blankets I’ve tried, so it feels warming even when it’s not switched on. It heated up quickly, too, and within a minute, there was a satisfying amount of heat from its centre. The heat felt comfortable rather than scorching, with the heated wires nicely disguised within the throw. The heat also radiates out to the sides effectively, providing an even warmth across the surface. After 10 minutes, I measured the centre of the blanket at 27.2C on its highest setting, and it reached 34.2C after 30 minutes and a sleep-inducing 40.3C after an hour.The control panel is easy to use and doesn’t give you a bewildering number of heat and timer options – there are six heat settings and a three-hour timer, which feels plenty. It comes with the safety of an auto-shut-off feature and can be conveniently machine-washed at 30C too – both features I’d expect to find in a good-quality heated blanket.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with a storage bag, which would make it neater to store while not in use. It’s hard to fault this blanket, though, as it’s such good value.Sizes available:one sizeDimensions:L160 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, three hoursRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.096kWh)Temperature after an hour:40.3CGuarantee:one yearMachine washable:yes, at 30CGlamhausHeated throwfrom£24.99£24.99 at Robert Dyas£24.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt heats up quickly and feels great against skinWhat we don’t loveNo storage bag includedBest quick-to-heat blanket:Bedsure heated blanket electric throwBedsureHeated blanket electric throwfrom£35.97£68.99 at Wayfair£35.97 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels soft and heats up quicklyWhat we don’t loveDue to its white sherpa lining, it may need regular washingPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£68.99 at Wayfair£35.97 at AmazonThis Bedsure heated blanket comes in a soft dual-sided sherpa fabric, with 14 colours to choose from. The timer goes up to a generous 10 hours, and there are six heat settings and a preheat feature.Why we love itThis blanket’s smart memory function is a nice extra. Every time you turn on the blanket, it will heat up to the last used setting. Unlike other blankets I’ve tested, it also has a preheat button on its controller that sped up the heating process. Within two minutes of turning it on, the blanket became noticeably warm – a welcome feature when the room was particularly cold. When on the highest setting, I was surprised to see how efficient it is too – costing just 2p an hour to run.I found the blanket beautifully soft to touch on both sides, with a nice weight and thickness to it. It took about 30 minutes for the blanket to reach 29.8C, and after an hour, it was measuring a satisfying 35.6C. This kept me warm but didn’t feel too hot to touch. The heat was distributed evenly, and the blanket retained the heat effectively right up to the edges of the blanket, too.It’s a shame that …the underside of the blanket is finished in white, which I can imagine will look a little grubby over time and need regular washing.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L130 x W160cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:up to 10 hoursRunning cost on maximum:2p/hour (0.076kWh)Temperature after an hour:36.6CGuarantee:30-day return policy; no warranty period specifiedMachine washable:yes, remove the controller and wash at 30CBedsureHeated blanket electric throwfrom£35.97£68.99 at Wayfair£35.97 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels soft and heats up quicklyWhat we don’t loveDue to its white sherpa lining, it may need regular washingBest heated duvet:Dreamland Love Mornings heated duvetDreamlandHeated duvet (king)from£199.99£199.99 at Dreamland£199.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt offers soothing heat from above, which works wellWhat we don’t loveCables will hang out of the end of the duvet coverKing, £199.99 at DreamlandKing, £199.99 at AmazonDreamland offers a wide range of heated bedding products – I also have my eye on the brand’selectric heat padsfor specific areas, including your feet, neck, back and hands.Having tried the underblanket (reviewed above), I was keen to see how this heated duvet would compare. Like the underblanket, the duvet is machine washable with the controller removed, and can be tumble-dried, too.Why we love itI was instantly impressed by the tidy stitching and smooth finish of this heated duvet, which is filled with polyester and has a 100% cotton cover. With an October chill in the air, I set up the duvet on my bed, under a breathable cottonNectar duvet cover.The dual controls lead out at the end of the duvet, so you can run them up the side of the bed to plug them in. This means you’ll be able to use it with a buttoned cover, but not one that has a zip.Dreamland states the heat-up time as five minutes, and while it was slightly warm after a few minutes, I did have to go hunting for the warmer spots during my tests. After 10 minutes on the highest setting, I measured the temperature at 26.6C at the centre, and after an hour it was 36.3C, which felt comfortable – although this probably isn’t a heat level I’d like to sleep in all night.The duvet’s dual controls worked well for my partner and me: I could blast the heat on my side while he, who prefers cooler climes, didn’t need to have it on at all.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with a cover. Also, while having the heat filter down from the duvet above me felt cosy on a really cold night, I prefer the heat from an electric blanket underneath.Sizes available:single,double, king sizeDimensions (king size):L225 x W220cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, one, three and nine hoursRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.101kWh a side)Temperature after an hour:36.3CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yesDreamlandHeated duvet (king)from£199.99£199.99 at Dreamland£199.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt offers soothing heat from above, which works wellWhat we don’t loveCables will hang out of the end of the duvet coverBest heated foot warmer:Vonhaus grey electric foot warmerVonhausGrey electric foot warmerfrom£27.99£27.99 at Vonhaus£27.99 at the RangeWhat we loveIt’s fast to heat and versatile to useWhat we don’t loveThe grey design is uninspiring and there’s no timerPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£27.99 at Vonhaus£27.99 at the RangeThe Vonhaus grey electric foot warmer comes with a microfleece lining, three heat settings, an auto-shutoff and overcurrent protection – so the power will stop if the electrical current exceeds a safe limit.There are a few grey heated foot warmers available online that all look similar –SilentnightandLogiksell a design that looks close to this model, for example. Having never tried a heated foot warmer before, I was pleasantly surprised at how comforting the Vonhaus could be.Why we love itThe grey and white warmer looks basic in design, but I found it effective and spacious for my feet. It took a couple of minutes to heat, but I then enjoyed the sensation of sitting at my desk and having the extra warmth for my feet. With deadlines to meet, I found it stress-relieving too.It fits up to a UK size 12.5, and my size six feet sat neatly inside with plenty of room to wiggle my toes around. My partner has size 11 feet and found he had more than enough room, too. Body heat, of course, influences how hot it becomes, but after 10 minutes on full power, it reached an impressive 28C in my tests. The small print on the website states that it can get up to 65C, but after an hour, I measured it at 36.2C, which was plenty.It’s a shame that …I found the removable lining inside the warmer annoying – it’s flimsy and can get creased, which makes it harder to put your foot inside it.Sizes available:oneDimensions:W30 x H24 x D30cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:noRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.096kWh)Temperature after an hour:36.2CWarranty:two-year warranty (not guarantee)Machine washable:yes, foot warmer and cover at 30C; controller is non-washableVonhausGrey electric foot warmerfrom£27.99£27.99 at Vonhaus£27.99 at the RangeWhat we loveIt’s fast to heat and versatile to useWhat we don’t loveThe grey design is uninspiring and there’s no timerBest heated throw for one person:Vonhaus pink heated throw blanketVonhausPink heated throw blanketfrom£37.99£37.99 at Vonhaus£37.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIts silky finish and pretty pink hueWhat we don’t loveIt could be thickerPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£37.99 at Vonhaus£37.99 at AmazonWith nine temperature settings, this soft and silky pink blanket offers a good range of heat options up to a maximum of 43C. It has a one-hour default timer, plus one that can be set for up to nine hours in total. If you’re going to sleep with it or are using it for extended periods, Vonhaus recommends setting the heat to level 1 for the duration.Why we love itMeasuring 160 x 130cm, I found this heated blanket just the right size for one. While its vibrant pink finish might not go down so well with some, personally, I didn’t mind it. It’s machine washable at 30C (with the control panel removed) on a gentle cycle and low spin, and the 2.15m cord length should be long enough to reach a nearby socket.The blanket felt smooth underhand with an almost silk-like finish, but I could feel the wiring inside. Nevertheless, it was subtle, and the blanket’s layers of fabric are well structured to make it easy to fold or lay flat on the sofa or bed. It heated up evenly, but not as quickly or as hot as others on test, reaching 25.5C within 30 minutes and 34C after an hour.It’s a shame that …the pink colourway may not be to everyone’s taste.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L160 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:nineTimer included:yes, up to nine hoursRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.156kWh)Temperature after an hour:34CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yes, up to 30CVonhausPink heated throw blanketfrom£37.99£37.99 at Vonhaus£37.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIts silky finish and pretty pink hueWhat we don’t loveIt could be thickerBest heated cushion:Beurer HK48 cosy heated cushionBeurerHK48 cosy heated cushionfrom£34.99£34.99 at Currys£34.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThat it both props you up and heats you upWhat we don’t loveThe control panel is very basicPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£34.99 at Currys£34.99 at AmazonThis heated cushion, made by German brand Beurer, would make an excellent gift.Of its two sides, it’s the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 fleecy fabric that warms up for a soothing effect; the other side is a breathable cotton with a removable pad inside. The cover is removable and machine washable on a gentle wool cycle at 30C, but it can only be cleaned up to 10 times in its lifespan. For an extra £9.99,replacement covers are availablein five attractive colours, including green, red and orange.Why we love itAn alternative option to your standard heated throw, this cushion provides a more targeted approach to warming and could work well for general pain relief. It comes with three heat settings, and felt great positioned near the lower back and under the neck, upper legs, knees and ankles.The cushion was super-quick to heat, reaching 34C in 10 minutes, and a very warm 43.4C after an hour. It never really felt too hot, and the heat seemed to radiate to the sides nicely. The three heat settings are useful, but a timer alongside would have enhanced the design.

My review sample arrived in the Mole colourway, which will suit both modern and traditional interiors.The blanket’s 10 heat settings allow for good control, although I found it difficult to “feel” a difference past heat setting six. The blanket reached a hot 31.9C after 10 minutes of being turned on; and while the borders didn’t get as warm, the heat did seem evenly distributed across the surface.Made from polyester, the blanket is washable at 40C on a wool cycle, but it can only be air-dried.It didn’t make the final cut because …when you turn it on, it starts at setting five.

The fastening straps for the corners and the blanket’s base material ensure a secure fit to the mattress.Two control panels let you tailor each quarter of the mattress to suit your upper and lower body, so it’s a great option for bed sharers or those who like to keep their feet at a different temperature from the top half of their body. On the highest setting, the blanket radiated an even temperature that felt even warmer once I added my duvet.It didn’t make the final cut because …it may have a pure cotton cover, but its filling is made from polyester.Sizes available:single,double, king,super king;dimensions (king size):L200 x W150cm;number of heat settings:nine;timer included:yes, up to nine hours;running coston maximum:2p/hour (0.062kWh);temperature after an hour:27.6C;guarantee:two years;machine washable:yesSnuggledownIntelligent Warmth (king)from£87.50£87.50 at Argos£125 at John LewisWhat we loveEach side can be controlled independentlyWhat we don’t loveIts filling is polyester, which is less breathableSilentnight luxury heated throwSilentnightLuxury heated throwfrom£41£41 at Silentnight£44.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s lightweight and heats evenlyWhat we don’t loveIt’s not as thick as some of the throws we’ve tried£41 at SilentnightFrom £44.99 at AmazonBest for:smaller sofas and people who don’t want to shareA simple control panel with nine heat settings adjust the temperature of this heated throw, which reached just over 33C after an hour of being plugged in. There’s no timer, but it turns off automatically after two hours, which should be more than long enough to warm you up.The throw is thin and light, so it would be good for transitional seasons when the weather is a little warmer and you don’t want anything too heavy. The box says it costs 1p an hour to run on the lowest setting, which sounds about right – I measured it as 3p an hour on maximum.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s quite thin, meaning you can feel the wiring inside.Sizes available:one;dimensions:L160 x W120cm;number of heat settings:nine;timer included:no, but two-hour automatic shut-off;running coston maximum:3p/hour (0.102kWh);temperature after an hour:33.6C;guarantee:three years;machine washable:yesSilentnightLuxury heated throwfrom£41£41 at Silentnight£44.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s lightweight and heats evenlyWhat we don’t loveIt’s not as thick as some of the throws we’ve triedOpera Flexi adjustable bed electric blanketOperaFlexi adjustable bed electric blanket (small double)£354£354 at OperaWhat we loveIt’s energy efficient and a good alternative to traditional wiresWhat we don’t loveIt only comes in two sizesPhotograph: Emily Peck/The GuardianSmall double, £354 at OperaBest for:heating an adjustable bedDesigned for use on all bed types, the Opera Flexi is a good shout for adjustable beds as it can move freely with the mattress. Unlike a standard electric blanket, there are no metal wires inside, which makes it a potentially safer and more flexible solution. Instead, it uses graphene technology to conduct heat, which is enhanced by body heat when in contact with the blanket. The heated graphene also emits far-infrared radiation (FIR), which claims to offer therapeutic warmth to benefit muscles, ease joints and promote restful sleep.I don’t have an adjustable bed, but I tested a single version of this blanket on my standard pocket-sprung mattress to see how effective it was at heating. While I can’t prove it had any positive effect on my body or sleep, I did find the gentle warmth it emitted comforting. On the downside, it felt a little thicker and rustled more than other electric blankets I’ve tried: I could tell I was sleeping with something underneath me. I like that I couldn’t feel any wires through the sheets, though.There are a lot of buttons on the control panel, but it allows you to heat the upper and lower parts of the blanket independently. It also comes with a flexible 12-hour timer for each section.I found the blanket heated up slowly, but got warmer as the night went on and my body temperature rose. After 10 minutes, I didn’t notice much difference in heat, but after 30 minutes, it was measuring 25C, and rose to 29C after an hour. I like this slow and steady pace as I never felt as if I was overheating.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pricey and only comes in a small single and small double. Its smart app is still in development.Sizes available:small single, small doubledimensions:L200cm x W75cm;number of heat settings:six;timer included:yes, up to 12 hours;running cost on maximum:2p/hour (0.060kWh);temperature after an hour:29C;warranty:three years;machine washable:no, top surface can be wiped clean with warm soapy water and a soft cloth when disconnected from mains supplyOperaFlexi adjustable bed electric blanket (small double)£354£354 at OperaWhat we loveIt’s energy efficient and a good alternative to traditional wiresWhat we don’t loveIt only comes in two sizesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenHow much do electric blankets cost to run?In my tests, the average king-size electric blanket costs 3p an hour to run. This shows that even if used for a few hours a day, it could cut down on your heating use and save you money over the year – depending on how much you spend on the blanket in the first place, of course.“There are factors to consider when calculating the costs, as not all electric blankets are the same,” says John-Paul Drake, energy expert atLove Energy Savings. “Some come with timers, different heat settings and various efficiency ratings. But it could be wise to take advantage of both an electric blanket and a lower thermostat setting as an optimal way to save money on energy bills this winter.”How much should you spend on an electric blanket?Prices for an electric blanket range from about £30 to £140, depending on the size. Expect to pay anything from £20 to £150 for a heated throw.Are electric blankets safe?Electric blankets should be used with caution, and never by young babies and toddlers. Most manufacturers do not recommend use by young children, unless they’re supervised by an adult and have a clear understanding of how to use them safely. Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe use. Not always obvious on the box, but the latest electric blankets should have passed electrical safety checks. Look for safety marks such as “BEAB approved” (British Electrotechnical Approvals Board) or “KEMA-KEURsafety tested” for peace of mind. For more advice on electric blanket safety,read this advice from London Fire Brigade.Consider safety features such as an automatic switch-off timer that will turn off the blanket after a set time, or overheat protection, which switches off the device if it senses it’s getting too hot.An electric blanket should fit securely on your mattress, starting just below the area beneath your pillow to stop your head from overheating. It shouldn’t be folded or creased, as this can damage the wiring inside. The safest place to leave your blanket when it’s not needed is flat on your bed.Is my electric blanket compatible with my mattress?Electric blankets are compatible with most mattresses, but can potentially cause damage to some mattresses made from memory foam or latex. “Memory foam mattresses are heat-sensitive, and there has been a concern in the past that they could soften too much when heated by an electric blanket, damaging the foam’s structure and reducing support,” says Chelsea Brown, lead product adviser atOpera Beds.“Most modern electric blankets shouldn’t reach high enough temperatures for this to be an issue, but you should use them with caution. Memory foam is designed to mould to your body, so directly placing an electric blanket on top can also prevent the mattress from fitting your body snugly. Consider using a mattress topper under the electric blanket or keeping it on a low heat to prevent damage to your mattress.”For more, read thebest weighted blanketsand thebest electric heatersEmily Peck is alifestyle journalist who’s been writing and editing for more than twodecades.

Once inside, their most treasured possessions, their phones, were taken from them and exchanged for government-approved devices, so they could continue to take photos and record video without breaching security guidelines. At the reception, creators from areas as wide as science, education and travel took part in a networking session at the heart of government.This was one ofa number of eventsin 2025. There were also off-the-record breakfasts to talk about how creators might collaborate with the government to reach new and younger audiences. A large part of the work being done by No 10’sNew Media Unitwas aimed at working with financial education creators to help share new policies being launched by the Treasury.Financial content creators were invited to speeches and briefings for the biggest political events of the year. WhenAnna Brading, a personal finance content creator, entered the No 10 briefing room for the spring statement, she could hardly believe it. Having three kids at a young age meant that she spent her time raising a family and making ends meet by tutoring maths on the side. As she managed her family’s money, she began posting tips online for other mums. Now she was in the room that public health experts had updated the public from during the pandemic. “The day I walked in that room, I had to take a minute,” she says.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThere was, of course, a backlash as some journalists felt that these creators didn’t have the expertise or clout to hold the government to account, but this may be one of the few areas in which No 10 is getting it right. The unit is attempting to address two unavoidable truths: one,people don’t trust politicians; two, more people are now getting their news fromcontent platforms. Usinghighly trustedcontent creators to share news of policies addresses both of these issues at once.Financial educator Rotimi Merriman-Johnson, known asMr MoneyJar,has recorded videos for policies such as changes to the minimum wage for young people. He began making content before training as a financial adviser, and is keen to emphasise that it’s not just about relaying any old information. It’s about consistently sharing quality information that makes a difference to people’s pockets. “Every additional year you spend as a content creator, you become more trusted … It’s not just about the information, it’s about the person sharing the information.”Political journalists, known as lobby journalists, have been permitted to work in parliament since the 1870s, sit in the press gallery watching the Commons floor, and receive briefings from the prime minister’s communication staff. The walls of the room where these briefings happen are lined with now-defunct telephone booths designed to allow reporters to file their copy down the phone. Desks in the members’ lobby, the room in which MPs gather before entering the Commons chamber, are pitted with now-dry ink wells. The bowels of Westminster are knotted with internet cables that sit – quite precariously – on top of old steam pipes. Inviting creators into the heart of government is yet another iteration of British politics and its institutions responding to technological innovation.Since their introduction more than 20 years ago, social media sites have evolved into “content platforms”. Once, Myspace, Facebook et al were spaces to connect with friends; with the advent of Instagram, they became places to follow lifestyle “influencers”; now they are platforms that host a never-ending stream of “content”. Some of the best creators lean hard into specialisms and niches, and present themselves as experts in specific areas. According to Diane Banks, the chief executive of talent management agency Northbank Talent: “We are in the age of the expert content creator.”In many ways, these expert creators are the perfect interlocutors for the Starmer government: they are technocratic and emphatically apolitical. As creatorCameron Smithsays: “When I go into these rooms I’m representing my audience’s interests, not the interests of these political parties.” In fact, being non-ideological is integral to the business model. Talent management agencies shy away from polemicists as they are difficult to monetise. Brands don’t like to work with opinions. In this sense, the UK is treading a different path from the US, as the White House has seen an exodus of mainstream reporters who are being replaced by regime-friendly influencers and commentators.Of course, the creators acknowledge the tension between pushing politicians on issues their audiences may be facing and needing to maintain access. This is especially pressing at a time when so many people feel knots tighten in their stomachs whenever they check their bank balances. There are more than a dozen major news publications in the UK, but millions of individual creators. It’s hard for a government to ignore – to pick an example out of nowhere – the Guardian for long, but easy to cast aside a creator who isn’t playing ball.CreatorMat Gaysays: “It’s a difficult question because while I would love to push a bit harder and talk a little bit more about the things that people are worrying about, to me it’s more important to just get them to the table.”Gabriel Nussbaumbelieves things are shifting. “They were a little bit rigid at the start,” he says. “They said: ‘Can you submit five questions that you’d want to ask Rachel Reeves?’, for example. And then they’d come back and say: ‘Do you mind not asking question four and five?’” But now, he finds he is given the freedom to question politicians. A government spokesperson said: “We are engaging with content creators, as well as journalists to reach new audiences, ensure we are held to account in a changing media landscape and keep the public better informed about government policies.”Talking to these creators, I get the sense that they’re diligent and dutiful to their audiences, focused on the policy rather than the politics. Rather than political journalists, they seem to have more in common with themost trusted man in Britain, Martin Lewis, a former consumer-affairs journalist turned consumer-rights champion. Lewis has managed to make a career of teaching people how to work the system, and when to intervene so that the system works for them. I am sure content creators will figure that out too.Kirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionSocial mediaDigital mediaEconomic policyBudgetConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s ironic that the most technologically obsessed art form on the planet is just as watery-eyed about the past as cinema and music. And to prove it here is the new version of the legendary QuickShot II, a plasticky joystick from the early 1980s that wasn’t eventhatgood the first time round. It was, however, cheap and it resembled an actual fighter plane control stick with its multiple fire buttons and ergonomic shaft. If you wanted a rugged and precise controller you’d go for the Competition Pro, but that one didn’t let you pretend to be in Star Wars or Airwolf. Plus, the QuickShot II had suckers on its base so you could stick it to your cockpit control panel – sorry, I mean MDF computer table.The new QuickShot II from RetroGamesand Plaion Replai is almost an exact replica in terms of its dimensions. You can grasp it in your fist and wrap your thumb and forefinger around its large red buttons. Yes, you can stick it to your table; the designers have even included the original auto-fire switch at the rear for players who weren’t prepared to hit the fire button repeatedly while playing Green Beret.View image in fullscreenBurst of nostalgia … playing Truxton with the QuickShot II.Photograph: Bitwave Games/ToaplanIt has been tastefully updated, though. The two fire buttons on the stick can now be separately configured – a feature I yearned for as a youngCommodore 64fanatic so that I could independently control the laser and bombs in Skramble. There are also six buttons on the base, which align with standard joypad layouts, and the USB cable means you can plug it into a PC or any of the modern computer remakes released by Retro Games, such as the C64 or Spectrum. I tested it with the latter and have already spent many hours blasting through Ant Attack, Pheenix and Head over Heels.In terms of build quality, it’s a good balance of necessary updates and respectful nonaction. The stick itself has plenty of travel (you have to push it quite far to register movement), which is just as I remember. This made the QuickShot famously unsuitable for joystick-waggling titles such as Daley Thompson’s Decathlon as you had to move it a long way left and right, often causing damage to the joystick and indignity to yourself. At least now the designers have added microswitches so you get a nice click when the stick moves. The fire buttons, however, still have the same old soft click, and the sound and feel of them is one of the most warmly nostalgic parts of the whole thing. I spent so many hours of my teen years pressing those buttons – the sound is as hardwired into my memory as the smell of school dinners or the wash of the ocean against a pier.I also tried the QuickShot II withSteamand it worked absolutely fine after some simple calibration – although the auto-fire proved problematic. It was lovely to play the Steam version of classic shooter Truxton with this stick, returning me to memories of playing arcade games in Blackpool then going home and pretending my computer desk and joystick were an arcade cabinet. You think these feelings are gone but it doesn’t take much to bring them hurtling back – sometimes just a hunk of plastic will do it.If you’re looking for a serious modern joystick, this isn’t it. It’s low-budget and awkward and, despite an hour of configuring, I couldn’t get it to work with PC emulation platform RetroArch, which was a shame, though others may manage it. But this is the point: the QuickShot II was not the best joystick, it was the one we could afford. And it looked cool.I respect that the remake is true to that spirit. It is affordable and a little compromised. But if you owned one back in the day, it is a fun thing to have, and the fourth star in my review is for the absolute raw nostalgia of it. Every time I see it sitting there beside my hi-tech PC and big HD monitor, I smile. It’s good to have you back, old friend, with all your flaws and shortcomings.The QuickShot II is available now, £30.95.Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Peace in the region rests on law and sovereignty, not ego and brinkmanshipFri 20 Feb 2026 12.52 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 14.46 ESTShareIn Gaza, aid still trickles in at levels relief agencies say are far below what is required. Temporary shelters are scarce. Reconstruction materials are restricted by Israel’s controls on goods entering the territory. Conditions, say the UN, remain “dire”. The violence has not stopped: Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed about 600 people since the ceasefire began. The announcement that the US wouldtransfer $10bnto President Donald Trump’s newly convened Board of Peace is hard to reconcile with the reality on the ground. Even worse is that Washington has paid only a fraction of its UN arrears – $160m against more than $4bn owed.This raises the obvious question: why is a private initiative being capitalised so heavily while existing UN mechanisms remain severely cash-strapped? Funnelling state funds into a body chaired by Mr Trump suggests foreign policy is serving private interests, not the public good. The board has ambitious plans. Rafah is to be rebuilt withinthree years with skyscrapers. Gaza is to becomeself-governingwithin a decade. An International Stabilisation Force isexpectedto begin deployment, eventually numbering 20,000 troops. These are dramatic claims. But their delivery is largely notional.Worryingly, there’s no clearlegal authoritydefining the board’s mandate. Last November’s UN security council resolution authorised the board solely for Gaza as a temporary,two-yeartransitional administration. Mr Trump – who holds veto power in the board and the authority to interpret its remit – thinks otherwise. He claims it canintervenein other global conflicts. The board is not embedded within existing UN structures, perhaps intentionally sidestepping the lengthy coalition-building with regional partners. If its objective is to generate headlines, then the board has succeeded. The question is whether the guardrails are keeping pace with the public relations.In a recent European Council on Foreign Relations paper,Muhammad Shehadaargues that the US’s top-down, externally designed economic model risks remaking Gaza as a tightly managed enclave – with Palestinians restricted to new heavily surveilledcompoundswhile the strip is dotted with residential towers,datacentresand seaside resorts. Mr Shehada is not wrong when he says Mr Trump’s plan poses a blunt question: is Gaza the home of its people – or a prize for outside powers and profiteers? Palestinians are not getting much of a say, yet the answer will shape their future.Gaza lies in ruins. What unfolded, many experts say, was agenocide. Yet Benjamin Netanyahu’s government claims the mission is unfinished and is signalling a newoffensiveif Hamas does not disarm – possibly before Israel’s election this year. This may fit the letter of the UN resolution, but it shreds its logic. Clearly, Palestinians must have a believable path to sovereignty. Hanging over all of this is the most unpredictable wild card: thethreatof US military action against Iran within days if negotiations fail. Tehran says American bases would be legitimate targets if it is attacked.Peace in Gaza requires regional calm, Israeli restraint, Palestinian legitimacy and institutional credibility. Yet the US – operating through personalised diplomacy – contemplates war against Iran because it won’t give up itsnuclear enrichment programmewhile encouragingRiyadhto adopt one. Any stable peace demands patience and predictability. Escalatory threats invite conflagration. In Gaza, that contradiction is already visible, and it is potentially explosive.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s not just about moneyChristopher MarquisIn a university ecosystem that breeds hunger for status, Epstein made scholars feel like celebritiesFri 20 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 14.21 ESTShareTheJeffrey Epsteinstory is often told as the intersection of two obsessions: sexual abuse and money. The recently released emails certainly contain significant evidence of both. But after more than two decades as a professor at Harvard, Cornell and Cambridge, I am most struck by the limitation of that frame – in part because it fails to explain why academics show up so consistently in these files.Certainly, money played a role in Epstein’s university connections. A rich man using donations and access to burnish his ego and legitimacy is a well-worn script, from Andrew Carnegie’s libraries more than a century ago toBill Gates’s more recent global health philanthropy. As a college drop-out, Epstein clearly craved “respect” from high-profile academics. Universities, meanwhile, are perpetually fundraising and institutions that rely on donations often avoid asking hard questions about where the money came from. As the Bard College president, Leon Botstein,put itwhen defending his Epstein connections: “Among the very rich is a higher percentage of unpleasant and not very attractive people.” Institutions sometimes learn to stop asking hard questions about where the money came from.Some professors also seemed drawn to the louche lifestyle. Duke’s Dan Ariely, for example,asksEpstein for contact information for a “redhead” who had been with him. The Yale computer science professor David Gelernterdescribessomeone he apparently recommended for a job as a “v small goodlooking blonde”. Stanford’s Nathan Wolfeinvited Epsteinto dinner with “a couple of hottie interns”. The connection to universities populated by young women was no doubt another draw for Epstein. (Ariely,GelernterandWolfehave all denied wrongdoing.)But the emails suggest something deeper than greed or libido. Epstein’s malevolent genius was understanding personal and professional vulnerabilities – and then offering a bundle of bespoke and non-monetary rewards, such asaccess to companiesanddeals for the investorsin his network,inside scoops for journalistsandprivate banking relationshipsfor executives. Molly Jong-Fasthas saidthat Epstein built his influence by “acting as a kind of superconcierge”.Most academics spend their careers inside the ivory tower – a world set apart from everyday commerce and politics, organized around research and teaching, with its own norms, hierarchies and insulated debates. That separation brings freedom, but it also breeds a unique hunger for status that travels outside the campus gates. Even the most successful professors are usually not powerful in the way power is understood in the “real world”. Their prestige exists only in narrow circles and is mostly legible only to other specialists.While universities love to celebrate “impact”, they often starve the conditions that produce it. The result is a constant craving for recognition that feels immediate and personal. Epstein supplied this attention, plus connections with elites in finance, entertainment, technology and government. He made scholars feel like celebrities for the one thing they are trained to prize, but for which they are frequently denigrated in America: their minds.Even at the top, academic life is full of quiet humiliations that wear people down: anonymous reviewers, rejected grants, students who care more about social media than classwork, committee work, institutional politics that drains more than just time. You can see this in how university departments obsess over minor expenses. Senior professors are boxed in by per diem caps, and required to furnish receipts for minor purchases; there are pre-approval forms and bureaucratic rules that turn routine travel into petty bargaining. You can hold an endowed chair and still waste time arguing with an administrator about whether the hotel cost was “reasonable”.Epstein understood the psychological power of bypassing that grind.One emailarranging a visit for the Harvard professor Martin Nowak includes an offer of “use of an available apartment … as well as the Jaguar”. He understood the social capital he would receive in return for providing shortcuts around the constant and myriad indignities of life in academia.Epstein was not ostracised for his crimes. To some powerful men, he became even more appealing | Moira DoneganRead moreBut Epstein’s power over academics was not a strange exception. The uncomfortable conclusion is that he had a rare ability to pinpoint what people needed or wanted and exploit it. His private plane, nicknamed the “Lolita Express” , sits at the center of many of his controversies, but as the journalist Michael Wolff, whoseemail exchanges with Epsteinhave been widely reported, has suggested, using it was less about travel than about creating a hard class boundary between those who can fly private and those who can’t. The status is what is important. HesummarizesEpstein’s perspective: “Nobody turns down an invitation to fly private.”To understand how Epstein accumulated the wealth and influence that enabled his predation of young women and children, we have to look beyond sex and money. For the Epstein class, what’s truly valued is what money can’t buy directly: deference, access and moral permission.Universities and academics like me need to face a hard truth about our own desires. The job is supposed to be about ideas, teaching and public knowledge. Epstein offered something else: prestige without peer review, and attention without consequence. Too many people – even those who were not involved directly in exploitation – took the deal because it was easy to do and because it felt good.Christopher Marquis is theSinyi professor of management at the University of Cambridge and author of The Profiteers: How Business Privatizes Profits and Socializes CostsExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

If implemented, the technology would create a metaphorical thermostat for the planet. Such a thermostat is advocated on the grounds that controlling global temperature reduces the harms associated with theclimate crisis.I wish to challenge this assertion.Trump has done more than harm the government’s ability to fight global heating | Jamil SmithRead moreGlobal temperature was first adopted at the beginning of this century as a way of indexing the extent of human impact on the climate system. Since then, managing global temperature has become the primary object of climate policy, thus the Paris agreement’s stated aim being to contain global warming between 1.5C and 2C. The policy goal of net zero emissions is derived from this target temperature range.SAI seeks to shave off a few hundredths, or possibly two or three tenths, of a degree Celsius from this temperature index. It does so not by removing the cause of the undesired heating – the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere – but by deliberately adding new elements, active particles, into the atmosphere. In global-average terms, this might slow the buildup of heat in the climate system; it may indeed discernibly lower the global temperature.In my view, there are many problems with this techno-fix for the climate crisis. But I wish to draw attention here to just two: it does little to defuse most of the risks that really matter for people and ecosystems and, worse than this, it runs the risk of making some of these harms worse, perhaps even many of them. Both relate to the difference between global temperature and the everyday weather experienced by people and places.double quotation markThe focus of climate policy should be on interventions that deal directly with the causes of climate harmsFirst, global temperature is only the crudest of proxy indicators for the various and multiscale harms associated with loading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases. Among many things, these include the disruption and reconfiguration of regional weather systems, the impacts of changing extreme weather events on vulnerable local communities and ecosystems, and the consequences of the increasing acidification of the world’s oceans. Reducing global temperature by forcing it down through solar geoengineering offers no guarantees that any of these harms are reduced.Second, artificially adding new radiatively active particles into the atmosphere will inevitably alter the dynamics of the global atmospheric circulation which determines regional and local weather. This is clear whether one draws evidence from the analogue case of explosive volcanic eruptions or from the results of climate model simulations of SAI. Hurricane tracks, the strength of the Indian monsoon, the behaviour of El Niño in the Pacific Ocean – in other words, everyone’s weather – then become things which the deliberate solar engineers must take responsibility for.The focus of climate policy should be on interventions – whether technological, regulatory or behavioural – that deal directly with the causes of climate harms. This requires focusing on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, implementing ways of removing them from the atmosphere, building up the resilience of human and ecological systems to a wide range of climatic hazards, and investing in the drivers of human development, which have long been shown to be cost-effective in reducing damage, morbidity and mortality from dangerous weather.Adopting the index of global temperature as the scientific object to be controlled by SAI may give the appearance of doing some good, but this is an illusion. Pursuing SAI as a desirable and cost-effective way to reduce the primary harms of the climate crisis is an unhelpful and risky distraction from what matters most: the reduction of human emissions in the atmosphere, not the addition of new artificial materials.Mike Hulme is a professor of human geography and fellow and geography director of studies at Pembroke College at the University of CambridgeThis article was amended on 20 February 2026 to correct the spelling of its author’s surname.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisIt's time to talk about geoengineeringPollutioncommentShareReuse this content"

Each year, Transparency International’sCorruption Perceptions Index, a league table of 182 countries, is greeted with predictable theatrics: praise where it flatters power, condemnation where it can be weaponised, and hollow promises of reform that quietly expire once attention moves on. Instead of a moment of reckoning, it is ignored by those with the power to act.As this newspaper reported, last week’s table showed a“worrying trend” of backslidingand a picture of “democratic institutions being eroded by political donations, cash for access and state targeting of campaigners and journalists”.Transparency International’s latest index lands at a moment of global democratic decay, and its findings are grim: more than a decade of stagnation with most states making little or no progress against public-sector corruption. The UK slid to its lowest score since 2012.Yet if this is about perception, some perceptions appear remarkably forgiving. The US slips modestly to 64, despite political upheaval and institutional strain. Israel drops two points to 62 even as it faces scrutiny over allegations of genocide and covert entanglement in other sovereign states. Reputation in global politics is sticky; power and influence tempers decline and the baseline for what counts as corruption sometimes shifts to accommodate geopolitical sympathies.double quotation markThe world has reached a juncture where waiting for Trump to exit Washington is not an optionBut the danger lies deeper than national rankings. As geopolitical rivalry, war and climate breakdown place unprecedented strain on the western international order, the need for principled leadership has never been greater, yet the world’s most powerful state is moving in the opposite direction.For three decades, anti-corruption efforts have rested uneasily on the assumption that the US would act as anchor and enforcer. As the world’s largest economy, nerve centre of global finance and home to institutions whose rules ripple across borders, US laws on money laundering, sanctions, corporate transparency and foreign bribery have shaped global governance. When Washington takes corruption seriously, others follow. When it does not, the damage is global.Across legal, diplomatic and financial domains, decisions taken under Donald Trump have been criticised as weakening safeguards that took decades to build. The fight against corruption can no longer be outsourced to the US – the rest of the world must lead.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump signing an order ‘weaponising’ tariffs last April. He admitted that the huge 50% tariff on Brazil was due to the coup plot trial of his ally, Jair Bolsonaro.Photograph: ReutersA central concern is selective enforcement. Sanctions, anti-money-laundering tools and anti-bribery laws were designed to constrain abuse of power and protect the public interest. Yet critics argue that, under Trump, these instruments have been used as political leverage: applied harshly to adversaries, relaxed for allies and recalibrated to reward loyalty.Economic sanctions have drawn particular criticism from UN experts, economists and humanitarian agencies. While framed as pressure on elites, sanctions have repeatedly devastated civilian economies, deepened poverty, restricted access to medicine and finance, and weakened state capacity – often in countries targeted for resources or geopolitical defiance. In such contexts, corruption does not disappear; it mutates, thriving in scarcity, hidden markets and discretionary power.At the same time, alarm is growing over attacks on international accountability mechanisms.Judges and prosecutorsassociated with the international criminal court have facedthreats, sanctions or vilification. Second vice-president Reine Adélaïde Sophie Alapini Gansou (Benin), Judge Solomy Balungi Bossa (Uganda), Judge Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza (Peru) and Judge Beti Hohler (Slovenia) all follow the earlier designation of the prosecutor Karim AA Khan KC.In addition, UN mandate-holders such as Francesca Albanese, special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, have been targeted for pursuing investigations that challenge powerful state interests.TheUS even imposed sanctions on a Brazilian supreme court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, overseeing the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro, accusing the judge of authorising arbitrary pretrial detentions and suppressing freedom of expression. Whatever your politics, this signals a dangerous precedent: using state power to intimidate those tasked with upholding international law.Corruption today is not only about envelopes of cash. It is about power: who is shielded, who is sacrificed and who is allowed to act with impunity. When beneficial ownership rules are delayed, foreign bribery enforcement is weakened, or “golden visa”-style residency schemes are sold without robust safeguards, the signal to global markets is unmistakable. Illicit wealth adapts quickly: kleptocrats look for permissive jurisdictions, pliant regulators and political cover.Concerns have also been raised about opaque relationships between political power, private interests and foreign policy, particularly in relation to Israel. Claims thatthe Epstein filesmay have been used to exert influence over politicians point to a more serious issue ; when transparency is lacking and accountability is weak, public trust begins to erode.double quotation markCredibility of global anti-corruption depends on whether others are willing to lead – collectively, consistently and with courageAnti-corruption frameworks exist precisely to prevent systems from becoming vulnerable to blackmail, coercion or capture, regardless of whether specific claims are substantiated.Washington is incapable of acting as a credible steward of global anti-corruption norms, leadership must become distributed. Several actors are well placed to step forward: the EU, with its regulatory reach, anti-money laundering directives and market size, can enforce transparency standards extraterritorially, if it applies them consistently, including to its own financial centres.Canada or the Nordic countries’ commitments to transparency, aid-linked governance reforms and independent judiciaries give them moral and institutional credibility.African, Caribbean and Latin American coalitions, regions historically targeted by extractive corruption and coercive sanctions, have a powerful stake in reshaping the agenda toward development-centred, rather than punitive, anti-corruption. International institutions and civil society, organisations such as Transparency International, UN special rapporteurs, journalists and independent prosecutors must hold the line when states falter.What is needed is not a new hegemon, but a normative coalition, one that insists anti-corruption law serves the public good, not geopolitical convenience; that enforcement is impartial, not retaliatory; and that transparency applies upward, not only to the weak.As US warships prowl the Caribbean, our region must hold fast against Trump’s gaslightingRead moreThis won’t be free. Those who defend international law, expose illicit finance or impunity will face political pressure, funding cuts and intimidation – particularly from theTrump administration. But retreat is the greater risk.When anti-corruption becomes a weapon rather than a principle, it ceases to protect and instead deepens inequality, instability and mistrust.The world has reached a juncture where waiting for Trump to exit is not an option. Under his administration, the US has weakened core anti-corruption safeguards, politicised sanctions and enforcement, attacked judges and watchdogs, and blurred the line between public authority and private interest.The credibility of the global anti-corruption project now depends on whether others are willing to lead, collectively, consistently and with the courage to apply the rules even when powerful actors object. Because when the centre abdicates responsibility, the margins must become the guardians of integrity.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentOpinionCorruption index and barometerTrump administrationUS politicsJeffrey EpsteinEuropean UnionInternational lawcommentShareReuse this content"

The shock ofthe Greenland crisismay have faded from the headlines, but Donald Trump’s US has also suggested it may decide not to defend Europe. And Russia continues to be a nuisance in the Baltic Sea.Luckily, the vulnerable Baltic nations have launched an impressive string of initiatives to keep their mini-ocean safe. As the US sheds responsibility for Europe’s defence, these efforts could provide a model for the future of Nato itself.Finland announcedin January that it would team up with other Baltic Sea countries to create a maritime surveillance centre. Finland sees it as a way to increase capability and authority to intervene in “situations” in its territorial sea and exclusive economic zone. It’s a sensible measure.And it’s not the only one. Whenthe two Nord Stream pipelines explodedin the exclusive economic zones of Sweden and Denmark in September 2022,it took the region by complete surprise. To be sure, a few prophetic voices had been warning for years that undersea cables and pipelines were vulnerable to sabotage, but with virtually no suspicious incidents jeopardising this invaluable infrastructure, complacency set in. Then came thesabotage of Nord Stream, followed by the arrival of theRussian shadow fleet– designed to dodge oil sanctions – and the mysteriousrupture of two cablesand a pipeline in 2023.Whether or not Trump invades Greenland, this much is clear: the western order we once knew is history | Timothy Garton AshRead moreThe ocean’s coastal states – minus Russia – began cooperating more. As undersea cables continued to be mysteriously cut, threatening energy and internet provision, and shadow vessels traversed these waters on a daily basis, they began to improve information-sharing, a boring but essential measure. They launched anAI toolcalled Nordic Warden to detect anomalies above undersea cables and pipelines. Their navies and coastguards expanded maritime patrolling. They launched shadow-vessel inspections (a more difficult task than it sounds, because international maritime law grants all vessels freedom of navigation). Early last year, they even created ajoint maritime patrolling serviceto protect cables and pipelines day and night. AlthoughBaltic Sentry, as this patrol is called, is officially a Nato initiative, it’s executed by the Baltic Sea nations themselves.For Estonia, 2023 was a rude awakening, as Erkki Tori, the country’s national security adviser, told me. Now, in 2026, he says that Russia’s shadow fleet is being tackled not just in the Baltic Sea, but in other waters as well. Existing maritime law is a constraint but it does allow certain types of action, Tori insists. The exchange of ideas and practices with other countries is a vital part of the solution.The same approach – taking action within the limits of international law – goes for the protection of undersea cables and pipelines.“The international mechanisms that the world has were not built for things like this, but we’ve tried anyway – within the rule of law,” Tori says.The Baltic Sea nations appear to have inspired other countries. The French navyseizedan alleged Russian shadow tanker with false flag registration in the waters between Spain and Morocco in January. It was thesecond such interventionby France of a suspected shadow tanker in recent months.Indeed, the Baltic Sea nations are demonstrating what Nato’s member states can do, especially by teaming up with their neighbours. That matters now that the alliance’s ability to operate is being questioned. As the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen,concludedduring the height of the Greenland crisis, Nato would no longer exist if the US decided to attack the territory of another member country.Trump may decide to leave Greenland in peace for the time being (although Frederiksenis not too sanguine on that point, as she made clear at the Munich Security Conference). Even so, the question remains whether the US would support European countries in case of attack, as the Nato treaty’s mutual defence pledge,or article 5, requires. “If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them,” Trumpsaidlast March, referring to his European allies in Nato. A few months later, member statescommittedto spending 5% of GDP on defence and related areas.Ordinary Europeans have already drawn their own conclusions about how Nato must be reimagined for an era in which the US puts up less and less of the military capability. In Sweden, onlya quarterof the population believes the US would come to its aid in the case of an attack. Last June,51% of Britonsconsidered it unlikely that the US would come to the aid of the Baltic states in case of a Russian attack.That’s why initiatives such as the Baltic Sea nations’ maritime collaboration are so essential.Natomay survive or even thrive in the long term. Trump may abandon his confrontational stance. But nobody knows. Teaming up in smaller groups is imperative: it allows Nato countries to look after their own regions, without Nato and without the US. What’s more, it does no harm to the alliance.The localised cooperation we are seeing among the Baltic Sea nations is a taste of Nato’s future.Elisabeth Braw is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council thinktank.

Now this pathetic photograph will define the former princeFri 20 Feb 2026 10.58 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 17.29 ESTShareYou will have seen the photograph by now: Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly a prince, slumped in the back of a car outside Aylsham police station in Norfolk. His face is corpse-like – his lips tight, stare fixed, eyes turned red by the camera flash. It’s a far cry from Randy Andy, the handsome prince with the big teeth and the easy grin, whose face was once plastered on china cups and plates and commemorative tins, pressed into the soft metal of national affection.Never the heir, but less of a spare than Harry somehow, Andrew’s face was once memorialised in the way that only royalty, Jesus and the saints were: endlessly reproduced as public property. Andrew’s face was part of his – and the royal family’s – brand; he was the warrior prince, the helicopter pilot, the man who had served. He had sweated for us, so much in fact, that he could never sweat again.That face on those cups and plates was not merely decorative but an assertion of something ancient: that lineage writes itself in bone structure; that the face of a royal is not just a face but a symbol, a cipher, a condensed history of power.In antiquity, the ruler’s face was stamped on coins not merely for identification but as a claim: this profile is authority, this jawline is legitimacy, this gaze is the state. By the time of the Tudors, the royal portrait was an act of sovereign self-presentation – as seen by Holbein’s Henry VIII or later in Van Dyck’s Charles I.Andrew’s face was never intended for coinage. Yet its “physiognomy” was a text that would have been read for centuries as royal lineage: that strong jaw asserting resolution and authority; the broad forehead intelligence; the wide-set eyes openness and clear-sightedness; the full mouth sensuality, which would have worried Johann Kaspar Lavater, the 18th-century founder of the pseudoscience. Why? Because a sensual mouth spoke of negative character traits, including a lack of intellect, sloth and moral degradation.We can’t read faces so easily now. But for centuries, it was used to “prove” how some men, especially rich white men, were morally, intellectually, physically, superior to others. The founder of eugenics, Francis Galton, and the French police officer who developed biometrics, Alphonse Bertillon, measured and photographed the faces of criminals and poor people, sorting humanity into hierarchical categories. The distinction that underpinned their work – compared with the rich tradition of portraiture – mattered enormously: to be portrayed was to have your humanity affirmed; to be catalogued was to have it denied.The widespread democratisation of photography in the late 19th century made it possible for us to take our own portraits. The face became less a symbol of lineage than an index of personhood and individualism. And the royal family got in on the act too. After the death of Queen Victoria’s beloved husband, Prince Albert, the palace released a postmortem image of his face, still in deathly repose, his jaw held closed by a bandage.View image in fullscreenAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor leaves Aylsham police station, 19 February 2026.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersBut something vital has happened to the image of the monarchy that we can see in the face of Andrew in the back of a police car. Until now, the lens through the car window has been in service of proximity to glamour – a glimpse, a wave, as people have craned to see Diana and Charles, William and Kate, Harry and Meghan (who, apparently shockingly, opened her own door) and Andrew and Sarah Ferguson as they stepped in and out of waiting cars: state limousines, Bentleys, Rolls-Royces.Never, before Andrew, had we seen a member of the royal family leaving a police station in an unmarked car after their arrest. And in that photograph, Andrew’s face is not glimpsed but trapped behind glass; no mugshot (yet) but a recumbent image of a man brought low, with a face read anew: he looks “haggard, shamed and haunted”, says the Daily Mail; all dignity lost.Many newspapers reached for Charles I, the last time a member of the royal family was arrested. And there are similarities beyond a public fall from grace. In 1649, Charles I walked to his execution scaffold at Whitehall wearing two shirts – the extra layer so that he did not shiver in the cold; he didn’t want his body shaking, to suggest that he was frightened.Rather less nobly, whenAndrew declared on that now infamous Newsnight interview that he couldn’t sweat, supposedly a medical condition from the Falklands, he presented hisbody as not like other bodies, common bodies, bodies that had not sacrificed themselves for queen and country.Two years later, Virginia Giuffre filed her civil lawsuit against Andrew and that famous photograph of the once prince grinning at the camera, his arm around Giuffre, came to symbolise the case. When the image circulated for the first time in 2011, Andrew wrote to Jeffrey Epstein: “We are in this together and will have to rise above it.”Fifteen years on, what has Andrew’s face become? The ageing man is there before us, hollow and undone, but in that image there remains the remnants of the Falklands hero, the grinning prince on the china cup, the Newsnight face with its sneer of disdain, the face staring into the camera bent over the body of a young woman or girl, as revealed in the Epstein files.How do we reconcile these faces of a man who for 66 years has been a fixture of the royal family, maintained by the public and consumed by the press?It is perhaps ironic that it is Epstein’s endless cataloguing that has brought us here. Epstein built a Victorian-style archive of surveillance of the rich, alongside a gallery of victims, and that was seemingly for leverage, rather than classification. Now that catalogue, the instrument of bureaucratic power, is turning against power itself.And the public have become the classifiers – poring over 3m pages of files, running AI facial analysis on images of men that look like Epstein, sharing debunked images that show him living in Tel Aviv with a beard. We are all physiognomists now, and we are all archivists. Every face simultaneously a portrait and a document.Andrew once controlled which side of that equation he stood on, or at least, he thought he did. He took his seat before the Newsnight cameras by choice, certain that the interview was just another way of putting his face forward – a portrait sitting, perhaps, with Emily Maitlis as Van Dyck, allowing him to compose his face for posterity. Which did happen – just not in the way he intended.Dr Fay Bound-Alberti is a writer and professor of modern history at King’s College London.

Systemic failures to protect innocents and hold people accountable are adding even more fuel to the fireFri 20 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 09.02 ESTShareNot so long ago, if you said there was a shadowy cabal of elites who were involved in the sex trafficking of young women and girls and that some of the most famous people in the world were allegedly involved, then you would have been dismissed as a conspiracy theorist.On a certain level, it feels psychologically safe to “other” people who have conspiracy theories – Jon Ronson even wrote a book called Them about extremists and conspiracy theorists.Conspiracies were for people who needed a coherent story in order to make sense of all the bad things in the world. They were for people who could not handle chaos and desired a neat narrative, the way children like a bedtime story.The Epstein files reveal that a vast global conspiracy actually exists – sort ofRead moreHaving worked in the media and politics – two areas often accused of being in on the conspiracy – what I saw instead were people just trying to get through each day and get the basics of their job done, rather than being players in some shadowy network that operated according to hidden rules. People who worked in newsrooms were too disorganised to be part of a global plot! They were too busy trying to get a paper out.There are many unsettling and vile elements to the Epstein story, which has now seenformer Prince Andrew arrestedin the UK on suspicion of misconduct in public office, but one of the most unnerving is that conspiracy theorists may be on to something with this one.For years, the broad outlines of what Epstein was doing were available to anyone who cared to look. Journalists had reported on it. Survivors had spoken. And yet the story kept not quite landing, kept being filed away in the part of the brain marked too strange, too vast, too much like something a paranoid person would believe.The powerful men in his orbit, the politicians, the financiers, the scientists, the royals, remained largely in their positions, collecting their awards. We let them, in part because the alternative required believing something that felt, to reasonable people, unreasonable.This is the epistemological trap the Epstein case springs on the rationalist.We tend to think of conspiratorial thinking as a failure of critical intelligence, the category error of people who see patterns where there are none, who mistake coincidence for coordination, who are drawn to the narrative satisfaction of a hidden hand pulling strings. And mostly conspiracy theories are wrong. The moon landing happened. Covid is real.But here, the systems designed to hold people accountable and protect the vulnerable failed. Big media organisations had the story and didn’t run it.Prosecutors initially gave Epstein a sweetheart deal. And a team of lawyers enforcing strict NDAs meant those in his orbit could not speak out.Epstein himself “threatened harm to victims and helped release damaging stories about them to damage their credibility when they tried to go public with their stories of being trafficked and sexually abused”,according to a report in the files. Epstein also instructed that evidence be destroyed.Even now, the powerful are protected through the US Department of Justice’s extensive redactions of the Epstein files, whichaccording to membersof US Congress who have seen the files, include the name of six powerful men.These are not the far-fetched claims on a QAnon message board. They are institutions that rationalists, implicitly, trust.What is emerging from the Epstein files does look like a conspiracy.When we accept the existence of a conspiracy like this, it opens the possibility for more conspiracies just like it, hiding in plain sight - just like the Epstein case, and before that in the UK, the Jimmy Savile case.This will further weaken trust in institutions, the media and government.Already this age is marked by a departure from the rational. Astrology is huge among young people, trust in science is waning and old diseases like measles are coming back due to a decline in people getting vaccinated.Conspiracy theories feed on distrust and extend it into a worldview where official explanations are automatically suspect.With the Epstein files proving conspiracy correct, expect conspiracy theorists to become emboldened and their numbers increase. It’s a time-honoured way of trying to find order in the chaos.Brigid Delaney is the author of the philosophical novelThe Seeker and the Sage(Allen and Unwin)Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

So why did the rest of the world fail to stop them?Husam MahjoubWestern governments have put elite bargains before civilian lives. If El Fasher is to mean anything, this approach must changeFri 20 Feb 2026 08.45 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 09.01 ESTShareThe latest report from the UN independent fact-finding mission on the fall of El Fasher in Sudan reads like a postmortem of a preventable tragedy. The report details what it calls the “hallmarks of genocide”: mass killings, systematic sexual violence and ethnic cleansing targeting non-Arab communities by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).The atrocities in El Fasher should have surprised no one in the international community. Western governments were warned repeatedly by civil society, humanitarian organisations, investigative journalists and their own agencies. In Britain, awhistleblowerlast year accused the Foreign Office of censoring internal warnings about imminent genocide. The US state department and members of the UN security council receivedcontinuous reportingfrom the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab documenting the RSF’s military buildup and preparations to overrun the city. SeniorUS officials warnedthe Biden administration that El Fasher was at imminent risk. A security council resolution in 2024 called for an end to the siege. None of this prevented the city from being strangled.The clearest expression of the failure to act on information emerged in October 2025, when Washington hosted talks involving officials from the Sudanese government and the RSF. Just days after those discussions, the RSFcaptured El Fasherand began the massacres the UN has now documented. These talks did not prevent catastrophe. They provided political cover while it unfolded. The subsequentcalls for a trucewere issued without any acknowledgment of why they failed to prevent the assault.The silence reflects a hierarchy of priorities. Strategic relationships with theUnited Arab Emirates(UAE) have been placed above civilian protection in Sudan.Multiple investigations, includingleaked UN expert reports, have raised serious concerns about the UAE’s role in sustaining the RSF through arms transfers, logistics networks and financial pipelines. When supply routes through Libya and Chad became widely exposed, alternative corridors reportedly emerged via Somalia’sPuntlandandEthiopia. Advanced weaponry, drones and foreign mercenaries further strengthened the RSF. At the very moment the Sudanese armed forces had retaken Khartoum, Gezira province and Sennar, creating a narrow but real opportunity for de-escalation, the UAE’s support for the RSF intensified.Yet western governments continue to treat Abu Dhabi as a mediator. The “Sudan quartet”, bringing together the US, UK, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, presents itself as a diplomatic mechanism for peace. In practice, it institutionalises contradiction. When a state widely accused of arming one of the belligerents is seated as a broker, mediation becomes theatre and engagement replaces accountability.A widening rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE has turned Sudan into a proxy arena of Red Sea competition. Riyadh frames the conflict through state authority and regional stability; Abu Dhabi has pursued an assertive strategy anchored in ports, gold and militia patronage. Rather than confront this divergence, Washington and London have chosen equilibrium, careful not to alienate either Gulf ally.That caution has translated into conspicuous silence. At theMunich security conferencelast week and in front of theUN security council, the UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, expressed concern for Sudanese civilians and for women subjected to sexual violence. Yet she didn’t acknowledge claims that the UAE was the principal external supporter of the RSF, instead asserting that “a dozen states” were involved in arms transfers. The effect was to diffuse responsibility precisely at the moment clarity was required.Donald Trump’s adviser, Massad Boulos, followed the same script. In hissecurity council briefingyesterday, he avoided addressing the documented scale of Emirati support and instead focused on the threat posed by Islamists and remnants of the former regime within the Sudanese army. Those concerns may be politically convenient, but they do not explain the RSF’s campaign in Darfur.With this evasive strategy, alliances are protected but civilians are not. The result is paralysis dressed up as diplomacy.International humanitarian law is at risk – but it still carries weight | Kenneth RothRead moreWestern officials routinely invoke accountability while remaining adrift in their attempts to operationalise it. The liberal peace-building model that privileges armed actors and elite bargains has already failed Sudan. It treats generals and militia leaders as indispensable stakeholders and relegates civilians to observers. By treating the RSF as a legitimate political interlocutor rather than what it is, an armed organisation implicated in mass atrocities and sustained by foreign patronage, the international community validates violence as a pathway to recognition. If El Fasher is to mean anything, this approach must change.First, fund the people keeping Sudan alive. Channel resources directly to Sudanese civilian networks such as resistance committees, emergency response rooms, and the medical and food lifelines operating outside both armed camps.Second, name the parties to the war. The US, the UK and the UN must explicitly acknowledge the UAE’s role in sustaining the RSF and treat it as a belligerent, not a broker. This means sanctions not only on individuals but on the companies, financial channels and transport routes implicated in arms transfers and logistics to the RSF.Third, establish real accountability. Any ceasefire or political track that lacks independent monitoring, enforceable civilian protection and automatic consequences for violations will merely provide cover for rearmament.Peace cannot be built on the same elite bargains that have repeatedly collapsed. Without confronting the external enablers of this war, diplomacy becomes theatre and accountability a slogan. El Fasher has already exposed the cost of that illusion.Husam Mahjoub is co-founder of Sudan Bukra, an independent non-profit Sudanese TV channelDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Once inside, their most treasured possessions, their phones, were taken from them and exchanged for government-approved devices, so they could continue to take photos and record video without breaching security guidelines. At the reception, creators from areas as wide as science, education and travel took part in a networking session at the heart of government.This was one ofa number of eventsin 2025. There were also off-the-record breakfasts to talk about how creators might collaborate with the government to reach new and younger audiences. A large part of the work being done by No 10’sNew Media Unitwas aimed at working with financial education creators to help share new policies being launched by the Treasury.Financial content creators were invited to speeches and briefings for the biggest political events of the year. WhenAnna Brading, a personal finance content creator, entered the No 10 briefing room for the spring statement, she could hardly believe it. Having three kids at a young age meant that she spent her time raising a family and making ends meet by tutoring maths on the side. As she managed her family’s money, she began posting tips online for other mums. Now she was in the room that public health experts had updated the public from during the pandemic. “The day I walked in that room, I had to take a minute,” she says.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThere was, of course, a backlash as some journalists felt that these creators didn’t have the expertise or clout to hold the government to account, but this may be one of the few areas in which No 10 is getting it right. The unit is attempting to address two unavoidable truths: one,people don’t trust politicians; two, more people are now getting their news fromcontent platforms. Usinghighly trustedcontent creators to share news of policies addresses both of these issues at once.Financial educator Rotimi Merriman-Johnson, known asMr MoneyJar,has recorded videos for policies such as changes to the minimum wage for young people. He began making content before training as a financial adviser, and is keen to emphasise that it’s not just about relaying any old information. It’s about consistently sharing quality information that makes a difference to people’s pockets. “Every additional year you spend as a content creator, you become more trusted … It’s not just about the information, it’s about the person sharing the information.”Political journalists, known as lobby journalists, have been permitted to work in parliament since the 1870s, sit in the press gallery watching the Commons floor, and receive briefings from the prime minister’s communication staff. The walls of the room where these briefings happen are lined with now-defunct telephone booths designed to allow reporters to file their copy down the phone. Desks in the members’ lobby, the room in which MPs gather before entering the Commons chamber, are pitted with now-dry ink wells. The bowels of Westminster are knotted with internet cables that sit – quite precariously – on top of old steam pipes. Inviting creators into the heart of government is yet another iteration of British politics and its institutions responding to technological innovation.Since their introduction more than 20 years ago, social media sites have evolved into “content platforms”. Once, Myspace, Facebook et al were spaces to connect with friends; with the advent of Instagram, they became places to follow lifestyle “influencers”; now they are platforms that host a never-ending stream of “content”. Some of the best creators lean hard into specialisms and niches, and present themselves as experts in specific areas. According to Diane Banks, the chief executive of talent management agency Northbank Talent: “We are in the age of the expert content creator.”In many ways, these expert creators are the perfect interlocutors for the Starmer government: they are technocratic and emphatically apolitical. As creatorCameron Smithsays: “When I go into these rooms I’m representing my audience’s interests, not the interests of these political parties.” In fact, being non-ideological is integral to the business model. Talent management agencies shy away from polemicists as they are difficult to monetise. Brands don’t like to work with opinions. In this sense, the UK is treading a different path from the US, as the White House has seen an exodus of mainstream reporters who are being replaced by regime-friendly influencers and commentators.Of course, the creators acknowledge the tension between pushing politicians on issues their audiences may be facing and needing to maintain access. This is especially pressing at a time when so many people feel knots tighten in their stomachs whenever they check their bank balances. There are more than a dozen major news publications in the UK, but millions of individual creators. It’s hard for a government to ignore – to pick an example out of nowhere – the Guardian for long, but easy to cast aside a creator who isn’t playing ball.CreatorMat Gaysays: “It’s a difficult question because while I would love to push a bit harder and talk a little bit more about the things that people are worrying about, to me it’s more important to just get them to the table.”Gabriel Nussbaumbelieves things are shifting. “They were a little bit rigid at the start,” he says. “They said: ‘Can you submit five questions that you’d want to ask Rachel Reeves?’, for example. And then they’d come back and say: ‘Do you mind not asking question four and five?’” But now, he finds he is given the freedom to question politicians. A government spokesperson said: “We are engaging with content creators, as well as journalists to reach new audiences, ensure we are held to account in a changing media landscape and keep the public better informed about government policies.”Talking to these creators, I get the sense that they’re diligent and dutiful to their audiences, focused on the policy rather than the politics. Rather than political journalists, they seem to have more in common with themost trusted man in Britain, Martin Lewis, a former consumer-affairs journalist turned consumer-rights champion. Lewis has managed to make a career of teaching people how to work the system, and when to intervene so that the system works for them. I am sure content creators will figure that out too.Kirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionSocial mediaDigital mediaEconomic policyBudgetConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Without a united front the left may splinter and loseFri 20 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 08.17 ESTShareYou don’t have to be in Gorton and Denton for long to know thatnext week’s byelectionreally matters. If Labour wins in what has been an over-50% solid red-voting area since the second world war, that will calm nerves on its febrile back (and front) benches. If Labour loses, heavy blame will fall on Keir Starmer for fixing the party’s ruling NECto bar Andy Burnham’s selection, ensuring he couldn’t challenge for the leadership without a Westminster seat.Few doubt the popular Greater Manchester mayor would have won next week in Gorton and Denton on his home patch. Blocking him is widely seen as grubby Westminster politicking that has weakened, not strengthened, Starmer’s grip on the leadership. For many erstwhile supporters that jiggery-pokery was a turning point, as Starmer seemed willing to riskReform UKscoring another win in order to stop Burnham, though “stop Farage” has to be Labour’s overwhelming priority.The field is a three-way split betweenLabour, Reform and the Greens, and each can make a good case as to why they will win. There is plainly a strong anti-Reform majority in an area that has been Labour for more than 80 years, but how is anyone to know which is the best anti-Reform vote to cast?Greens and Labour fight it out fiercely here, each accusing the other of dirty tactics, of uprooting each other’s posters from front gardens and worse. A mass of canvassers has descended. A journalist arriving, as did I, can, as ever, take their pick of doorstep vox pops and shape a conclusion to suit any proposition. The truth is that I am none the wiser about the result after spending time here; my crystal ball is murky. Professional pollsters say the same thing: Patrick English of YouGov says it all depends on whether either Labour or the Greens can unite the “beat Reform” vote. The venerable pollster Peter Kellner says: “If Reform get 40% they will be hard to defeat, but if they get 30-35% they can be beaten if voters have a clear signal as to who is best placed to overtake them.” Good polling could be vital, he says. But there is none in sight. Without it, if anti-Reform votes split, then he says “first past the post will deliver a Reform victory”.Minds may be concentrated sharply this weekend when the white supremacists of Britain First hold what threatens to be a large “march for remigration” in the centre of Manchester, challenged by Stand up to Racism and others. Resisting the far right, kin to Nigel Farage’s crew, must surely be the prime focus for all on the left, setting aside their smaller differences. Reform’s candidate, the GB News presenter Matt Goodwin,has claimedUK-born people from minority ethnic backgrounds are not necessarily British.He has also said: “We need to dramatically lower, if not stop, migration into the UK from predominantly Islamic nations.”More than 40% of votershere are from an ethnic minority.From my vox pops, I can quote a former Labour voter on the doorstep who says: “Everything has to change from top to bottom.” He doesn’t quite say it, but “change” is now the Farage trope. Or there’s a woman dithering, after longtime voting Labour. “Nothing’s going well, is it?” she says. Then she nods to the sound of Labour achievements – breakfast clubs, local bus fares capped at £2, NHS waiting times falling, the move to curtail zero-hours jobs, living wage rising and more. Then she looks at a leaflet of Farage, declaring: “Not that smile; he has to be stopped!” She likes Burnham. She will probably back Labour.Burnham is everywhere most days: at events, door-knocking, recording TikToks, “the most loyal of foot-soldiers”, his team says. You look at him for the eye-roll: he would be less than human if deep within there wasn’t a schadenfreude wish for a loss here to serve Starmer right. But he’s ultra-visible in backingAngeliki Stogia, the good local candidate, whom he knows well as a local councillor. Sometimes people tell him they won’t vote Labour because he was blocked from running. “Please, please don’t do that!” he begs them, raising the threat of Farage, reminding them that nearby Runcorn was lost to Reform at the recent byelection by just six votes. “Keeping Farage out means voting Labour,” he says. He talks of national policies, what Labour got wrong on disability benefits and winter fuel allowance, of the need for electoral reform, Lords reform, and a new economic direction. He talks, they listen.Can he tilt for the leadership one day? Can he win it? My crystal ball is murky as ever. But primed to go, you see him standing “in the slips, straining upon the start”,as Shakespeare might have it, ready with plans to govern, and like so many others, deeply frustrated by the missteps that have cast Labour so low in so short a time.Next Thursday, Gorton and Denton won’t just yield a result – it will also reveal the shape of the battle to come.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsByelectionsOpinionLabourReform UKGreen partyAndy BurnhamFar rightcommentShareReuse this content"

At 16, Kemi Badenoch wasflipping burgers and cleaning toiletsin McDonald’s. Me, I waitressed at weekends from the age of 15 in an Essex pub owned by an ex-paratrooper with two formidable rottweilers roaming behind the bar, which was a life lesson all of its own.But whatever your first job may have been, there’s a reasonable chance it combined the thrill of hard cash with several mortifying mistakes and a crash course in handling stroppy customers, taking criticism more or less gracefully and moaning about it only out of earshot. Though teenage starter jobshave been in decline for decades– for reasons varying from academic pressures on sixth-formers to the rise of side hustles on Vinted that don’t show up in official statistics – everyone still has to start somewhere, even if it’s now more likely at 18 than 14. But getting that start is becoming harder than it was.This week, unemployment rates for 18- to 24-year-oldshit a highnot seen outside the pandemic since 2015. School leavers are now competing for work stacking shelves or pulling pints with overqualified new graduates who can’t find graduate jobs, at a time when pubs, shops and cafes don’t seem to be hiring. Even those employers strong enough to have survived lockdown routinely complain that it’s getting too expensive to hire staff – especially young ones.Ministers may slow youth minimum wage rise amid UK unemployment fearsRead moreThe Centre for Policy Studies thinktank calculates that itwill cost 26% moreto hire an 18- to 20-year-old by this spring than it did in 2024. That reflects government decisions taken for perfectly good reasons, including hiking employers’ national insurance to fund the NHS, plustwo chunky rises to the minimum wagefor the under-20s (now £10 an hour) in line with manifesto promises to level it up with the higher adult rate (now £12.21) over the course of a parliament. No matter how noble the motive, once it costs the same to hire four teenage Starmers as it once did to hire five,there are likely to be consequences. Yet until this week, when an internal Labour argument about whether they could be inadvertently pricing young people out of work spilled on to newspaper front pages, political debate over why so many young people don’t have jobs has mostly involved blaming them for being anxious snowflakes. Injury, meet insult.So in some ways it was refreshing to hear the former minister Alan Milburn, charged with reviewingwhy record numbers of 16- to 24-year-oldsare neither earning or learning,finally concede this week that this complex puzzle isn’t simply explained by a teenage mental health crisis. Anxiety, ADHD and autism diagnoses are rising worldwide,he told the BBC, but elsewhere that doesn’t seem to be driving teenagers out of work: our rates of young people not in education, employment or training (Neet) are treble those of the Netherlands. (Incidentally, Dutch teenagers have asignificantly lower minimum wagethan Dutch adults.) His review is nowconsidering economic factors. At least everyone can now be honest about what may or may not be going on.Our young people aren’t shirkers or snowflakes - they were failed by government policy. That changes now | Pat McFaddenRead moreBut with candour comes risks. The politics of watering down a manifesto pledge on the youth minimum wage would be hideous, and not just because it would be the latest in apainful run of U-turns.Dumping or delaying it would put Starmer in direct conflict not only with trade unions but with Angela Rayner, a more formidable political organiser than anyone in No 10.Give an inch on minimum wage, meanwhile, and the fear is that business will try to take a mile, pushing to delay the rollout of Rayner’s broader flagship package of workers’ rights until the economy is stronger.We have, of course, been around this block many times before. Every time new employment rights are introduced, employers claim they’ll cost jobs, and in a growing economy they often turn out to be crying wolf. But this time it’s not just the usual suspects howling.George Bain, who led the low pay commission that pushed through the original minimum wage against considerable corporate opposition,now believesa rising youth minimum wage is pushing up youth unemployment. I’ve heard the same from other veterans of the era. Gordon Brown, as chancellor, set a lower rate for the young precisely to encourage employers to take a risk on people needing first jobs. If you’re a pub landlord choosing between a gawky sixth former with no experience who will need closely supervising, and a seasoned 27-year-old with good references, who would you hire? Especially if the older one needs the job to pay their rent while the younger is mostly trying to save up for Reading festival tickets.For the lower rate also tacitly recognised that most under-20s aren’t wholly supporting themselves. Today, that’s if anything more true, with almost three-quarters of 19-year-olds and 61% of 20-year-oldsstill living with their parents, in homes where someone else probably fills the fridge. The vulnerable teenagers for whom that’s sadly not true, including those estranged from their families, meanwhile need the kind of intensive support that comes most reliably from in-work benefits.Almost 27 years on from its introduction, the minimum wage has drifted from its original purpose of ending exploitation. The idea was to create a decent floor from which people could rise into better jobs, helped by a booming economy: it was never the sole lever for raising living standards. But as successive governments struggled to reignite that boom, the minimum wage had to do more and more of the heavy lifting. There was always going to be a ceiling on how much employers could reasonably afford to pay, and now we may be hitting it.One cynical view of what’s happening is that the Treasury is privately prepared to see unemployment rise and some zombie businesses go to the wall in return for transitioning to a more productive hi-tech economy. If so, good luck selling that to a country that never voted for a re-run of the 1980s.But in the altogether less dramatic event that ministers conclude they’ve simply got the balance wrong for young people,as one minister hintedto the Times this week, then any tinkering is best done under cover of a broader rethink of how working poverty has changed since 1999. The worst option of all, meanwhile, would be to plough stubbornly on with something everyone worries might be making young people’s lives harder, just to avoid the embarrassment of admitting that for once your enemies might be right.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Can Labour come back from the brink?On Monday 30 April, ahead of May elections, join Gaby Hinsliff, Zoe Williams, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr as they discuss how much of a threat Labour faces from the Green party and Reform – and whether Keir Starmer can survive as leader of the Labour partyBook ticketshereExplore more on these topicsMinimum wageOpinionYoung peopleUnemploymentJob huntingKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Pauline Hanson, take noteSusan CarlandBeyond disproving the tired tropes of Muslims hating the west, Australian Muslims can show us what a month of practising to be a better person looks likeThu 19 Feb 2026 20.19 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 20.21 ESTShareAs Australian Muslims prepared for Ramadan this week, the leader of the second most popular political party in the country, Senator Pauline Hanson,said of them: “Their religion concerns me because [of] what it says in the Qur’an … They hate Westerners … You say, ‘Well, there’s good Muslims out there.’ Well, I’m sorry. How can you tell me there are good Muslims?”None of this is surprising. This same senator has twice worn a burqa into parliament,wrongly claimed that halal certification funds terrorism, and wanted a royal commission into Islam.At the same time as Hanson made her comments, Sydney’s Lakemba mosque has said it is facing “themost alarming situation since Cronulla” due to repeated threatening letters arriving at its doors. A large Melbourne mosque says it has increased security ahead of Ramadan due to Islamophobic incidents. This is after repeated reports of Islamophobia in Australia being at thehighestrecordedlevels.HappyRamadanto us.For Muslims, Ramadan commemorates the final time divine words crossed a metaphysical boundary into human language and crystallised as the Qur’an. In this month, adult Muslims abstain from all food, drink (yes, even water), and sex from before sunrise until after sunset. In Australia this year, that makes for about 16 hours each day.In a world where morality is increasingly privatised, the Muslim commitment to ritual confounds many Australians. This is why the sight of Muslims praying alongside a protest in Sydney last week was pondered as possibly “baiting” police, or at least behaviour that warrantedviolent intervention. That the prayer was not being conducted to make a point, to provoke or threaten, but was simply the fulfilment of a religious obligation without political strategy, was unfathomable to many.Ramadan also confuses people. Non-Muslim attitudes towards Ramadan range from ignorance, to scepticism, to outright disbelief. To them, the fast seems gruelling – even masochistic. People often look at me with concern and pity knowing it’s Ramadan. “That’s so sad,” a friend observed when I explained Ramadan.But Ramadan is not a desert, it’s a harbour. After 11 months of feeling battered on an ocean of conflict, chaos and pain, the annual Ramadan is a sheltered port I wearily float in to. The noise and the cruelty continue to hum, but the increased ritual, community, and reflection gently blanket me, allowing for a more patient, more generous, kinder version of myself to grow. Yes, Ramadan is physically and spiritually challenging, but it is also deeply rewarding and fulfilling, like running a marathon or delivering a baby.And yet fasting is not the point of Ramadan. It was never the point. Muslim religious texts tell us that if all we get from Ramadan is hunger and thirst, we’ve wasted our time.Pauline Hanson’s poison is rewarded with airtime and rising support. But fearmongers must be called out | Julianne SchultzRead moreFasting from food, water and sex – our most basic desires and needs – is done to show us wecangain mastery of ourselves. If we can control our instinctive reach for a snack through nothing but internal discipline, then we know we also have within our power the ability to control our other instincts that we all too easily indulge – anger, selfishness, gossip, contempt, spite, conceit. The behaviours that are so easy to slide into and are so socially corrosive. Ramadan is meant to make us good people. Good Muslims.Which highlights the irony of Hanson disputing now that there are any good Muslims. With Ramadan, Muslims embark on a rigorous month of trying to internally eradicate the very traits – contempt, suspicion, hate – directedatus.When later pushed on the point Hanson acknowledged perhaps good Muslims did exist, saying a non-practising Muslim woman had once stood for her party. However, should we think she was now tempering her previous comments, Hanson then affirmed, “I’m not going to apologise”.Beyond disproving the tired tropes of Muslims hating the west (the Australian Muslim surgeons, doctors, nurses, teachers, counsellors, cleaners, volunteers, pharmacists, paramedics, police officers, firefighters, psychologists and vets who serve this country every day beg to differ), there is something else Australian Muslims may have to offer this country: a month-long disciplined commitment to trying to be a better person. Of guarding your speech, of generosity, of kindness, of seeking forgiveness, of standing up for justice even if it’s against your own self.There are good Muslims – because we work at it. Maybe a few other Australians could work at it, too.Susan Carland is a sociologist of religion in the school of social sciences at Monash UniversityExplore more on these topicsPauline HansonOpinionRamadanIslamIslamophobiacommentShareReuse this content"

Does it also add a sudden, terrifying understanding of the abject horror of existence? Phil Noble’s apparently does. The Reuters photographer’s shot of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor leaving Aylsham police station in the back of his Range Rover is an image filled with shock, pain and horror. Noble’s harsh, blinding flash paints Andrew in pink, red and white – his skin is sickly, his eyes are hollow and red like a rat’s. His hands are steepled as if in prayer, like he’s pleading with a higher power for absolution.Much like the eerily similar 2019 picture of his father, Prince Philip, in a car, this photograph’s composition is one of pure luck. Noble took shots as Mountbatten-Windsor rushed past. Two were blank, two were of the police, one was out of focus. Only this one came out right. Only this one gave us a private glimpse of power crumbling and rotting away in real time.View image in fullscreenEerily similar … Prince Philip leaving hospital in 2019.Photograph: Jeff Gilbert/REX/ShutterstockIn the social media and cameraphone age, it’s harder than ever for a single image to stand out, to rise above the visual noise we are bombarded with. That this one has somehow done so shows how important and powerful it is. Whatever precise crimes Mountbatten-Windsor is or isn’t guilty of, in one incredibly fortuitous photo Noble has captured the visceral anguish of having to live with what you’ve done, and contend with its repercussions.It’s the eyes that do it. They suck you into the photo’s abyss: Mountbatten-Windsor is aghast, stupefied, frozen in wide-eyed dismay and distress. Those red eyes, like two little portals to hell, are not angry or vicious: they are dazed and overwhelmed. They’re the same eyes you see in the anguished howler of Edvard Munch’sThe Screamor Gustave Courbet’sDesperate Man.View image in fullscreenAnguished howler … The Scream by Edvard Munch.Photograph: Dennis Hallinan/AlamyThe same eyes you see over and over in Otto Dix’sDer Kriegseries of etchings, whereterrified facesglare out of the paper totally unable to make sense of the horrors they have witnessed on the sodden battlefields of the first world war. The figures in Dix’s work are victims, witnesses to trauma, people who have been forever scarred by what they have just survived.But what viewers –rightly or wrongly–read into this photo isn’t the loss of innocence or the trauma of victimhood. It is guilt and complicity. Something far closer to Francis Bacon’sscreaming popeseries of paintings of a powerful ecclesiastical figure being consumed by the pain of his own past.Or, even better, Francisco de Goya’s gothic nightmareSaturn Devouring His Son, a blackened, penumbral vision of a Titan driven to consume his own child because the goddess Gaia prophesied that one of his children would overthrow him. Here, the wide-eyed bewilderment of the central figure speaks of a personal horror, an admission that things have been done, and they can never be undone.View image in fullscreen‘It’s the eyes that do it’ … Self-portrait (The Desperate Man) by Gustave Courbet.Photograph: GL Archive/AlamyIt’s a long way from how royalty has been portrayed in history. All the gold, pomp and circumstance swapped for the end-of-empire, wipe-clean luxury of a Range Rover’s all-white leather interior and the mortifying shame of being the first senior royal to be arrested in modern history.Images of rulers are controlled, approved, mediated by the rulers themselves. Royals, despots and tyrants don’t allow any old portrait out into wider society. But this isn’t official, this isn’t mediated – it’s a window into a private moment. Royal families around the world must be furious that someone invented telephoto lenses.View image in fullscreenPenumbral vision … Saturn Devouring His Son by Francisco de Goya.Photograph: AlamyImportant royal portraits record a small handful of historic truths instead of a wider, more nuanced narrative. Most of us know absolutely nothing about Charles II of Spain, but one glimpse of his huge jaw inJuan Carreño de Miranda’s 17th century portraitof him triggers immediate thoughts of inbreeding and how it was a tool of control, greed and empire. This photo will tell a similar story in the future. It will forever tie the British royal family to theEpsteinfiles and all the grim truths they have revealed.Will this be their legacy? Will this be how history remembers the royals in the early 21st century? Not as gilded icons, or decorated, powerful leaders standing proud with chests covered in military medals like the royals of old – but as decaying, broken spectres that haunt a decaying, broken nation.10:54Andrew under investigation: what's next for the former prince? - The LatestExplore more on these topicsUK newsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Winkleman herself, who doesn’t come off at all breathy, said: “I can’t quite believe it and I’m incredibly grateful to the BBC for this amazing opportunity.” Kalpna Patel-Knight, who commissioned TheClaudia WinklemanShow, observed: “Claudia is a true national treasure – warm, witty and endlessly entertaining.” Graham Stuart, long-term producer/buddy of Graham Norton, who runs So Television, which produces both, said of his new venture: “How can you possibly follow [Graham Norton]? By booking a host equally as brilliant. So we have.”And if anything proves how hard it is to create great chat, it’s those quotes. If anyone was ever that bland and blow-hard on one of their chatshow sofas, most TV people would punch themselves in the head. No wonder so many chatshows struggle when they first come out – it’s not that the expectation is too high, exactly, so much as the fanfare is too boasty. Brilliant as she is, then, the success of Claudia’s new series is far from given. But how exactly do you go about creating chatshow magic?One tricky balancing act is getting the guests right. An awesome amount of energy goes into securing A-listers, but the bigger the name, the less they’ll say. Some host-guest magic needs to occur to leaven the stories, which pray God are not retreads. Graham Norton’s multiply populated sofa – which has its own formula, big ticket guest at the seat nearest Norton, a good mixer who is nice in the middle, and someone who is funny and can hold their own in seat three – is the show’s secret weapon. That’s even according to Norton, who told the Radio Times in 2010 (when his show was but three years old) that: “I’m really bad at actually interviewing people.” In an ideal world, the guests make their own magic (go watchLady Gaga and June Brown, AKA Dot Cotton), creating TV that’s lively and chaotic like a circus.View image in fullscreenDwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt, Matthew McConaughey, Graham Norton, James Norton, Raye on The Graham Norton Show.Photograph: Matt Crossick/So Television/PA Media/Then there’s the interview itself. In the same issue of Radio Times, Michael Parkinson, who’d hung up his mic in 2007, had a moan about chatshow formats where “television executives who really ought to know better … entrust the job to people who, more often than not, neither know how to ask a question nor listen to the answer.” But those days are long over; nobody really wants to watch people be interviewed any more. The question-answer format belongs to a more civil century, when you’d approach a celebrity the same way as a politician: searching, polite.Kirsty Wark, the Bafta-winning interviewer and ex-Newsnight host, who speaks to me over the phone while she babysits her brand new granddaughter, says that nowadays “entertainment interviews are a totally different kettle of fish from current affairs ones. Scratchiness is OK for political interviews, it’s a bit tricky for sofa interviews.” You could actually imagine Claudia Winkleman revivifying the old art of asking genuinely difficult things. She has a lot of natural authority, either caused or signified by the eyeliner, nobody knows which. But you can also imagine that going really wrong on contact with a thin-skinned Hollywood A-lister whose most significant disclosure that year was how he felt about lactose. The norms of celebrity interrupt human connection at every stage. Even the entourage a star walks in with creates some artificial power imbalance that chatshow hosts either kick against or cave into.Kirsty Warkstill remembers the time she interviewed George Clooney: “He just sauntered in on his own and it was so much nicer.”View image in fullscreen‘Entertainment interviews are a totally different kettle of fish’, says Kirsty Wark.Photograph: Mike Marsland/WireImageIf the chatshow isn’t really about interviewing, though, what the hell is it about? Jonathan Ross doesn’t love talking about his work because he gets into trouble running his mouth, but told the Guardian in 2010: “My talkshow is not an interview show as such, which is why I’m always bemused when critics say the interview wasn’t very good. And I think, but I’m not doing an interview! What I’m trying to do is make a comedy show. And that, trust me, is a fuck of a lot harder.” But is it? Seems like comedy, if you’re funny, is not as hard as the white-knuckle ride of creating a chemical reaction between people who are each flogging something (generally speaking) and have never met. Very often, and surely in Claudia Winkleman’s case, the question is: we have this gold-dust host whom everyone wants to watch – how on earth do we maximise that?In 1973, that person was Esther Rantzen. She didn’t say that, by the way, she’s way too modest: she tells the story ofThat’s Lifeas a magpie pilfer of the consumer show that went before it, from the Canadian actor Bernard Braden (Braden’s Week). She was a researcher on that and, when he went back to Canada, turned it into something that people definitely watched for Rantzen herself, and it was massive.View image in fullscreen‘Mrs Thatcher and John Major watched it [That’s Life], because they knew that their voters watched it’, says Esther Rantzen.Photograph: David McHugh/Brighton Pictures/Shutterstock“In those pre-fragmented days, we had audiences, regularly, of around 15 million, at its height, 22 million. Mrs Thatcher and John Major watched it, because they knew that their voters watched it,” she tells me on the phone while her daughter makes her some lunch.She can’t watch herself now, she says, “like actors sometimes say they don’t like watching themselves on film, because there’s nothing you can do to improve it. I do shudder when I watch it, and I’m sure there would have been viewers that felt the same.”It is just a fact that you can’t be that person – that national treasure, that water-cooler main character – if you don’t excite strong feelings in the audience, which means you have to split the crowd a bit. The Princess of Wales, for instance, could not host a chatshow. Claudia Winkleman comes off as someone who has the backbone to be 90% loved and 10% loathed, which matters, because it’s not fun loathing people unless they seem as if they’ll brush it off with casual self-deprecation. (Rantzen sat in for Terry Wogan once in 1986, and interviewed Anthony Perkins, who took umbrage at one of her questions: “He had a fantastic go at me, and said: ‘All the aficionados know that that’s the truth,’ and I said: ‘With my teeth, I can’t even say aficionados.’”)Part of That’s Life’s success was that it wasabout a thing. The key to its longevity (it ran for 21 years – and led to Rantzen getting her own spin-off chatshow, Esther) was that it evolved, from low-stakes outrages (people selling fake slimming tea) or things that were funny (a dog that could say sausages) to campaigns. The first, in 1984, about Ben Hardwick, a toddler who needed a liver transplant, doubled the number of transplants in the immediate aftermath. In this more cynical age – and given how difficult it would be to keep it apolitical – pioneering social affairs content like that would be impossible to pull off.View image in fullscreenHugh Grant during an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, 1995.Photograph: Margaret Norton/NBC/Getty ImagesIf sofa magic is hard to conjure, some dynamics are pretty failsafe. Norton said once (when he himself was a guest, on Late Night With Seth Meyers): “I think what’s good about actors is sometimes they don’t care about the audience but they care about each other. So if an actor tells a funny story, you can see someone seething, like: ‘I have a funny story! I shat myself!’ So the stakes get higher and higher.” Winkleman brings something extra to the baseline of competitiveness, which is that people want to show off in front of her. You can see it inThe Traitorsbetter than onStrictly, where everyone is showing off already – the way the Traitors, celebrity and regular, stand up straighter, mugging not for the cameras but for her twinkly approval. If you could bottle chatshow chemistry, that would be a big part of it – but sadly we’ve established that you can’t.Ultimately, the key is to make TV that’s memorable. Hosts and audiences remember discord on a chatshow word for word (Michael Parkinson and Meg Ryan; Terry Wogan and George Best) and they remember when things were funny, even if they can’t recall what anyone said. Moments of spontaneous connection and openness (Freddie Flintoff on Jonathan Ross, Hugh Grant’s mea culpa about that blowjob on Jay Leno – look it up, young’uns)are also extremely watchable, they’re just quite rare; if you could turn it on and off like a tap, it wouldn’t be authentic.“You’ve got to do your homework but, in a sense, throw it all away,” Kirsty Wark says, “and follow the conversation. I did the last interview with Harold Pinter before he died. I think he knew that he wasn’t well. People who are less well known and perhaps less practised, that conversation sometimes flows more naturally. But I also feel that people who are comfortable in their skin give better interviews.” They also make better interviewers, on which terms, Claudia Winkleman should absolutely smash this.

With Alan Cumming set to helm the Baftas on Sunday, here’s what he needs to knowAndrew PulverFri 20 Feb 2026 11.15 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 14.54 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleNo modern film awards show is complete without a wisecracking host, who has the tricky job of compering the evening, bringing people on and off stage in rapid succession, keeping a restless audience entertained, and coming up with a decent comedy routine themselves. Hence the attention that is paid to the annual announcement of the Baftas, Golden Globes and Oscars hosts; they are gigs that can flourish in the cultural memory, such asTina Fey and Amy Poehler’s multiple turns at the Golden Globes, or become infamous,such as Anne Hathaway and James Franco’s double act at the Academy Awards in 2011, which saw themcastigated as “children” and “spectacularly unwatchable”by the media.In December, the Baftas announced that Scottish actor Alan Cumming was to host of the 79th edition of the event, which takes place on Sunday; he takes over from fellow actor and Scot David Tennant, who occupied the berth in 2024 and 2025. Tennant was given amiddling review for his effortslast year by the Guardian’s Gwilym Mumford, who called him “a game host, a willing song and dance man, but he definitely needs more help from whoever’s writing his gags” – but that was glowing compared with the notices that arrived for Absolutely Fabulous star Joanna Lumley after her turn in 2019; in an article headlined “Is Joanna Lumley the worst Baftas host of all time?”the Guardian said: “Watching it on TV was excruciating. Not only were the jokes bad, but the Bafta audience responded with a total, ominous silence.” Following the Lumley debacle, Bafta managed to claw back some credibility by hiring Graham Norton in 2020 (“a safe pair of hands”) and a well-reviewed Rebel Wilson in 2022 (“rescues Baftas”).View image in fullscreen‘A willing song and dance man’ … David Tennant at the helm of the 2025 Baftas.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/Getty Images for BaftaTheactor and film-maker Alice Lowe, who presented three London film critics’ awards with her acting partner Steve Oram, says that awards show presenting is not as intimidating as it may seem. “Personally I don’t think it’s that much of a tough gig if you are used to live performance. The trick is not being so annoying that people hate you. I think they thought we would bring a sort of authenticity to it, which is why I suspect they asked me and Steve.”Lowe adds: “I made sure I did my homework and watched the films nominated, knew who the nominees were and how to pronounce their names – I didn’t want some kind of John Travolta mispronunciation scenario. We also ran any jokes past the organisers.”Travolta’s difficulties in introducing Frozen star Idina Menzel– calling her Adela Dazeem at the 2014 Oscars – have since become regardedone of the all-time great awards show blunders.Anna Smith, presenter of the Girls on Film podcast and chair of the London film critics’ circle from 2014 to 2020, was part of the committee that hired Lowe and Oram. She says that the choice of host is key to a successful night: “It’s good to have someone to set the tone of the event, to give a sense of occasion and to keep things running smoothly and to time. What organisers look for is a familiar face who understands the nature of the awards, and who’s prepared to do their research. They don’t necessarily need to be a comedian, but they do need to have a sense of humour and charisma. Most importantly, they need to be relaxed in front of a large audience of celebrities.”View image in fullscreenThat’s how it’s done … Tina Fey and Amy Poehler at the 2015 Golden Globes.Photograph: Paul Drinkwater/APAs the Hathaway/Franco and Lumley experience demonstrates, the charisma and comedy timing that actors can display on screen doesn’t always translate well to the live presenting environment, where standup comedians and talkshow hosts often seem more comfortable. Lowe says that it’s “the ‘being yourself’ thing which throws actors”, adding: “They often start to malfunction in a fascinating way. Comedians, on the other hand, have an exalted position as jesters who are there to tear things apart anyway, so it’s sort of allowed to be a bit rude and disregarding of the pomp of it.”The joke writers – often anonymous, behind-the-scenes figures – are a key part of the process, Lowe says. “It’s not about you. It’s about putting yourself into the other person’s shoes and preempting how they feel, and putting them at ease.” But even for comedians well versed in the art of the roast, things can go badly: seeJo Koy’s disastrous routine at the Golden Globesin 2024, orSeth MacFarlane’s poorly received We Saw Your Boobs songat the 2013 Oscars.Combat intensifies as One Battle After Another takes 14 Bafta nominations to Sinners’ 13Read moreWhile memory may dwell on the disasters that awards shows can serve up, an inspired host can provide a positive cultural experience on a gigantic scale.The selfie taken by actor-director Bradley Cooperat the 2014 Oscar ceremony, which featured a number of Hollywood stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, and event host Ellen DeGeneres, became the most reposted item on what was then Twitter (now X). Lowe says that Jonathan Ross, who helmed the Bafta film awards five times, from 2007 to 2011, is the most impressive host she has seen. “It was the way he seamlessly segued from chatting to people and putting them at ease in the commercial breaks, into scripted Autocue moments, and then improvised gags in response to unpredicted events. A very smooth operator, and supremely relaxed, which is the key.”This year’s Bafta film awards, hosted byAlan Cumming, take place on Sunday at the Royal Festival Hall in London, and will air on BBC One.Explore more on these topicsFilmBaftasOscarsBaftas 2026Oscars 2026Golden GlobesAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

She explains why she’s fighting for her fellow council estate kidsSupported byAbout this contentFri 20 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAlthough she is on course for pop stardom, with two nominations at next week’sBrit awards, 22-year-old Skye Newman lives in a cabin at the bottom of her sister’s garden in London. It’s the backdrop for the music video to her song Hairdresser, which has 7.5m views on YouTube. In the clip, she is made up, her hair in rollers, lounging with a gaggle of friends. Licking her fingertips to roll a joint, she laments a one-sided friendship with another woman: “When I’m needed, know I’ll be there first / You don’t reciprocate and, girl, that hurts.”It’s typical of Newman’s songcraft: ballad-driven contemporary soul that goes beyond romantic heartbreak to cover all kinds of pain and recrimination.The cabin gives Newman independence, but also proximity to family in the main house – which is where she is sitting today, barefaced, barefoot and drowning in an oversized black tracksuit. Her sister, who is also Newman’s manager, pops my tea on to the table and hovers nearby. The sisters each have their blond hair slicked back into topknots. Today is a busy day and tomorrow they fly to the US where Newman has two sold-out shows.Watch a video for Skye Newman: HairdresserNewman’s family is the subject of her biggest song to date, Family Matters, which is nominated for song of the year at the Brits (she is also up for breakthrough artist). It lays bare the pain that she experienced growing up: phone calls from the police, drug abuse in her home, a brush with death. “At school, weed was my perfume,” she sings. “Then my brother’s drugs got harder / It became substance abuse, so he’s a stupid bastard.”Understandably, she guards the details of her family history closely, but the accumulation of stresses that she and her siblings were living with contributed to her having two life-threatening seizures, being admitted to hospital and having tests for a tumour or bleed on the brain. As for the situation she sings about in Family Matters, she says: “We all just tried to love him, because that’s all you can do. It’s weird to grieve for someone who is still alive.” In the comments for the song on YouTube, fans earnestly offer support to Newman and compare her to Amy Winehouse and Adele.Newman shares some qualities with those two generational talents: a voice that could move a rock, energy that fizzes as she speaks and that magical ability to distil a sentiment in a way that feels completely personal to an audience of millions. One key difference is that she was twice rejected from the Brit school, the performing arts institution from which both Adele and Winehouse graduated.Instead, as a teenager she started posting performance videos on social media, which blew up during the Covid lockdown. She was initially hesitant to reply to the calls that soon followed from A&Rs and record labels. “I come from a vulnerable background and there are vultures in this world,” she says. “People jump on that.”The council estates she grew up on taught her a lot more besides, and she attributes her storytelling to the range of people she saw as she moved around south-east London living with various family members: “Life can be hard but I love the way I grew up because I got to experience and understand people,” she says. “It made me very empathetic.”She is passionate about putting a spotlight on people who grew up in similar environments. “There could be so much more love and education put into people who have less because there is so much knowledge in those places; there’s so much talent but they don’t get the same opportunities.”View image in fullscreenNewman on stage with Ed Sheeran in Ipswich, his home town, last July.Photograph: Mark SurridgeAnother artist who shares these sentiments isEd Sheeran, who recently made a plea to the governmentto invest more in music in the school curriculum. He asked Newman to do a support set at his Ipswich homecoming in 2025, where they also performed together. “He’s the sweetest man. He’s just so normal, same as Lewis,” as in Capaldi, who she supported on tour last year. “I’m drawn to them people, because that’s how I am. I’m not above nobody, nobody’s above me.”Ahead of our interview, her team shared some unreleased music including The Woman I Am, a flawless piano ballad about the female relationships that have held her through difficult times. Here, Newman’s voice sounds softer and more controlled than it is on her breakthrough songs.I ask about the times when she needed that support. “My whole life,” she says with another laugh. “My whole life, I feel like there’s been …” Then her voice wobbles and there are tears. Her sister shuffles over in her slippers and wraps her arms around Skye.double quotation markThere’s no better feeling than knowing that something I’ve gone through has done something for others“I hate saying it because I feel like it sounds like ‘poor me’,” Newman says, still crying. “I’m good; I’m a very fucking strong person, I’ve got lots of strong women around me. But it’s never-ending. That’s the circumstances that I’m in, with family and things.”Again, she holds back from outlining those exact circumstances. She gathers herself: “I’m grateful, because it means I can write so much music that helps so many other people.” A lot of them have told her as much. “It breaks my heart every time I have to hear that, especially from kids,” she continues. “But there’s no better feeling than knowing that something I’ve gone through has done something for them. I feel powerful. It makes me feel great to know that they’re not alone. That I’m not alone.”She also writes vividly about the toxicity that can tear relationships apart. On Out Out, she pleads with a closed-off partner: “Is it really that hard to just love me loudly?” It’s the sort of relatable sentiment that speaks to women of her age, and older. “Not having solid role models to look up to in the space of men, it’s quite hard to then pick the right person,” she says. “I feel like I attract hurt and I attract brokenness. I also fight for things that I shouldn’t.”View image in fullscreenNewman  at Koko, London, in September.Photograph: Jessie MorganOn her recent single Lonely Girl, Newman speaks to teenage girls like an older sister: “Please don’t let him take control / He’s far too old / To be the one that takes you home.” The song was inspired by a friend of hers who, aged 15, was involved with a 21-year-old. Newman says many friends have experienced such predatory behaviour, and she herself was chased and intimidated by men when she was as young as 12.“I got more attention from men, builders, from the age of 12 to 16, and then it just got less and less as I got older,” she says. Then she asks: “As a grown woman, do you really get catcalled in the street as much as you did as a child?” The question takes me by surprise, but the answer is no. “A lot of it is about control,” Newman concludes. “There’s men that do it that are paedophiles, and then there’s the men that do it because they’re like: well, you can’t do anything about it.”double quotation markWe’re in hell, mate, and we need to work our way to find inner peace. On the other side of that is heavenA fire gets going inside her. “Most men think that a woman is frail, weak and dependent. No, we’re not. A feminine woman is independent.” She moves from having her feet tucked under her to stretching out and gesticulating. “It winds me up. We need to go back to women ruling the world.”During The Woman I Am, she sings “our cycles are in sync, it’s bigger than you think”. “We’ve been knocked off of our fucking cycles [by men]. We’re meant to be in sync with the Earth and nature: it’s Mother Nature for a reason,” she says, carrying on riffing, pointing out that there are species that procreate without male input. “I honestly do believe women used to be like that. We got fucking bored and we created the man. Because what are you? You are half of what we are. You’re just our chromosomes with a leg knocked off.”She says she believes in another power above her, though not a male God figure. “I don’t believe that this” – our world – “is everything. If anything, I think this is hell. We’re in hell, mate, and we need to work our way to find inner peace. On the other side of that is heaven.”View image in fullscreenSkye Newman after performing for Radio 1’s Sound of 2026 live sessions, with the station’s presenter Jack Saunders.Illustration: James Watkins/BBCIt’s enjoyable watching her go off like this, with a power she has evidently snatched back for herself and channelled into her songs. That process has probably saved her life, she thinks. After experiencing those near-death seizures, brought on by emotional distress, she then “flipped my thinking” and stopped bottling things up. She started writing. “It’s how I let everything out healthily. I don’t know what I would do without it.” One of the songs she wrote then, not yet released, is a real tearjerker as she sings: “I’m going to be selfish with my life, because it’s mine.”‘Addiction teaches you a lot’: breakout pop star Lola Young on sex, substances and self-loathingRead more“I felt like that song was God, the universe, my auntie, whoever, showing me that if you think about yourself, and you put good back into yourself, then your body will naturally give back to you,” she says. “That’s just what happened.” She was signed to a major label and in January she topped the BBC’s Sound of … poll, the breakthrough artist contest won in recent years byChappell RoanandPinkPantheress. “Hairdresser went off, Family Matters went off, everything just went. People say: how do you do it? And I’m like: your thoughts are so fucking powerful!”As her star power also increases, she says she is mindful of “not falling into the whirlwind of this”. With so much turbulence in her life before this new chapter, she is happy to be close to her sister with her own space to breathe – “I enjoy sitting in my cabin with my friends, smoking weed, watching films and that’s it” – and she’s finding that in an industry that can be slippery and attract people with ulterior motives, she wants to protect herself. “I feel like a lot of this world is just kind of an exchange, and not in a good way. Scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours – and I’ll do it when needs be. But I just don’t feel the need to put myself in all of it. I’m quite happy with the people I’ve got in my life. I’m quite happy with my life the way it is. Quite happy with my cabin.”Skye Newman’sUK tourbegins 11 April at Mountford Hall, Liverpool. The Brit awards are on 28 February, screening on ITV.

They stretch out in his face and spill out of his mouth. He’s a magnet for oddity, imitating the peculiarities of the people he’s grown up with: his grandmother’s lipstick eyebrows; his big-hearted uncle’s old-lady arm candy.In this meandering collection of anecdotes from the comedian’s high-octane upbringing in New Mexico, Allen – best known as one half of the influential comedy duo the Pajama Men, kings of mime and improv – browses through his dressing-up box of voices, trying them on for size. He’s done this since he was a kid, he tells us, to help him get through “the tetchy bits” of life. Of which his has been extremely full.Flashes of mime remind us of the potential of his malleable features, only sparsely used. Instead, Bloodlust Summertime, created with feral comedian Kim Noble, is a haphazard quest for the “unnamed dread” Allen’s therapist has lumped on him. Could it be from the accidental killing in his family? Or the very deliberate murders he has witnessed the immediate aftermath of? Perhaps it was the time he was told his dad was the devil and had his whole life ripped away. Allen breezes through the many strange darknesses he’s encountered, including more guns than one man should ever see, but he’s adept at plucking the funny from the foul. Though the structure of the show feels loose, there’s no shortage of wild experiences to exorcise.Noble’s influence is felt most keenly further in, as flesh boils, fingers are severed and the gunshot count increases. The stories get darker, but they remain discreet, lacking a coherent trajectory to this cluster of personal demons. A little tech trouble is navigated with ease, but it’s indicative of a show that still feels like a work in progress, while Allen continues to pinpoint the root of that dastardly dread.AtSoho theatre, London, until 21 February.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreSoho theatreComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now the two are exhibiting their massive, moving installations in two parallel exhibitionsMarigold WarnerFri 20 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThese clothes are not “secondhand”, says Yin Xiuzhen, the Beijing-born artist known for creating large-scale installations out of found garments and keepsakes. “I prefer to call them ‘used’ or ‘worn’,” she explains. “Clothes that have been ‘worn’ carry a lot of information … like a second skin, imprinted with social meaning.” In some of Yin’s works the clothes are her own, telling a personal story. In others, the clothes are collected, stained and stretched across towering steel frames resembling planes, trains or organic forms.Yin is showing a selection of these works in Heart to Heart,an exhibition occupying the lower floor of London’s Hayward Gallery. “Worn clothing acts as a narrator in my work … the lived experience is embedded in the fabric,” she says.View image in fullscreenYin’s Dress Box.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Beijing Commune.This sentiment is somewhat shared by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota, whose exhibition, Threads of Life, runsconcurrently on the second floor of the gallery. Using thread as her primary material, the Berlin-based artist weaves found objects such as suitcases, keys and letters into monumental web-like installations. “I want to create this feeling of shared experience and existence,” she says. “Memory exists inside each person, but it is also connected to objects in our daily life.”The two artists have exhibited on the same programme at biennials, but never in such close proximity. While their exhibitions are distinct, Hayward Gallery’s senior curator Yung Ma hopes that the artists’ overlapping interests will resonate between the gallery walls. “Both artists explore how textiles and found objects can carry identity and lived experience,” he says. Although they are roughly 10 years apart in age – Yin was born in 1963, and Shiota in 1972 – they rose to the international stage at around the same time in the late 90s. “Two female artists … with such strong overlapping interests – that feels significant,” says Ma.View image in fullscreenYin Xiuzhen’s Thought.Photograph: Yin Xiuzhen/Beijing Commune/Pace GalleryMemory and material are the most evident parallels in their work, but they approach it from different positions. “We use similar materials and objects, like suitcases, and an interest in various aspects of human existence within society, but our exhibitions have different focuses,” says Shiota.Both artists work with textiles, but Shiota’s use of yarn is more abstract. She started working with material in the 00s, but before that she was a painter and then a performance artist studying under Marina Abramović in Berlin. “With painting, you’re working in two dimensions, but by using thread, I could draw throughout the entire space,” she says. “As I continued working with it, the act began to feel very close to human relationships … Sometimes the thread looks like it’s connecting people; at other times, when my work becomes very tangled, it reflects moments when my own feelings are confused or unsettled.”View image in fullscreenChiharu Shiota’s Breathing from Earth.Photograph: Sabine Klem/DACS/Chiharu ShiotaThis material is the literal and figurative thread that ties collective memories and experiences together, represented by objects that Shiota collects from flea markets and donation boxes. Her work is deeply emotive and engulfing, crafted entirely by hand on site using thousands of balls of yarn. However, the result is not always inviting. During Sleepis an installation with a performance element in which women lie in hospital beds encased in a dense black thread. The performance, which will take place monthly across the run of the Hayward exhibition, represents Shiota’s interest in mortality and the fragility of life.These are themes that draw from her personal battles with ovarian cancer – first in 2005 and again in 2017. The first diagnosis was a “huge shock”, she says, arriving just as the artist was planning to have a child with her husband of three years. “The fear that I might not be able to give birth was very painful,” she says. After intense chemotherapy and surgery, Shiota recovered and was able to have a child. But after a 12-year remission, the doctors found a malignant tumour. “The second time was different,” she says. “At that point, it wasn’t a question of what to do next – it was a real possibility that I might die.” Shiota was just starting to work on her landmark solo exhibition, The Soul Trembles, at Tokyo’s MoriArtMuseum. “It was incredibly hard … I thought deeply about what happens to the soul and where it goes if I disappear.” The 2019 show became the second-most visited exhibition in the institution’s history. “I truly could have died,” says Shiota, whose cancer is now in remission. “Just being able to have that exhibition felt incredibly special in itself.”View image in fullscreenChiharu Shiota’s The Key in the Hand.Photograph: Sunhi Mang/DACS/Chiharu ShiotaWhile Shiota’s craft is informed by her inner landscape, Yin’s work is often a reaction to the changing world around her – “the perceptions and reflections of an individual life within the vastness of the world”, as she puts it. For her, clothing is a medium that is deeply intertwined with her personal life and her country’s history. Yin grew up during the Cultural Revolution, in a planned economy where new garments were a rarity. Luckily, her mother worked in a clothing factory, and every Chinese lunar new year she brought home scraps of fabric to sew new clothes for the family. Through her mother, Yin developed a kinship with textiles, and after graduating high school in 1981 she set her heart on studying art. She spent the next four years working as an interior painter while preparing for entrance exams, eventually enrolling in the Department of Fine Arts at Beijing’s Capital Normal University in 1985.Yin’s earliest work to feature clothing is Dress Box(1995). The artist gathered 30 years of her own clothes, placed them in her father’s wooden chest and sealed it with cement. Inside the lid on a bronze plaque are the following words: “These clothes are the clothes that I’ve worn over the past three decades; they carry my experiences, memory, and physical traces of time.” Yin is entombing the past, while reflecting on the transformation she has witnessed throughout her life. The artist has seen multiple tower blocks displace traditional houses and alleys; she has been forced out of her own studio more than once.View image in fullscreenYin Xiuzhen’s Thought.Photograph: Yin Xiuzhen/Beijing Commune/Pace GalleryPortable Citiesis an ongoing series that reflects on urbanisation. She collects clothes from people all over the world and repurposes them into miniature soft sculptures of their cities, housed in an open suitcase. For the Hayward show, she presents eight iterations of the project, including Beijing, New York and the latest edition, London. In the lead-up to the Hayward show, Yin collected nearly 180 items of clothing through a donation box at the Southbank Centre. “It forms a tactile map of the city in my heart,” she says. “Those who donated garments may be able to locate their personal contribution within the work.”Both exhibitions make full use of Hayward’s expansive space, featuring floor-to-ceiling installations visitors can walk through. Through collected objects, they map the experiences that connect us – and preserve the stories embedded in everyday things, long after we’re gone.Chiharu Shiota’s Threads of LifeandYin Xiuzhen’s Heart to Heartare at the Hayward Gallery, London, to3 May.Explore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can they revive the UK’s love of them?Fri 20 Feb 2026 05.44 ESTLast modified on Fri 20 Feb 2026 09.16 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on Google“You wouldn’t seeOlivia Colmandoing this bollocks would you?” jokesDanny Dyeras he clears up a dustbin at Priory Hill & Nutts Farm Holiday Park in Kent.But over the past year – around filming the return of the hit Disney+ seriesRivals– the actor, and his daughter Dani, have been spending weekends on the Isle of Sheppey, filming The Dyers’ Caravan Park (Sky One) in an attempt to boost the fortunes of Priory Hill and make caravanning cool.As Danny puts it: “[Jeremy] Clarkson’s got a farm, Richard Hammond’s got a workshop … if Jamie Oliver can save school dinners, then why can’t we save the great British holiday?”The pair have got properly involved – from cleaning the caravans to donning a bear costume to entertain children, to sorting out the issue of poos in the park’s indoor swimming pool.Danny says he wanted to make the show as he adored his childhood holidays with his extended family in a caravan park in Canvey Island. “There was a real sense of community,” he says, “which I think in today’s world is severely lacking. It was the best time of my life, running about getting a bit of sea air in my lungs. These places are dying out.”Dyer does not own Priory Hill (it has been in the Butcher family since 1951) but he has invested in it; staking not just his money but his reputation. Sitting in Priory Hill’s clubhouse with Dani, he says: “We’re living in a very divisive time, it’s very difficult, and … no one’s really interacting with each other any more [due to] social media.View image in fullscreenDanny and Dani relaxing inside one of the caravans.Photograph: Ellis O’Brien / Sky“I do think, on a caravan site, the kids [are] just playing, laughing on bikes … fresh air in their fucking lungs. [It’s] such a beautiful thing to watch … can we bring that back? Can we get kids out all day, getting naturally tired instead of having their brain just zapped all day? Can we make that an exciting thing again?”Sporting the moustache he has grown for Rivals’ Freddie Jones, Danny says older generations love caravanning but, “it’s about trying to get the next generation involved … It’s so accessible to go abroad, and probably cheaper.”He acknowledges that there is a fair degree of snobbery to overcome: some people he has spoken to, “just don’t understand [the appeal]; they turn their nose up at it slightly. I think the elitism comes from, it’s a very working-class holiday … So if you’ve got a few quid, then you probably wouldn’t buy a caravan.”Yet, Dani explains, new luxury ones have all mod cons and are “so cosy” but expensive. One on the seafront cost more than £50,000 (with a boutique hotel-style interior) but the Dyers sold it by making an amusingsocial media video.Expectation’s creative director, entertainment Ben Wicks said the pair want to ensure, “everyone is having the time of their life when they’re on the park” and Danny has, “got a real social conscience. He worries about things that not everyone worries about.”The pair are happy to send themselves up and acknowledge mistakes: one marketing initiative, involving a giant billboard by the Sheppey Bridge, backfired and was targeted with graffiti.Danny was keen to get Dani onboard the series because she had more youthful ideas (she has successfully introduced glamping to the site) and was able to rein in his more extravagant plans.Attending a residents’ meeting to discuss improvements led to the pair holding a sports day, complete with a mobility scooter – a “granny prix”. It was a hit, but cost about £10,000.The show is made by Expectation TV, the company responsible forClarkson’s Farm, and there are similarities – particularly the idea of its fish-out-of-water celebrity stars being guided by knowledgable local workers and characterful residents.But Leysdown-on-Sea is less affluent than the Cotswolds, and more open to the TV tourism the Sky show could bring. As Priory Hill’s co-owner Jimi Butcher explains: “Already the hype in Leysdown is incredible.”View image in fullscreenDani Dyer gets stuck in to the cleaning routine.Photograph: Ellis O’Brien/Ellis O’Brien / SkyWhen I visited the island, the locals were friendly but there was evidence that some are struggling. One business had a sign saying: “Closed for now due to problems.” But the town and Priory Hill & Nutts Farm have stunning views across the bay to Whitstable – that beacon of how a once run-down town can be rejuvenated by tourism.The pair hope the show will help reinvigorate a “very deprived” area that has “a real charm”. Although, says Dani, their other aim is to not “tread on” the owners’ toes, but to “put a lot of smiles on people’s faces” – from viewers to Priory Hill’s residents and managers.However, Priory Hill was badly affected by Covid and the cost of living; when the Dyers got involved the business had 38 empty pitches, causing a loss of £150,000 in potential revenue per annum.The co-owners, Alex and Jimi, lost their father, Michael, (who previously ran the park) seven years ago and say “it’s not been the same” since, but the Dyers have “brought some energy back”.This has included star appearances from EastEnders actorShaun Williamsonand Harry Redknapp, who helped with a football tournament the Dyers organised to bring the site’s residents together.With his lauded appearance onITV’s The Assemblyand Rivals, Danny’s career is experiencing a renaissance. “We don’t know how [the show] is going to be received,” he says, but he and his daughter feel a responsibility towards the residents and to try to use their fame wisely – even if his public persona doesn’t always open doors for him.View image in fullscreenDani and Danny patrolling the site.Photograph: Ellis O’Brien/Ellis O’Brien / Sky“I am from a working-class background. People might have had a perception of me and [Dani], and then if they don’t really like you it’s about trying to win them over.”He says he is “getting better” at dealing with fame and remembering to be “true to yourself”, not “losing [who] the fuck you are. Being famous … it’s very toxic. I do love being in these sort of surroundings, I really do, around other peasants like me!” he jokes.But not everything he is working on is down to earth. He’s been writing a play about his friendship with his late mentor Harold Pinter, called When Harry Met Danny. “And,” he says, “I would love to play Harold.”The Dyers’ Caravan Park launches 24 Feb on Sky and NowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDanny DyerinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Luckily, pianist Tamara Stefanovich had something else in mind.Titled Labyrinth, Stefanovich’s recital proposed an essay in sound in which Kurtág’s short piano works (many from ongoing series Játékok) were woven into and out of works by Debussy, Liszt and JS Bach. Performing this 90-minute cycle without pause, smudging the edges between pieces, Stefanovich paid homage to a composer whose sound world is alive with musical ghosts, drawing out its echoes and exposing its palimpsests.Bach’s early Capriccio for the departure of a beloved brother – an unusual, programmatic sequence of musical tableaux – stared into the mirror of Kurtág’s mercurial Eight Piano Pieces, No 3’s slippery interplay of voices glancing back to Bach’s counterpoint (now receding in the fog), but also reaching out towards the chalky impressionism of Debussy. Apple Blossom (one of Játékok’s many musical games) was a Schumann or Mendelssohn folk song that had strayed from the homeward path, wandering directly into Liszt’s late Nuages gris in a sleight of hand that left you questioning your own ears. Surely these persistent, unresolved storm clouds belonged to another century?Not content with blurring repertoire, Stefanovich also smeared styles. Kurtág was theatrical, almost Romantic in the scope of its gestures, Debussy all negative space and modernity. Heavily pedalled, often strident, her Bach won’t have been for everyone, but with so much musical aphorism and impermanence you can understand Stefanovich casting him as earth wire, or thread through the maze.Her decision to close with the final Contrapunctus from The Art of Fugue – suddenly broken off at the place Bach left it unfinished – was inspired: a jagged fragment ripped from the book in real time. Kurtág’s Pantomime saw Stefanovich’s hands approach the keyboard by way of coda, before coyly darting away without a sound struck. Wit and silence; the only possible birthday tribute to a singular musical voice.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

She died in 2022 and the tapes remained hidden in herManchesterhome. They have never been broadcast until now.How the ‘Lowry effect’ is rejuvenating Salford and Manchester: a tour of the artist’s old haunts and new shrinesRead moreLowry bared his soul to her. He confided that his family and friends had teased him about his paintings. “I made no money,” he said. “People laughed heartily at them … All my friends used to joke about it: ‘How’s the art trade?’; ‘Are you making your fortune out of it?’; ‘Don’t be such a fool, why don’t you give it up?’”Lowry had enrolled at the age of 17 for evening art classes. On selling his first painting, he said: “It was in 1921. And I got the sum of £5 for it. I was 34 … My family got the shock of their lives when I sold it. They couldn’t believe it was possible I could sell anything.”Asked whether his mother liked his paintings, Lowry replied: “No, I don’t think so. And me father [who worked as a clerk for an estate agent] used to have hysterics if I sold a picture. He couldn’t understand it.”Lowry became disheartened: “I was often very, very fed up. I said what’s the point of doing this, many a time.”View image in fullscreenLS Lowry (played by Ian McKellen) bared his soul to Angela Barratt, a young fan (played by Annabel Smith).Photograph: BBC/Wall to Wall Media/Connor Harris/PAYet Lowry is loved by the public for his unique depictions of working-class urban life, mill scenes and industrial landscapes in the north ofEngland, peopled with his distinctive matchstick men.When his family faced financial difficulties, they moved to Pendlebury in Salford, then an area blighted by pollution, noise and poverty: “I didn’t like it at all for a long time, and I couldn’t get used to it. And then I got fascinated by it. I began to think after a time, has anybody ever painted this scene? And I found they hadn’t.”Asked whether he preferred an “industrial” view to “places which are beautiful”, he replied: “I don’t like the south of England, if that’s what you mean. It’s harmless. No guts in it … Dull … Horrible place.”Lowry worked as a rent collector for the same Manchester property company for 42 years. He feared that if people knew about his day job they would assume that he only painted in his spare time and was therefore an amateur. He really wanted to be taken seriously.One of his friends says in the documentary that they only found out about his job after he died. “Somebody told us, and in all honesty, we didn’t believe it. We thought that they were mistaken. It was a little hurtful that one felt that one was very close to this man, and he kept a secret.”When Barratt paid tribute to him for putting the “industrial scene on the map [with] these wonderful paintings”, Lowry replied modestly: “That’s very nice of you. Thank you for that.”He added: “I feel about my painting, I did as well as I could.”LS Lowry: The Unheard Tapes will be released onBBC Twoand BBC iPlayer on 25 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsLS LowryIan McKellenPaintingNorth of EnglandBBC TwoManchesterBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

Sadly it raises more questions than it answersLucy ManganThu 19 Feb 2026 19.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 19.19 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThere are a lot of unanswered – possibly unanswerable – questions in the air at the moment. Questions such as what prompts a husband to drug his wife and, for a decade,invite strange men over to his houseto rape her while she lies unconscious in the marital bed? Or: what kind of a person do you have to be to hang around with a convicted child sexual offender and billionaire who is exercising his perversions in plain sight, even if you are not yourself fully involved with said perversions? Or: if a year into a presidencyyou already have citizens being killed in the streetby uniformed thugs barely a notch above a militia, what happens next?It’s almost a relief to have to turn away and consider for a moment an older, slightly smaller question; namely, what makes someone want to kill an animal for sport? Not for food, not in defence of a home or family or livestock, just for fun. Just to be able to say they did it and take a picture with the corpse to prove it.It becomes even more unfathomable (although yes, of course, the principle remains the same) when the way to killing has to be paved by guides and other hunters – because you don’t even have the skills to find and stalk animals yourself. Added to that is the fact that as a hunter aims higher and higher up the food chain, the more rare and precious the beasts become.So, then, to Cecil: The Lion and the Dentist, which focuses onthe killing in 2015 of a lion from Hwange National park in Zimbabweby an American trophy hunter called Dr Walter Palmer. The documentary uses it as a prism through which to examine the interdependence of native Zimbabweans, the hunting and safari industry catering largely for rich, white tourists, and the national parks which seek to protect African wildlife while being forced to sacrifice some of it to the national economy.Africa’s great elephant divide: countries struggle with too many elephants – or too fewRead moreCecil had become famous for being – even for a lion – phenomenally majestic and beautiful. He was huge, the head of two prides, and was still a force to be reckoned with at the advanced age of 12. He was one of the animals being tracked by a team from Oxford University that was studying the animals in Hwange in part so that sustainable annual quotas for hunters could be decided. In June 2015, one of the team’s leaders noticed that data from Cecil’s collar was no longer being recorded. A few days later, they found his skinned and headless body. Piecing together the story from local guides, it appeared that Cecil had crossed the park boundary into a hunting area and been shot by Palmer, who had been brought out there by local professional hunter Theo Bronkhurst. Between the killing and the body’s discovery, Palmer had returned to the US.There was no quota for lion hunting in the area that year. Too many had been killed too young the year before and the population needed to recover. Palmer claimed he was reliant on local knowledge, and Bronkhurst was arrested, but charges against him and the owner of the land on which Cecil was killed were eventually dismissed. The world’s media got hold of the story, however, and there was widespread outrage about the animal’s death and the perceived guilt of Palmer.The film retells this aspect of the tale clearly. But when it tries to look at the bigger picture, it becomes frustratingly fragmented and superficial. It mentions the original displacement in 1928 of the ancestral tribes, who hunted but lived in balance with the local flora and fauna, to facilitate the establishment of Hwange national park, but doesn’t explain the reasons – and there must have been reasons, good or bad – behind it. It touches on the lack of transparency about how the money raised from hunting is distributed: some is supposed to go to nearby communities whenever an animal is “taken”, but it rarely does, which makes you wonder why this should be, whose fault it is and where any potential corruption lies. There is no interrogation of whether there are animal populations that genuinely need to be controlled and thus whether it would be foolish to look a lucrative gift carcass in the mouth. Are westerners too sentimental about animals (and should the unhinged nature of some of the protesters outside Palmer’s office affect our opinion of his actions)? Or are those who live alongside them too blase about a resource that is precious beyond the merely financial sense? And there’s an odd final comment that seems to conflate the hunting with the photographic industry that also does very well out of African safaris – but can it really be as bad?A good documentary should, of course, raise questions. But not this many more than it answers.Cecil: The Lion and the Dentist is available on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryCecil the lionHuntingZimbabweAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

It deserves to be heard again, for its remarkable feat of resourcefulness, prodigious child’s intelligence and great, against-the-odds narrative arc. A Malawian boy living through a climate of floods and drought that left his village facing famine, he builta wind turbine out of scraps, as a 13-year-old, to life-saving effect for his community.Following Kamkwamba’s memoir, co-written with Bryan Mealer, andChiwetel Ejiofor’s film, along with a much viewed and celebrated Ted Talk by Kamkwamba, this musical version of the story is its own distinct thing. Directed by Lynette Linton, it is an exuberant creation, filled with warm light, humour, a gorgeous grass-roofed set design by Frankie Bradshaw as well as vivid costumes (patterned fabric, bright colours, great headdresses) and vibrant African sounds and movement.View image in fullscreenAlways good-natured … Alistair Nwachukwu as William.Photograph: Tyler FayosePerformers excel in energetic choreography by Shelley Maxwell and it contains a big, loud West End energy that seems to expand beyond the edges of this stage and spill over. There is a nice rapport between the always good-natured William (Alistair Nwachukwu) and his friend, Gilbert (Idriss Kargbo), the cheeky son of the village chief who aids William’s learning after he has been dismissed from school for not being able to pay the fees. There is romance too, not only the warm, comfy chemistry between William’s parents but also between his older sister Annie (Tsemaye Bob-Egbe) and schoolteacher Mike (Owen Chaponda).This leavens the harder edges of the story but things stay too insistently feelgood, even in the face of hunger and famine when drought arrives, and the lack of nuance in tone becomes limiting. We do see William’s mother (Madeline Appiah) struggling with malaria, as well as his clashes with his father(Sifiso Mazibuko) and death all around the family. But the production glances at this darkness and withdraws from it too quickly, as if scared to diverge from the musical’s high mood. A re-emerging hyena (Shaka Kalokoh) symbolises the sense of danger in the village but simply stalks on and off, looking like an extra from The Lion King and carrying little threat.There is some superb percussion and drums, with songs variously filled with lamentation or celebration, along with spirited ululations. But while Tim Sutton’s music is always big on sound, with a few strong songs including Mphala Boys Power and This I Know, there are too many unmemorable numbers and some ropey singing voices too, along with an often bland book by Richy Hughes that renders characters rather too simplistic.William remains strangely unknown, as if eclipsed by the song and dance. His friendship with an adopted neighbourhood dog, exquisitely played by Yana Penrose, is another sweet feature, but you do not feel the emotional tragedy when it comes. At well over two hours long this drama of immense suffering – alongside a boy’s incredible determination to find a solution for it – is certainly life-affirming. But it does not get you in the gut, or squeeze the heart, as it surely should.AtSwan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 28 March.

Too big to be contained within the regular loop of the auditorium, even when the director uses the full height of the in-the-round space, sending her actors up ladders and getting them to pop out from the upper level. More than that, before the show and in the interval, her production spills into the wider building.Leslie Travers’s set is scattered like so much post-industrial debris into corners where, if you get there early and time it right, you will see actors perform sketches of working-class life: some pre-party preening; a boozy game of darts; a lost soul wandering with her shopping trolley.The intrusion excites the audience and extends the playwright’s slice-of-life portrait. This community, the director seems to suggest, is not just living around one Lancashire road in 1986 as the playwright envisaged, but in and around us. You start looking at your fellow spectators and wondering if they too are part of Cartwright’s tapestry.View image in fullscreenSinging for her supper … Lesley Joseph.Photograph: Ros KavanaghSimilarly bold is Cartmell’s approach to the actors. She sets them off at a fast simmer and heats them to boiling point. Playing Scullery, a dishevelledJohnny Vegasis at once measured and pugnacious, punching out his introductions to a short-fuse cast of characters, be that Lesley Joseph as an old dear singing for her supper or Laura Elsworthy and Lucy Beaumont as girls on the town.None of this diminishes the sourness of Cartwright’s play, written in anger at the neglect and poverty of Thatcher’s Britain, but more bitter than politically articulate. His characters dream of the beauty ofOtis Redding’s Try a Little Tenderness, while locking their own beauty away. Insults come first, demands for cash come second, friendship is hard won.A collage of unrelated monologues and two-handers, Road can seem like a sequence of audition pieces. Cartmell’s actors, including a pre-recordedTom Courtenayas a man crippled by nostalgia, would effortlessly pass such an audition, but the fragmentary structure makes it easier to be impressed than to care. Still, as the centrepiece of the Royal Exchange’s 50th anniversary season, the production is exuberant, abrasive and giddily theatrical.At theRoyal Exchange, Manchester,until 14 March.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreRoyal ExchangereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s ironic that the most technologically obsessed art form on the planet is just as watery-eyed about the past as cinema and music. And to prove it here is the new version of the legendary QuickShot II, a plasticky joystick from the early 1980s that wasn’t eventhatgood the first time round. It was, however, cheap and it resembled an actual fighter plane control stick with its multiple fire buttons and ergonomic shaft. If you wanted a rugged and precise controller you’d go for the Competition Pro, but that one didn’t let you pretend to be in Star Wars or Airwolf. Plus, the QuickShot II had suckers on its base so you could stick it to your cockpit control panel – sorry, I mean MDF computer table.The new QuickShot II from RetroGamesand Plaion Replai is almost an exact replica in terms of its dimensions. You can grasp it in your fist and wrap your thumb and forefinger around its large red buttons. Yes, you can stick it to your table; the designers have even included the original auto-fire switch at the rear for players who weren’t prepared to hit the fire button repeatedly while playing Green Beret.View image in fullscreenBurst of nostalgia … playing Truxton with the QuickShot II.Photograph: Bitwave Games/ToaplanIt has been tastefully updated, though. The two fire buttons on the stick can now be separately configured – a feature I yearned for as a youngCommodore 64fanatic so that I could independently control the laser and bombs in Skramble. There are also six buttons on the base, which align with standard joypad layouts, and the USB cable means you can plug it into a PC or any of the modern computer remakes released by Retro Games, such as the C64 or Spectrum. I tested it with the latter and have already spent many hours blasting through Ant Attack, Pheenix and Head over Heels.In terms of build quality, it’s a good balance of necessary updates and respectful nonaction. The stick itself has plenty of travel (you have to push it quite far to register movement), which is just as I remember. This made the QuickShot famously unsuitable for joystick-waggling titles such as Daley Thompson’s Decathlon as you had to move it a long way left and right, often causing damage to the joystick and indignity to yourself. At least now the designers have added microswitches so you get a nice click when the stick moves. The fire buttons, however, still have the same old soft click, and the sound and feel of them is one of the most warmly nostalgic parts of the whole thing. I spent so many hours of my teen years pressing those buttons – the sound is as hardwired into my memory as the smell of school dinners or the wash of the ocean against a pier.I also tried the QuickShot II withSteamand it worked absolutely fine after some simple calibration – although the auto-fire proved problematic. It was lovely to play the Steam version of classic shooter Truxton with this stick, returning me to memories of playing arcade games in Blackpool then going home and pretending my computer desk and joystick were an arcade cabinet. You think these feelings are gone but it doesn’t take much to bring them hurtling back – sometimes just a hunk of plastic will do it.If you’re looking for a serious modern joystick, this isn’t it. It’s low-budget and awkward and, despite an hour of configuring, I couldn’t get it to work with PC emulation platform RetroArch, which was a shame, though others may manage it. But this is the point: the QuickShot II was not the best joystick, it was the one we could afford. And it looked cool.I respect that the remake is true to that spirit. It is affordable and a little compromised. But if you owned one back in the day, it is a fun thing to have, and the fourth star in my review is for the absolute raw nostalgia of it. Every time I see it sitting there beside my hi-tech PC and big HD monitor, I smile. It’s good to have you back, old friend, with all your flaws and shortcomings.The QuickShot II is available now, £30.95.Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

A world apart from Florence or Turin, Naples is a fascinating, lived-in city with a long history and a rich culinary tradition. The Spaccanapoli, which runs right through the core of the city, is a bustling place to walk along and experience Neapolitan life. The world-class sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum are nearby, as are Mount Vesuvius, Sorrento and the wonderful islands of Capri, Ischia and Procida. You can get to Naples by train from London via Paris and Turin or Milan in about 15 hours.Michael KuipersTake the ferry to CorsicaView image in fullscreenCorsica in spring offers wildflower-covered hillsides and snowy mountain peaks.Photograph: Jon Ingall/AlamyEurostar from London via an easy connection at Lille or a change in Paris takes between six and eight hours to arrive in Marseille. After a shower at the station, refresh in Vieux Port before arriving for breakfast in Bastia,Corsica, via a comfortable night-ferry. From Bastia, catch the scenic mountain railway into this remarkably unspoiled island to explore its wild interior and coastal regions. Mid to late spring is best for southern Europe, when snow-melt replenishes streams and waterfalls that dry up in summer. The weather is sunny yet exceedingly pleasant, hillsides blanketed with wildflowers, wild animals nurturing their young and locals refreshed in mood.JakeProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Take the TGV to Nice, then it’s just a few minutes on the local train (easy for day trips to Cannes and Menton, too).

We spent our time meandering the cobbled streets with their pastel-coloured buildings, eating a mix of French and Italian meals (it’s the last French town before the Italian border) and paddling in the calm blue bay. We trekked in the hills north of the town, past stunning houses, pine trees and spring flowers to exploreMaison Gannac, a citrus farm that grows theMenton lemon, which is renowned for its flavour and aroma.KatieA boat trip along the Moselle in GermanyView image in fullscreenThe view from Burg Landshut castle ruins.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyThe Moselle valley in April was stunning. Starting in the old Roman city of Trier, with its amazingPorta Nigragate, we followed the river 30 miles north-west to enjoy the panoramic views fromBurg Landshut. We took boat trips, including to Cochem, to take the chairlift opposite the castle up to the Pinnerkreuz viewpoint. Early April means wildflower-strewn meadows and fewer visitors. Castles, boats and cable cars kept the children entertained; the fresh Moselle valley rieslings kept the adults happy. We finished our trip in Koblenz, with its selection of traditional breweries where spätzle and schnitzel pair well with any beer.Kirsten LoweryCoastal paths near PerpignanView image in fullscreenThe harbour at Port-Vendres.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyGo south by train and resist the rush. Take the Eurostar to Paris, then a fast TGV to Perpignan in six hours, before a final 25-minute local train to Port-Vendres – about nine hours from London, end to end. Early spring suits this working harbour: many places are shut, the fish market is not. Lunch at its no-nonsense restaurant, then walk the coastal paths toCollioure, brighter and busier by comparison. The Pyréneés-Orientales coast is one of France’s sunniest areas, and even out of season the light does much of the work.BeckyThe hazily golden city of AvignonView image in fullscreenThe Rhône at Avignon.Photograph: Hilke Maunder/AlamyEn route to Sicily via ferry from Genoa, we stopped in Avignon. We got off the train in the early evening to find a hazily golden city with winding medieval streets full of small independent shops, the amazingPalais des Papes(Popes’ Palace), a beautiful shining Rhône river – and we explored the remaining four arches and gatehouse of the 12th-century Pont Saint-Bénézet. Everywhere was walkable, from the very comfortable and reasonably- pricedBristol Hotel. Warm in the evening, plenty of traditional restaurants, no crowds.

Instead of the traditional rubbing-in method, the crumble is made by pouring warm browned butter straight into the dry ingredients, creating a pebbly topping with a deeper toasted flavour. Leave out the crushed fennel seed, if you prefer, but this small addition, bloomed briefly in the butter, gives the whole thing a subtle aromatic lift.Rhubarb, pear and hazelnut crumble with browned butterPrep15 minCook1 hr 15 min, plus coolingServes680g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orange, plus 1 tbsp juice1½tbsp tapioca flour, or cornflour500g rhubarb, trimmed and cut into roughly 2cm pieces2 large, ripe pears, peeled, cored and cut into 2cm pieces1tbsp orange juice1 tsp vanilla bean pastePouring cream, vanilla ice-cream or thick yoghurt, to serveFor the crumble topping130g unsalted butter, plus 10g extra, softened, for greasing1 tsp fennel seeds, lightly crushed (optional)130g plain flour80g light brown sugar70g rolled oats70g toasted blanched hazelnuts, roughly chopped¼ tsp fine sea saltStart by making the topping: put the butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally until the butter has completely melted. Keep cooking until the butter smells nutty and turns golden; it will splutter and hiss at first, then quieten as the foam subsides. When dark brown specks form on the bottom of the pan, take the pan off the heat, stir in the crushed fennel seeds, if using, and leave to “bloom” for a couple of minutes.Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir the flour, brown sugar, oats, hazelnuts and salt to combine. Pour over the warm browned butter (including the brown sediments – they have great flavour) and stir until irregular clumps form; you want a mixture of both rubble and fine crumbs. Put the crumble mix in the fridge for now.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and lightly grease an oval ovenproof dish (I used a 28cm x 16cm one) with the extra 10g softened butter.For the filling, put the sugar and orange zest in a large bowl and rub firmly until it smells fragrant and the sugar is tinged orange. Stir in the tapioca flour, then add the rhubarb, pears, orange juice and vanilla. Toss gently to combine, then tip into the buttered baking dish. Scatter the crumble mix evenly on top, then bake for 45-50 minutes, until the fruit juices are bubbling up around the edges and the top is golden brown. Remove and leave to stand for at least 15 minutes, then serve with pouring cream, vanilla ice-cream or thick yoghurt.Explore more on these topicsDessertThe sweet spotFoodFruitVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkBakingNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"
