Curtains drawn to keep the lawbreakers out. A few dozen brave journalists who have dared to walk the streets. Mugshots of convicted criminals along with the sentences received line the walls on video screens. Though weirdly, none of James McMurdock. Perhaps Reform has yet to update its own database of undesirables. Young James istaking a break from the party whipwhile the Public Sector Fraud Authority investigates Covid loans to his companies. That’s the trouble with London today. Trust no one.Just after 11am, a siren goes off andNigel Farage, the Conservative-turned-Reform councillor Laila Cunningham and Tory-turned-Reform MP Sarah Pochin settle down behind a table. To their right is a lectern with the slogan “Britain is lawless”. Miraculously, none of them have had their phones nicked or been stabbed on the journey into London. A city where crims operate with impunity. Dante’s seventh circle of hell. A place where only the lucky get out alive.First up is Laila, a woman who freely admits she expects to get robbed every time she leaves her front door. She’s almost sorry when she makes it back home in one piece. Laila has something she wants to get off her chest: she doesn’t actually like anyone. Her country has been betrayed.One day, she might ask who was responsible. The answer might be closer to home than she imagines. Nige has done as much to shape the UK in the past 10 years as anyone. If you want to know why we’re broke, you can start with Brexit. But for now, Laila is beyond thinking. She’s just a heartbeat away from taking out an AK-47 and mowing down a nearby gang.Next comes Sarah P, AKA Nurse Ratched. The unthinking person’s idea of a thinking person. She, too, is in despair. London is a ruined city. The only people out in daylight hours are shoplifters and drug dealers, most of them foreigners. Sarah is almost in tears as she goes on to say that most Afghan migrants are potential sex offenders. How she yearns for the days when you could rely on all rapists to be white.But that’s two-tier justice for you. Spare a thought for poor Lucy Connolly, who wassentenced to prisonjust for inciting people to burn refugees alive inside their hotel. Where was the harm in that? It was obviously only a joke. And Sarah is still laughing her head off at it. Worryingly, Farage appears to be lining her up to be his home secretary. She’s one of the few Reform MPs he hasn’t yet fallen out with.For the details, such as they are, we have to wait for Nige. He, too, is living out his own fantasies of a London that is one large no-go area.Crimeis out of control, he says. Don’t believe the statistics that show violent crime is going down. Just turn the graphs the other way up and use your own data.Stop and search everyone. Especially foreigners. Zero tolerance for anything. Apart from James McMurdock. Three strikes and it’s life imprisonment. Send our worst prisoners to El Salvador – with any luck they might get tortured there. Send foreigners back to foreign lands.Build Nightingale prisonsand throw away the keys. Recruit 30,000 new police officers. Abandon all diversity and equality targets. If you want a proper copper you need to get a white, heterosexual man to do the job. Only then will you feel safe.This is Nige’s fantasy world. A country on its knees, reduced to lawlessness by the woke andthe Blob. A land only he can save by locking every crim up. No offence would go unpunished. To prove his point, he passes around a sheet of paper with some bogus figures explaining how he would pay for everything. Shrink the state, cut net zero and HS2 and you can do what you like, he says.He’s asked about El Salvador. Is he serious? Oh, no. Not that El Salvador. He can’t think why he said it. He’s all heart really. Nige and reality have a small intersection area.View image in fullscreenStarmer appeared before the House of Commons’ liaison committee on Monday.Photograph: House of Commons/PAElsewhere in Westminster, the government is winding down before the summer recess. For Keir Starmer, this means one of histhrice-yearly appearances before the liaison committee. A chance for the select committee chairs to ask the prime minister a few – reasonably – polite questions about his performance so far. It’s noticeable that the Labour members of the committee are a great deal tougher than they were last time round.Meg Hillier gets things going by asking what he thinks the country will look like in three years’ time. It will be amazing, Keir replies. Everything hunky-dory. No one should take his brilliance for granted. The Tories have broken everything. He is the saviour who will mend things. In the public seating area, the first eyelids begin to droop. Starmer has the unique gift of being able to put any crowd to sleep. It’s got him out of bigger holes than this.The session drifts on as Keir talks technobabble – “no silver bullet”, “delivery targets” – while the committee tries to reintroduce him to the real world. If he is really committed to ending poverty, why doesn’t he consider getting rid of the two-child benefit cap? And even the diluted reforms to the welfare bills are going to increase poverty. Debbie Abrahams insists these aren’t Labour values and that she feels ashamed. Liam Byrne wonders why Starmer is so reluctant to make changes to capital gains tax? Then he could afford to give tax breaks to the less well-off.Keir mumbles something about not setting the budget months ahead and the forecasts constantly changing and we all go back to sleep. Hillier ends by asking what has been his highlight of his first year in office. “Easy,” says Starmer: walking into Downing Street for the first time. Which rather suggests it has all been downhill from there.Explore more on these topicsReform UKThe politics sketchNigel FarageCrimecommentShareReuse this content"

But the comedy has lost some of its magic in this erratic new seriesRachel AroestiMon 21 Jul 2025 17.15 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 21.31 EDTShareThe title sequence for Mandy, the short-form sitcom fromDiane Morgan(Motherland, Philomena Cunk), tells you everything and nothing about the programme you are about to watch. Clad in a stonewashed denim biker jacket and diamante earrings, a voluminous hairpiece plonked (perhaps backwards) on top of her head, our titular protagonist stands on some kind of spinning platform, soundtracked by the maudlin strains of Barry Manilow’s Mandy. Her face is contorted into a sideways pout; she looks worried, but vacant.Now in its fourth series, the show is in some senses a character study of the eponymous Mandy Carter, a single, chronically jobless woman with a remarkable knee-led walk whose attempts to secure employment are continually scuppered by a combination of bad luck and bad attitude; she is a work-shy chancer for whom a cigarette break is always the number one priority. But Mandy is more of a tone piece than a serious examination of a mind: we stay firmly on the surface of our hero’s world and, beyond the basic emotions (fear, indignation, excitement at the prospect of a quick buck), there doesn’t seem to be a huge amount going on in her head.‘I’ve not got a problem with making myself look disgusting’: the wild rise of Diane MorganRead moreIn fact, Mandy’s main characteristic is apathy – even in the face of death. In one episode, she steals an unbelievably long ladder and starts earning a few bob by helping the local vicar maintain his steeple. When her best friend, Lola (Michelle Greenidge), expresses concern about the risk involved – Mandy ascends in her trademark high-heeled boots, fag in mouth – she insists safety equipment is for snowflakes: “If I slip and die, I slip and die! We’ve all gotta go some time.” On another occasion, she is buried alive in a coffin, largely because she can’t be bothered to get out of it.Mandy is an exercise in human vibe – you may have crossed paths with someone vaguely like her before – but also a certain kind of comic architecture. Episodes usually start with her getting a new job, before something goes awry, and general destruction ensues. It is not supposed to be realistic: with a brilliant rep theatre-style rotating cast (Michael Spicer, Mark Silcox, Yuriko Kotani, Alistair Green) and a random assortment of celebrity guests (Deborah Meaden, Iain Lee, Graham Norton), the show has a hallucinatory quality, while Mandy’s bizarre crescendos often involve deliberately bad CGI and a wholesale rejection of logic. The comedy can be uneven, but the show is admirable in its pursuit of end-weighted belly laughs. The sight of Morgan clomping along the wing of a plane in magnetic callipers (after having a leg-lengthening operation to qualify as cabin crew) to boot a bomb into the night sky – a sacrifice that is immediately forgotten by practically everyone on the plane – is the moment I am fully converted to Mandy’s genius.That said, series four – the first Morgan has co-written with her partner, producer Ben Caudell – has far fewer of these ludicrous climaxes. In one episode, Mandy takes a rat on a bus and, after an unfortunate chain of events, is forced to fly the vehicle over a large gap in a bridge, but that moment of satisfyingly stupid farce is an outlier. The opening episode – which involves a back-to-work training scheme helmed by her beige employment officer (a recurring role for Tom Basden), Mandy administering old Botox to a school bully, a snooty shop assistant and a cameo from Martin Lewis – has a few titter-worthy moments, but never finds true hilarity. Elsewhere, the set pieces feel disconcertingly violent: Mandy accidentally inflicting head trauma on a man in a wheelchair or dunking a chip shop worker’s face in boiling oil.Mandy subjects herself to brutality, too, undergoing buttock enhancement – carried out below an Istanbul kebab shop, naturally – after finally discovering the beauty standards long peddled by the Kardashians. Another storyline revolves around an artwork by Banksy – or Banky, as a confused Mandy calls him. Clearly, both plots are supposed to illustrate how blissfully out of touch Mandy is, but it also means we must endure comic riffs on topics that are, at this point, mind-numbingly cliched.When comedy as boldly slapstick and overtly ridiculous as this hits its stride, it can feel like sorcery. Sadly, much like Mandy’s approach to every task under the sun, the construction of this new series seems a bit half-hearted. It is still a pleasingly idiosyncratic proposition – something you can say about vanishingly few TV shows these days – but Mandy seems to have lost something of its former magic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This year, no song represents the simple thrill of shrugging it off better than Addison Rae’s Headphones On. With a detached, lobotomy-chic delivery that’s drawn comparisons to Y2K-era Madonna, the TikTok star turned serious pop scholar breezes through a list of anxieties, from her parents’ relationship to the ever-present thrill of being bumped down a notch by “the new it girl”. Ultimately, our laconic heroine swaps a panic attack for slipping those headphones on and riding it all out with a song. Clocking in at exactly four minutes, there’s a straightforwardness to it all that I can’t help but appreciate. Rae will make you dance without working too hard. And that’s all I want right now.Alaina DemopoulosKatseye – GnarlyThis song, sung by a six-woman international K-pop group, begins with an analysis of how malleable English slang is. “They could describe everything with one single word, you know? / Boba tea, gnarly / Tesla, gnarly / Fried chicken, gnarly,” one member of Katseye sings, the bass thumping every time she says the most versatile descriptive word in the language, signifying intensity, both positive and negative. It’s the early 2010s, and we’re so back. The song is as maximalist as can be, similar to Skrillex’s 2011 Bangarang or Kesha’s 2010 hit TiK ToK. The music video, in which the group assembles a grotesque sandwich, calls back to 2010’s Telephone, when Lady Gaga does the same. The song is fun and rowdy. It speeds forward, apt for TikTok (the app), where it first gained popularity with a distinctive, jerky dance. If you like Gnarly, I would suggest going in search of other songs by one of the song’s writers, Alice Longyu Gao. Rich Bitch Juice and 100 Boyfriends feature the same mix of heavy bass and saccharine, electrified vocals and instrumentation.Blake MontgomeryJade – Plastic BoxSince squishing a NOW! compilation’s worth of ideas into three minutes on her solo singleAngel of My Dreams, Jade has backed up what Little Mixologists always suspected – that she knows pop as if she has an MA in Bangers. Ahead of the release of her debut album That’s Showbiz, Baby!, there’s something invitingly scrappy to the way she’s dovetailed frombrash EDMtoorgasmic disco, discardingcheap wigsandJade-branded buttplugsin her wake. (To my mind, the only other pop act exploring genre this boldly is Sabrina Carpenter, who is something like a spiritual sibling to Jade as well as her stylistic opposite.) Plastic Box bottles a certainScandinavianstrainof sweet melancholy, with Jade playing the jilted lover over seductive electro-pop. Co-producers Grades and Oscar Görres, the latter of whom helmed most of Troye Sivan’s slick Something to Give Each Other, hug her voice with rosy synths and a chorus that explodes in a cloud of confetti. It’s an end of summer party that’s chicer than SSENSE – and despite Jade’s antics that made her so much fun to follow, Plastic Box proves that she’s just as magnetic when she strips them away.Owen MyersPinkPantheress – IllegalTo me, summer feels like going at terminal velocity down a waterslide: an unstoppable blur that before you know it has spat you out in the run-out pool of autumn, dazed and blinking. PinkPantheress’s new 20-minute, 30-second mixtape Fancy That feels the same way, a rush of UK dance music history – heavy with samples of Basement Jaxx and Underworld and nods to Fatboy Slim and Groove Armada – guided by a flirt laying down the law in girlish RP. Illegal is the only time Pink’s grip loosens, thanks to a hero dose of THC that leaves her tangled in lust, paranoia and shame. Between the reality-obliterating synth strobes, her sensory production makes you feel all the freedom and frustration of being high, close breaths and screams flickering through the slipstream.Laura Snapesfortywinks –commiebfThere are plenty of songs of the summer about falling in love or partying or breaking up or going for a long, gorgeous drive, but there are hardly enough songs for summer lethargy. When the mercury hits 90 degrees, all my friends go insane, my technology stops working, and I start napping for at least one hour a day. Enter commie bf, a blunt buzzsaw of a song on which forty winks singer Cilia Catello yells that “everyone and everything makes my ears ring” right before she and her bandmates unleash a maelstrom of nasty, dementedly catchy punk-pop. This is a funny, and fun, and ferocious track – loud and unruly, but so intensely catchy that even the guitar-music-averse among us would have to admire its moxie. Catello’s sheer frustration rings through every second of the song, enough to shake you from that heatwave-induced stupor and get your ass back into gear, no matter how sweaty and malcontent you may be.Shaad D’SouzaMK – Dior (featuring Chrystal)While pop fans fret about there not being a good enough song of the summer this year, the UK has gone ahead and anointed its choice anyway. MK’s Dior is now at No 1 in the UK charts, standard behaviour for a country whose inhabitants need only the faintest hint of a 4/4 pop-dance beat on a temperate day to crack open a tinned cocktail at 11am and go “wheeeeey” with arms stretched wide. US producer MK, AKA Marc Kinchen, has been around since the early 90s (he’s behind the still-ubiquitous Push the Feeling On) and therefore brings a level of craft to bear on his productions that puts them into a different league to all other mirrored-wall nightclub fodder. 2017’s 17 still shines like the white walls and high-tensile glass of an Ibizan villa; 2023’s Asking is as good as build-and-drop dance gets. 2025’s offering Dior is more coiled and sensual than those tracks, with a really dramatic delayed drop: silence and Chrystal’s a cappella vocal fill the space where you expect the beat, creating a simple but spine-tingling effect. The high fashion references meanwhile make it a sort of sequel to 2023’s equivalent dance-pop song of the summer, Cassö’sPrada.Ben Beaumont-ThomasHaim – RelationshipsBest efforts notwithstanding, the vibes aren’t great this summer. The news is terrible, the AI ominous, the culture still in an extended hangover from last year’s Espresso buzz and Brat bumps. There is no obvious song of the summer – the charts are basically tracks from 2024 or Morgan Wallen (though you wouldn’t know it ingodless New York); Charli xcxbasically headlined Glastonbury; people are too busyarguing over Sabrina Carpenter’s album coverto remember her Espresso follow-up Manchild. In this muggy malaise, I’ve been stuck on Haim’sRelationships– the LA trio’s best pop song to date, a bright, deceptively airy anthem for being fucking over it. Lyrically, this lead single off the sisters’ aspirationally titled fourth albumI Quitdescribes the messy end of some ill-defined entanglement. But its spare, intoxicating production – simple piano chords, ambling bass, synths glimmering like barlights at 9pm dusk – evokes a more general, potent summer ennui. I normally want the bpm up when it’s hot, but this summer, I’ve been circling blocks to Danielle’s dreamy falsetto, ascending with her rhetorical questions – fucking relationships, don’t they end up all the same? – and then crashing back to earth with her “when there’s no one else to blame”. Feelings? In this strung-out summer? Try me next year.Adrian HortonThe Beths – No JoyThe most joyous sounding song of this summer addresses depression, numbness and the futility of it all. No Joy, by the tuneful New Zealand quartet the Beths, provides an ideal object lesson in the thrill of mixed messages in pop. The music couldn’t feel more summery or light, fired by bouncy powerpop chords and chirpy backup vocals. The video, set in a candy-colored child’s playroom, follows suit, with lead singer/writer Elizabeth Stokes deadpanning her way through lyrics like: “All my pleasures, guilty / Clean slate looking filthy” and “I feel nothing,” all while her bandmates smile with satirically exaggerated pleasure. It’s impossible to keep a straight face while watching or listening to it, despite the fact that the numbness Stokes reports in her words reflects something sadly real. The lyrics chronicle her experience on the dulling SSRI drug she has used to deal with her depression. True as that may be for her, the song winds up giving the opposite feeling to the listener. When she sings “no joy” over and over we feel nothing but – a twist that could make this the most ironic song of this summer, as well as the most irresistible.Jim Farbersombr –weneverdatedWelcome to sombr season. Summer ‘25 seems to have given us a new star, and he’s Shane Boose – otherwise known by his melancholy moniker, sombr. A native of New York’s bustling Lower East Side, at just 19 he has effectively launched his mainstream career with a series of chart-topping singles which flaunts the artist’s emotional, guitar-propelled lyrics. Yes you read that right, the new generation has officially rediscoveredactualinstruments, with the teenage artist seemingly channelling alt-rock acts like Arctic Monkeys and Radiohead, the latter of whom he’s cited as a major influence. Songs like We Never Dated flaunt brutally honest lyrics accented by guitar-picking led it to become an instant breakout upon its late June release, which makes it a no-brainer when it comes to Song of the Summer status. Meanwhile, he’s riding high on other explosive singles including Back to Friends, which recently was anointed as the most-streamed song on Spotify’s global charts.Rob LeDonneKhamari – Head in a JarWithout a factory-made earworm to invade our every waking moment, the floor has opened up to a wider selection of artists this summer and, as there always should be in my opinion, a wider selection of vibes to go with it. Songs of the summer are typically characterised by the infectious perk and sweaty overwhelm of mid-afternoon sun but there’s another seasonal feeling we all know, as the brightness starts to fade, that also deserves its space. Boston-born singer Khamari knows it too and in delicate downer Head in a Jar, he captures a brand of summery sadness that’s also rather seductive, a deliberate dive into dark feelings that’s as refreshing as an early evening breeze. It’s a song about being pushed away from the centre of someone’s life, forced to watch from a distance instead and, with a voice that has rightly earned comparisons to the mostly awol Frank Ocean, Khamari pierces right through. He’s quietly been gaining buzz since his similarly reflective 2020 EP Eldorado and this one deserves to vault him from the outside in.Benjamin LeeMatías Aguayo – El InternetYou know you’re in the right party if someone throws down this tune. The Chilean-German firebrand Matías Aguayo returned in May with a subversive dancefloor heater that has been building in notoriety over the subsequent months. It’s sung in Spanish but translates to, Aguayo says: “walking through the city on hot summer nights looking for the perfect dancefloor”. But it’s also a mission statement, longing for “revolutions in music and dreams in community” away from homogenisation, social media likes and solely facing the DJ booth. In the track, Aguayo remembers the freewheeling days of YouTube rips where you could hear “raw, primitive and direct music” from, say, a Syrian wedding or Angolan teenagers dancing on the streets – references for El Internet’s own jittery, restless rhythm and also his live DJ sets, where he sings and dances inside a circle in the audience, inviting onlookers to move freely with him and let loose. It’s lithe, gonzo techno for sticky evenings in search of catharsis and connection.Kate HutchinsonTom Rasmussen – Gay BarTaken from London-based polymath Tom Rasmussen’s High Wire, a remixed and reimagined version of last year’s excellent Live Wire album, new song Gay Bar – not a cover of Electric Six, apols – showcases two of my favourite summer past-times; trashy storytelling and gossip. Who doesn’t love a steamy page-turner on the beach, interrupted only by the details of last night’s escapades wafting over from the gaggle of pals nearby? On Gay Bar, Rasmussen details three attempts at a night out; the first is interrupted by a pint to the face, and then completely ruined by the gay bar now being a Slug & Lettuce. Night two, meanwhile, involves going to the place where “Danielle sucked on that MP’s armpit”, but – shock horror! - it’s now a Crossfit gym full of “muscled up yuppies”. By night three, with hope dwindling, Rasmussen takes a straight friend giving off “bi vibes” to a busy gay bar. As the song’s hi-NRG dance pop ratchets up, you find yourself gripped as the story reaches its climax; will Cassandra get off with anyone? What’s Rasmussen doing in the basement? When will the decimation of queer nightlife end? It’s a real page-turner.Michael CraggExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Let Thames Water fail – it doesn’t deserve a bailoutMon 21 Jul 2025 13.17 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 14.10 EDTShareIn a bone dry summer, every drop of water counts. So, even though therain is finally fallingagain now, it’s still hard to take it for granted, or to ignore the way that everything in the countryside still feels unnervingly out of rhythm: earth too cracked, grass too bleached, wheat harvest being brought in too early, rivers too low – and, knowing what Thames Water has been pumping into them, water quite possibly too dirty to cool off in.In May, the company wasfined £122.7mfor the combined sins of sewage dumping and continuing to pay shareholder dividends despite its environmental failings. It responded by protesting that it might go bust if actually held accountable for its actions, a sentence that sums up everything people find infuriating about the water industry. Yet its resentful customers have no choice but to keep paying bills that are expected torise by a thirdover the next five years – though Thames Water, inevitably, asked to be allowed to charge more – while wondering how we ever let a commodity this precious become so badly managed, heading into a volatile new era of summer drought and winter flood.Rivers, Jon Cunliffe notes in hisnewly published reviewof what a new Labour government should do about the water industry, are part of a country’s national identity. There’s a romance and a history to be preserved here, not just a life-giving water supply to be extracted or wildlife habitats to be protected. Being a neutral civil servant, what he doesn’t explicitly add is that lately they have also come to symbolise corporate failure and decline of the public realm, but that too is part of the picture.Few will disagree withCunliffe’s verdictthat the current regulator, Ofwat, isn’t up to negotiating the complex trade-offs involved here, and that there should be a new watchdog, bringing together various powers currently scattered across Whitehall, with the ability to take control of failing water companies if needed. His ideas for increasing accountability, curbing excessive dividends and creating a new social tariff for those who can’t afford to pay is welcome too. (Bills were kept too low for too long, the review concludes, meaning that when the inevitable hike came it was painfully sharp.) But that’s the easy bit, compared with facing up to the consequences of chronic underinvestment by an industry that has in parts seemed quick to take the profits and slower to take responsibility.There will be outrage on the left that Cunliffe doesn’t advocate nationalisation, though politically that idea was off the table before he started. (Labour said before the election that it wasn’t keen to take water back into public ownership, and nothing about the fiscal hole in which it has since found itself has made the idea of spending billions on doing so more appealing: Cunliffe’s terms of reference were set accordingly.)The review argues that ownership models are anyway something of a red herring – water is nationalised in Scotland but bathing water qualityisn’t much betterthere than it is south of the border, and while Welsh Water’s not-for-profit model could be viable for some English companies, even that isn’t necessarily a magic bullet. All of which may well be true, but might sound more convincing had ministers given him free rein to consider all the options equally. As it is, it’s hardly his fault that this plan – which would still see water bills rising steeply to fund the investment in creaking infrastructure that everyone accepts is necessary – is the answer of the Treasury official he used to be, rather than of a politician.High water bills, filthy rivers – and now drought. This is England’s great artificial water crisis of 2025 | George MonbiotRead moreWhere’s the moral hazard, the price any private business should be forced to pay for failure, if in the end their customers just get stuck with the tab? It’s not our fault if companies who were granted a monopolyback in 1989over the supply of something humans literally can’t live without still managed somehow to make a commercial hash of it. No wonder the water minister, Emma Hardy, will take the summer to decide exactlywhich of Cunliffe’s recommendationsLabour plans to accept.The dilemma this government finds itself in over water is, of course, not unique. It is part of a common thread now linking everything from welfare reform and the still unresolved problem offunding social care, to the momentous decisions on tax now facing Rachel Reeves in her autumn budget; that these are all expensive and deep-seated problems this government’s predecessors repeatedly dodged or kicked down the road. And, although Labour’s commitment to actually facing reality is admirable, it turns out there were good reasons everyone else chose to bravely run away. Years of ducking and diving have only magnified those problems, to the point where selling the kind of sacrifices now required to a reluctant public is almost impossible.Getting the future governance of the industry right is crucial, of course, but that’s not the end of it.Thames Watershould be allowed to fail, on the grounds that it has done nothing to deserve a taxpayer bailout, and if its lenders have to take a hit, well, them’s the risks. Parliament should keep digging, investigating the historic failures of oversight that allowed us to get into this mess. But, somehow, ministers need to find a broader way of conveying that failure has consequences, and not just for the taxpayer. A harder rain needs to fall, not just into rapidly shrinking reservoirs, but on to some of those responsible for managing them.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It pains me to say that they are now microwaving it.Hear that sound? It’s King Arthur weeping.Or maybe they’re doing it right. Maybe they’re sick of making tea in an old, limescale-filled, single-use appliance.But that’s traditional!It doesn’t matter. A survey of just over 2,000 UK energy bill payersby Uswitchhas found that 58% of under-30s have used a microwave to make a cuppa, and one in six say they do it every day.Why? Is it quicker?No. A mug’s worth of water takes 48 seconds to boil in a kettle, and almost three minutes in a microwave.So, does it produce a better quality drink?Also, no. Dr Tim Bond from the Tea Advisory Panel says thatmicrowaves heat water unevenly, which leads to uneven tea extraction, which leads to a stewed flavour.Then why microwave water at all?Well, the answer may be twofold. For one thing, student halls are increasingly prohibiting the use of kettles due to steam setting off alarms, so some young people at university are forced to nuke their water in a microwave …What’s the other reason?The American influence.The what?Americans typically don’t use electric kettles, so they are more likely to microwave their water. Perhaps people who grow up consuming US culture are starting to believe that it’s the norm.Wow. First they elected Trump, and now this.It’s OK.

After this ‘rollercoaster of emotions’, says the actor, a Jane Austen or a romcom has to be nextMon 21 Jul 2025 10.36 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 21.31 EDTShareIn Unforgivable, a new 90-minute drama by Jimmy McGovern, Anna Friel never once smiles. She plays Anna Mitchell, whose brother – released from prison as the drama begins – sexually assaulted her preteen younger son. The trauma inflicted is clear: almost throughout, the boy won’t utter a word beyond “yes” and “no”.“We worked on the basis that her anger had to be suppressed,” Friel says, speaking from her home in Windsor. “She’s lost her husband, her mother has died, she’s lost a brother who she absolutely loved. And most of all, she’s lost trust. Trust is so hard to come by, it takes years and years, and when that’s broken, it sets off a domino effect. So while there’s a certain amount of paranoia in Anna’s mood, she has got to hold it together.”The dialogue in the show is pared down and the aesthetic is sparse. At one point during our interview, Friel jokingly turns off her ring-light to mimic how unflattering the lighting was on set. But the effect is perhaps not what she intended: Friel still looks incredible no matter the lighting situation, her fairytale face the same as ever, tough but never hard. But the point she is making is that, with a drama like this, you can’t worry about how you look, “otherwise you lose integrity, authenticity, honesty, rawness”.Friel says there is a certain poetry to the way Unforgivable was shot. “Natural lighting can be a character in itself. And it’s hard, because there is such pressure, particularly on women: should you, shouldn’t you look old? I think there are more important things to focus on, to be honest.”View image in fullscreenSilent fury … Friel as Anna in Unforgivable.Photograph: BBC/LA Productions/Kerry SpicerMcGovern started his writing career on Brookside, which, like Unforgivable, was set in Liverpool in the early 1980s. He left four years before Friel started on the same soap, 32 years ago, when she was 16. She didn’t do a scouse accent then, but does here, as does Leeds-born Austin Haynes, who plays her younger son, during the brief moments he speaks.“Being a child actor myself, I can honestly, hand-on-heart, look back and say I was nowhere near as good as he is,” she says. “They’re phenomenal, the young actors [Finn McParland plays her other son, Peter]: the focus, the concentration. How can they have that understanding at such an age? It’s the equivalent of meditating – but instead of meditating on wonderful manifestations and good thoughts, you’re meditating purely on that one emotion, and you carry that around for a day. It can be quite wearing. They’re really blowing my socks off. And I’m getting to see it all because I’m at an age when I’m only playing mothers – and I’m probably soon to be playing grandmothers.”She says that without chagrin, but it’s a real bugbear among actors over 65 that they are the perfect age to play grandmothers, but all the roles go to women in their 50s. Friel recalls, wryly, howMichael J Foxin Back to the Future Part II, aged 28, played a teenager. “That’s a way more interesting way to do it, because you have more life experience. It’s more interesting to play down than to play up.”At the same time, the role of a mother is far less generic now. It’s not unusual in the streamer age to see a maternal character, such as hers in Unforgivable, with a personality. “I think I probably wouldn’t be working if I’d reached this age in the 1980s,” she says. “Which is crazy, because you become more fascinating in your late 40s or mid-50s, not less – it’s justthis[she gestures theatrically, to her face]. Or aching bones or aching joints. But I think life experience is everything, and if you’re someone who wants to grow and be better, that will show.”View image in fullscreen‘Phenomenal’ … Austin Haynes as Anna’s son.Photograph: BBC/LA Productions/Kerry SpicerThe night before we speak, the drama had a screening in Liverpool for the cast, crew, friends and family. “When it ended,” Friel says, “there was complete and utter silence. Before there was applause, you could have heard a pin drop. And we thought, ‘Gosh, I wonder what people are going to feel, because it’s so thought-provoking, such a challenging piece.’”The challenge is that it’s about child abuse but is morally quite complicated. Of course it doesn’t excuse Joe, the perpetrator, played with an awful wounded plausibility by Bobby Schofield, but nor does it deliver any easy hate figures or certainties. Friel’s character is “really fiercely angry and devastated”, bitter, volatile and hard to warm to. Her problems are redoubled when she can’t get mental health support for her son, as he spirals into despair. “That would be so alienating and infuriating,” she says. “I tried really hard not to judge her. You can’t just go for the easy option in a performance, of, ‘Please like me.’”Unforgivable boasts a cast you will think you have seen together before, particularly Friel and David Threlfall, who plays Anna’s dad, along with Anna Maxwell Martin as a blunt but caring former nun. All three are like a badge of quality for a particular kind of British dramatic realism, yet they hadn’t met before. Friel and Threlfall bonded over matcha, the bright green and very much on-trend drink – “as we get older, we can’t have too much caffeine,” she says, pretend-mumsily, “it makes our heart rate accelerate.”Creating familiarity, says Friel, is probably the most important thing in doing a family drama. “When you have no rehearsal time” – the whole thing was shot in four weeks – “you need that openness and believability. ‘That’s my child’, ‘That’s my father.’”In 2020, Friel was in a film with the same theme, calledSulphur and White– based on the real-life story of David Tait, the survivor of a paedophile ring and a campaigner for the NSPCC. The film was slightly blindsided by Covid – it was released on the eve of lockdown and hardly got an audience – but Friel is still in touch with Tait, having played his mother. “He was one of the first people I sent a screener of Unforgivable to,” she says. “He just cried from beginning to end, because all of his abusers, unfortunately, got away with it. And I think what struck him, as someone who has been abused, is that he carried the effects all the way through his life.”Friel has also just finished shooting, in Bristol, a semi-futuristic, semi-dystopian drama, set in 2038, about “deep poverty and the union of the human spirit”. After that, she says: “I think what I need is a really good comedy, or a romcom, or a Jane Austen novel, something beautiful and sweet.”Friel is often cast in darker roles – in the three seasons of the British so-called Nordic noir, Marcella, she barely smiles either. She doesn’t think it’s reflective of her personality. “I’m quite jolly and funny … I won’t say funny, I’m not allowed to call myself that. But Gracie [her daughter] and I just laugh constantly. We’re silly and lighthearted.” She and her ex, David Thewlis (they split in 2010) never encouraged Gracie to become an actor, but inevitably, having been on film sets in 10 countries before she was one, she is curious about acting, and their tastes are very similar. “We could, all three of us, be put in separate rooms, watch the same thing, write an essay on it and come back and say the same thing. I don’t know if that’s genetics or nurture, but we all have the same taste. We’d have the same notes, the same level of enjoyment or dislike.”View image in fullscreenNot a lot of smiling … Friel as Marcella in the British TV noir drama of the same name.Photograph: Publicity imageGracie turned 20 two weeks ago. A few days later, there was an Oasis gig in Manchester, “which took me back to the carefree days”, says Friel. “It was the most incredible night. Lots of people are referring to it as biblical. I felt like a teenager. All those songs resonate still to this day. To see them reunite, it was an incredible atmosphere, of love and hope and happiness.”She seriously got hope vibes from the Gallagher brothers?“I danced my little bottom off!”Friel turned 49 the day after that, then went to see her father, who is very unwell, her grandmother, who is 99 and pretty hale, and then to the Lake District for her godmother’s funeral.“It’s been a massive rollercoaster of emotions,” she says. “But I still love my job and I hope I’m always getting better at it.She has had wonderful mentors: “Brenda Fricker was one, and when I was on Broadway, I had the amazing Judi Dench giving me little notes and checking in on the phone. I remember being 22, looking up at them, going, ‘How have they done that?’ It’s utter discipline and never, ever feeling that you have got to a point where you can’t be better.”Unforgivable is on BBC Two on 24 JulyExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaTV crime dramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

These locations – as with all civilian sites – must be protected, regardless of evacuation orders,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.The World Health Organizationsaid its staff residence and main warehouse in Deir al-Balah was also attacked.Evacuation mapIn its daily update, Gaza’s health ministry said at least 130 Palestinians had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded by Israeli gunfire and military strikes across the territory in the past 24 hours, one of the highest such totals in recent weeks.Early on Tuesday health authorities said at least 12 Palestinians were killed and dozens injured when Israeli tanks fired on tents housing displaced people at al-Shati camp in western Gaza City. There was no immediate comment from Israel.On Mondaythe UK and 27 other countries signed a sharply critical lettercondemning the Israeli military’s killing of hundreds of Palestinians seeking food in recent weeks and calling for an immediate end to the conflict.“It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid. The Israeli government’s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable. Israel must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law,” the letter said.Israeli sources had said the reason the army had previously stayed out of Deir al-Balah was that they suspected Hamas might be holding hostages there. At least 20 of the remaining 50 hostages in captivity in Gaza are believed to remain alive.Israel launched its renewed assault despite reports in the Hebrew media that Israeli officials believed Hamas was close to agreeing to a ceasefire.View image in fullscreenMourners attend the funeral of relatives killed in an Israeli bombardment in Deir al-Balah on Monday.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APThe latest Israeli assault followed forced evacuation orders for between 50,000 and 80,000 people in Deir al-Balah, in the centre of the Gaza Strip, leaving almost 88% of the territory under such orders.“With this latest order, the area of Gaza under displacement orders or within Israeli-militarised zones has risen to 87.8%, leaving 2.1 million civilians squeezed into a fragmented 12% of the strip, where essential services have collapsed,” the UN said in a statement released by its Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha).With the growing threat of widespread starvation, Ocha emphasised the importance of Deir al-Balah for what remained of the struggling international aid effort. Warehouses, health clinics and a key desalination plant serving southern Gaza are located there. “Any damage to this infrastructure will have life-threatening consequences,” the agency added.Amid increasing concern over the potential impact of the latest assaults, Ocha said the agency’s local head in Gaza, Jonathan Whittall, had decided to remain in Deir al-Balah.View image in fullscreenAn injured man is brought to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after Israeli forces opened fire on civilians who were waiting for humanitarian aid near Gaza City on Sunday.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockIn a series of posts on X, Whittall said the territory was witnessing “conditions of death” and that “This death and suffering is preventable. And if it’s preventable, but still happening, then that suggests to me that it’s intentional.”Unrwa, the UN refugee agency dedicated to Palestinians, said on X it was receiving desperate messages from Gaza warning of starvation, including from its own staff, as food prices have soared.“Meanwhile, just outside Gaza, stockpiled in warehouses, UNRWA has enough food for the entire population for over three months. Lift the siege and let aid in safely and at scale,” it said.The Israeli military said it had not entered the districts of Deir al-Balah subject to the evacuation order during the current conflict and that it was continuing “to operate with great force to destroy the enemy’s capabilities and terrorist infrastructure in the area”.Deep concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza was underlined by reports from doctors that more than a dozen Palestinians had died from hunger in the past 24 hours.“Nineteen people, including children, have died of hunger,” Khalil al-Daqran, a spokesperson for al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah told the BBC. “Hospitals can no longer provide food for patients or staff, many of whom are physically unable to continue working due to extreme hunger.“Hospitals cannot provide a single bottle of milk to children suffering from hunger, because all baby formula has run out from the market.”In southern Gaza, the health ministry said an Israeli undercover unit had on Monday detained Marwan Al-Hams, head of Gaza’s field hospitals, in a raid that killed a local journalist and wounded another outside a field medical facility run by the International Committee of the Red Cross.An ICRC spokesperson said the ICRC had treated patients injured in the incident, but did not comment further on their status. It said it was “very concerned about the safety and security” around the field hospital.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.People killed and injured while seeking aid in Gaza chartAccording to the World Food Programme, the killing of dozens of Palestinians who had gathered to get flour on Sunday came after a convoy of 25 trucks carrying food assistance crossed into Gaza.“Shortly after passing the final checkpoint … the convoy encountered large crowds of civilians anxiously waiting to access desperately needed food supplies,” the agency said. “As the convoy approached, the surrounding crowd came under fire from Israeli tanks, snipers and other gunfire.Senior Labour MP urges UK to recognise Palestinian state ahead of UN conferenceRead moreIsrael’s military acknowledged the shooting but said it had fired “warning shots to remove an immediate threat posed to the troops”. It said initial findings suggested the reported casualty figures were inflated, and that it “certainly does not intentionally target humanitarian aid trucks”.The latest Israeli attacks in Gaza took place as a security official for Yemen’s Houthi group said Israel had struck Hodeidah port on Monday, destroying a dock that had been rebuilt after it was damaged in earlier attacks.“The bombing destroyed the port’s dock, which had been rebuilt following previous strikes,” the official told Agence France-Presse, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Without it, you would not secure cabinet and parliamentary support for military action. She must understand that you could be forced from office if you tried. The US must not promote regime change in Baghdad at the price of regime change in London.”Manning wrote: “I said that Bush could afford to gamble. He wanted a second resolution but it was not crucial to him. He already had congressional authority to act unilaterally. This was quite different from the situation you were facing.“Condi acknowledged this but said that there came a point in any poker game when you had to show your cards. I said that was fine for Bush. He would still be at the table if he showed his cards later. You would not.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Manning, Rice, Bush and Blair at Camp David in 2002.Photograph: Paul J Richards/EPAThe Americans were becoming increasingly impatient with the unwillingness of France and Russia – which both had a veto on the UN security council – to agree a resolution so long as UN inspectors were unable to find any evidence of Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, the supposed justification for war.After Bush’s annual State of the Union address to Congress, shortly before Blair’s visit, the UK’s Washington ambassador, Christopher Meyer, warned that the options for a peaceful solution had effectively run out.Meyer described Bush’s message on Iraq by this point as “messianic”. It was now “politically impossible” for Bush to back down from war “absent Saddam’s surrender or disappearance from the scene”, he wrote.View image in fullscreenThe then US ambassador Christopher Meyer said Bush was bent on overthrowing Saddam Hussein as part of a ‘mission to rid the world of evil-doers’.Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PABush’s State of the Union address had closed off any room for manoeuvre, Meyer informed London: “In the high-flown prose to which Bush is drawn on these set-piece occasions, he said in effect that destroying Saddam is a crusade against evil to be undertaken by God’s chosen people.”In another cable the previous month, he said of Bush: “His view of the world is Manichean. He sees his mission as ridding it of evil-doers.”In the end, the US and UK abandoned their efforts to get agreement on a resolution, claiming the French president, Jacques Chirac, had made it clear he would never agree.In another briefing note before Camp David, theMinistry of Defencewarned: “The loosening of Saddam’s grip on power may give rise to significant levels of internecine violence.”One of thekey findings of the Chilcot reportwas that Blair had ignored warnings on what would happen in Iraq after invasion, and it rejected Blair’s claim that the subsequent chaos and sectarian conflict could not have been predicted.Explore more on these topicsNational ArchivesForeign policyTony BlairGeorge BushIraqIraq war inquiryCondoleezza RicenewsShareReuse this content"

The inside story of Palestine Action – and the plan to ban itRead moreChallenging the ban on the grounds that it contravened freedom of expression and assembly under the European convention on human rights, Ní Ghrálaigh said the proscription had already had a significant impact. “Dozens and dozens of people have been arrested for protesting, seated and mostly silent protest,” she added.Among the cases she highlighted were protesters near the BAE Systems factory in Samlesbury, Lancashire, who were stopped by police who asked them to remove shirts reading “Free Palestine” because they might have breached the proscription order.She said a man in Leeds was arrested for carrying a placard reproducing a graphic from Private Eye magazine, which said: “Unacceptable Palestine Action: spraying military planes. Acceptable Palestine Action: shooting Palestinians queueing for food.”Ní Ghrálaigh said Merseyside police had bailed someone on condition they did not “mention” Palestine.She highlighted the case of Laura Murton,first reported by the Guardian, who was threatened with arrest by armed police for supporting a proscribed organisation because she was holding a Palestinian flag and had signs saying “Free Gaza” and “Israel is committing genocide”.Mr Justice Chamberlain said in response: “This is obviously an officer that doesn’t understand the law at all.”Ní Ghrálaigh pointed out that Kent police had not apologised.Ammori’s lawyers said the timing of the ban indicated that “national security risk was not a material factor” and was secondary to “political considerations”.Although a review body recommended banning Palestine Action on 13 March, Husain and Ní Ghrálaigh said Foreign Office memos had advised “against moving to implement a decision to proscribe quickly”. This was because proscription might be received poorly domestically and abroad if implemented shortly after Israel’s resumption of military action inGaza.Sir James Eadie KC, representing theHome Office, accepted it was true that most of Palestine Action’s activities were not terrorism but said: “The incidents are serious and they’re escalating.”He focused almost exclusively on process, telling the court in written submissions: “Parliament has prescribed the alternative and appropriate remedy namely an appeal to POAC (Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission) as the appropriate mechanism for challenging proscription; POAC’s procedures are better suited to such a challenge; and there is no good reason for going behind that process in the present case.”Chamberlain said he would give his decision on 30 July on whether to grant Ammori permission for a judicial review.Explore more on these topicsProtestGazaHome OfficeYvette CooperFreedom of speechCounter-terrorism policyIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

At the moment, the companies are responsible for reporting their own spills.Cunliffe’s reforms for water should have happened 20 years ago | Nils PratleyRead moreCampaigners and environment groups will have more of a say in the cleaning-up of their local rivers, Reed announced, and regional water boards will be set up with powers to clean up rivers and seas locally as well as planning essential infrastructure.“Volunteers and citizen scientists will be able to engage for the first time through regional structures. Citizens, local authorities, businesses will all have a voice,” he said.A super-regulator will be created to replace Ofwat, which has been blamed for letting water companies preside over decades of financial mismanagement andwidespread sewage dumping.This new watchdog will also take in the powers of the Environment Agency, the DrinkingWaterInspectorate and Natural England to avoid duplication of efforts and provide one clear regulatory system for the industry.Reed said: “I agree with Sir Jon that water regulation has been too weak, too complex and ineffective. Having four separate regulators with overlapping and conflicting remits has failed customers and the environment.”View image in fullscreenSteve Reed said ‘water regulation has been too weak, too complex and ineffective’.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesHowever, Cunliffe told the Guardian it would be 2027 at the earliest before the new body was fully set up, comparing it to the media regulator. “We looked at Ofcom, which took two years,” he said.Launching his 465-page report at the London Museum of Water and Steam on Monday, he said the current system had failed: “If we are to achieve the water sector we need, we need to look at all the factors that have contributed to our Great Stink moment. Some companies have manifestly acted in their private interest but against the public interest. That must be prevented in future.”The Great Stink was the name given to the terriblehot summer of 1858that created such an awful smell from the Thames that Sir Joseph Bazalgette was tasked with creating the capital’s sewer system.Another recommendation Reed is adopting from Cunliffe’s report is tocreate an ombudsmanwith legal powers to recoup funds for customers who face water outages, and Reed will set out “strong ministerial directives” for Ofwat and the Environment Agency while they are merged, as Cunliffe recommended.The rest of the suggestions will be considered over the summer and conclusions will be published in a white paper in the autumn.Cunliffe proposed the creation of a formal turnaround regime to allow struggling companies space to recover under “regulatory forbearance” which could let them avoid fines.Thames Water, the UK’s largest water company with 16 million customers in London and the south-east, is loaded with £20bn of debt and is struggling to stave off financial collapse into special administration,a form of temporary nationalisation.However, it may not be able to benefit from the proposed turnaround regime, according to Reed, who said the government was prepared for the company to enter special administration if that became necessary. The company has been asking to bespared more than £1bn in fines,arguing it would face financial collapse if it had to pay for committing environmental offences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mark Lloyd, the chief executive of the Rivers Trust, said the 88 recommendations “would lead to a dramatic improvement in the water environment and far more cost-effective delivery”.Others were less enthusiastic, particularly as Cunliffe was barred by Reed from exploring the possibility of nationalisation.The water campaigner Feargal Sharkey accused the government of a year of inaction on sewage and called for the environment secretary to quit: “The first year has been so chaotic,” he said. “Quite frankly I think Steve Reed now needs to resign and hand the job over to somebody who can be more effective.” A spokesperson for Keir Starmer said the prime minister had full confidence in Reed, who was doing an “excellent” job.The GMB union called for the renationalisation of water. Gary Carter, its national officer, said: “Water privatisation has been a disastrous failure. It’s a disgrace – and one Ofwat has overseen. Now is the time to fundamentally reform the water sector and renationalise this vital resource.”Reed said he had not considered nationalisation as an option because his department had found the cost would be in excess of £100bn – money that could be used for services such as the NHS. Economists have queried this figure and suggested itcould cost as little as £14.5bn.Graph showing there was a recent high of water-polluting incidents in 2024.Cunliffe said the ownership structure was not necessarily the cause of the sewage pollution, arguing that the UK had been the “dirty man of Europe” under a nationalised model.He defended the high pay of water company executives after anger caused by the news last week aboutSouthern Water’s chief executive receiving a doubled pay package.“We are not proposing the regulator should set pay scales for the industry,” Cunliffe said. “They do need to recruit, and you have to attract the best people.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, claimed on Monday that women and girls were facing a “public safety crisis” as a result of crimes committed by “illegal immigrants”.Philp’s comments were delivered in the Commons after six people were arrested after a protest outside an Essex hotel believed to house asylum seekers.A series of demonstrationshas taken place outside the Bell Hotel in Epping since Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, a 38-year-old asylum seeker, was charged with sexual assault over allegedly trying to kiss a girl of 14.He denied the charge at Chelmsford magistrates court last Thursday.Philp told MPs: “Numbers in asylum hotels are now higher than at the time of the election. This is a border security crisis, but it is also a public safety crisis, especially for women and girls.”He urged the government to “record and publish the immigration status of all offenders” and to close the hotel in Epping.Diana Johnson, the crime and policing minister, said it was “vital that the criminal justice procedures are able to run their course”.She added that the government took any allegation of sexual assault “incredibly seriously” and was changing the law to ensure those convicted of sexual offences were not granted asylum.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumDavid LammyEuropeCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

His club paid tribute to the “hugely talented and charismatic individual” who “had a great future ahead of him”.It comes two weeks after the death of another Scottish tourist, Evan Thomson, 26, who fell to his death at the hotel on 7 July.The hotel, which is also an open-air music venue, has decided to pause its scheduled events programme due to “the seriousness of the situation and out of respect for those involved”.It said: “We are deeply shocked and devastated by the recent incidents that have tragically occurred. Our priority is to support those affected and their loved ones during this incredibly difficult time, and to fully assist the authorities with their investigations. The safety and wellbeing of our guests has, and always will remain, our highest priority.”The rapper Dizzee Rascal was due to play this week and the drum’n’bass band Rudimental were expected to appear on 30 July. The hotel did not specify how many events were cancelled.A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British man who has died inSpainand are in contact with the local authorities.”The Dundee Stars said: “We send our thoughts and condolences to Gary’s family, partner, and all his friends at this extremely difficult time. Everyone at the club including players, staff, management, and ownership are heartbroken to hear this tragic news.“Gary was hugely talented and charismatic individual who had a great future ahead of him. His loss will impact many in the ice hockey community and beyond. He will be sadly missed. We respect and support the family’s request for privacy at this extremely difficult time.”Other ice hockey teams also paid tribute to Kelly. In a statement on X, the Glasgow Clan said: “This is truly heartbreaking news. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragic incident during this incredibly difficult time.”The Whitley Warriors, who Kelly played for briefly, said: “Gary iced for Warriors on only a few occasions in the 2023-24 season but was a popular player in the dressing room despite the shortness of his time at Whitley.”Thomson’s mother paid tribute to her son in a social media post. “I’m absolutely heartbroken to write and tell you all, earlier this week my son Evan was in a tragic accident whilst on holiday with his friends in Ibiza and sadly passed away,” she wrote, adding: “We are all absolutely broken.”Explore more on these topicsSpainScotlandEuropeIce hockeynewsShareReuse this content"

It took a jury five hours and three minutes to unanimously find Mosquera guilty.Grisly suitcase find led to one of Met’s ‘most harrowing’ murder inquiriesRead moreThe judge, Mr Justice Bennathan KC, said he would sentence Mosquera on 24 October. He said: “I am not going to pass sentence on you today although the only one I can pass on you is one of life imprisonment. I am going to order a psychiatric report on you. It is in your interests to cooperate with the psychiatrist so that I can decide the minimum term you are going to serve.”Mosquera, who had been staying with the couple, froze some of their remains and brought the rest to Bristol, the court heard.Alfonso enjoyed “extreme sex” and Mosquera, a Colombian national he had met online years earlier, was part of that world, jurors heard. Alfonso was stabbed to death during a filmed sex session.Mosquera’s plan was to hurl the suitcases over the bridge to dispose of the remains after the “calculated” and “premeditated” killings, the prosecutor, Deanna Heer KC, said. But he was witnessed attempting the disposal late on 10 July 2024 shortly after pubs were emptying following England’s football victory over the Netherlands in the Euros semi-final.Mosquera abandoned the suitcases, triggering a manhunt that led to his eventual arrest outside Bristol Temple Meads railway station on 13 July last year.Explore more on these topicsLondonCrimeBristolEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

She raised Trump’s name specifically because of an unsettling encounter with him late one night in 1995 in Epstein’s offices – which she said she told law enforcement agents at the time andhas since recounted publicly.Farmer told the Times that she has “long wondered” how law enforcement agencies handled her complaints in 1996 and 2006.In 2008, Epstein struck a deal with federal prosecutors in south Florida that allowed him to escape more severe federal charges while pleading guilty to state offenses of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution. Investigators say he died by suicide in 2019 in a prison cell while awaiting trial for child sex-trafficking.Maxwell in 2022 was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sex-trafficking.Farmer’s account could indicate in what context Trump’s name may appear in unreleased Epstein-related files, a matter which has generated unprecedented fury and division among the president’s usually loyal supporters.Any documentary evidence of Farmer’s efforts to draw the FBI’s attention to Epstein’s associates could prove politically thorny for Trump, who has tried – but failed – to divert attention from his ties to the convicted sex offender. Farmer’s account could also fuel further mistrust in the official version of events, including findings that Epstein died by suicide.The hefty Epstein files almost certainly contain many records that have not been made public, and probably include names and details of tips, evidence, testimonies and relationships that were gathered during the investigation – but may have not been corroborated or relied upon in the prosecutions of him and Maxwell.Law enforcement agencies have not accused Trump of any wrongdoing related to Epstein, and he has never been named as a target of any investigation.The White House contested Farmer’s account and told the Times that Trump ended his friendship with Epstein many years ago.Trump’s relationship with Epstein has come under intense renewed scrutiny since his attorney general, Pam Bondi, and FBI director, Kash Patel, backtracked on earlier pledges to release Epstein investigative files.Trump has responded to the backlash from his supporters – and Democrats – at the U-turn with mounting fury. But that has not defused the backlash, and Trump then called for relevant grand jury testimony in the prosecution of Epstein to be publicly released, insisting that he had nothing to hide.Farmer was in her mid-20s when she worked for Epstein in 1995 and 1996, initially acquiring art on his behalf but then later manned the front desk of his Upper East Side townhouse and would oversee the comings and goings of girls, young women and celebrities.One night in 1995, Farmer said she was summoned to Epstein’s offices in a luxury building in Manhattan. She arrived in running shorts. Trump then turned up wearing a suit, according to Farmer.Farmer said she felt scared as Trump was hovering over her, staring at her bare legs. Epstein entered the room, and she recalled him saying to Trump: “No, no. She’s not here for you.”The two men left the room, and Farmer said she overheard Trump commenting that he thought she was 16 years old. Farmer told the Times that she had no further alarming interactions with him and never saw him engage in inappropriate conduct with other girls or women.The White House communications director, Steven Cheung, told the Times, “The president was never in his office,” referring to Epstein. “The fact is that the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep.”The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said: “Dumb NYTimes reporters are desperately recycling news stories to try to link President Trump toJeffrey Epstein. It’s not news that Epstein was a member of the Mar-a-Lago club, because it’s the same club Donald Trump kicked Epstein out of for being a creep. These stories are tired and pathetic attempts to distract from all the success of President Trump’s administration.”The president’s position on Epstein has evolved.Trump was quoted in 2002 as calling Epstein a “terrific guy” – and there are videos of the pair partying together in New York, years before he entered politics.In 2019, Trump repeatedly told journalists that he was “not a fan” of Epstein and had broken ties with him two decades previously. In August of that year, after Epstein’s death, Trump retweeted a post that alleged former US president Bill Clinton was connected to Epstein’s death. (Clinton has denied any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and has denied ever visiting Epstein’s private island.)On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump strongly suggested that he was inclined to release the federal files on Epstein amid growing pressure from his base and high-profile supporters who have long suspected foul play by authorities, in part to cover up a much bigger criminal scandal involving rich and powerful Democrats.The Times story, published on Sunday, came just days after the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump in 2003 sent Epstein a sexually suggestive birthday greeting. Trump called the report a hoax and filed lawsuits against the news organization and its owners, including Rupert Murdoch, for at least $10bn for defamation.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

And there will be further injustices perpetrated because the police do what they do.”Under the government of Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s, the Home Office and senior police officers created a secret tactical manual that redefined what could be considered “reasonable force” when it came to protesters. For example, it allowed mounted police charges into static crowds and the use of short shields and truncheons to “incapacitate” non-violent protesters.View image in fullscreenIn the early 1980s, the Home Office and senior police secretly redefined ‘reasonable force’ against protesters.Photograph: Photofusion/RexThese additional unprecedented powers, described as “paramilitary” tactics, have still not been repealed, despite never having parliamentary approval. Another campaigner, Chris Peace, added: “I think the issue is when policing gets political, and the policing at Orgreave was politically led. I think that’s an important point to make.”The clash between police and striking miners on 18 June 1984 at the Orgreave coking plant inSouth Yorkshirerepresented a “turning point”, they said, in the police’s use of force to shut down protest.While Thatcher maintained that the government had not interfered in policing of the miners’ strike, various Home Office documents have since revealed extensive active interference, including influencing, directing and financially supporting the police in their actions against striking miners.Speaking before the press conference, the mayor of South Yorkshire, Oliver Coppard, said the police were under “completely new” leadership in South Yorkshire compared with the days of the strike.View image in fullscreenKevin Horne, who was arrested at Orgreave in 1984, visited the site of the protest with other miners and the home secretary on Monday.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I’m conscious that in South Yorkshire and across this country we have any number of challenges when it comes to policing protests, because these things are always difficult. But I think what we saw on the day at Orgreave was a million miles away from the way in which protest is policed now.”He added that the Orgreave inquiry was important “because we need the truth and we need accountability and we need justice to be done”.However, police in South Yorkshire were not as welcoming, with the Police Federation stating that local operations were already at “breaking point”. The chair of the police-staffing association in South Yorkshire, Steven Kent, said: “Courageous colleagues are out there keeping the public safe struggling with what feels like one arm tied behind their backs as government cutbacks to the service hit home.“This will be long and protracted – and the associated costs of this inquiry will lead to there being even less money in the policing purse, which will only have a negative impact on the public of South Yorkshire.”One of the 95 miners arrested at Orgreave, the campaigner Kevin Horne, said the inquiry would not “make the wrong thing right”, but that it could help mining communities “get back to something normal again”.He said: “We have this chance now of wiping the slate clean so that our children and grandchildren can respect the police again.”Explore more on these topicsThe miners’ strike 1984-85PoliceSouth YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Few environmental crises evoke such visceral public anger aspumping poointo waterways, but for years, that is exactly what water companies in England and Wales have done in large volumes.Their failure to build infrastructure, plug leaks and protect nature has infuriated customers who at the same time have struggled withsoaring water bills. It has also shocked European neighbours whose publicly owned water companies keep things far cleaner.Critics say the increasingly sorry state of England’s waterways is the result of mismanagement and underinvestment by debt-ridden water companies who were allowed to run wild by toothless regulators.Graph showing there was a recent high of water-polluting incidents in 2024.The problem, as they see it, is the environmental conundrum at the heart of the modern consumer paradigm: public goods such as healthy rivers and clean beaches do not appear on company balance sheets. Why should corporations – which have a duty to create value for their shareholders – look after public goods? And if governments won’t force them to, should we really expect them to look after the environment?In this case, after alandmark report on the troubled sectoron Monday, the government announced it would combine the powers of four water industry watchdogs – which had competing economic and environmental aims – into one entity with oversight for the sector. It promised “strong ministerial directives” and an end to its light-touch approach.“A single, powerful regulator responsible for the entire water sector will stand firmly on the side of customers, investors and the environment, and prevent the abuses of the past,” said Steve Reed, the UK environment secretary.The adopted proposal is just one of 88 recommendations from a report by an independent water commission– the bulk of which the government will consider over the summer – and the response from environmental experts has so far been muted.Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist at the University of Reading, said water industry reforms were “long overdue and badly needed” but warned against spending years setting up new structures while rivers stay polluted and reservoirs run dry.“The real challenge isn’t designing better systems on paper – it’s getting companies to actually fix leaking pipes, stop dumping sewage and build the infrastructure we need,” she said. “Less reorganising, more doing.”The report contains several recommendations that could help improve water quality and manage its supply, such as better third-party monitoring, new infrastructure standards, compulsory smart meters and a ban on wet wipes with plastic. It considers drawing from new EU rules to make polluters pay for the extra treatments needed to clean up emerging micropollutants, which could eventually include long-lasting Pfas (“forever chemicals”) and microplastics.The report also calls for the updating of existing environmental laws, in addition to overhauling the regulators. The proposed “streamlining” includes setting a new long-term target for the health of water bodies in England andWales– though the move might tempt ministers to lower ambition, given that the existing targets are set to be missed.Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Rivers Trust, said it was understandable that “many people will have wanted this report to go further” but that he believed the recommendations, if implemented, would lead to a “dramatic improvement” in the water environment and more cost-effective delivery.Most of all, though, the report has also come under fire for what it has left out.Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green party, compared the proposed regulatory changes to “rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic”.“Not only that, but the majority of the public are going to be expected to pay more in bills, as we watch the industry continue to sink under the failed model of privatisation,” he said. “The government deliberately left out the option of public ownership from the review, but that’s the only real way to get the water industry to clean up its act.”That outcome isn’t guaranteed. When the water companies were privatised in 1989, the UK was regarded as “the dirty man of Europe”. A trip to its beaches shows it has come full circle.Explore more on these topicsWater industryThames WaterRegulatorsUtilitiesPollutionWater billsPrivatisationanalysisShareReuse this content"

Here are some of his main claims and how they stack up.‘Crime has rocketed since the 1990s’Farage’s central argument is that crime has risen so much that the UK is “facing societal collapse”, while politicians are in complete denial. He wrote on Monday that total crime was 50% higher than it was in the 1990s.He told reporters that the crime survey for England and Wales was “based on completely false data” and that “if you look at police-recorded crime … there are some significant rises in crimes of all kinds, particularly crimes against the person”.He went on to argue that the true figures were even higher than the records showed, because “most of us now don’t even bother to report crime”.In fact, the Office for National Statistics regards the crime survey for England and Wales as the more accurate metric of long-term crime trends, because it includes incidents that haven’t been reported to the police and is unaffected by changes in how crime is recorded. It is unclear what Farage’s claim that it is based on “completely false data” is founded on.The ONS also says police-recorded crime “does not tend to be a good indicator of general trends in crime” and should only be used in conjunction with other data.ONS analysis ofcrime survey and police-recorded crime dataconcludes that crime against individuals and households has generally fallen over the last 10 years, with some important exceptions, including sexual assault. There have been long-term decreases in violence with or without injury, theft offences and criminal damage since the mid-1990s.There are, however, some increases in the short term. The latest survey shows a 33% increase in fraud last year, and a 50% increase in theft from the person compared with 2023.‘People in the UK no longer feel safe’Farage claimed that “people are scared of going to the shops” or “to let their kids out” and that “witnessing and experiencing crime has become normalised”.It is true that a significant proportion of British voters – 22%according to YouGov’s poll tracker– regard crime as one of the biggest issues the country faces. Crime ranks behind the NHS, however, cited by 33% of people, and immigration and asylum, cited by 53%.One concrete data point Farage mentioned was that 57% of women felt it was unsafe to walk on the streets of London, whichcame from a Survation pollcarried out this spring.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has said nothing about crime.Farage also said one in three people in London had been subject to phone theft. This appears to have come from a survey of 1,000 people by a UK fintech startup called Nuke From Orbit, rather than the police-reported figures that Farage said he preferred. According to the Metropolitan police, 80,000 phones were reported stolen in London in 2024, which suggests the crime affected far fewer than one in three people.TheReform UKleader did cite some official figures, including that shoplifting in London was up 54% last year compared with 2023, which came from the ONS.Explore more on these topicsReform UKCrimeNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

She would wake every morning to a view of the sea, spend her days splashing in the surf, playing football on the sand with her brothers. They would talk into the night, eating and drinking, the waves crashing below them. These are her earliest and most treasured memories: Nettuno, the coastal town an hour south of Rome, where hernonnastill lives and which Alessia Russo still describes as her favourite place in the world.The story goes – and so fondly is it recounted in the Russo family that it has long since passed into lore – that one day Alfonso was up from Sicily, visiting Rome with a friend, when he saw a girl stepping on to a train at the railway station. No, not just a girl.Thegirl. Two fairly major issues: he didn’t know her, and it wasn’t his train. But Alfonso was a true romantic, the train was about to leave the station, and above all he knew that some moments in life just need to be seized.Euro 2025 power rankings: Spain still the team to beat but England in huntRead moreTurns out she was an English girl named Patricia, visiting Italy on a school trip. Problem number three: he didn’t speak English. But a fellow passenger was able to translate for them, the pair got talking, and after a fashion they fell in love. After another fashion, they ended up getting married. Seven decades later, their granddaughterwill play for England against Italyfor a place in a European Championship final.We are, in large part, who we once were: our bloodlines and our stories, stones carried along in the river. Perhaps this is even more apparent in women’s football, a sport in thrall to the journey, a collective inheritance passed down from the pioneers and the dreamers who built it in the shadows, to the ballers and the icons who play it today. Russo’s career has been built on her own talent, her own hard work, her own dedication and ambition. But it has also been shaped, irrevocably so, by forces wildly out of her control, by decisions taken before she even existed.So Alfonso moved to London in the 1950s, where he fell in love with the Busby Babes and established a lifelong passion for Manchester United. His son Mario played non-league, coached local kids, reared his two sons Giorgio and Luca in his own footballing obsession. And so by the time Alessia came into the world, in a sense her footballing life had already been built around her: endless games in the back garden, football on the television, blue box‑fresh Azzurri shirts to wear for major tournaments. Indeed, Mario still supports Italy in men’s football. But come Tuesday night, he will be a Lioness.View image in fullscreenAfter 120 minutes of hard running, Alessia Russo still found the energy – and courage – to fire the opening penalty past the Sweden goalkeeper, Jennifer Falk.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAOf course Alessia sounds English, wears the England No 23 shirt, plays with English brawn and guts. But sometimes when she gets animated, you see her hands flailing and gesturing with a quality that can only be described as “you know, quite Italian”. And as much as the game in Geneva on Tuesday night is a job to be done, it will surely also stir certain memories and emotions, the multivalent loyalties of those she loves, of those who came before her. Parents Mario and Carol. Grandparents Alfonso and Patricia. Uncle Bob and aunt Teresa, who died before she was born but after whom she takes one of her middle names.For all this, after thedrama of Thursday night in Zurich, the chaotic penalty shootout against Sweden in which Russo admitted later that she briefly lost track of the score, England will be deeply grateful for a simpler game in Geneva. Russo was slightly annoyed with her performance on Thursday, bleakly aware that had she taken one of the chances that had fallen to her in extra time, there would have been no need for penalties.Alessia RussoBut it was scarcely her fault that she was exhausted by that point, having spent more than 90 minutes grappling and chasing, forced to wait until the 93rd minute for her first attempt on goal. It was a measure of her patience and work ethic that she was still able to contribute in other ways: holding the ball up, running the channels, leading the press. But England’s job against Italy will be to get service to their most potent goal threat, to surround her with bodies and runners, to prevent her being isolated against a team that will have no issue defending for long periods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Norway were truly abject against them in the quarter-finals, but Italy also held Spain to their lowest expected goals of the tournament in a slightly harsh 3-1 defeat. The speed and the precision of their counterattacking suggests a strong degree of tactical drilling, with Arianna Caruso and Sofia Cantore the perfect foils for the great Cristiana Girelli, who at the age of 35 remains as devastatingly elusive as ever, still arguably one of the top six or eight pure centre-forwards on the planet.Quick GuideEngland v Italy: past three meetingsShowItaly 1-5 England, 27 Feb 2024, AlgecirasThe Lionesses started preparations for the Euro 2025 qualifiers perfectly, with a dominant win over Italy in south-west Spain. Lotte Wubben-Moy gave England the lead inside the first minute and Lauren Hemp scored twice to put England 3-0 ahead after 34 minutes.Le Azzurregot one back just before half-time through Michela Cambiaghi, but England cemented their dominance with second-half goals from Ella Toone and Rachel Daly to round off an impressive performance.England 2-1 Italy, 19 Feb 2023, CoventryEngland made it two out of two wins in the Arnold Clark Cup, thanks to two Daly headers either side of Sofia Cantore’s 62nd-minute equaliser. Italy could not contain Daly, who in addition to her goals, hit the crossbar just before half-time. The Lionesses broke the attendance record for a sporting event at the CBS Arena, drawing a crowd of 32,128.England 1-1 Italy, 7 April 2017, StokeEngland were held to a frustrating draw in their penultimate home match before Euro 2017. Italy scored with their only attempt on goal, which came from Valentina Cernoia minutes after Jodie Taylor opened the scoring in the 70th minute. The Lionesses dominated Mark Sampson’s 50th match in charge, with a whopping 23 shots to Italy’s six.Eze ObasiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Russo, too, is beginning to enter that conversation, even if she has been forced to wait for the recognition her talent deserves. And of course there are parallels here too with her upbringing, the way her brothers would make her go in goal in the garden, the way she was forced to leave Chelsea in search of regular football, the way she remained second choice to Ellen White at the last European Championship, the way she remains weirdly underrated by a lot of non-Arsenal fans, despite being probably two wins from being a very decent Ballon d’Or shout.Alfonso died a few years ago, before Alessia’s career really began to take off. He had Alzheimer’s disease, but even as his faculties began to desert him this lifelong football fanatic could still remember the teams he played for as a teenager. And this of course is the eternal power of football: its ability to cut across generations and borders, its universality, its enduring ability to teach us basic lessons about life. The train is leaving the station. Nobody knows what happens next. But some moments in life just need to be seized.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Alessia RussoEngland women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The answer was on the other side of the worldI connected with other moms worldwide, doctors and a geneticist – and identified the rare genetic disorder that connects us allAsha DoreMon 21 Jul 2025 13.43 EDTFirst published on Mon 21 Jul 2025 12.12 EDTShareRight after my daughter, Maggie, was born in 2012, she held her hands clasped together against her chest. “Like she’s praying!” a nurse said in a singsong voice.But when the pediatrician walked in, the mood changed. “Praying?” she asked, her voice tight. The nurse and I stepped back while the pediatrician gently moved Maggie’s limbs, testing how much they could straighten or bend. While some tightness in the hips or knees can be normal for a newborn, Maggie’s joints were unusually tight and her limbs could not straighten all the way.The pediatrician pointed out the rounded soles of Maggie’s feet. “A handful of genetic conditions can cause the shape of her feet. Most of them are fatal,” she said.I stared at her, unable to process the word “fatal” in connection to the brand new, six-pound person I’d brought into this world.Over the next seven days, I rarely slept. The children’s hospital put me up in aRonald McDonald housea mile away from the NICU, where Maggie had been transferred. Every three hours, I walked to the NICU to breastfeed and pump. I was anxious and scared, signing off on procedures and tests, and answering dozens of questions about my pregnancy, diet, lifestyle and family history. By the time Maggie left the hospital, she had been seen by neurology, genetics, internal medicine and orthopedics.Then the results came: she had tested negative for the scary fatal conditions. The relief floored me. But she also tested negative for every other known diagnosis.“Why are her joints stiff?” I asked her last doctor right before discharge. He shrugged and said, “We can only get to know her as an individual. Sometimes it is not a bad thing to see how unique each person really is.”I agreed that accepting my daughter’s differences was essential. But I worried that the physicians had missed something. For the next two months, I sat in front of the computer, flipping through Maggie’s 50-page medical chart and searching terms like “multiple joint contractures”, “vertical talus”, “high arched palate” and “micrognathia”.Eventually, I discovered pictures of children with similar limbs in medical journals and studies aboutarthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC – an umbrella diagnosis describing infants born with multiple contracted joints.I showed Maggie’s new pediatrician screenshots. The condition was incredibly rare, he said; in his 30-year career, he had met only three babies who looked like my daughter, all during his time as a military physician overseas. He referred us to the closest specialty clinic, which was five states away in Philadelphia.“She has a community. You just haven’t met them yet,” he said.I knew the trip would be daunting with an infant and Maggie’s two-year-old sibling in tow. But for the first time, I had some answers and knew where to look for more.Six months later, Maggie and I arrived for her first appointment at the clinic. We saw five specialists, which took nine hours. Some mysteries were solved. I learned the term for her feet: “rocker bottom”, the soles curving like the bottoms of cartoon boats. Surgery could guide them to grow flatter and arched, so she could learn to bear weight and eventually walk.Since birth, Maggie’s elbows had loosened, but her knees still didn’t flex all the way. We would need to take annual weeks-long trips to Philadelphia so the doctors could slowly stretch Maggie’s ankles and knees, wrap them in casts, saw off the casts a week later, stretch a little farther, and cast again.Still, we had no diagnosis. “What caused all this?” I asked the doctors. I was afraid to voice my other questions:Will she walk or talk? How different will she be from her sibling? What decisions will I have to make? How will I know what is right?In the United States, parents of the one in six childrenwith developmental delaysask such questions every day. For the approximately15 million childrenwho have received a rare diagnosis, defined as one that affectsfewer than 200,000 people, the future is unknowable. Some diagnoses, like Maggie’s, are so rare thatthey aren’t seen as profitable subjectsfor research funding. People with these “orphan conditions” have to rely on themselves, their families, and grassroots endeavors to fund and discover treatments.Navigating the maze of anxiety and “what ifs” felt relentless. Then I joined a Facebook group dedicated to the AMC specialist clinic we had visited, where parents shared pictures of their children, diagnoses, concerns, treatments and contact information for specialists.I introduced myself and posted pictures of Maggie. Immediately, Alyssa Wolfe, a mother and nurse, messaged me. She pointed out that her daughter, Delaney, had the same rocker bottom feet as Maggie, a rarity in the group. Our daughters both had one middle finger stuck flexed at the joint, and similar faces: a small chin, and a broad nose bridge that makes their eyes look farther apart than most babies’.View image in fullscreenMaggie with her iPad, loaded with a program that she could use to talk.Photograph: Asha DoreDelaney was three years older than Maggie. For years, I tracked Alyssa and Delaney’s progress through treatments, surgeries and diagnoses. Having another parent to talk to about major decisions was a huge relief.Maureen Donohoe, a physical therapist, was also in the group, as she worked with many children with arthrogryposis. She had been gathering stories from patients like Maggie and Delaney because they “were different from the others with AMC, but they had so many of the same characteristics, it was impossible to ignore”, she said.Alyssa had met Maureen at an arthrogryposis conference before I joined the group. “In an elevator, Maureen approached me, listing off Delaney’s attributes. I asked her if she somehow read my child’s medical chart. Maureen told me, ‘No,’ but she had been hypothesizing with a geneticist about a syndrome, and she thought Delaney had it,” Alyssa said.After coming across six patients with these characteristics, Maureen had told Dr Judith Hall, a clinical geneticist and pediatrician, this might be a genetic anomaly worth studying. “After Dr Hall looked at her own notes, she called me and said, ‘I have 10,’” she said.Connecting with Alyssa and Maureen was the first major step in identifying Maggie’s condition. But what was the next step?As Maggie grew, her development continued to be markedly different from that of other kids her age. By the time she was three, she could scoot but not yet crawl. Most kids her age with AMC had been mobile for at least a year. But one day, in physical therapy, she suddenly stood with the help of a toy shopping cart. Then she learned to use a walker. Over the years Maureen noticed a similar trend with kids like Maggie. “They do their best weight-bearing and walking around preschool age,” she said. “When they get older, they seem to have a harder time maintaining a center of gravity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maggie was talking constantly, but her sounds were disorganized. Nobody could understand her. Most children with AMC alone had no speech problems at all. It was hard to find resources, but our speech therapist helped us get an iPad program that Maggie could use to talk. She’d press a button on a grid of images and common words, and the iPad would say the word.Her first sentence blew me away.Maggie was sitting at the dining room table eating breakfast while I washed dishes. “I need money,” her talker said in a mechanized child’s voice. I paused, holding a bowl. Maggie pressed the “talk” button again, and the sentence repeated. She pointed at my purse and threw her head back, guffawing. She’d made a joke. I said, “You need money!” over and over, laughing, nearly sobbing, dripping soapy water everywhere.Within a year, Maggie was using her talker to ask for snacks and toys, to complain, to tell her new baby brother, “You’re cute!” At school, Maggie verbally repeated every word she or her friends pressed. By the end of the school year, the talker was gathering dust in our coat closet.Maggie’s limitations and sudden moments of progress surprised even the doctors who specialized in arthrogryposis. At every turn, I wanted to celebrate her success, but the gap widened between her and the other kids with the condition.Isolating a genetic anomaly is a “diagnostic odyssey” that many families embark on, said Dr Michael Bamshad, head of genetic medicine in pediatrics at the University of Washington. “There’s all this data that sits locked away in medical records. A physician in one state may know of three similar cases, a physician in another state may know about five,” said Bamshad, “but there aren’t many ways for those families to find each other.”Bamshad, his colleague Jessica X Chong and their colleagues have researchedthe power of social media in genetic discovery. They launched a secure, free genetic information sharing site,MyGene2, in 2016. “Families and clinicians can share their genetic information to help them find answers,” said Chong.Alyssa and I input our daughters’ data and hoped for more information. But the waiting game was long, and we felt powerless. Alyssa recently described it to me as a three-part process: “In the beginning, parents are typically very active on social media, trying to understand their kid and hoping to give them as normal of a life as possible,” she said. Then, “sometime in elementary or middle school, their development stalls” and the focus shifts from “fixing” the issue to maintenance through puberty.This can all be “very isolating”, she said. “Parents with typically developing kids often stop hanging out with you.” But “an acceptance stage” can come via social media groups like ours, which are “sometimes the only place to find connection and friends who understand”.In 2017, Catherine Paul-Fijten, a mother and molecular biologist who lives in Dubai, used Facebook groups to connect with parents whose kids resembled her daughter, Milou. I didn’t know about Milou yet, but she had the same physical traits as Maggie, who was five by then. Milou’s doctors had located adifferenceon the ZC4H2 gene shortly after birth, and Catherine organized a meeting of doctors and geneticists – including Maureen and Dr Bamshad – to review the current, albeit limited, research.Maureen sat next to Bamshad, scrolling through pictures of Maggie, Delaney and other children with rocker bottom feet and tiny chins. Bamshad suggested that we both report our daughter’s symptoms on MyGene2 and apply for testing.Within a year, the diagnosis was confirmed: Maggie also had an anomaly of the ZC4H2 gene. At the time, fewer than 50 people with a similar genetic difference had ever been identified. Catherine used personal resources to start a foundation to research the impacts of this new genetic diagnosis, updating a new, dedicated Facebook group regularly with insights. The diagnosis gave us a sense of belonging through the shared goal of understanding our kids and learning how to help them grow.The dramatic impact of online support groups for children withrare diagnoseshas beenwell documentedfor more than 20 years. Online information sharing among parents has been found to strengthen treatment and mental health supportforfamiliesand children withSpinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA),neurologic disordersandotherraregenetic disordersas well as more common diagnoses likediabetesandchildhood cancers.While the ZC4H2 gene difference is rare, research into rare conditions is crucial – “not just for the people who have that diagnosis – but for humanity as a whole”, Catherine said. That’s because “much of what we know about the function of the human genome comes from understanding the genetic basis of rare diseases”, said Bamshad, citing examples including common heart conditions and vaccine research. “What we’ve learned about rare diseases helps us understand the genetic and molecular basis of common conditions as well.”The ZC4H2 group has nearly 200 members, though nearly 250 people with this condition have now been identified globally. Because of their stories, I was prepared. In 2023, at the beginning of sixth grade, Maggie suddenly presented with severe scoliosis, and I knew she would probably need a full spinal fusion because I’d heard about related complications from our ZC4H2 community. I shared this information with Maggie’s spinal surgeon, as well as a list of other surgeons who had had to manage these complications, and she formed a pre-emptive plan.During Maggie’s spinal surgery, I let myself get lost in the labyrinthian halls of the hospital for hours, cellphone in one hand, operating room pager in the other. As with her previous 10-plus surgeries, I didn’t allow myself to imagine what was happening or what could go wrong.As I stood in the hallway, I scrolled through encouraging comments and messages from Alyssa, Catherine and others. Despite our different jobs, family culture and background, we’d collaborated with doctors, scientists, physical and speech therapists – and each other – for more than a decade. Their support didn’t guarantee a perfect future for my daughter, but their generosity was a profound gift.The operating room pager went off. My phone rang. The charge nurse told me my daughter was waking up, that surgery had been a breeze. I rushed to the recovery room, tapping the app to share the news while I waited for Maggie to be wheeled in. At the top of the feed, a new member had posted about her child’s fresh diagnosis, her questions, her fears. I abandoned my own update to type the words that changed the course of my life and Maggie’s childhood:Welcome! You are not alone.Asha Dore is a journalist, illustrator, and speech-language therapist.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthMedical researchGeneticsChildrenSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thankfully, a wonderful casting director believed I was right for farmer Hoggett and pushed for me to get a meeting.George had found the book that the film is based on –The Sheep-Pig by British author Dick King-Smith– while on a trip to Europe with his daughter. I thought farmer Hoggett was from Yorkshire, but the studio said: “No. Movies with accents don’t make money.” Of course,Schindler’s Listwon the best picture Oscar that year and it was filled with accents.They wanted me to keep my American accent so I thought I’d blow smoke up their ass and spent a whole day using this Texas shit-kicker accent. In the end I had to re-record all of those lines using the British accent I ultimately went with.During my makeup test, George was standing nearby. As he walked past, he said: “Lose the sideburns.” I don’t know what got into me. I just said: “No. I like them.” George went, “Who the fuck is he?” and walked off. I was very pleased with myself.We had an animatronic sheep in the middle of real sheep – which doesn’t stick out. The crew used to bet on which one of the flock was fake. At the end of a take, you’d see the real sheep continue to look around and the animatronic one power down. You’d then hear a crew member say, “I got it!”On the second day of filming, I broke for lunch before everybody else. All the animals I’d worked with that morning were on the table, cut up, fricasseed, roasted and seared. That was when I decided to become a vegan.The final scene, where the sheep follow Babe, was a miracle. The woman who worked with the sheep spent five months trying to get them to walk three abreast in rows and follow the pig around the circuit. She was working with them right until we shot. I said, “Away to me pig” and those sheep moved through the circuit without a pause. When the gate closed behind them, the crowd – 200 extras we’d gathered from the local town – went berserk.I asked Chris how he wanted me to deliver my final line and he said: “Right down the lens.” I didn’t expect what happened: reflected back at me in the camera lens I saw not me, but my father. On that thought I laid the line: “That’ll do pig, that’ll do.” At the time I hadn’t forgiven my father, who was a director and very critical of my work, which stung. I didn’t know I had to forgive him. But at that moment, I looked at myself and saw I am my father’s son and I love him. Without a doubt, it brought closure.The only negative thing I ever heard about Babe was from a woman who said it ruined her relationship with her daughter. They used to enjoy Big Macs together and now her daughter wouldn’t eat animals. I thought: “If that’s what you based your relationship on, it sucks anyway!”Neal Scanlan, special effects artistWhat set Babe apart was that it featured realistic animals and not fantasy characters. The goal was to intercut puppets with real animals.To have a convincing animatronic Babe, we had to fit a prosthetic band around the puppet’s neck every day and punch in the hairs one at a time with a needle. We’d start early in the morning. We couldn’t afford more than one prosthetic head, so to go from a standing pig to a sitting pig, we had to take off the head, put it on to the new puppet body, and then punch in all the hairs again to make it a seamless blend. If anything went wrong, we had to start the entire process all over again. It was terrifying.Up until that point, we had always used foam latex for puppets. It’s wonderfully elastic but has no skin-like qualities. We had a chemist working with us who took on the challenge of making skin-like silicone for Babe. He added lots of oil and extra hardener. It set solid but remained flexible. When we’d lay it on paper, it would leach oil. It was a kind of mad chemistry. People who supply silicone skins to the industry use it to this day.View image in fullscreen‘Animatronic dogs were beyond what we were capable of – there’s just so much going on under that fur.’Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyBabe’s eyes were plastic spheres with a plunger inside that moved back and forth. They had a round silicone ball in front of them. We painted an iris on the ball and filled the spheres with clear silicone gel. By pushing the plunger, we could make the pupils bigger or smaller to create her big brown eyes.Ferdinand the duck was a combination of fur and feathers. We had tried using only feathers but we couldn’t lay them individually and make them move. When I watch the scenes with Ferdy and Babe in the shed, I struggle to know what’s animatronic and what is real.We shot in Australia and the heat was phenomenal. Silicone is a great insulator so it was like an oven inside animatronic Babe. After we rehearsed, we’d cover Babe in a foil blanket and keep our fingers crossed that nothing overheated.James Cromwell: ‘My father told me: “Don’t be an actor, you’re too damn tall”’Read moreCloseups of animatronic dogs were a degree beyond what we were capable of. The work everybody did was outstanding but there’s just so much going on under that fur. We failed – they’re impossible. In the end, all dog closeups were digitally enhanced.James had moments of holding Babe in his lap, and there was never a feeling of ridicule. He engaged with the puppets. It was remarkably rewarding to see him reach that level of interaction with something so dependent on your contribution. We did as much as was humanly possible. I’m very proud to have been involved with it.Explore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeFamily filmsGeorge MillerVeganismVegetarianismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It feels like he is trolling the UK …Mon 21 Jul 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareYou have to let politicians go on holiday, I guess. You have to accept the existence of world leaders with whose views you disagree, especially now that it’s almost all of them. So why does it feel like a particular provocation for JD Vance to be planning a trip to the Cotswolds? His itinerary isn’t yet known, but its bare bones are that, sometime in August, the Vanceswill visit London, Oxfordshire and Scotland.For a recap on what, exactly, is wrong with the US vice-president, there is nothing more evocative than February’spress conference with Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Of course, many of Vance’s more extreme views – calling Democratic politicians a “bunch of childless cat ladies with miserable lives”, claiming thatstaying in an abusive relationship was preferable to getting divorced, and saying that abortion should be banned – were alreadywell known, from a combination of his voting record and his memoir,Hillbilly Elegy. But Republicans say a lot of things, particularly while seeking election. You may have been able to infer Vance’s drive to dominate and control others, but it wasn’t until that exchange with the Ukrainian president that you could witness it.Legacy media struggled with the right language to describe that press conference: the BBCcalled itan “angry spat”,CNNgot a little bit closer to the mark when it said Zelenskyy “bristled” at his “berating”. To any normal human listening to it, unfettered by a muddled commitment to impartiality, it was bullying. Any description that fell short of picking a side, that did not say “Trump and Vance set out to humiliate Zelenskyy”, felt like a whitewash. Against a backdrop of implied financial control, Vance’s repeated demands – “You should be thanking the president”; “Have you even said ‘thank you’ once?” – were for public abasement, and it was strange, disgusting and sullying to witness.Two weeks before that, Vance had indulged in amass gaslighting event at the Munich conference, claiming that Christians were persecuted in the UK, private prayer at home could be banned in Scotland, the EU had overturned an election in Romania, and freedom of expression was at risk in Germany, Sweden, almost everywhere, in fact, since Europe had gone off the rails. It felt strange and unsettling to hear him use this language – humiliation, defiant untruth, his upside down world in which the victim is painted as the offender are components of coercive control. It is infinitely preferable to avert your eyes than to consider what this means for the rules-based international order.And it is much harder to look the other way when he is holidaying in Chipping Norton. Somehow, the London leg of his journey doesn’t feel so confronting; larger, more sprawling and anonymous, the capital is bound to contain some nefarious visitors at any given time, and those of us who live here can’t react to everything. In the Cotswolds, by contrast, nothing happens that isn’t immediately visible. Boris Johnson can’thave a pint in Charlburyor buy a stately home with athree-sided moat; David Cameron can’tborrow Jeremy Clarkson’s tractor and blow it up; the place is like a petri dish, every minute change in its makeup immediately registers. Yes, it is exceedingly pretty, but it has done nothing to invite high-profile, divisive politics to its doorstep.The Telegraph reportsthat activists plan to disrupt Vance’s trip, which is possible, but a logistical nightmare, given that public transport is rubbish across the Cotswolds. But really, Vance himself is the activist; it is a troll move to holiday in the most visible part of a country that you loudly claim has gone to the dogs. The rest of us are more re-activists.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJD VanceOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

But how do you teach inclusivity while fielding accusations of ‘wokery’?Mon 21 Jul 2025 09.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 09.34 EDTShareParents’ evening. Two words that many parents assume are a source of dread for teachers. But most will tell you this is a misconception. Why? Because the evening tends to offer a rare insight into the children we teach. It is, generally, a positive, purposeful discussion.There are, of course, the dreaded meetings with parents who are convinced you have it all wrong about their child. They will be at pains to point out that an incident with an exercise book, for example, was misunderstood. The book, they will argue, fell accidentally from X’s grip. This, despite the fact your own eyes observed it being unceremoniously flung across the classroom.Then there is another trying bunch who, in exasperation, ask if they should take their child’s iPad, PS5 or smartphone off them. To which the only answer can ever be that I, as their teacher, am in no place to say since I am not the parent. Meanwhile, their child sits mute, clearly desperate for the ground to open up and swallow them whole.Now, though, there is the possibility of a newer type of encounter. In this fraught exchange, a parent may ask a teacher to apply values of tolerance and inclusivity to views the teacher believes threatens those values. Given the way that the culture wars have a stranglehold on our politics, it is no surprise schools and teachers are seeing them cross the school gates into our classrooms.In a lesson on a Shakespearean text designed to discuss the issues of empire and colonialism at the heart of the play, a student may defend the benefits of empire. And a teacher, worried they could be labelled a member of the “woke mob” that the rightwing press claim is taking over our public institutions, may leave the view unchallenged.This fear for teachers is real. When staff at a Warwickshire secondary school sent home a12-year-old studentwho had come to a “culture day” clad in a sequined union flag dress, a la Geri Halliwell in her Spice Girls era, the school had to close for the summer holidays a day early following threats to staff from extremists. Like clockwork, the headlines from a particular branch of our tabloid press wrote themselves.The school was undoubtedly overzealous in its approach. The girl, whose presentation on British culture involved a segment on our love of the cuppa, should have been allowed to take part in the day’s events. Yet, while the union flag does not carry the same association with far-right nationalism as theSt George’s Cross, we can perhaps have sympathy for teachers who must have been trying to avoid the very ire and upset they found themselves surrounded by.Schools are told they must champion inclusivity, yet teachers’ politics must be left at the door. Nowhere is this balancing act harder to follow than in the immigration debate. Last week, a far-right mob outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Essex could be heard shouting that aseriously hurt security guardshould “go home … fuck off back on your boat and go”.In this febrile climate, it is not beyond the realms of possibility for a geography teacher in any part of the UK to find themselves dealing with the ripple effects. A lesson on migration may end with them fielding questions on whether or not there are “too many immigrants”.What happens when 16-year-olds get the vote? Other countries are already seeing the benefits | Christine HuebnerRead moreTheDepartment for Education saysa teacher must “take steps to ensure the balanced presentation of opposing views on political issues” whenever such claims arise. Yet the teacher must also protect their pupils from hate. If a comment is dismissed outright, the teacher could be accused of limiting freedom of expression and legitimate debate. If they let it stand, however, they are seen as normalising the type oflanguage that ledto preteens lobbing projectiles at police guarding hotels housing asylum seekers in Southport. As teachers with a legal duty to uphold the Prevent strategy, we are required to safeguard pupils from radicalisation and extremism. But what countsas radical or extremeis increasingly debated. Pupils and their parents may claim their “political speech” is being muted if we intervene.The tightrope is about to get thinner still with the government’s announcement that 16-year-olds will be granted theright to votein the next general election. Classroom discussions on election issues could well be interpreted as examples of voter influence. This is before we have tackled the shortage of specialist citizenship teachers. Or the need for, as Liz Moorse, the head of the Association of Citizenship Teaching, puts it, “clear contenton democracy, voting, rights and media literacy”.I am writing anonymously because the price of doing otherwise is high. After the union-flag debacle at the Warwickshire secondary school, staff received death threats. Students alreadyroutinely attemptto hack teachers’ social media accounts in a bid to publish their personal data, or worse, and our employment contracts warn against bringing schools into disrepute. It would be splitting hairs to argue whether the disrepute in question is outrage whipped up by the rightwing press.The stakes have never been higher for teachers. We have a duty to get these conversations right for the children we teach. But what was once clear is no longer so. We are expected to be moral without being political, inclusive yet not ideological. We should teach critical thinking, but not too much in case we fall into wokery. The classroom is in danger of becoming a minefield.The writer is a teacher in EnglandDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We weren’t tougher, faster or stronger – just smarter and better coordinated. In many cases, extinction was an accidental byproduct of some other goal we had. A true AGI would amount to creating anew species, which might quicklyoutsmartoroutnumberus. It could see humanity as a minor obstacle, like ananthillin the way of a planned hydroelectric dam, or aresource to exploit, like the billions of animals confined in factory farms.Altman, along with the heads of the other top AI labs, believes that AI-driven extinction is areal possibility(joining hundreds of leading AI researchers and prominent figures).Given all this, it’s natural to ask: should we really try to build a technology that may kill us all if it goes wrong?What's the appeal of AI? It will always reassure you | Zoe WilliamsRead morePerhaps the most common reply says: AGI is inevitable. It’s just too useful not to build. After all, AGI would be the ultimate technology – what a colleague of Alan Turingcalled“the last invention that man need ever make”. Besides, the reasoning goes within AI labs, if we don’t, someone else will do it – less responsibly, of course.A new ideology out of Silicon Valley,effective accelerationism(e/acc),claimsthat AGI’s inevitability is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics and that its engine is “technocapital”. The e/accmanifestoasserts: “This engine cannot be stopped. The ratchet of progress only ever turns in one direction. Going back is not an option.”ForAltmanand e/accs, technology takes on a mystical quality – the march of invention is treated as a fact of nature. But it’s not. Technology is the product of deliberate human choices, motivated by myriad powerful forces. We have the agency to shape those forces, and history shows that we’ve done it before.No technology is inevitable, not even something as tempting as AGI.Some AI worriers like topoint outthe timeshumanity resisted and restrained valuable technologies.Fearing novel risks, biologists initiallybannedand then successfullyregulatedexperiments on recombinant DNA in the 1970s.No human has been reproduced viacloning, even though it’s beentechnically possiblefor over a decade, and the only scientist to genetically engineer humans wasimprisonedfor his efforts.Nuclear powercan provideconsistent, carbon-free energy, but vivid fears of catastrophe havemotivatedstifling regulations andoutright bans.And if Altman weremore familiarwith the history of the Manhattan Project, he might realize that the creation of nuclear weapons in 1945was actuallya highly contingent and unlikely outcome,motivatedby a mistaken belief that the Germans were ahead in a “race” for the bomb. Philip Zelikow, the historian who led the 9/11 Commission,said: “I think had the United States not built an atomic bomb during the Second World War, it’s actually not clear to mewhenor possibly evenifan atomic bomb ever is built.”It’s now hard to imagine a world without nuclear weapons. But in a little-known episode, then president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachevnearly agreedto ditch all their bombs (a misunderstanding over the “Star Wars” satellite defense system dashed these hopes). Even though the dream of full disarmament remains just that, nuke counts areless than20% of their 1986 peak, thanks largely tointernational agreements.These choices weren’t made in a vacuum. Reagan was astaunch opponentof disarmament before themillions-strongNuclear Freeze movement got to him. In 1983, hecommentedto his secretary of state : “If things get hotter and hotter and arms control remains an issue, maybe I should go see [Soviet leader Yuri] Andropov and propose eliminating all nuclear weapons.”There are extremely strong economic incentives to keep burning fossil fuels, but climate advocacy haspried openthe Overton window and significantly accelerated our decarbonization efforts.In April 2019, the young climate groupExtinction Rebellion(XR)broughtLondon to a halt, demanding the UK target net-zero carbon emissions by 2025. Their controversial civil disobedience prompted parliament todeclarea climate emergency and the Labour party to adopt a 2030targetto decarbonize the UK’selectricity production.The Sierra Club’sBeyond Coalcampaign was lesser-known butwildly effective. In just its first five years, the campaign helped shutter more than one-third of US coal plants.Thanksprimarilyto its move from coal, US per capita carbon emissionsare nowlower than they were in 1913.In many ways, the challenge of regulating efforts to build AGI is much smaller than that of decarbonizing.Eighty-two percentof global energy production comes from fossil fuels. Energy is what makes civilization work, but we’re not dependent on a hypothetical AGI to make the world go round.Further, slowing and guiding the development of future systems doesn’t mean we’d need to stop using existing systems or developing specialist AIs to tackle important problems in medicine, climate and elsewhere.The trouble with AI art isn’t just lack of originality. It’s something far bigger | Eric ReinhartRead moreIt’s obvious why so many capitalists are AI enthusiasts: they foresee a technology that can achieve their long-time dream of cutting workers out of the loop (and the balance sheet).But governments are not profit maximizers. Sure, they care about economic growth, but they also care about things like employment, social stability, market concentration, and, occasionally, democracy.It’s far less clear how AGI would affect these domains overall. Governments aren’t prepared for a world where most people are technologically unemployed.Capitalists often get what they want, particularly in recent decades, and the boundless pursuit of profit may undermine any regulatory effort to slow the speed of AI development. But capitalists don’talwaysget what they want.At a bar in San Francisco in February, a longtimeOpenAIsafety researcher pronounced to a group that the e/accs shouldn’t be worried about the “extreme” AI safety people, because they’ll never have power. The boosters should actually be afraid of AOC and Senator Josh Hawley because they “can really fuck things up for you”.Assuming humans stick around for many millennia, there’s no way to know we won’t eventually build AGI. But this isn’t really what the inevitabilists are saying. Instead, the message tends to be: AGI is imminent. Resistance is futile.But whether we build AGI in five, 20 or 100 yearsreally matters. And the timeline is far more in our control than the boosters will admit. Deep down, I suspect many of them realize this, which is why they spend so much effort trying to convince others that there’s no point in trying. Besides, if you think AGI is inevitable, why bother convincing anybody?We actuallyhadthe computing power required to train GPT-2 more than a decade before OpenAI actually did it, but people didn’t know whether it was worth doing.But right now, the top AI labs are locked in such a fierce race that theyaren’t implementingall the precautions that even their own safety teams want. (One OpenAI employeeannouncedrecently that he quit “due to losing confidence that it would behave responsibly around the time of AGI”.) There’s a “safety tax” that labs can’t afford to pay if they hope to stay competitive; testingslowsproduct releases and consumes company resources.Governments, on the other hand, aren’t subject to the same financial pressures.An inevitabilist tech entrepreneur recentlysaidregulating AI development is impossible “unless you control every line of written code”. That might be true if anyone could spin up an AGI on their laptop. But it turns out that building advanced, general AI modelsrequiresenormous arrays of supercomputers, with chips produced by anabsurdly monopolisticindustry. Because of this, many AI safety advocates see “compute governance” as a promising approach. Governments could compel cloud computing providers to halt next generation training runs that don’t comply with establishedguardrails. Far from locking out upstarts or requiring Orwellian levels of surveillance, thresholds could be chosen to only affect players who can afford to spendmore than $100mon a single training run.Governments do have to worry about international competition and the risk of unilateral disarmament, so to speak. Butinternational treatiescan be negotiated to widely share the benefits from cutting-edge AI systems while ensuring that labs aren’t blindly scaling up systems theydon’t understand.And while the world may feel fractious, rival nations have cooperated to surprising degrees.For Silicon Valley, AI isn’t just about replacing some jobs. It’s about replacing all of them | Ed Newton-RexRead moreThe Montreal Protocolfixedthe ozone layer by banning chlorofluorocarbons. Most of the world has agreed to ethically motivated bans on militarily useful weapons, such asbiologicalandchemical weapons,blinding laser weapons, and “weather warfare”.In the 1960s and 70s, many analystsfearedthat every country that could build nukes, would. Butmostof the world’s roughly three-dozen nuclear programswere abandoned. This wasn’t the result of happenstance, but rather the creation of a global nonproliferation norm through deliberate statecraft, like the 1968Non-Proliferation Treaty.On the few occasions when Americans were asked if they wanted superhuman AI,largemajoritiessaid “no”. Opposition to AIhas grownas the technology has become more prevalent. When people argue that AGI is inevitable, what they’re really saying is that the popular will shouldn’t matter. The boosters see the masses as provincial neo-Luddites who don’t know what’s good for them. That’s why inevitability holds such rhetorical allure for them; it lets them avoid making their real argument, which they know is a loser in the court of public opinion.The draw of AGI is strong. But the risks involved are potentially civilization-ending. A civilization-scale effort is needed to compel the necessary powers to resist it.Technology happens because people make it happen. We can choose otherwise.Garrison Lovely is a freelance journalist"

Its leadership has been up against some serious corporate miscreants and boardroom financial engineers over the years, butabolitionis the right decision. The original sin – overseen by New Labour – was to allowthe leveraged takeover boom of the mid-2000s, which was the point at which regulatory control over the sector started to be lost. The past decade has been about trying to undo the damage, which has only exposed yawning gaps in regulatory knowledge, such asthe storm overflow scandal that broke in 2021. A “reset” moment is overdue by about 20 years.Sir Jon Cunliffe’s review goes to the heart of one main problem: the fragmented, overlapping and inflexible nature of a regulatory system that takes in not just Ofwat and the Environment Agency (a regulator that lost its way as severely) but also the Drinking Water Inspectorate, Natural England and Natural Resources Wales. That structure is simply confused. A super-regulator in England (and equivalent in Wales) should, the theory goes, solve the problem of duplication and lack of coordination. Simpler is better.One line of criticism says the government is merely rearranging the deckchairs. Not necessarily. The bite in Cunliffe’s recommendations, if they are to succeed, will be the switch to a “supervisory” model. The description is bland but, if done correctly, it could make a difference, as it has in financial services, from where Cunliffe, one of the clean-up officials at the Bank of England after the great crash, has drawn his analysis. The Prudential Regulation Authority is capable of striking fear in bank boardrooms.Abolishing Ofwat is fine but not enough: teach water bosses that failure has consequences  | Gaby HinsliffRead moreFor water, it will require the regulator to know a company’s operations in detail at a basic engineering level, and thus be equipped to know when excessive returns are being made or when, genuinely, the company hasn’t been given the financial resources to do the job. It is, for example, amazing that Ofwat’s board does not include anyone with the job title “chief engineer”. (The new regulator should have one, says Cunliffe.) And it is even more astonishing, 36 years after privatisation, that nobody seems to have a clear idea of the real state of companies’ assets. (Fix that too, says the report.)Add it up and there is a framework for a more commonsense approach than the current cycle of reviews and exchanges of documents running to thousands of pages. “Ofwat has relied too heavily on a data-driven, econometric approach, and has not taken sufficient account of company-specific conditions and challenges,” says Cunliffe’s commission. It is hard to disagree.In the end, it is not possible to run a privatised system without strong regulators who form their own judgments. New powers, under Cunliffe’s advice, would allow regulators to block certain owners and to apply a financial-style suitability test for senior executives. Both sound like improvements if backed by “public benefit clauses” in water company licences that would allow the regulator to interfere more aggressively.Given the sector’s history of financial engineering, Cunliffe could have gone further and suggested caps on debt levels. Instead, he opted for new regulatory powers to set minimum capital levels. That is weaker, but at least we may see an end to the nonsense of Ofwat announcing a leverage ratio for its “notional” company (55% of assets currently) and then being ignored.In other respects, the report will read as investor-friendly: “company-specific” supervision and the possibility of “regulatory forbearance” in turnaround situations will be music to the ears of the sector laggards. If the latter is to achieve public consent, the other side of that coin will have to be tougher day-to-day enforcement of environmental laws, which comes down to the government’s willingness to fund boots on the ground. That part is the gift of ministers.Indeed, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, should take note of what this report demands of government – a “step change” in strategic approach, including setting medium- and long-term priorities and an acknowledgment of trade-offs. Step one, one can suggest, would be for Reed to stop claiming the government has “secured £104bn of private sector investment” when everybody knows the vast bulk of the sum comes from customers’ bills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On that score, the government’s resistance is justified. Nationalisation would take years, would be challenged in court if attempted at less than market value, and offers no guarantee of success if the HS2 debacle is a guide to departmental talents in building critical infrastructure. Cunliffe’s vision of a “low-risk, low-return” sector for investors is a better pragmatic bet if the goal is to clean up lakes and rivers as quickly as possible and actually build some reservoirs. Low-risk cannot mean risk-free: it must still be possible for the owners of outright corporate flops to lose their shirts, as the mugs who bought Thames Water from Macquarie will.Everything will depend on execution, of course. In the meantime, the Thames crisis rumbles on andspecial administration remains a highly possible outcome for that disaster, not least because Cunliffe’s review should remove the “contagion” risk for the wider sector. For now, the forward-looking aspect of his review is the thing to focus on. A tally of 88 recommendations illustrates how much has gone wrong. But the core advice to create a single, stronger regulator – one that can throw its weight around on the basis of up-to-date information – should be unarguable.Explore more on these topicsWater industryNils Pratley on financeRegulatorsJon CunliffecommentShareReuse this content"

A hated, toxic chemicalAlexander HurstA student-led petition against a bill that would reintroduce a banned insecticide is spreading like wildfire. Will the government listen?Mon 21 Jul 2025 09.59 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 12.24 EDTShareAmillion petition signatures in 10 days? That should tell a government something: that a huge number of citizens aren’t happy with what it has just done, but also that they still believe in their democracy and its ability to course-correct.In response to pressure from farmers’ unions and the agricultural lobby, on 8 July, the French legislaturepassed a bill named theloi Duplomb, which contained numerous measures to boost large-scale industrial agriculture – among them, the reauthorisation of a previously banned insecticide, acetamiprid. Beet farmers in particular say they have no alternative to fighting pests. However, there is a growing scientific consensus around acetamiprid (enough, it should be pointed out, for use of the substance to have been banned in France since 2018): it is linked tohighly negative effectson bee populations, and, according to the European Food Safety Authority, may adversely impactlearning and memoryin humans. Studiesalso showthat the whole class of chemicals to which acetamiprid belongs, neonicotinoids, could cause birth defects and reduce male fertility.When the law passed, the cancer survivor and activist Fleur Breteau couldn’t contain herself. “You’re on the side of cancer and we’ll make sure everyone knows it!”she yelledat the legislature from a balcony. Well, the word is certainly out. By Sunday evening,a petitionposted by a 23-year-old student calling for the government to reconsider the contentious law had crossed the 1m signature mark and shows no sign of slowing down. At the time of writing it’s at 1.3m – well beyond the 500,000 signatures that enables parliament to bring the petition to debate, and by farthe most signaturessince the introduction of the official petition site in 2019.There are large, macro reasons why the loi Duplomb should never have been passed. At a time when Europe could be vauntingthe superiorityof its agriculture and accelerating a transition towards sustainable, regenerative farming, the law is, generally speaking, an enormous step in the wrong direction. It’s not that farmers don’t need assistance, it’s that they need assistance in transitioning toregenerative agriculture. That means a series of practices (less tilling, reduced use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, cover crops, and rotational grazing and natural fertilisers) that can increase biodiversity and restore soil health, and in turn help soils to retain more water and become carbon sinks. According to Rattan Lal, the director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, regenerative agriculture globally could enable soils to draw downbetween 1bn and 3bn tonnesof carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. In other words, changing the way we farm could negate up to 8% ofannual emissions globally(almost three times the impact of eliminating aviation altogether).Then there is the specific cause of the backlash against the loi Duplomb: acetamiprid. I find it curious which issues seem to catch alight, and it’s not surprising that food and health would be prime terrain for that to happen. Both are tangible in an everyday sort of way, rather than having the problem of being almost too big to wrap one’s head around. Perhaps our brains are simply more able to deal with the threat posed by introducing a dangerous chemical into the food system, than with systemic threats and cascading impacts through the climate and ecosystems. And that’s what is instructive about the reaction to the loi Duplomb, and what it means outsideFrance.It’s no secret that faith in democracy has been tumbling almost everywhere. But Francehas experienceda particularly acute decline, with French voters expressingfar more disaffectionthan their neighbours in Germany and Italy. In the midst of that, the research institute Destin Commun proposes that the environment may actually bea unifying issuefor French voters – a generational, civilisational type of project that can provide a sense of national purpose. In itsmost recent report, Destin Commun found that 87% of the French are concerned about the climate crisis and environmental degradation, and French voters rank the environment as a more important political issue than they do insecurity, retirements, immigration or inequality.The French government has an opportunity here. Not just to do the right thing, but to show voters that democracy works, that activism produces results, that the youngest voices can be among the loudest.

That is an impossible taskMon 21 Jul 2025 19.07 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 21.52 EDTShareBy now we’ve all seen the video: acouple locked in an intimate embrace at a Coldplay concert. Within milliseconds, the woman turns her face and the man ducks. The crowd gasps. Chris Martin quips: “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy.”Within 24 hours, the internet had done what it does best: turned sleuth. The names of the pair were quickly revealed. LinkedIns found. Both were senior executives at a New York data firm, he, the CEO; she, the head of HR. Both married. With children.The story unfolded like a soap opera. The CEO’s wife’s Facebook was discovered.Internetwatchdogs noticed she’d removed her last name. The internet was furious and equally entertained.Are they ‘having an affair’ or just shy? The couple caught on Coldplay’s kiss camRead moreThousands of memes circulated. Parodies flooded TikTok. Calls to fire them rivalled calls for humanitarian justice and in the most corporate plot twist of all, it spilled over to LinkedIn. Beneath the HR manager’s last post, commenters asked if cheating was in the job description.This was a media storm. But more than that, it was a public trial.We live in a digital panopticon. Surveillance isn’t top-down any more, it’s lateral. It’s ambient and crowdsourced. It can come from your neighbour. A passerby. A stranger on their phone.Think of the people unknowingly caught in the background of an OOTD video. A “what are you listening to?” vox pop could inadvertently feature a woman on the run from an abusive partner. In a world obsessed with consent, there seems to be a blind spot when it comes toonlineconsent.There’s an entire genre on TikTok dedicated to background reactions. Someone in the corner makes a face, maybe startled by a flash, maybe just not wanting to be filmed and the internet crowns them a hater or a bully. Then, their account is found. Their employer tagged. Calls for termination follow.When did virality replace due process?Public shaming is now a participatory sport. Viral justice is gamified. We chase information like it’s loot in a moral scavenger hunt for names, jobs, partners, homes. Every new fact unlocked is rewarded in likes and retweets.What starts as accountability often becomes performance. What begins as critique becomes content.Yes, if the Coldplay couple were having an affair, it may be amoral. It might shed light on power dynamics in the workplace. But was the doxing, the intense, invasive publishing of private details a proportionate response?Don’t get me wrong, doxing has done good. During the January 6 Capitol riots, internet sleuths helped identify rioters, some of whom were later arrested. It showed that the people, armed with nothing but wifi and rage, could hold power to account.But doxing is neutral and the internet is agnostic to moral weight. It rewards theperformanceof outrage, not the ethics behind it.Sometimes, people get doxed over something as small as complaining about a coffee order or a haircut. We don’t pause to ask:What kind of day were they having?What if they were grieving? Overwhelmed? Underpaid? In the rush to moralise a moment, we strip away all context. There’s no room for nuance.Sometimes, innocent people get caught in the crossfire, punished not for who they are, but for a single frame of a much bigger picture.The collateral damage of instant moralism is real.Do we really want kids harassed at school because their parent made a mistake? Or someone’s house posted online because they turned away a guest and theirantipasto salad?What about the CEO’s wife, who woke up one day and watched the entire internet dissect her life, her job, her marriage?Once something is online, it metastasises far beyond the original wrongdoing. It’s not just about justice any more. It’s about content spreadability.Today’s reality is knowing your face might be the next meme. Your breakdown, someone’s new Twitter DP.The just world hypothesis suggests we like to believe people get what they deserve. It comforts us. But “deserving” is a slippery logic. It changes depending on the narrative, the context, the mood or even the meme template.Honestly? I was entertained by the Coldplay spectacle. He’s a CEO, and I’m a card-carrying member of the “eat the rich” school of thought. But even that is a slippery slope.We’re collectively trying to decide through digital telepathy, what makes it OK to ruin someone’s life. That is an impossible task. It’s endlessly malleable. Infinitely debatable.What do we lose when we treat every viral moment like a courtroom?What do we gain from piling on, without considering the proportion of the punishment?Yes, celebrities have chosen to live in the public eye. They have PR teams. They have crisis managers. Sometimes, they have Oprah and a tell-all interview.But the Coldplay couple? They don’t have a publicist and even if they did, they owe the public nothing. If something did happen, the only people who deserve an explanation are their families, whose lives have been permanently altered by two people’s choices.Well… maybe also the HR manager at their workplace.Oh, wait.

Polling last year showed ahigher level of supportfor publicly owned water companies than railways. Yet while train companies are beingrenationalisedas contracts expire, ministers ruled out a reversal of 1989’s water privatisation before they commissioned Sir Jon Cunliffe, a former central banker, to report on how they could improve this failing industry through tougher regulation.This newspaperregretsthat the question of ownership was taken off the table. Water is among the most precious of all natural resources and the pro‑market logic for the sell-off was bogus. In the absence of competition, regional monopolies were created and, in the decades since, businesses have enriched themselves while failing to fulfil their responsibilities. No other European government has followed suit in offloading vital infrastructure including pipes and reservoirs, and enabling investors to extract wealth by loading up balance sheets with debt.AskingSir Jon’s commissionto reconsider public ownership, alongside regulatory reform, would have offered more options. Growing pressure on the water supply, and increasing instability of hydrological cycles due to global heating, mean proper stewardship centred on human needs is more essential now than ever. It remains likely thatThames Waterwill end up in special administration due to its vast debt – despite this scenario having been left out of the commission’s scope. The Common Wealth thinktank has proposed this as a stepping stone tolong-term public control.Within the terms offered, Sir Jon has done athorough piece of work. If they are accepted by ministers and work in the way he intends – and these are big ifs – his 88 recommendations ought to bring a shocking period of mismanagement to an end. But they probably won’t prevent another from beginning. Not all of England and Wales’s 11 regional water companies have the disgraceful records ofThames and Southern. The approach to pollution of these two businesses, combined with their aggressive financing structures, have undermined public confidence more deeply than all the rest. But tougher regulation is clearly overdue.The supervisory approach proposed, modelled on financial regulation, would be a significant improvement provided that the right people, including engineers, are put in charge. Rather than conduct statistical tick-box exercises, this new regulator should aim for an overview. Bringing under one new roof thevarious regulatory functions– including those carried out in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and by the little-known Drinking Water Inspectorate, as well as Ofwat – makes obvious sense.The rollout of smart meters is also a good proposal, provided that a social tariff is created for low-income households. An ombudsman ought to make it easier to seek redress when local services fail. It is right to highlight the need for a longer-term approach to water policy too. It remains to be seen which of these ideas will be taken forward. Businesses in multiple sectors are experts at running rings around regulators. Making water companiesvalue the public interestmore highly, relative to private profit, will be an ongoing struggle. Without structural reform, the cycle of regulatory failure and corporate evasion remains all too likely.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They deserve a say in shaping the society they’re growing intoMon 21 Jul 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareElections are imperfect reflections of public sentiment. But they are the least worst means to distribute political power. Each vote does count, however unsatisfactorily, under Westminster’s electoral system – except when people are denied one. For too long, those missing out have included16- and 17-year‑olds. These teenagers are old enough to work, pay tax, join thearmyand makemedical decisions. Yet they are judged too young to help decide who governs them.The governmentproposesto resolve that anomaly. The decision to lower the voting age by the 2029 general election marks the largest extension of the franchise in more than50 years. It is a long-overdue reform that brings England and Northern Ireland into line with Scotland and Wales. In democracies, those affected deserve a say. Opponentsclaimteenagers are too immature to vote. Political insight isn’t bestowed by a birthday. Foolishness and wisdom are spread across age groups. Younger people vote less reliably – but many adults also don’t bother. Apathy is no bar to suffrage.Britain’s youth are already political – onsocial mediaand in thestreets. What they’ve lacked is formal power. Little wonder that many feel alienated. Policies have too often favoured older voters – with higher turnout rates – while the concerns of younger generations, from climate breakdown tohousing insecurity, go unheeded. A system skewed so sharply by age erodes its legitimacy. Sixteen-year‑olds in Scotland madehistoryby voting in the 2014 independence referendum. They now cast ballots underproportional representationin Scottish and Welsh elections. Their participation isserious, their presence uncontroversial. Yet some teenagers who voted in 2014 couldn’t vote again in the 2015 general election or in the 2016 Brexit referendum.A growing list of countries – includingAustria, Brazil and Argentina– allow 16-year‑olds to vote in national elections. There is someevidencethat voting becomes a habit when it starts in school. Such a reform belongs in a broader rethink of how our democracy works. Improving political education in schools is a must in the UK’s constituent parts. Lowering the voting age from 18 without addressing the digital information ecosystem would be an incomplete measure. If we entrust 16- and 17-year-olds with a vote, we must also ensure that they’re not the most vulnerable to manipulation,misinformationor disengagement. Ministers have so far fallen short of this challenge.The pollster Sir John Curtice thinks new voters will add onlyabout 3%to the electorate. Half of teenagers surveyed say they might not vote. But that doesn’t invalidate the principle. Expanding the franchise isn’t about party advantage – whatever some in Labour think – but about fairness. The leftwing party led byJeremy Corbynand Zarah Sultana, theGreensand Reform UK could all benefit. Political outcomes may surprise.Young people deserve a say in the future that will shape their opportunities. To turn that right into engagement, parties need policies that speak to their concerns. Lowering the voting age will not by itself revive trust in democracy. If young people are not made to feel genuinely included in political life, it may have limited impact. But at a time ofrecord‑low turnout, it is a signal that politics still belongs to the people. Including the young is not a gamble, it’s a commitment to the future.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.“Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future.

He will get his first chance to play alongside his new teammates as they embark on a tour of the US in the coming days.“Bryan’s goals and assists record in the Premier League is exceptional, his remarkable consistency has put him among the most productive players in England for the last three seasons,” United director of football, Jason Wilcox, said. “Bryan’s belief in our project and determination to join the club confirmed that he was the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture that we are developing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That time came to an end midway through their last game – just days after their coach, Brendon McCullum, told them they could be a bit meaner – when they seized on “a great opportunity to go hard at them” and “tried to create a bit of niggle”.Brook said that during the break between the conclusion of that game and the team’s reunion in Manchester for the penultimate match of the series, which starts on Wednesday, he had received “loads of compliments” about the drama created by the outbreak of hostility at Lord’s. “Everyone said it was awesome to watch,” Brook said. “It was good fun, I have to admit. It made fielding a lot more enjoyable.”Liam Dawson’s selection an about-face from England and a reward for county formRead moreZak Crawley’s timewastingat the end of the third day infuriated India, which in turn pushed the rest of the England side into action. “Everybody saw them guys get stuck into Creeps [Crawley] and Ducky [Ben Duckett],” Brook said. “We just thought: ‘We’re not having that.’ So we all piled into them. A few days before Baz said sometimes we are a bit too nice. [So] we had a conversation and said: ‘It’s time to not be those nice guys that we have been before.’“You don’t always have to be nice. We tried to create a bit of niggle. We weren’t being personal, we weren’t being nasty, we were just putting them under more pressure. We were doing it within the spirit of the game. We weren’t out there effing and ­jeffing at them and being nasty people. We were going about it in the right manner.”India’s Mohammed Siraj, who was fined 15% of his match fee for his aggressive reaction to the dismissal of Duckett on the morning of day four, said he plans to continue along similar lines this week.Quick GuideEngland name team for fourth TestShowEngland have announced their team for this week’s fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, with Liam Dawson’s return to the side after an eight-year absence, replacing the injured Shoaib Bashir, the only change to the side that took a 2-1 lead in the series by winning the third game at Lord’s.Bashir sustained a multiple break of the little finger on his left hand while fielding at Lord’s, and though he returned to bat in England’s second innings and to bowl on the final day – taking the decisive wicket of Mohammed Siraj to end the game – the injury required surgery and he has been ruled out of the remainder of the series.“We’re going to miss Bash. He’s bowled exceptionally well and as we saw last week, he’s got tremendous fight,” said Harry Brook. “The way he came back out with a broken finger – he did an amazing bit of fielding on the boundary just before he got that last wicket. Just to come back out and get that wicket with a broken finger in two or three places showed an exceptional character.”Dawson, a left-armer 14 years Bashir’s senior, has a first class batting average of 35.29, compared with Bashir’s 8.27. He will bat at No 8, pushing Chris Woakes down to nine – where he has batted only twice in the last five years and averaged 58.94 in 18 Test innings.“He’s a wily old fox, very experienced and very skilful,” Brook said of Dawson. “He’s played everywhere, played against everyone so hopefully he can have an amazing performance. Hopefully he can land it in the footholes and create a bit of spice and some opportunities to take wickets. He’s adding to our strength in batting as well.”Simon BurntonEngland team to play India at Old Trafford: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Liam Dawson, Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“When you’re in the moment and a batsman is playing well, sometimes you say something to get into his head,” he said. “I think players need sledging sometimes. It can disrupt a batter’s concentration. As a fast bowler, it’s fun when those mind games happen.”With doubts over the availability of another seamer, Akash Deep, owing to a groin injury, India are expected to field Jasprit Bumrah at Old ­Trafford rather than hold him back for next week’s final Test at the Oval with the 31-year-old reportedly only able to play three of the five Tests in the series.After the Lord’s Test, England were punished for their slow over rates, and though Brook said the subject had not been discussed by the team he admitted improvements could be made. “I think there were 75 overs in a day last week, which is pretty poor,” he said. “You’re losing 15 overs a day – you can bowl a side out in 15 overs. I think that was both teams, if I’m being honest. We can be quicker, they can definitely be quicker at stages. In my opinion, when they’re batting it affects us a lot because they’re always changing their gloves or getting treatment or whatever. There’s got to be something happen there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday, the survivors of one of the craziest, fastest Tours ever, a race with even less respite than usual, will do as their predecessors have done every few years since 1951: they will crest a rise in the road, and see Mont Ventoux on the horizon. A sinking in the heart will accompany the dull ache in the legs: we’re off to the Bald Mountain once again.The men of the Tour probably won’t be thankful for small mercies, but they should be. Last time the Tour visited, in 2021, although the background scenario was the same –Tadej Pogacar had smashed the race to bitson the first serious climb and was set fair for victory – the organisers cruelly made them go over the 1,910m summit twice, in two different ways. Wout van Aert might recall that with a wry smile: theBelgian was in his prime back then and he won out of a breakaway.Open victor Scheffler is latest sporting star to explore space beyond wins and losses | Cath BishopRead moreThe time before that, in 2016, the chaos on the mountain was such that the man who was Pogifying the race that year, Chris Froome,ran part of the way to the finish, which had been moved off the summit due to high winds. Froome might recall that utterly freakish episode with a wry smile from his home in Monaco, but it will be tinged with regret that at 40 he probably won’t be racing up the Giant of Provence again.Tempora mutantur, but not the Ventoux. That, partly, reflects one of the key features of the Tour; the way it constantly revisits and rewrites its past in places that have barely changed since the first visit. Go round the partly banked corner at Saint-Estève and on to the virtually straight haul through the oak-wooded lower slopes, and it’s essentially the same brutal experience that the stars of the 50s, 60s and 70s might have undergone, perhaps with better tarmac as you go up with barely a hairpin to break the gradient until the final haul across the scree slopes to the top.The Ventoux is a place where stuff happens on the Tour, very little of it good, beginning with Jean Malléjac’s near-death in 1955 and continuing withTom Simpson’s dramatic demise in 1967. That event, which I investigated in my 2002 biography of Simpson,Put Me Back on My Bike, remains the mountain’s defining moment, lending a note of pilgrimage to every ascent to the desolate waste of wind- and frost-blasted limestone scree on its pointed summit. The generation that raced with Simpson has largely passed on –the death in April of Barry Hobanbeing a case in point – but the poignancy of his death and the tales around it lose nothing in the telling.View image in fullscreenChris Froome runs with his bike after he crashed during the ride up Mont Ventoux in 2016, one of the most bizarre incidents in Tour de France history.Photograph: Bernard Papon/APEqually memorable, if with a touch of farce, wasthe Froome fiasco in 2016. Froome slipping and sliding in his stiff-soled carbon shoes and clicking pedal cleats with a huge crowd baying at him was probably the most outlandish event I witnessed in 27 Tours, and the feeling then was that this kind of thing could happen only in one of three places, all equally extreme: the Ventoux, l’Alpe d’Huez, and the rarely visited extinct volcano of Le Puy de Dôme in the Massif Central.After all, it wasn’t that long since, in 2000, most of the race infrastructure had had to be left behind due to dangerous, but not freak, high winds, meaning that whenMarco Pantani wonahead of Lance Armstrong, the finish felt like a return to the 1970s. Given the extreme physical challenge and the sumptuous television images it provides, it’s not surprising that the mountain now hosts the Tour far more often than of old, pretty much matching l’Alpe d’Huez for frequency whereas in the 80s and 90s, one visit per decade was deemed enough.The one major change in recent years concerns not the mountain itself but the area around it. Recently, the newspaper l’Equipe documented how cycling up the Ventoux is now front and centre of the local economy, with more than 90,000 cyclists each year pedalling up its slopes by the most traditional route, the southerly road from Bédoin which opens earlier in the year than the northerly route from Malaucène. On the last two visits I made to the mountain, I’d have expected the slopes to be busy when I rode up one June, but less so on a bitter October day when light snow was falling at the observatory.Cycle cafes, cycle hire businesses and major players in the cycle industry cater for the two-wheeled hordes, far beyond the traditional stop-off point at Chalet Reynard, where the thermometer was reputed to have broken on the boiling day Simpson died. There are three dedicated photographers who make a living from selling photographs to those who ride up each day, turning over €130,000 annually in one case, not to mention the local businesses that feed and accommodate the cyclists plus major mass participation events such as sportives and gran fondos; the strangest, perhaps, being the “brotherhood of the Ventoux nutters”, membership of which goes to those who have ridden up the Ventoux three times in a single day using each of the three different ways to the summit. Given the Tour’s constant pursuit of new and televisually interesting challenges, it’s probably only a matter of time until the race follows suit.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025CyclingTour de FrancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

To wonder what the point of it is, sandwiched between the first two Tests. That the Lions have shipped in five players specifically to keep their frontline stars wrapped in cotton wool suggests it is little more than an inconvenience to the touring side. Then you listen to Jamie George explain what it means to him to represent the Lions again and it immediately changes your perception. Bin juice has never tasted so good.It took George 47 hours to make the journey from San Juan, not far from the Andes in Argentina, where he was preparing to represent England against the Pumas, to Brisbane to join the Lions before the first Test. Devastated at missing out on the initial squad, George jumped at the chance to come in as cover for Luke Cowan-Dickie, who is still recovering from concussion.Owen Farrell opens door to England return after sidestepping social media ‘poison’Read moreA flight to Buenos Aires was followed by another to Rio de Janeiro, another to Dubai and then on to Brisbane. “I gave the world a good lap,” he says, explaining that the television gangster series MobLand and “some pretty horrific movies” including the Kevin Costner golf classic Tin Cup kept him busy while sticking to a strict sleep regime prescribed by the Lions.George, Jamie Osborne – cover for Garry Ringrose – as well as Thomas Clarkson, Darcy Graham, Ewan Ashman, Gregor Brown and Rory Sutherland all make the squad for the fixture on Tuesday, along with Blair Kinghorn who returns after a knee injury.Andy Farrell, the head coach, insists he is keeping an open mind when it comes to selection for the second Test but in reality only Kinghorn and Ringrose, who is on the bench, have a realistic shot at making the XV. Owen Farrell is captain and he could make the 23, as could George. On the whole, however, those selected are the dirt-trackers, the bin juice or the midweek massive.View image in fullscreenJamie George (centre) with Finn Baxter and Joe Heyes pose in the changing rooms after England’s win over Argentina in La Plata this month.Photograph: Marcelo Endelli/Getty ImagesFor his part, George is determined to make the most of his second chance on his third Lions tour. A cancelled flight delayed the arrival of his father, Ian, whose presence in Melbourne gives the fixture extra meaning to George. He lost his mother, Jane, to cancer last year and George cites having his parents on the 2017 tour of New Zealand as one of his happiest memories.“My old man is on the way,” George said. “Obviously it’s sad that my mum is not going to be able to be here but being able to do stuff like this for people like my old man, giving him the opportunity to travel around Australia, to watch his son play for the Lions. That’s the special bit about what I do and it’s my biggest motivation about why I do what I do.“It’s emotional to be back out there because I never thought this opportunity was going to come, however many weeks ago the squad was announced and I was heartbroken and now I’ve got the opportunity to pull the jersey on again and it might be the last time, it might not be. But I’ll try to put my best foot forward and play like it’s the last time and when I do it like that I want to make people proud, I want to do the jersey proud and do everything I possibly can to win in a Lions jersey because I think international selection is one thing but winning as a Lion is different so that’s what I’m here to do.“It’s absolutely about gathering momentum for the boys in the Test team and giving them confidence in terms of what they see from us. Of course it’s an amazing opportunity to put your name forward for Test selection. That’s the way that people have got to see it.”View image in fullscreenJamie George on the charge against Sharks in a Lions tour match in South Africa in 2021.Photograph: Themba Hadebe/APGeorge is a huge cricket fan and so the significance of the Lions playing the second Test at the MCG is not lost on him. The 34-year-old hooker says attending a Boxing Day Test is a “bucket list” occasion and he did not rule out leading a “sprinkler” celebration, as Graeme Swann did when England retained the Ashes in the 2010‑11 contest in Melbourne.“What a great shout that is,” he said. “I see myself as a sort of Graeme Swann figure. Similar characters, both talented blokes. It could happen, yeah, who knows. Bucket list stuff for me is watching the Boxing Day Test there. I’d be getting stuck in once I’ve retired. In the Barmy Army, 100%, I’d be in the mix, shirt off, I’d have anywhere between 15 and 20 pints.

I thought the atmosphere was good at the weekend but from experience it just goes like that [upwards] in the second and third Tests.”Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025British & Irish LionsAustralia rugby union teamAustralia sportRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here are six areas in which the players and Sarina Wiegman must do better.Italy’s icon Cristiana Girelli takes Le Azzurre to verge of Euro 2025 historyRead moreBe more selective with long ballsThe England defenders Leah Williamson and Alex Greenwood have played more passes into the final third than any other players from the 16 teams who have contested this tournament, but fewer than half of Greenwood’s 26 long passes against Sweden were completed successfully. Both players are usually far more accurate when it comes to pass completion, as two of the best ball-playing centre-backs around.Against Sweden, though, England did not seem to be picking the right moments to go long. There is clearly a case for some direct balls, exemplified by the perfect execution ofHannah Hampton’s defence-splitting pass against the Netherlands, but on Thursday England seemed too keen to go long more often than usual, and only one of Lucy Bronze’s seven long passes found its target.Italy rank joint-11th for average possession at this tournament, whereas England’s 58% share puts them second only to Spain, so on Tuesday viewers can expect England to control most of the play. But they must pick and choose their moments to play the ball over the top. If Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway and Ella Toone can control the midfield, England can thrive.Make substitutions earlierWiegman did not make a change until the 70th minute in the quarter-final, despite England trailing 2-0, and although her triple change worked like a charm and all six of England’s eventual substitutes played important roles, there is a strong case to be made that the alterations came too late. Given the marked improvements England made after changing their tactical shape, could Wiegman have rolled the dice a little earlier and perhaps even won the tie in normal time?View image in fullscreenGeorgia Stanway, in training with England in Zurich, needs to be shooting more given her ability from long range.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWiegman has tended not to make changes before the hour but with the tight turnaround between fixtures in this relatively short tournament, players will be tiring and introducing fresher legs earlier in the second half could be vital for England, particularly in light of their strength in depth.Utilise the space being found by BronzeBronze was pushing up high from right-back against Sweden and was regularly asking for the ball in acres of space, unmarked, but the Lionesses were often either too slow to spot her run or unable to switch the ball with the diagonal pass required. Against Wales, England found success down the right repeatedly, either with Bronze linking with the winger Lauren James or with those players combining with the runs of Toone, and that trio will need to combine more effectively again to get in behind Italy’s defence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They can ill afford a repeat. The Lionesses made three errors that led directly to shots on goal and that will be three too many if repeated against a team with aclinical striker such as Cristiana Girelli, who has scored 61 senior international goals.A lot of the post-match attention focused on Jess Carter’s performance but she was not the only player to misplace a few easy-looking balls; Williamson’s completion rate for her short passes dropped to 79%, having been 100% against the Netherlands. Carter completed all 10 of her short passes against the Netherlands, in a game when England’s backline were in great form with their distribution. Bronze’s completion rate for short passes dropped to 61% from 33 attempts against Sweden, demonstrating how sloppy the Lionesses were in possession.Make more of set piecesEngland are yet to look threatening from attacking set pieces. That could be partly down to the quality of the deliveries but will also be related to the absence of some of the taller and aerially strong players who were at the last World Cup and Euros, such as Millie Bright or Rachel Daly. The centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy, arguably the strongest attacking weapon at corners in England’s squad, is unlikely to feature against Italy, but Wiegman and her staff will surely have been working on set pieces over the weekend.Shoot more frequentlyThe Lionesses also need to shoot more often. Against Sweden they recorded only four shots on target and the figure was two against France in their opening fixture. Stanway, one of England’s strongest ball-strikers, who scored a superb goal with a first-time effort against the Netherlands, had one shot on Thursday and England will want to create more in-play situations where they can tee up the Bayern Munich midfielder to shoot from the edge of the box.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That was how close a weary Italy were to extra time against Norway in atense quarter-final in Geneva. It was clear from the frayed nerves and unusually dishevelled appearance of the coaching staff on Italy’s bench that they were concerned those on the field did not have much left in the tank. All their stamina and emotions had been left on the pitch after almost 90 energy‑sapping minutes of a game they knew they should be winning.What they seemed to forget for a minute, however, was that they have Cristiana Girelli. Their talismanic centre-forward can do many things on a football pitch but nothing is more certain than her scoring goals. They needed just one chance, one delivery and the odds were on that their captain would take it.Euro 2025 power rankings: Spain still the team to beat but England in huntRead moreThat moment came: a pinpoint Sofia Cantore cross, an intelligent run by Girelli to lose the full-back, and an angled header that had one destination.It was a goal emblematic of Girelli’s career, which has spanned the best part of two decades, and sent Italy into a European Championship semi-final for the first time since 1997. With 122 caps and 61 goals across 12 years, Girelli has been at the forefront ofLe Azzurre’s past six major tournament appearances and is widely considered among her peers and fans as one of the best to pull on the shirt.Girelli has played her entire career in Italy, bridging the gap from amateur to full-time, with Serie A Femminile going fully professional in 2022. She has spent seven seasons with Juventus and finished the last campaign as the league’s top scorer with 19 goals that propelledLe Bianconereto their first title in three years.Quick GuideEngland v Italy: past three meetingsShowItaly 1-5 England, 27 Feb 2024, AlgecirasThe Lionesses started preparations for the Euro 2025 qualifiers perfectly, with a dominant win over Italy in south-west Spain.

Although her movement in the area, aerial ability and instinctive finishing are second to none, she is more than a penalty box poacher. She loves to drop deeper and help to build from the pocket, is potent from free-kicks and, as shown in theGroup C draw with Portugal, has the ability to score from distance.In the quarter-final, she not only scored twice but made six recoveries and led the way for Italy in terms of duels won (eight), touches in the opposition box (seven) and shots on target. It was a performance that illustrated her capabilities at defending from the front as much as her threat in front of goal.View image in fullscreenCristiana Girelli signals to the Italian fans after scoring against Norway.Photograph: Francesco Farina/SPP/ShutterstockGirelli wears her heart on her sleeve. The emotion she feels representing her country and bringing them success runs deep. This has never been more evident than when the final whistle blew on Wednesday night. Having barely had time to rest after being substituted, she ran on to the field in disbelief, hands to her head, before embracing Barbara Bonansea, a player with whom she has spent so much of her journey.The two centurions’ careers have been inextricably linked, their national team debuts coming six months apart and Girelli moving to Juventus a year after Bonansea. The latter deserves just as much credit for Italy’s development. The tears flowed and the celebrations were euphoric. Girelli turned photographer temporarily for a picture in front of Italy’s fans as they started to realise what they had achieved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I felt something different – something special – in this team. I’ve seen a special light in the eyes of my teammates … It’s history for Italian women’s football. I’m so happy and proud for this team.”The progress of the women’s game in Italy has been slow, with less investment and accessibility than in other top European footballing nations. It has meant that Girelli has failed to receive due praise, something Italy’s manager, Andrea Soncin, alluded to on Wednesday. “Throughout her career, she’s received less recognition than she truly deserves, both for her technical ability and her character,” he said.View image in fullscreenCristiana Girelli buries her last-minute header past Norway’s goalkeeper Cecilie Fiskerstrand.Photograph: Salvatore Di Nolfi/EPAIn the semi-finals await England, where there has been no lack of support in recent years.

It is uncertain how long she can continue and she told AFP on Saturday that this would be her last European Championship.However, she and her teammates will be determined this journey does not end just yet. Italy are on the verge of something monumental, one win from a game that could massively improve the trajectory of the sport back home. Girelli’s legacy is written but her last contribution to a nation she has served for so long could yet be the biggest of all.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Italy women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Theirquarter-final victory against Switzerlandwas more difficult than expected and required significant patience. They were not at their best – the hosts did not allow them to be – but the calibre of the world champions’ squad means the opposition cannot switch off, even for an instant. Finding a way is relatively easy when you have Aitana Bonmatí on the field, and her back-heeled assist for Athenea del Castillo’s opener on Friday night was the moment of inspiration they needed. Winning in front of a partisan host crowd is also an achievement mentally.2) EnglandSarina Wiegman describedEngland’s win against Swedenas one of the hardest matches she has ever watched. But it was also one of the most thrilling. The holders were outplayed in the first half but came back through sheer grit, tactical adaptability and a bench-worth of game-changers. The Lionesses became the first team in Euros history to turn around a 2-0 deficit in a knockout match and they have been in the semi-finals of every major tournament since 2015. That shows a mental resilience not many teams possess. To then win the penalty shootout in the manner they did – through the pure willpower of Lucy Bronze if nothing else – illustrated how important this is.3) ItalyThe development of this Italy side since crashing out of the 2023 World Cup at the group stage has been nothing short of remarkable. Andrea Soncin has brought fresh life to a team that were threatening to go backwards. They dominated theirquarter-final victory over Norway, utilising Arianna Caruso’s passing range, Sofia Cantore’s speed in wide areas and Cristiana Girelli’s instinctive eye for goal, and celebrated reaching their first major tournament semi-final since 1997 with fervour, tears falling and Natasha Bedingfield’s Unwritten echoing through the hallways of the Stade de Genève.4) GermanyThe difference in Germany between their group defeat by Sweden and the performance they put into overcome Francecould not have been starker. They were reduced to 10 players in both matches, but they left everything on the pitch in their quarter-final encounter on Saturday night, battling against the odds to reach the last four once again. There is no doubt that Christian Wück’s side are wounded. Their backline is decimated by injury and suspension. There is strength to be found in resilience, however, and Germany displayed plenty of that in Basel.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang scored England’s equaliser in the dramatic quarter-final win against Sweden.Photograph: Philipp Kresnik/SheKicks/SPP/Shutterstock5) SwitzerlandEveryone present inside the Stadion Wankdorf on Friday understood they were witnessing something special. Switzerland have captured the heart of their nation over the past month and their performance against Spain, despite ultimate defeat, will have only brought in more fans. About 25,000 marched through the city of Berne to the match, a sea of red and white that illustrated this goes way beyond the plucky, tenacious performances of Pia Sundhage’s young group. They have forged a bond with their fans; it is now up to those in power to ensure this opportunity is not missed.6) FranceA week ago, France very much looked like a team who could win this tournament, one who had shaken off numerous past issues. But once again, their knockout curse raised its head. Their shootout defeat by Germany was their eighth in their past nine appearances at a quarter-final stage, and it is the way this one happened that will hurt the most. Despite an injury-struck Germany being reduced to 10 players early on, Laurent Bonadei’s side created nine chances and recorded an xG of only 0.63 from open play. The inquest will begin shortly.View image in fullscreenAnn-Katrin Berger saved Amel Majri’s penalty in the shootout as Germany sealed an unlikely victory against France.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images7) SwedenPeter Gerhardsson’s dejected appearance after defeat by England summed it all up. The Sweden manager could not comprehend how his in-form side had not won. The initial gameplan was “perfect” but their inability to retain their energy levels and adapt to the Lionesses’ tactical adaptations proved their downfall. Add in some strange substitutions and penalty-taker decisions and it was Sweden who found themselves on the plane home. This was their first defeat since July 2024 and they had taken the tournament by storm up to this point, cruising through the group stage. Ultimately there was a sad end to Gerhardsson’s eight-year tenure.8) NorwayHow to solve a problem like Norway. That is the question that remains after yet another knockout stage defeat. On paper they possess one of the strongest attacks in Europe, but they all too often fail to be a sum of their parts. Their performance against Italy was disappointing, offering very little bar a 10-minute spell in the second half. Gemma Grainger’s side registered just one shot on target in 90 minutes; Ada Hegerberg’s equaliser. Their failing repeatedly on the global stage requires a comprehensive rethink by the Norwegian FA if they are ever going to realise their potential.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Spain women's football teamEngland women's football teamGermany women's football teamItaly women's football teamSweden women's football teamNorway women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have also questioned its legality, as the proposed expansion,straddling the boroughs of Merton and Wandsworth,would be onmetropolitan open land, which has the same protected status as green belt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The scaling up of facilities is necessary for players and to maintain the prestige of the grand slam tournament, it says.The dispute goes back to 1993 when the All England club bought the golf course land from Merton council for £5.2m. It signed a covenant agreeing it would not use the land other than for leisure, recreational purposes or as open space. The campaign group, which raised £200,000 before the review, believes the proposals have violated that pledge.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the ruling. He said the plans would “cement Wimbledon’s reputation as the greatest tennis competition in the world and London as the sporting capital of the world.“This scheme will bring a significant range of economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits to the local area, the wider capital and the UK economy, creating new jobs and green spaces.”Planning permission for the expansion was first granted by the London deputy mayor Jules Pipe, who said the proposals would deliver benefits that “clearly outweigh the harm”.Explore more on these topicsWimbledonTennisLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Whether or not the government takes any notice is, in the BHA’s view, a potential £100m question for the country’s second-biggest spectator sport.That is roughly the mid-point of the Authority’s best- and worst-case scenarios if the proposal for a unified online gambling tax – Remote Betting & Gaming Duty, or RBGD – becomes a reality in October’s budget. The current rate of duty on betting is 15% of gross profits while online gaming is taxed at 21% of gross profits, and BHA-commissioned modelling suggests that an RBGD rate of 21% would cost the sport £66m per year in lost income from betting. A unified rate of 40%, meanwhile, could see the annual cost rise to £160m.Racing chiefs warn Labour plans on betting could cost sport tens of millions | Greg WoodRead moreGiven the scale of this potential hole in the sport’s annual balance sheet, racing’s official response to the consultation feels, to this fan and punter at least, distinctly underwhelming.According to the BHA press release which announced its formal response, it “outlines racing’s opposition to harmonisation”, and “calls for British horseracing to be taxed at a different and lower rate to all other forms of betting”. In summary: we think this is a bad idea but if you plough on regardless, we want you to give us a get-out clause.For me, there are several problems with this approach. The first is that it is unlikely to fly, because from the government’s point of view, handing a tax break to the sport of kings is not a great look in the current climate. And why “harmonise” in the first place if you are immediately going to start making exceptions?But even in the unlikely event that the chancellor accepts racing’s plea for special treatment, the overall harmonisation of betting and gaming for tax purposes will remain. The big conglomerates that now dominate the gambling landscape will have even more reason to prioritise the no-risk gaming side of their business – and the billions being extracted from punters via online slots above all – over betting.The fundamental differences between betting and gaming, in terms of their mechanics and the risks for their consumers, have been recognised in both legislation and the tax regime since off-course gambling was legalised in Britain in the early 1960s.Similarly, while alcohol and nicotine are both legal and regulated drugs, cigarettes are taxed at a higher rate (and thereare several different bandsof duty for alcoholic drinks according to strength).No one believes that a one-size fits-all duty rate for tobacco and alcohol, or a unified rate for beer and spirits for that matter, is a smart idea.And yet, while theGamblingCommission’s first Gambling Survey for Great Britain stated plainly that “those who had gambled on online slots were more than six times more likely than average to have a PGSCI [Problem Gambling Severity Index] score of 8 or more”, indicating an experience of problem gambling, the Treasury seems minded to tax all the many forms of gambling, from relatively low-risk betting to the most dangerous and potentially addictive gaming products, as if they are one and the same.Alternative ideas are out there. The Social Market Foundation thinktank, for instance,proposed a doublingof the duty rate on gaming products, from 21% to 42%,in a reportpublished last year, while also pointing out that in some jurisdictions around the world, the tax rate for online gaming is above 50%. A hike to 42% on online slots and casino products would, the authors suggested, raise around £900m annually for the exchequer.But rather than go on the offensive and argue for a big hike in gaming duty, the implication of racing’s response to the consultation is that the sport will accept harmonisation plan – which will further incentivise gambling operators to steer punters towards (more dangerous) gaming products at every opportunity – so long as it gets a tax break.It is almost a year to the day sincethis column suggestedthat a unified tax rate for betting and gaming was potentially a far more significant long-term calamity for the sport’s funding model than the “affordability checks” for punters which dominated the narrative at the time.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowLingfield2.15 Nanny Park 2.45 Gran Descans 3.15 Redditizio 3.45 Speed Of Majid (nap) 4.15 Fai Fai 4.50 Fiorella Princess 5.22 Roman EmperorMusselburgh2.30 Gillali Lass 3.00 Proud Nation 3.30 Made All 4.00 Brazilian Belle 4.30 Ravenscraig Castle 5.00 Keep Me Stable 5.30 BalmerinoWolverhampton6.30 Irv 7.00 Calafiori 7.30 Lyra Lea 8.00 Dandy G Boy 8.30 Ignition 9.00 Hidden Verse (nb)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There was some hope 12 months ago that an idea which initially emerged in the final, dismal days of the last Tory government would quietly die a death.With the consultation process now complete, however, the clock is ticking towards the budget in three months’ time. An effective end to the decades-old distinction between betting and gaming – an outcome that “Big Gambling” would celebrate long into the night – now feels increasingly, and disturbingly, imminent.Explore more on these topicsBritish Horseracing AuthorityTalking HorsesHorse racingHorse racing tipsGamblingcommentShareReuse this content"

Scottie Schefflerdescribed in a press conferencebefore the Open how he keeps asking himself why he wants to win golf tournaments and can’t find any answers. The world No 3 men’s tennis player Alexander Zverev confessed to feelings of emptiness and a lack of joy in his tennis regardless of whether he wins or loses matches. The Wimbledon women’s singles runner-up Amanda Anisimova took a long break from tennis to preserve her mental health, was written off by many and unsure what to expect on return, yetended up in the SW19 final.What’s going on? As the world’s top athletes naturally push the boundaries of what’s possible physically, so they also have to push the limits mentally, and these questions and experiences are a vital part of that process.Scheffler is compared to Tiger Woods after a win that rarely seemed in doubt | Sean IngleRead moreWe’re seeing more and more athletes explore the space beyond winning and losing, a concept many in sport have yet to understand actually exists. But as most athletes find out, some sooner than others, to get caught up with winning and losing is to lose the point, both on the court and in life.Finding a purpose behind the pursuit of trophies now forms a key part of an athlete’s mental journey to reach and sustain their highest levels of performance. And, typical of elite performance, it’s not an easy path.Scheffler explained before and aftertriumphing at Royal Portrushthat winning tournaments brought a positive sense of achievement but that thisshouldn’t be mistaken for deep, lasting fulfilment. In many ways, it’s a healthy questioning attitude. Scheffler is largely in a good place: he still enjoys playing, while keenly aware that winning a golf tournament can never be the be all and end all. But he is aware he doesn’t yet have a good enough answer to the question: “Why do I want to win this championship so badly?”View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler chips on to the 12th green – he later said winning the Open was ‘a cool feeling … but it doesn’t fulfil the deepest desires of my heart’..Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnisimova was facing burnout two years ago and knew she had to step away. This time off allowed her to reconnect with herself and redefine why she wanted to play tennis again. She said many people told her she would never make it back if she took time out – one wonders whose interests they were looking after or whether they understood the need to nurture an athlete’s mental and emotional health as much as the physical and physiological side. Zverev seems to sense he must find a different route and knows the answer isn’t about winning or losing.Scheffler, Anisimova and Zverev each prove age‑old findings of biology, psychology and philosophy that humans need meaning in our lives beyond immediate, material gains. Whether you look at the top level of the psychologist Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, return to the Greek Stoic philosophers, or open up the psychiatrist and Auschwitz survivor Viktor Frankl’s classic work Man’s Search for Meaning, the prime motivating force in humans is to find meaning and purpose in life. Trophies are fun, and we all enjoy them. But as Scheffler reminds us, those celebrations last only a few minutes and won’t ever “fill the deepest wants and desires of my heart”.It’s important to note these athletes are not saying winning doesn’t matter. It’s just not the only thing and, as winning is by its nature temporary and shallow, it’s insufficient to sustain the highest levels of performance. Asking “what’s the point of sport?” can feel dangerous, almost heretical, but it’s clearly a powerful thought process to sustain any athlete wanting to explore their full potential.View image in fullscreenAmanda Anisimova, on her way to defeat in the Wimbledon final, previously took time out from the game to look after her mental health.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianFinding reasons why sport matters can look different for different athletes but typically involves the awareness of the person that you are becoming through the pursuit of sporting excellence, the depth of connection that you have with friends, family and wider communities that you belong to, and, over time, the lasting positive impact or legacy you might leave.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it’s a world away from many coaching development routes which have for decades emphasised technical and tactical excellence. Even in the world of sports psychology where there is greatest skill in this area, it’s not what is often requested from coaches or performance directors.Organisations including Switch the Play, the True Athlete Project, ACT and the Jacobs Futura Foundation have woken up to the need to help athletes transition out of sport at the end of their careers, alongside various companies that offer athlete transition programmes. What is becoming clear is that those conversations about purpose, identity and social impact need to come much earlier in an athlete’s career, long before they retire.An interesting consequence that follows when athletes do have a strong sense of meaning, purpose and connection is less difference between the emotional states of winners and losers. Both winning and losing prove useful in the pursuit of connection with others and the process of self-discovery and character development, reinforcing values and virtues such as resilience, courage, gratitude, and humility.We saw this demonstrated by the Wimbledon men’s singles finalists and top two players in the world,Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, whose speeches were remarkably similar and based largely on gratitude, humility and accepting loss. Alcaraz clarified that losses hurt but were “not failures” and Sinner emphasised how important it had been to “accept” his loss a few weeks earlierat the French Open. They had given everything to win Wimbledon but were both immediately grounded that who they are isn’t changed by the result and that they are playing a bigger game.Performance sport shows us contenders at the top of their game whose incredible feats of human possibility now go beyond the field of play. As Sinner said just after holding the Wimbledon trophy for the first time: “We just keep pushing and trying to become a better tennis player, but mostly a better person.” That’s the way to find the mental edge, whatever game you’re playing.Explore more on these topicsScottie SchefflerThe OpenGolfTennisPsychologyUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

The lastLabourgovernment got child poverty down, and I want to get child poverty down.”His comments go further than the 2024 party manifesto, which promised to “develop an ambitious strategy to reduce poverty”. But the government remains unclear on how it intends to meet the prime minister’s target, with the results of the child poverty taskforce expected later this year.Starmer has previously said he wants to end the cap “when fiscal conditions allow” butministers saidthis had been made harder recently by the government’s decision to abandon planned cuts to disability benefits in the face of a Labour rebellion.Child poverty rates have been rising for most of the past decade, and nearly a third of children now live in poverty, according to campaign groups.Ending thetwo-child cap, which was imposed by the Conservatives in 2017, would be a costly measure but one that experts say would have the most direct impact on poverty rates per pound spent. TheChild Poverty Action Group saysscrapping it would take 350,000 children out of poverty overnight – reducing the rate by seven percentage points.Starmer came under heavy criticism during Monday’s hearing with the chairs of all 32 Commons select committees – even from his Labour colleagues – over the government’s record on poverty and living standards.Debbie Abrahams, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, said she had been “ashamed” by the initial proposals in the government’s welfare bill, against which she helped lead the rebellion.“This was poor legislation,” she said. “It was designed to save money for the Treasury by cutting support to sick and disabled people. It was so far removed from Labour values of fairness and social justice, let alone compassion and common decency. I have to say I felt ashamed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A survey by Ipsos found that 31% are mostly excited about the possibilities, but somewhat concerned about the risks. Another 30% are mostly concerned about the risks, but somewhat excited about the possibilities.Kyle said: “AI will be fundamental in driving the change we need to see across the country – whether that’s in fixing the NHS, breaking down barriers to opportunity or driving economic growth.”He said this “can’t be achieved without companies like OpenAI” and added that the partnership would give Britain “agency over how this world-changing technology moves forward”.Altmansaid: “Britain has a strong legacy of scientific leadership and its government was one of the first to recognise the potential of AI through its AI opportunities action plan. Now, it’s time to deliver on the plan’s goals by turning ambition to action and delivering prosperity for all.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said he could not rule out the possibility that Leuga had died on the day of the 999 call.Hamilton said Leuga’s cause of death was pneumonia of uncertain cause, while her daughter’s cause of death could not be established.Asked to comment on the possibility that Choulla’s death may have been because of dehydration or malnutrition, Hamilton answered: “There is nothing in my findings that say any of that is incorrect.”The inquest continues and is expected to last five days.Explore more on these topicsEmergency servicesNottinghamNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The CBO estimates the bill will leave 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034.Trump bill set to add trillions to US debt pile – can America stop it climbing?Read moreThe bill also makes permanent tax cuts that were first introduced by Republicans in Trump’s 2017 tax bill. The cuts included a reduction in the corporate tax rate, from 35% to 21%, and an increase to the standard deduction. It also includes a tax dedication for workers receiving tips and overtime pay, and removes tax credits that support wind and solar power development, which could ultimatelyraise energy costsfor Americans.Increased costs will also come from boosts to immigration and border security funding. The billallocatesnearly $170bn to immigration law enforcement, including the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency and funding for a wall along the southern border.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budgetestimatesthat, with interest, the bill will actually add $4.1tn to the deficit. The USnational debtcurrently stands at more than $36tn.“It’s still hard to believe that policymakers just added $4tn to the debt,” Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement. “Modelers from across the ideological spectrum universally agree that any sustained economic benefits are likely to be modest, or negative, and not one serious estimate claims this bill will improve our financial situation.”Trump signed the bill into law earlier this month after weeks of debate among congressionalRepublicans. The bill passed the Senate 51-50 before it passed the House 218-214.While Republicans largely celebrated the bill, with Trumpcalling it“the most popular bill ever signed in the history of the country”, only a quarter of Americans in a CBS/YouGovpollsaid that the bill will help their family.Democrats meanwhile universally criticized the bill, with Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committeesayingthat while “the GOP continues to cash their billionaire donors’ checks, their constituents will starve, lose critical medical care, lose their jobs – and yes, some will die as a result of this bill.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS economyUS CongressRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

The surprising source of the contamination – a polyester-based paint on the glass bottles’ metal caps.The findings were “very surprising”, said Alexandre Dehaut, a study co-author with the French agency for food, environmental and occupational health and safety.“Caps were suspected to be the main source of contamination, as the majority of particles isolated in beverages were identical to the color of caps and shared the composition of the outer paint,” the authors wrote in the study.US wetlands ‘restored’ using treated sewage tainted with forever chemicalsRead moreMicroplastics are tiny bits of plastic either intentionally added to consumer goods, or that are products of larger plastics breaking down. The particles contain any number of 16,000 plastic chemicals, of which thousands, such as BPA, phthalates and Pfas,present serious health risks.The substance has been found throughout the human body, and is a neurotoxicant that can cross theplacentalandbrainbarriers. It is linked to an increased risk ofheart attackand cancer.Diet is thought to be a main exposure route – testing in recent years has consistently identified microplastics in a range of foods andbeverages, and packaging is one source of contamination.Researchers in the new study checked beverages in water, glass, metal and brick bottles, and found microplastics in all.The levels in the glass bottles were highest – about 50 times higher than the plastic. The glass bottles used metal caps, while the plastic bottles came with plastic caps. The plastic caps did not use the same kind of paint as the metal caps, researchers noted.Dehaut said they were led to the paint because the microplastic fragments they found in the beverages seemed to match the paint. Closer scrutiny revealed the microplastics matched material, color and polymeric composition of the paint lining the outside of the caps.It appears the bottle caps are stored post production with thousands of other caps in bags or boxes, and those scrape each other as they are jostled, Dehaut noted. Once the caps are sealed to the bottles, the bits of plastic from the scratches end up in the beverage. The authors were able to see the tiny scrapes and scratches when they placed the caps under a microscope.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDetox Your KitchenFree weekly newsletterA seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Dehaut said the strategy worked in the lab, but it may be more difficult to do on an industrial scale.They also found microplastics that did not come from the paint, meaning the contamination occurred somewhere in the production process, or was in the product’s water.Though the dangers of microplastics are coming into sharper focus, the health impacts of those that researchers found in the bottles are unclear because there is so much variation in the type of plastic, and they did not run risk assessments, Dehaut said.Consumers could avoid metal bottle caps. Dehaut said there is little people can do at home about the contamination because the microplastics are already in the beverages. He said the findings point to the need to investigate and avoid contamination further upstream during the production process.“We should investigate such things, but don’t be paranoid,” Dehaut said.Explore more on these topicsPfasHealthPlasticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Xinhua reported that the project would consist of five cascade hydropower stations, producing an estimated 300 million megawatt hours of electricity annually at a cost of about 1.2tn yuan (£124bn).In comparison, the Three Gorges dam cost 254.2bn yuan andgenerates 88.2m MWh.No further details were given about timing or scope of construction, but the figures reported by Xinhua exceed estimates from 2020.China, the world’s biggest carbon emitter, is operating a huge renewable energy expansion as it seeks to reach emissions reduction goals and stabilise its power supply. It has tens of thousands of hydropower projects, far more than any other country.The Yarlung Tsangpo megadam will reportedly harness the power created by the river dropping 2km in about 50km as it winds through a canyon on a U-shaped bend.India and Bangladesh have voiced concerns over the project, fearing the water could be held or diverted away from them.The Yarlung Tsangpo becomes the Brahmaputra river as it flows south into India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states and finally into Bangladesh as the Jamuna river. Damming it could affect millions of people downstream.“China can always weaponise this water in terms of blocking it or diverting it,” Neeraj Singh Manhas, special adviser for South Asia at the Parley Policy Initiative,told the BBCin January.The Indian government formally registered its concerns with Beijing over the project in December, and during bilateral meetings between the two countries’ foreign ministers in January.In response, officials have said China does not seek “water hegemony” and never pursues “benefits for itself at the expense of its neighbours”.“China will continue to maintain current exchange channels with downstream nations and step up cooperation on disaster prevention and mitigation,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said in December.Tibetan groups have also noted the presence of sacred sites along the river, and the lack of information about potential population displacement.Other hydropower projects in Tibet have inspired rare protests, resulting in brutal crackdowns from authorities, according to activists. Last yearhundreds of people were arrestedwhile protesting against the Kamtok dam on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river, which they said threatened to displace thousands of residents and submerge ancient Buddhist monasteries. The Three Gorges Dam is estimated to have displacedabout 1.5 million people.Environmentalists have also expressed concern about wildlife in the region, as well as the significant tectonic shifting, severe landslides and extreme geography where the dam is expected to go.The Chinese government rejects the criticism, and says the project will stimulate jobs in the region, increase domestic energy supplies and spur on development in the renewables sector. “Special emphasis must be placed on ecological conservation to prevent environmental damage,” Li said.Explore more on these topicsChinaTibetHydropowerRenewable energyBiodiversityRiversAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Lund also suffered aninvestor rebellionat BP’s annual meeting amid pressure over its poorly performing share price.View image in fullscreenThe incoming BP chair, Albert Manifold.Photograph: Niall Carson/PAThe change in chair comes amid a broader strategic shift at BP, as it cuts back on green spending and returns its focus to oil and gas, after a botched attempt to reinvent itself as a net zero energy company.Manifold was chief executive of CRH for a decade until the end of last year, and led the shift in the company’s primary listing from London to New York in 2023.The chief executive of BP, Murray Auchincloss,saidlast year that switching BP’s listing to the US was “not on the agenda”. BP shares have lagged behind its US peers, while a string of British firms haveswitched their primary listings from London to New York.Amanda Blanc, the boss of Aviva and senior independent director at BP who led the process to find a new chair, said Manifold had “transformed and refocused CRH into a global leader” and praised “his impressive track record of shareholder value creation”.View image in fullscreenThe outgoing BP chair, Helge Lund.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesManifold, who received a $13m (£9.6m) package for his work at CRH last year, called it “an honour to be appointed chair of one of the world’s great energy companies, and to have the opportunity to help the company reach its full potential”.BP’s green strategy was set by its previous boss, Bernard Looney, who was appointed by Lund in 2020 to transform the business into an integrated energy company. However, the transition was undermined by a rise in global oil and gas prices, as well as theshock departure of Looney in 2023.Auchincloss set out a“fundamental reset”this year after the activist hedge fund Elliott Management amassed a multibillion-pound stake in the company amid growing investor dissatisfaction over its sluggish share price.Lund said in April that “having fundamentally reset our strategy”, it was “the right team to start the process to find my successor”.The Norwegian, who was paid £882,000 last year, was at the centre of ahigh-profile storm over a £25m packageto lure him to BG Group in 2015.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, it agreed tosell its onshore wind business in the US, as part of a plan to offload $20bn in assets to “simplify and focus the business”.The green shareholder activist group Follow This said it was a “good signal” that Manifold was not a fossil fuels veteran, but expressed doubt that “he has the transition experience BP urgently needs”.Mark van Baal, of the Netherlands-based group, said: “The new chair needs to be climate and transition competent and resistant to short-term activists.“BP’s recent strategic U-turn appears to be driven by panic after a short-term activist reportedly bought shares in the company. We’re hearing significant frustration from long-term investors about this.”Manifold’s appointment is the latest in a series in BP’s boardroom. The company added Simon Henry, a former Shell executive, to its board two weeks ago, as well as Dave Hager in May. Hager is an industry veteran, leading the US shale producer DevonEnergyas chief executive and then as executive chair.BP shares have fallen by more than 10% in the past 12 months, prompting speculation it could become a takeover target.

The man, who denies the offences, was remanded in custody before a two-day trial next month.After the latest violence, Essex police said that four people who arrived at the scene on Sunday were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder in connection with offences alleged to have happened during last Thursday’s protest.The force also said there were angry and violent scenes when a woman walked through the crowds. It said in a statement: “Missiles were thrown at her and a number of individuals were shouting abuse and trying to reach the woman.“Our officers walked alongside her until she left the scene in order to keep everyone on all sides safe and ensure no one was hurt.”Video footage of the incident showed the middle-aged woman saying she had tried to speak to councillors at the protest and that she also supported closing the hotel.Epping has emerged as a potential major flashpoint with the first anniversary of last year’s riots approaching.The prime minister’s official spokesperson said on Monday: “Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but it’s clearly unacceptable to see police coming under attack as they ensure that peaceful protest is able to take place.“Essex police put out the statement making very clear: people who protest peacefully, lawfully and responsibly cause us and the wider public no concern. However, we can never and will never tolerate criminal violence, and I think the prime minister will obviously echo that.”Asked about Epping at a Reform UK press conference, Farage said: “I don’t think anybody in London even understands just how close we are to civil disobedience on a vast scale in this country and I regret saying that.“Of course there were some bad eggs that turned up in Epping. There were the usual far-right thugs, but equally what about antifa?” he added, in apparent reference to those in a small group of Stand Up to Racism demonstrators who staged a protest in Epping in Thursday and who quickly became the target of anger by some in the other protest.“It isn’t all far-right thuggery, as you might sometimes hear from our prime minister, but do I understand how people in Epping feel? You bet your life I do.”A man has appeared before a court and denied a charge of violent disorder after a protest outside the hotel.A second man was charged on Monday with violent disorder, the Crown Prosecution Service said.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He was banned from driving for 17 years and eight months.Byrne, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and other offences at a previous hearing. An earlier hearing was told Slinn had dismounted and was walking across the A57 when he was hit by a Volkswagen Golf driven by Byrne.Byrne, who was carrying two passengers, then sped off, with dashcam footage showing his tyres smoking as he appeared to be trying to control the vehicle. Footage shown in court showed him inhaling nitrous oxide gas from a yellow balloon several times as he was driving, before and after the collision.View image in fullscreenGraham Slinn.Photograph: Family Handout/PAThe court heard Slinn, a retired builder who helped care for adults with learning disabilities, was weeks away from celebrating his 60th wedding anniversary with his wife, Jaqueline.In a statement, his wife said they had met through a love of cycling and that her husband rode his bike several times a week. He was also a keen singer who would perform in pubs and clubs in Sheffield, she said.Sentencing Byrne, Judge Richardson KC said inhaling nitrous oxide was an “exceptionally dangerous act while driving”, and told the defendant that Slinn had “died of injuries inflicted by your truly appalling driving”.The judge said Byrne “endured a dreadful upbringing” and “had known very few boundaries” in his life, but told the defendant: “You are a dangerous offender and the public must be protected from your evident dangerous and ingrained criminal behaviour.”Byrne was due to be sentenced last month but, after hearing about his “astonishing and appalling” driving record, Richardson said he wanted a report prepared by probation officers. The court heard Byrne had convictions for 27 offences, including dangerous driving, despite having no driving licence.Rebecca Stephens, defending, told the court her client drove off because he believed he had only hit another vehicle with his wing mirror.After the sentencing, Slinn’s daughter Nicola, and son Victor, said the death of their “kind to his core” father was “100% avoidable”. They said cycling was his “lifelong passion and a shared family activity”, and that their father “always took safety incredibly seriously”.“Despite taking every possible precaution to stay safe – dismounting at the end of the cycle path, waiting for the lights to change to green for pedestrians, and wheeling his bike across the pedestrian crossing – on the day he died, he was hit at speed by a car driven by someone who just kept going, as if our dad wasn’t even there, as if he was nothing,” they said.“But he was there. He was everything to us. He was our dad, our mum’s husband of 60 years, a granddad to two teenage girls, and a friend to so many.”In a statement released through Thompsons Solicitors, the family said: “To lose any loved one is a shock. But to lose someone so vibrant, so active, and to know their death was 100% avoidable is doubly cruel.”Explore more on these topicsYorkshireCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Two of his children have appealed to the public to engage with the documents “with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family’s continuing grief”.“The release of these files must be viewed within their full historical context,” wroteMartin Luther KingIII and Dr Bernice A King in a statement. “During our father’s lifetime, he was relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign orchestrated by J. Edgar Hoover through the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).”They also repeated the family’s long-held contention that James Earl Ray, the man convicted of assassinating King, was not solely responsible, if at all.Bernice King was five years old when her father was killed at the age of 39. Martin III was 10.“The intent of the government’s COINTELPRO campaign was not only to monitor, but to discredit, dismantle, and destroy Dr. King’s reputation and the broader American Civil Rights Movement,” they continue. “These actions were not only invasions of privacy, but intentional assaults on the truth – undermining the dignity and freedoms of private citizens who fought for justice, designed to neutralize those who dared to challenge the status quo.”The murdered civil rights leader’s children also write that they believe that their father was killed as part of a conspiracy that involved “unnamed co-conspirators, including government agencies”.“While we support transparency and historical accountability, we object to any attacks on our father’s legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods,” they add. “We strongly condemn any attempts to misuse these documents in ways intended to undermine our father’s legacy and the significant achievements of the movement. Those who promote the fruit of the FBI’s surveillance will unknowingly align themselves with an ongoing campaign to degrade our father and the Civil Rights Movement.”Some civil rights activists were not so supportive of the release.“Trump releasing the MLK assassination files is not about transparency or justice,” said the Rev Al Sharpton. “It’s a desperate attempt to distract people from the firestorm engulfing Trump over the Epstein files and the public unraveling of his credibility among the Maga base.”The King Center, founded by King’s widow and now led by Bernice King, reacted separately from what Bernice said jointly with her brother. The King Center statement framed the release as a distraction – but from more than short-term political controversy.“It is unfortunate and ill-timed, given the myriad of pressing issues and injustices affecting the United States and the global society,” said the King Center, linking those challenges to MLK’s efforts. “This righteous work should be our collective response to renewed attention on the assassination of a great purveyor of true peace.”Donald Trump promised as a candidate to release files related to John F Kennedy’s 1963 assassination. When the US president took office in January, he signed an executive order to declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F Kennedy’s and King’s 1968 assassinations.The government unsealed the JFK records in March and disclosed some RFK files in April.The King records were initially intended to be sealed until 2027, until justice department attorneys asked a federal judge to lift the sealing order early.Scholars, history buffs and journalists have been preparing to study the documents for new information about his assassination on 4 April 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. King was assassinated as he was aiding striking sanitation workers in Memphis, part of his explicit turn toward economic justice.Ray pleaded guilty to King’s murder. Ray later renounced that plea and maintained his innocence until his death in 1998.Members of King’s family, and others, have long questioned whether Ray acted alone, or if he was even involved. Coretta Scott King asked for the inquiry to be reopened, and in 1998, then attorney general Janet Reno directed the justice department’s civil rights division to take a new look. Reno’s department said it “found nothing to disturb the 1969 judicial determination that James Earl Ray murdered Dr King”.In their latest statement, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III repeated their assertions that Ray was set up. They pointed to a 1999 civil case, brought by the King family, in which a Memphis jury concluded that Martin Luther King Jr had been the target of a conspiracy.“As we review these newly released files,” the Kings said, “we will assess whether they offer additional insights beyond the findings our family has already accepted.”Explore more on these topicsMartin Luther KingTrump administrationFBInewsShareReuse this content"

The technician operating the machine – which looks like a long, narrow tube with openings on each end – then allowed Keith to walk in while he wore a nearly 20lb (9kg) metal chain that he used for weight training.Police in Nassau county,New York, said Keith was then sucked into the device by its potent magnetic force. He endured “a medical episode” at that point which left him in critical condition at a hospital, and he was pronounced dead a day later, police said.Adrienne told News 12 that her late husband had suffered several heart attacks after the incident with the MRI machine and before his death. She recalled, through tears, “seeing the machine snatch him and pull him into the machine”.She said she implored for the clinic to call for emergency help and, referring to the machine, to “turn this damn thing off!”But eventually Keith “went limp in my arms”, Adrienne recounted. “This is still pulsating in my brain.”AGoFundMecampaign since launched to support Adrienne purported that Keith “was attached to the machine for almost an hour before they could release the chain from the machine”.Adrienne told News 12 that she and her husband had previously been to Nassau Open MRI, and he had worn his weight-training chain there before.“This was not the first time that guy [had] seen that chain,” Adrienne said to the station. “They had a conversation about it before.”A person who picked up a phone call to Nassau Open MRI on Monday said the facility had no comment.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates MRI safety and warns that scans with the technology can create a “strong, static magnetic field” that poses physical hazards. The agency says that “careful screening of people and objects entering the MRI environment is critical to ensure nothing enters the magnet area that may become a projectile” and dangerous to anyone nearby.The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, meanwhile,cautionsthat MRI machines exerts “very powerful forces on objects of iron, some steels and other magnetizable objects” and have the strength “to fling a wheelchair across the room”.McAllister was not the first person killed by an MRI machine in New York. In 2001, Michael Colombini, 6,diedwhen an oxygen tank flew into an MRI chamber that he was in, having been pulled in by the machine at a medical center in Westchester county.Explore more on these topicsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

A mere 0.1% of residents hold 71% of the tech hub’s wealth.The findings come from the 2025 “Silicon Valley Pain Index”, a report published by SJSU’s Human Rights Institute each year since 2020. The report aims to quantify “structured inequalities” in Silicon Valley, and measures “pain” as “both personal and community distress or suffering”.This year’s index reports that the wealth divide has widened in Silicon Valley at double the rate of the whole United States over the past decade. The nine wealthiest households in the valley control $683.2bn – a $136bn increase over the past year.At the same time, 110,000 households reported nearly none or no assets.The cost of living in Silicon Valley has risen as well: renters must earn $136,532 to afford an apartment – the highest in the nation.The report ranked San Jose No 4 in “impossibly unaffordable” cities worldwide (after Hong Kong, Sydney and Vancouver). Yet, no cities in Silicon Valley have raised the minimum wage in the past three years. The report finds that 54,582 low-income households do not have access to an affordable home in San Jose and that homelessness grew 8.2% from 2023.When they created the Silicon Valley Pain Index in 2020, shortly after the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, San Jose State University researchers were inspired by the Katrina Pain Index, which aimed to quantify the injustices New Orleans residents faced after Hurricane Katrina. The index continues to show stark racial inequalities.Hispanic workers in San Jose, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara can expect to make 33 cents for every $1 their white peers take home. And although shareholders have voiced commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion, only 3% of employees working in research and development at Apple are Black (compared with 6% Hispanic/Latino, 36% white and 50% Asian).Meanwhile, police violence remains a real concern – even years after the Black Lives Matter protests. Ten people died in police custody in the Santa Clara county sheriff’s office in 2024 – the highest in two decades. And San Jose reported five office involved shootings, up three from 2023.However, the report did note certain improvements in the Silicon Valley area – including a decrease in police use of force incidents in San Jose, an expansion in services to prevent homelessness and environmental sustainability programs.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaSilicon ValleyUS income inequalityWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The protesters also included the group Omas gegen Rechts (Grans against the Right) and the anti-fascist artists’ collective Zentrum für Politische Schönheit (the Center for Political Beauty).View image in fullscreenOmas gegen Rechts (Grans against the Right) were among the groups protesting against the AfD.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPASome parts of the interview were inaudible to people watching it on TV.The anti-immigrant party has insisted the interview should be rerun to give Weidel the chance to properly answer the questions in what was part of a series of interviews with politicians from all parties.On Monday ARD said it would learn lessonsfrom the incident but refused to say whether it would redo the interview. “An uninterrupted flow in interviews is in our interest and, above all, in the interest of the audience. Therefore, we will draw conclusions from the broadcast and take precautions in the future,” a spokesperson said.The broadcaster said it had not been notified that the protest would be taking place and that nothing had been registered with the police in advance. The Berlin police said no arrests had been made, but that it was considering launching proceedings against the demonstrators.The journalist carrying out the interview, Markus Preiß, said afterwards: “I have to say: Alice Weidel was quite sporting, considering the volume.” He added: “Everyone is allowed to demonstrate; that’s a good democratic right. But demonstrations are usually registered. And this one wasn’t.”While she tried to make light of it, calling the choir a “tax-funded NGO” and insisting she was used to protests against her, Weidel appeared to grow increasingly frustrated as the interview went on.Posting a link on social media to the interview, which was shown on the flagship news programme Tagesschau, she wrote: “This is how it looks, by the way, when the Tagesschau holds a summer interview with the AfD in [conservative] CDU-governed Berlin – while the NGO choir protests in the background.”View image in fullscreenThe interview was held next to a public square in Berlin.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPAPreiß said he and Weidel had briefly discussed whether they should keep going and had agreed to continue.ARD faced a barrage of criticism for its failure to move it to an enclosed studio. AfD members and supporters said the broadcaster was responsible for guaranteeing equal conditions for politicians of all parties during interviews.Some opponents of the AfD said the protests had had the effect of creating more publicity for the party, whichbecame the largest opposition party in the German parliamentafter February’s elections.The media lobby group Reporters Without Borders said internet companies should be taxed to create a fund to help public broadcasters deal with the pressures they are increasingly facing from far-right parties.The group’s director general, Thibaut Bruttin, cited Donald Trump’s decision to “dismantle” the US’s international broadcasting service, saying it echoed “the offensive being waged by certain political forces against public radio and television broadcasters across Europe”, naming Hungary, Italy and Slovakia.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropeProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Ahead of a new Edinburgh show, Peter Richardson tells us why his riotous creation still makes audiences laugh 40 years onBrian LoganMon 21 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 03.41 EDTShareIt was the moment comedy broke with sexism – yet it happened in a strip club. It was a fervour of free creative expression – yet it retained a commercial, careerist edge. It was one of the longest-running and most successful brands in UK comedy history – which few people could now recognise.At the Edinburgh fringe this summer, The Comic Strip Presents … will be memorialised in a series of film screenings and Q&As with its creator and prime mover Peter Richardson. Richardson was the impresario behind the legendary comedy club The Comic Strip, which opened in 1980. When he and his star performers – Rik Mayall, Alexei Sayle, French and Saunders among them – created Channel 4’s The Comic Strip Presents … a couple of years later, he could legitimately claim to be the man who brought alternative comedy to television.This being a celebration of an iconic moment in UK comedy history, one might assume Edinburgh’s Usher Hall or the 750-seat Pleasance Grand has been set aside to host. But one might assume wrong. “When I started [showing these films] about a year ago,” Richardson tells me, “we didn’t have the money to advertise them. So we’d arrive at theatres that had about 30 people who had somehow read our minds that we were going to be there. And 30 people in a 300-seat cinema can be hard work.”The Comic Strip Presents … ran for three series on Channel 4 from 1982-1988, then it moved to the BBC in the early 90s before making a return to Channel 4 for one-off specials, the most recent in 2016. But it’s not a big name in comedy – far less so than, for example,The Young Ones, the BBC sitcom starring some of the same talents and broadcast at the same time.View image in fullscreenJennifer Saunders in The Comic Strip Presents: War.Photograph: RGR Collection/Alamy“It wasn’t good television,” admits Richardson, “because it wasn’t repetitive, and television is about repeating a formula and people getting to know it well.” And was it even comedy? One of the show’s stars,Mayall, argued that it shouldn’t have been called The Comic Strip, and that “Interesting Films” might have been a better fit. In fact, the series was – likeInside No 9more recently – a tonally varying anthology show, a suite of standalone films united only by sensibility, and by the performers bringing them to the screen.“I told Channel 4,” says Richardson, “‘These performers are so good they don’t need to be stuck playing one-dimensional characters. They can play all sorts. One week they can be a heavy metal band, the next week they can be The Famous Five.’ You could call it bad television, because you’re not seeing more of the same. But as it’s gone on, it’s become a collection of very memorable one-off moments and that’s what people now remember.”The performers also includedAdrian Edmondson,Nigel Planerand Richardson himself, with a rotating supporting cast that included Keith Allen, Robbie Coltrane and more. At the time, they were setting the UK comedy scene ablaze. That all started at the Comedy Store, a strip club and the anarchic HQ of what had recently been called “alternative comedy”. Richardson’s coup was to cherrypick the most exciting voices of that generation, and cart them off to another strip club, a little less anarchic, a few blocks up the road: the Raymond Revuebar. Here, with the financial support of the Rocky Horror Picture Show producer Michael White, he opened The Comic Strip club – a name that seems obvious, although “the New Depression Club” was, according to Edmondson, a very near miss.For a year from 1980-1981, the Comic Strip was the hippest and hottest comedy night in town. “The bouncers at Raymond Revuebar had a simple rule of thumb for who was directed where,” Sayle later wrote. “If they reeked of aftershave they were sent to the strip show; if they smelled of beer they came to us.” Celebs piled in: Bianca Jagger, Dustin Hoffman. Robin Williams came and demanded to perform, to impress his guest, David Bowie. Sayle offered him 15 minutes. Williams said: “I told [Bowie] I’d do an hour”. Sayle: “You can’t.” Williams: “I’ll buy the club!” Sayle: “We don’t own it. It belongs to a bouffant-haired pornographer.” The buzz even reached the pages of the London Review of Books, whose critic noted, “within seconds, [Sayle] has the audience agape. Most of them, it seemed, had never been called cunts before.”View image in fullscreenOne-off moments ... Alexei Sayle in Didn’t You Kill My Brother?Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyThen Channel 4 came calling, looking for cutting-edge talent to help launch the new broadcaster on to the country’s airwaves. Richardson was given carte blanche. “They said, ‘What do you want to do?’ and I said, ‘I want to make six films, all different.’” The first, Five Go Mad in Dorset, was transmitted on the station’s opening night, and the controversy around its satire of Enid Blyton attitudes gave that event a front-page news fillip. But Five Go Mad willnotbe celebrated at the fringe this summer, says Richardson. “Taking the piss out of racism and sexism [in that way] is long gone,” he says. “It’s not a funny issue like it was when we did it in the 80s.”One option might have been to re-edit the episode – a course of action in which Richardson, now 73, has freely indulged as the Edinburgh shows have come together. Not for him a bask in the glory of his youthful success. “What we’ve done,” he says, “is revisited the films and said, ‘30 years later they need some adjustment.’ Because things go faster now.” Western spoof Fistful of Travellers Cheques has been “cut back a bit”. So too has late-period favourite Four Men in a Car. And a scene has been trimmed from The Strike, the show’s faux Hollywood movie making mincemeat of the miners’ strike. That one bagged a Golden Rose of Montreux comedy award, and starred Richardson (the only performer to appear in every episode) as Al Pacino playing, er, Arthur Scargill. “I could do Pacino much better now,” he laughs, “because I worked with John Sessions onStella Street.” So now, he says, slipping into a convincing Italian-American accent, “I can do Al.”Stella Street was another of Richardson’s TV hits, undertaken when The Comic Strip Presents, by any measure his life’s work, was in abeyance. Even when he was a jobbing comedian, in double act The Outer Limits with Nigel Planer, Richardson was a child of amateur film-makers and a wannabe film-maker himself. With The Comic Strip, he made movies for cinematic release: The Supergrass in 1985, and Eat the Rich two years later. Further TV specials included Red Nose of Courage, telling the tale of John Major’s flight from the circus to parliament, and2011’s The Hunt for Tony Blair, imagining the ex-PM on the run having been accused of a series of murders.Both will be screened at the fringe, MC’d by comedian Robin Ince and with special guests including Sayle and Allen. Richardson is modest about the achievement of having brought these 30 years’ worth of films to the screen. “I always thought we were the new Ealing comedies. And [Ealing Studios at its peak] made about 150 films over 20 years, of which about 15 are remembered. So our strike rate isn’t too bad. We made some flops, but at least one or two out of each series are really good.”View image in fullscreen‘These performers are so good they don’t need to be stuck playing one-dimensional characters’ … Nigel Planer and Dawn French in Four Men in a Car.Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamySome, indeed, are carved on this writer’s heart – notably Bad News Tour and More Bad News, the show’s two-part heavy metal spoof, which predated This Is Spinal Tap and ended up with Edmondson, Mayall and co performing live on stage, under a hail of beer glasses, at the 1986 Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington.Richardson is at peace with the under-appreciation of The Comic Strip Presents, acknowledging that, as a bloody-minded sitcom refusenik way back when, he is the auteur of his own misfortune. He is delighted to be bringing the remastered films to Edinburgh, a city in which, back in the day, he and Planer once toured as a support act to Dexy’s Midnight Runners. “FrontmanKevin Rowlandcomplained,” he says, “that we didn’t do new material at every performance.”Expect no new material at these screenings – but a new experience, perhaps. “It’s a great thing,” says Richardson, “to show them in the cinema. You don’t often get to share comedy television with an audience, and it changes the whole experience: people laughing around you. We’ve discovered that thereisan audience around the country who want to see these films on the big screen and talk about them. It’s fantastic that something we created 30 or 40 years ago is still creating laughter.

The fellow about to swing is Isaac Broadway (Tim Daly), who manages to communicate to his onlooking son Henry (Brandon Lessard) that he should seek revenge on one Sheriff Butler, who framed him for murder. But when Henry corners a different lawman, Gabriel Dove (Pierce Brosnan), in a church in the Montana town of Trinity, he learns that someone got to the previous sheriff first.It turns out that papa Broadway, a maligned patriarch who built most of Trinity, was embroiled in a stolen Confederate gold racket – ripping off his gallows tormentor, the ex-slave St Christopher (Jackson), in the process. Add to that a Blackfoot seeking revenge (The New World’s Q’orianka Kilcher), a fake priest (David Arquette), a smattering of local thugs, and before you can say “sins of the father” (luckily, someone does), we have a bubbling potboiler on the go.While The Unholy Trinity is always robustly enjoyable, director Richard Gray and writer Lee Zachariah aren’t the best at laying out their convoluted screed. Not only does it feel as if Henry and Gabriel are always skulking around the peripheries of their own story without clear agendas, it never settles down for long enough to hit on the emotional core of this homecoming. Forced into cahoots as they try to locate the gold and fend off the loitering St Christopher, it is only near the end that the childless sheriff and prodigal son start to bond – and the theme of surrogate family belatedly flares up.The muddy psychology shows in some diffident directing from Gray when handling quieter scenes; he is more at ease in brothel shootouts and the gallops across ravishing Montana prairies. The impressively arrayed cast also help to keep this enterprise buoyant, even if a silver-haired and affable Brosnan and Jackson, effortlessly mesmerising a saloon full of punters, are doing exactly what you would expect. If following The Unholy Trinity’s various tracks is sometimes frustrating, it’s still rare enough: a red-blooded and essentially satisfying western.The Unholy Trinity is on digital platforms now and available on DVD from 21 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmWesternsSamuel L JacksonPierce BrosnanreviewsShareReuse this content"

He makes the remark about an over-the-top, literally pyrotechnic school play that his teenage friend Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) has just debuted to an audience of dazed teachers and parents. But his comment stands in for the whole movie, an audacious and risky comedy that should not work, but does. I am elated each time I watch this poignant, wise and wildly funny film – and, yes, there is a happy ending.‘Spirited and sumptuous’: why Big Night is my feelgood movieRead moreRushmore is about children trying to act like adults and adults acting like children. Fischer is a precocious scholarship student atRushmore, a prestigious private boys’ school. He is the sort of bright but naive young person who tries to impress an adult by telling them, with a straight face, that he plans to apply to Oxford and the Sorbonne for university, with Harvard as a “safety”. In fact, Fischer spends more time planning lavish plays and starting school clubs than studying. He is one of the school’s “worst students”, his headmaster (Brian Cox) sighs.One day Fischer meets Blume, a local industrialist whose sons are students at Rushmore. Blume is a self-hating rich man – his loathing of his boorish, silver-spoon-fed sons is one of the film’s many funny running jokes – and he takes a shine to the scrappy Fischer. Despite their difference in age, the two develop a sincere and surprisingly equal friendship.A wrench is thrown into their bromance when Fischer meets Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), a new teacher at Rushmore and a recent widow, and develops a powerful crush. In addition to the obvious hurdles – he is a child, and she is not interested – his friend Blume becomes smitten, as well. (Talking to Fischer by cellphone, Blume tries to talk him out of his crush on Rosemary. “I mean, she’s notthatbeautiful. She’s notthatintriguing,” he argues, as the camera pans to reveal that he is spying on her through a classroom window.) The two friends spiral into an infantile battle for Rosemary’s attention – without, in classic male fashion, having given much thought to her feelings.A love triangle (sort of) between two adults and a teenager is an odd, even uncomfortable, premise for a movie. Rushmore’s protagonist, Fischer, is also frankly a bad person: a shameless operator who manipulates people, subjects the exasperated Rosemary to grand and misguided romantic gestures, and acts ruthlessly to realize his overambitious projects. (Perhaps Anderson is trying to tell us something about auteur film-makers?) There’s a version of Rushmore that reads like Fatal Attraction; it is a testament to the film’s intelligence that it instead bubbles over with charm, warmth and emotional observation.I first watched Rushmore in high school, when I was old enough to appreciate the movie but not really to fully understand it. It was recommended by a friend who had a touch of Fischer to him, and perhaps saw a touch in me, too. Watching the movie, I had a strange shock of recognition: not just “Where has this been all my life?” but “How is it that some people I’ve never met made something perfectly tailored to my sensibilities?” Of course, a good film offers more, not less, each time you watch it. I’ve come back to Rushmore again and again, and each time I catch things – jokes, call-backs, themes, smart symmetries and flourishes – that I hadn’t noticed before.The film is the best of Anderson’s quirky vision, without an overindulgence in the aspects of his style that can be grating or “twee”, to cite a common criticism. One reason may be the contribution of the actorOwen Wilson, who co-wrote Anderson’s first three films (including another fan favorite, The Royal Tenenbaums). I suspect he balanced Anderson’s whimsy with a certain groundedness and emotionality. Rushmore is stamped with the famous Anderson aesthetic, but its characters and story also have a realness that his more recent work sometimes lacks.As entertainment, the film gives me sheer pleasure. Yet it is also a profoundly shrewd study of relationships, ego, and growing up, whose emotional maturity is all the more impressive given that Anderson and Wilson started writing it when they were still in their 20s. And the film’s iconic soundtrack of British Invasion pop-rock is perfectly chosen, none more so than in the final scene. As characters dance sweetly to Faces’ Ooh La La, the lyrics offer a summation: “I wish that I knew what I know now / When I was younger.”Rushmore is available on Hoopla in the US or to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsWes AndersonMy feelgood movieRushmoreBill MurrayJason SchwartzmanOlivia WilliamsComedy filmsComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

(The fact that university student Clare looks so pretty is a distinct advantage in her quest for deserving victims.) Like predatory creep Joe (Bart Johnson), they find her seemingly by accident, pre-equipped with stock photo prints of their mythical children and hip-flasks full of spiked booze, hoping to dupe her into getting in the car so she can be raped or worse. But Clare has mad self-defence skills, homicidal instincts of her own, and a backpack conveniently stocked with rubber gloves and lint rollers just in case she needs to wipe away fingerprints and evidence.Funnily enough, it seems there have been numerous unsolved disappearances of young women in the very town in which she lives with her retired actor grandma, Gigi (Rebecca De Mornay, underused but feisty). So Clare gets investigating and nearly every man she meets seems suss, apart from the campus’s flamboyantly gay theatre director (Joel Michealy) who is clearly just there for comic relief. And yet Clare doesn’t seem all that good at building relationships with women either, given the toxic, bitchy interactions she has with supposed friends Amity (Erica Dasher) and Juliana (Joy Rovaris), mean girls whom the film seems quite happy to put in danger.This is adapted from a novel by Don Roff, the script crafted by director Mitzi Peirone and co-screenwriter Guinevere Turner. Turner, also an actor, was once quite a name in the indie movie world with credits for co-writing Go Fish and American Psycho among others, but this doesn’t really have the same zeitgeist-harmonising thrum. Instead, it plays as pseudo-feminist horror for viewers who don’t really like women, or, for that matter, men. Or people of any gender. It’s all curdled but not in an especially interesting way, although there is no denying that Thorne has a basic charisma that holds the screen, and Ryan Phillippe is well cast as a grouchy cop whose agenda doesn’t mesh with Clare’s.Saint Clare is on digital platforms from 21 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersHorror filmsFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The film is centred on this queen’s gambit: her c 1555 portrait of her three sisters and housemaid playing chess, which clocked up numerous firsts. Apart from being the first Renaissance all-female group painting and the first to juxtapose women of different classes, its most groundbreaking accomplishment was depicting real-life – rather than symbolic or idealised – women.Narrated by Elizabeth van Sebelle, the film sticks to basic summaries to relay the context. Born around 1532 into a lapsed aristocratic family from Cremona, as the eldest child Anguissola got a fancy Carthaginian first name (her father was Amilcare) and artistic training a cut above the average woman of the time. Initially schooled by distinguished local painters, she impressed Michelangelo in her early 20s when he challenged her to draw a weeping boy. Her artistic apprenticeship was meant in part to bolster her marriage chances rather than to give her a career in her own right – a career she had, nevertheless, becoming court painter to Philip II of Spain, and subtly influencing her peers.The showpiece analysis is brisk and compelling, from a history of chess as an emerging cultural status symbol to rival literature and music, to the painting’s Leonardo-inspired composition. While the image undoubtedly displays Anguissola’s empathic talents, there’s something particular going on in its matrix of sisterly gazes, as delineated here: moving from seven-year-old Europa’s amused reaction to adolescent Minerva’s stupefied gawp on losing her queen, to the self-possessed 18-year-old Lucia staring outwards (presumably at the artist). Anguissola is selling the family’s credo of education and the transmission of good character.One drawback is that confining the film to a single painting means the analysis of Anguissola’s influence feels limited; charting the specific imitators of The Game of Chess is interesting, but less so than understanding the broader impact of ordinary women’s representation. And the titbits in her biography hint at greater dramatic possibilities than this purely academic treatment gets across; after leaving the Spanish court, she fell in love with a sea captain, lived childless in Genoa and Palermo, before dying aged 93. This is an intriguing primer, but there’s ample biopic potential for this lady on fire.Sofonisba’s Chess Game is on Prime Video from 24 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPaintingArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her daily circular walks round Lancaster during lockdown were no real preparation, and a brief orienteering course was no guarantee that she wouldn’t get lost. She wasn’t walking for charity or running away from a marriage or, like the fell runner who’d done the route in 39 hours, trying to break any record. A homebody “inclined to slowness”, she was a 40-year-oldnovelist, professor and mother of two going off on her own for two-and-a-half weeks for reasons she couldn’t quite articulate.Not that there weren’t contributory factors. Lockdown had left her with post-Covid cabin fever, itchy to be elsewhere after the long months of caring for her family and students (“a one-woman battle against entropy”). She also knew that at every pub and guest house she’d booked en route supportive letters would be waiting from her terminally ill but brilliantly animated friend Clive. Most importantly, although her walking wouldn’t be solitary, since she couldn’t avoid bumping into other (potentially annoying) hikers, she’d be “the sole owner of my own skin again”.As she flogs herself “onwards towards impressiveness”, her journey is marked out plainly. The chapters detail the distance and destinations of each day’s walk. They also convey how brittle, sour and grumpy she can be, and how blistered and footsore she gets: she might be “off on a jolly” but there’s a price to pay, in pain and guilt. She doesn’t go in for nature writing: when she evokes “the damp green air and the heavy, alive smell of the still-wet branches and mulchy undergrowth”, it’s a plain-as-muck authentic response, not a “soft” poeticism. Maybe that’s down to her being grittily northern. She does reflect on what it means to come from the north, but her version of northern-ness isn’t Alfred Wainwright’s, whose “gruff complaining” she engages with throughout – enjoyably and sometimes scathingly.The book conveys how brittle, sour and grumpy she can be, and how blistered and footsore she getsHe’s not the only fellow traveller in her head. Nor is Clive, with his letters, nor Ben, her late first husband, whose 24 marathons in 24 months, completed after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, were an amazing achievement. Mostly it’s writers she carries with her – Henry David Thoreau, William Hazlitt, Werner Herzog (whowalked from Munich to Paristo see his dying mentor) and Virginia Woolf – whose ideas inspire her own. (Had it come out sooner, David Nicholls’s novel of last year covering the same route, You Are Here, might have featured too.)What’s captivating about her book is all the thinking she does mid- or post-trek: on writing, friendship, welfare, illness,Charles Atlas, climate change, protest marches, knitting, and why it is that in popular mythology “walking women” are either models on a catwalk or sex workers. As she wanders, her mind wanders.Solvitur ambulando: she’s not sure what exactly it is she’s trying to solve by walking, but the book’s as much an invigorating mental workout as it is a hard physical trudge.Memories surface, too, from childhood and adolescence: of a girl called Alice she knew who died in a “horrible accident” when Ashworth was 10 and whose photo she hid in a bottle; of her volunteering for the Samaritans as one of the women (Brendas,they were called) who’d listen on the phone to distressed or lonely callers, including men who’d masturbate as they talked; of how she returned to Preston from Cambridge University 34 weeks pregnant at the age of 21 and made it her home again. In her last nonfiction book,Notes Made While Falling, Ashworth devised a method that married narrative fragments with philosophising lyrical essays. Here the storyline is simpler – a walk, start to finish – but the method is much the same.Towards the end comes the threat of failure. She loses her balance and falls – no injury is sustained, but the dizziness feels ominous. Then a heatwave arrives, making the scheduled completion of the walk impossible. The complications gather to a major health crisis, closer to home than the one affecting Clive. Mercifully, there’s an upbeat outcome, adding another layer to the motif of care. The walk that the author saw “as a break from the labour of care turned out to be a path that led me deeper into understanding my own need for it”.“Not until we have lost the world do we begin to find ourselves,” Thoreau wrote. Ashworth didn’t walk 192 miles in order to find herself. But she’s newly conscious afterwards not of her stamina and sure-footedness but of her frailty, of how “my body is more fragmented and vulnerable than I wanted it to be”. Despite her guise as an “armoured little being stomping her way across the entire country”, she’s forced to embrace a new kind of gentleness. And rather than exulting in independence, she’s back among friends and freshly available to “the traffic of love”. Chastened but buoyant, she’s stimulating to be with, her book the best kind of walking companion.The Parallel Path: Love, Grit and Walking the North by Jenn Ashworth is published by Sceptre (£20).

Slap, Pound, BiteA game to get the blood up.Heart pumping. Skin singing.No breath or time to askWhose bodies are blanketed?Whose bodies blanked out?What are the odds white wins?Salt & Snowis the title of Naomi Foyle’s latest poetry collection. If they haven’t done so already, some judging committee somewhere should shortlist it for a significant prize. Impressively varied and agile in form, international in scope, Salt & Snow is as emotionally rich as it is politically alert, drawing strength from its predominant genre, the elegy.The “in memoriam” poems lament both individuals known privately to the poet, and public “names” including author and art critic John Berger, poet Lee Harwood and US police murder victim George Floyd. There is no significant difference in Foyle’s approach: what particularly distinguishes all the elegies is the depth of imaginative empathy brought to bear on the various lives and deaths. Foyle, who has recovered from cancer, writes not only from the awareness of death as an individual tragedy, especially when “untimely”, but as the common prospect of all organisms. Her visionary prose poem The Dark Earth concludes its life-enhancing list of fruits and flowers, and how to cultivate and eat them, with their horrific metamorphosis into dangerous threats: “Should they persist, hack with knives and machetes, chop down and string up, beat with bats, iron bars, hurl from tall towers, crush, burn, behead. Ditch their remains in the earth you call dirt.” This poem has an unusual dedication: “i.m. all those cut down due to their nature” and it expresses another essential theme of the collection, the political creation of the enemy who justifies the forces of destruction.This week’s poem adds “earth” to the “salt” and “snow” of the title and the title poem. The latter is one of the “public” elegies, written in memory ofArthur Labinjo-Hughes, the child who was “poisoned with salt” by his mother and whose death became an impossible subject of conversation: “Our silence / is a coverlet / of snow // on a looted grave – // white as salt.” These images are scattered across the book’s main section. Salt is especially significant and takes various forms: it’s the ammonium nitrate (“that white synthetic salt”) which exploded with devastating effect in a Beirut warehouse on 4 August 2020, and also a vital ingredient in the “bottle of Tajín” which George Floyd’s ex-girlfriend was keeping for the meal they hoped to share on their “first post-lockdown meet-up”.Snow, Salt, Earth initially enacts a process of stripping down. The symbolic substances are introduced in brief sentences, stating the effect of one upon the other,anaphoraemphasising the chant of a “game”. The effects are not necessarily negative: salt is useful for melting snow, snow may “slap” earth without destroying it, salt is vitally important to life. But the implicit metaphor of a relentless game develops in the tercet: “And so it goes, on and on and on / round and round in every shade of hand …” The hand then shape-shifts into various weapons: “— claw-teeth” (suggesting the cruelty of fingernails), “hard palm, fist —”. Now syntax is abandoned: the pace accelerates as the couplet divides, as if in a battle with itself, into a line of nouns and a line of verbs, percussive monosyllables belted out like punches. If this were a sonnet (I’m leaving the interpretation open), verse three would mark an upheaval of a “turn”. Subsequently the speaker, perhaps not wholly ironically, shows violence becoming exciting and addictive. Words are put together again, though not yet as full sentences: “A game to get the blood up. / Heart pumping. Skin singing.”Formal grammar restored, the questions there will be “no breath or time to ask” occupy the final tercet. It makes a clear distinction between the snow that “blankets” and somehow comforts a surface, and the snow that erases it, “blanks” it. That surface implicitly becomes a scene of annihilation: it may be a political arena in which the crimes of a state against its people are concealed and those who ask questions are disappeared. As if exhausted by what it has enacted, the poem now seems to drop a tone in pitch, into the angry sarcasm of despair: “What are the odds white wins?” The whiteness left on the page provides the only answer to the question.I was struck by the uncanny prescience of that line when I re-read the collection a few months ago. It was coincidentally after I’d watched the video ofthe confrontation between presidents Zelenskyy and Trumpover the future of Ukraine. Trump had told Zelenskyy, “You don’t have the cards right now”, and Zelenskyy replied: “We’re not playing cards.” “You’re gambling with World War Three,” Trump insisted. The memory of that snarling battle over a familiar metaphor immediately rose in my mind when I re-read Salt, Snow, Earth, giving the poem’s conclusion a strong additional thrust. This resonance persists with the daily reminders of the “gambling” element in missile-strikes, for instance, which are often not as predictable as claimed. The line has a further significance as a reminder of the “supremacist” racial assumptions behind war.Salt, Snow, Earth has been re-imagined as the compelling “poemfilm” below in a collaboration betweenRazia Aziz,Wendy Pyeandthe poet herself. Their work combines exciting vocal and instrumental sounds, brilliantly woven imagery and some stunning physical theatre.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The connection between death and day school is new girl Agata, the daughter of notoriously corrupt East End businessman Ezra Levy.Ezra, a man who takes phone calls from Putin, buys football clubs and has had people killed, wants more for Agata than he had when young. Her anorexia is killing her, and he, “fleshy and stupid”, can’t stop it. Gail sets her sights on Ezra: part compulsion, part seduction, an adolescent power game taken to dangerous conclusions.Gail’s mother, Dar, wants to make it clear that they are a very different sort of Jewish from Ezra. Ezra, Dar believes, is bad for Britain and bad for Jewish people. A pro-Palestinian activist for whom Israel is “a KICK ME sticker”, Dar isn’t sure about Ashkenazim (too much therapy, not enough booze) and “suspicious of Hassidim ... booking flights that took off on Saturdays so she’d never have to sit next to them”. Is Dar antisemitic? Gail worries she might be. And Dar worries about Gail all the time: the mother-daughter relationship is close, troubled and finely drawn.Precocious Gail is the kind of 16-year-old who writes long, thoughtful letters to George Michael. They begin simply – “Dear George … what exactly happens in cottaging?”– and progress, as Gail’s dangerous infatuation with Ezra builds, to “Dear George … I looked like a teenage girl in a pornographic magazine. He didn’t see that. But I did.” The one-sided nature of the correspondence evokes exactly the never-enough feeling of adolescence. The conceit is charming and funny, if a little underdeveloped.Precocious Gail writes long, thoughtful letters to George Michael. They begin simply: ‘Dear George … what exactly happens in cottaging?’The year is 2015 but, with minor tweaks, the novel could be set 10 years later or 50 before. Adolescence, and the hot, hungry nature of it, doesn’t change much. The teenage girl, in Forrest’s capable and unusual fifth novel, is a kind of bottomless pit of need – for desire, attention and the world to come. Agata, seriously ill, attempts to wrest back control from Ezra and her doting stepmother; Faith, Gail’s one-time lover and former best friend, breaks away from Gail by flirting with a whole cohort of teenage boys on Hampstead Heath; and Gail herself is unstoppable. “I fellated a Cypriot fruiterer at the apex of Parliament Hill,” begins her controversial essay.The teenage girl is also a thing mostly beyond adult understanding, and certainly beyond adult intervention, which here only serves to complicate matters further. This is a book that seeks to complicate everything it possibly can. From the sexual agency of teenage girls to bigotry among billionaires, mental illness, murder, protest, queerness, and the obviously thorny question of Israeli-Palestinian relations, Father Figure thrives as an exploration of grey areas. As a novelist, Forrest tends to reserve judgment: her characters are not likable, but they are tender. They feel things very deeply, and Forrest treats each one with distinction. You could never mistake them for anyone else.The same is true of Forrest’s prose, the rhythm always half a beat from where you think it will land. The overall effect is of a kind of faux-naivety, even a childlike desire to spell things out, to have clarity at all costs (“Faith swam back and forth between the child and the mother, unsure of who could better advance her needs, because she still didn’t know what her needs were”). And yet the contrast between this plain tell-don’t-show approach, and the complex nuances of Forrest’s plot, characters and morality systems creates a kind of literary twilight zone in which anything is possible. It feels like being told a story by a liar. Or by a precocious teenager.Forrest’s adolescent ventriloquism is a gift deployed powerfully here. Being able to avoid the school loos, for example, is a “more valuable talent than being able to hold your breath under water”; the only girl more unloved than Gail is “Fat Lilah”; the resentment of Gail for her mother is matched only by Dar’s desperation to understand her daughter. “Living in the era where mothers could track their children digitally,” Dar muses, “only made her daughter’s emotional secrecy more challenging to accept.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

This is fairly unexpected, but not at all unwelcome. A plot! In a literary coming-of-age story! Nothing, in Forrest’s writing, is ever simple. Things are deceptive, untidy and uneasy – and happen when you least expect it. Actions have consequences, and those consequences can change the shape of everything – which is, I suppose, always the true lesson of adolescence. And the true, tricky, slippery lesson of Forrest’s novel.Father Figure by Emma Forrest is published by W&N (£18.99). To support the Guardian buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

While there had been books with gay themes, his is widely recognised as the first novel in the region to put a gay character at the heart of the story.“The absence wasn’t just literary; it was societal,” Dibia says. “Queer people were living, loving, suffering, surviving – but largely rendered invisible or spoken of in hushed tones, if at all. That silence felt violent. It felt like erasure.“Literature has the power to name what society refuses to see. Walking With Shadows was my small attempt to do that,” he adds.Initially, some publishers refused to touch the novel, considering it too controversial. Others suggested he rewrite the ending, either making the character renounce his homosexuality or killing him. When the book was finally published, Dibia was called names. He lost friends and was blacklisted from certain literary spaces. He was invited to events, only to later be uninvited once the organisers realised who he was and what he had written.Literature has the power to name what society refuses to see. Walking With Shadows was my small attempt to do thatJude DibiaDibia’s novel is widely recognised as the first Nigerian book to depict queerness with depth and empathy. It tells the story of Ebele “Adrian” Njoku who has buried his sexuality in the past, become a husband and a father, but who has to confront who he really is when a co-worker informs his wife that he is gay.Ainehi Edoro, associate professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and founder of the literary blogBrittle Paper, says the novel marked a turning point. “For a long time, queer characters in African literature were either invisible or treated as symbols of crisis, like their presence was a sign that something had gone wrong,” she says. “So when Dibia wrote a novel that centred a gay Nigerian man as a full human being, that mattered. He pushed back against an entire archive of erasure.”The book, which turned 20 this year, was published by Blacksands in 2005 and republished in 2011 by Jalaa Writers’ Collective. In 2019, it wasadapted for the screenby Oya Media and a special film edition was released.View image in fullscreenA scene from the 2019 film version of Walking With Shadows, based on the novel.But the initial backlash Walking with Shadows faced has not entirely disappeared, says Dibia. “Some still view the book as too controversial, too political, too queer. But I’ve made peace with that. If a story makes people uncomfortable because it tells the truth, then perhaps discomfort is the first step toward awareness.”Dibia was forced to leave Nigeria and now lives in Sweden after theSame Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, a law that criminalises homosexuality, was passed in January 2014, fearing he might become a target for his writing.Since the publication of Walking With Shadows, an increasing number of books with queer characters at the heart of them have been published in West Africa and, specifically, Nigeria. There have been a slew of firsts: Chinelo Okparanta’s Under the Udala Trees (2015) was the first novel to focus on lesbianism; Romeo Oriogun’s Burnt Men (2016) was the first queer poetry book; Chike Frankie Edozien’s Lives of Great Men: Living and Loving as an African Gay Man (2017), the first gay memoir; Unoma Azuah’s Embracing My Shadows: Growing Up Lesbian in Nigeria (2020), the first lesbian memoir.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All these years later, it [Walking with Shadows] still is for me a guiding light.”For the British-Nigerian gay rights activist Bisi Alimi, the book was liberating the moment he laid hands on it. “Prior to that day, I had never really read any book as personal and relatable as that. Jude and the book did something to me,” he says.The writer and researcher Ayodele Olofintuade had a similar experience. “The book came as it is, creating a new genre, queer literature,” she says. “Encountering the novel about two years post-publication was a shift in reality for me. Walking with Shadows is a roadmap of what is possible.”Dibia’s deepest satisfaction comes from readers all over the world who say that Adrian’s story helps them feel seen. He sometimes wishes, however, that he had been better prepared for, and protected against, the fallout. “But then again, maybe part of the novel’s power comes from the fact that it was written without armour,” he says. “I don’t regret writing it. I only regret the climate that made it feel dangerous to tell the truth.”Today, Dibia still hopes people see the book as an act of courage and, more importantly, an act of care. Likewise, 20 years from now, he hopes the novel will still feel relevant yet like a historical document of a time outgrown.‘[I hope it] becomes a reminder of what silence cost us, and how far we’ve come,’ he says.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentNigeriaAfricaLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was 54.Warner accidentally drowned off the coast of Cocles beach near Limón, Costa Rica, on Saturday afternoon, local police confirmed toABC News. The alert stated that two men were swept out to sea by high currents; one man was rescued and brought to a hospital in critical condition; Warner was recovered on Sunday, according to the Costa Rican outletLa Teja, citing Costa Rican Red Cross officials.The actor played Theo Huxtable, the only son ofBill Cosby’s patriarch Cliff Huxtable, on the seminal NBC sitcom from 1984 until 1992, earning one Emmy nomination. Warner went on to star alongside Eddie Griffin in the sitcom Malcom & Eddie from 1996 until 2000, and became an executive producer and voice actor on the beloved educational children’s series the Magic School Bus.He also starred as Alex Reed opposite Tracee-Ellis Ross on the BET show Reed Between the Lines, from 2011 until 2015. He often guest-starred on television, with credits on shows such as Major Crimes, Suits, The Resident, 9-1-1, and Alert: Missing Persons Unit.Born and raised in Jersey City, New Jersey, Warner attended performing arts high school in New York City before his big break on the Cosby Show. He auditioned for the role of Theo on the final day of a nationwide search. During his tenure on the popular sitcom, Warner trained as a director, and went on to direct numerous music videos for the likes of New Edition and others, as well as episodes of sitcoms such as the Cosby Show, Kenan & Kel and Malcolm & Eddie. A poet and a musician, Warner won a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance in 2015, and was nominated for best spoken word poetry album in 2023.Warner continued to defend the Cosby Show’s legacy as a groundbreaking portrayal of a Black American family on television, though he acknowledged the show’s reputation had changed afterBill Cosbywas convicted of sexual assault in 2018 (the conviction was later overturned on a technicality in 2021). More than 60 women have accused Cosby of violations from sexual harassment to rape, often involving a pattern of drugging to incapacitation.“I know I can speak for all of the cast when I say the Cosby Show is something that we are still very proud of,” he told People in 2023. “Regardless of how some people may feel about the show now, I’m still proud of the legacy and having been a part of such an iconic show that had such a profound impact on – first and foremost, Black culture – but also American culture,” Warner said.Most recently, he started hosting his own podcast, Not All Hood, whose latest episode dropped just three days ago. The show was the place where he could be “the most vulnerable”, he toldPeople.“When we talk about the Black community, we tend to speak of it as a monolith when the reality is there are so many different facets of the Black community, and we wanted to have a space where we can really explore, discuss, and acknowledge all of those different aspects,” he added.Warner is survived by a wife and daughter, whose identities he never revealed publicly.Tributes were paid on social media from across the industry, including from former colleague Tracee Ellis Ross. “What an actor and friend you were: warm, gentle, present, kind, thoughtful, deep, funny, elegant,” shewroteon Instagram. “You made the world a brighter place. Sending so much love to your family. I’m so sorry for this unimaginable loss.”On X, the former NBA star Earvin “Magic” Johnson said that he and his wife were sad to hear of the death of their friend. “We were both super fans of the hit ‘Cosby Show’ and continued to follow his career on shows like ‘Malcolm and Eddie’ and ‘The Resident’,” he wrote. “Every time I ran into Malcolm, we would have deep and fun conversations about basketball, life, and business. He will truly be missed.”The Guardian has reached out to Warner’s representatives for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTelevisionBlack US culturenewsShareReuse this content"

She will play a film-maker arriving in Paris for fashion week, following her role as Maria Callas in last year’s Netflix biopic Maria. Winocour previously premiered the Eva Green-led sci-fi film Proxima at the festival.Ronan, who was last seen in the alcoholism dramaThe Outrunand Steve McQueen’s Blitz, will lead the Bristol-set comedy thriller Bad Apples, playing a teacher forced into drastic lengths while dealing with a particularly troubling 11-year-old. The official synopsis promises “uneasy laughs” and a “provocative” tone.Reeves will leadAziz Ansari’s directorial debut, Good Fortune, as an angel who engineers a body swap between a poor and a rich man, played by Ansari and Seth Rogen, respectively. Ansari has said he hopes the film helps to resurrect the theatrically released R-rated comedy. “Aziz is great,” Reeves toldEntertainment Weekly. “A great writer, director, actor. I had such a fantastic experience working with him.”Toronto will also see directorial debuts from actors James McAvoy, Brian Cox and Euphoria’s Maude Apatow, daughter of Judd Apatow. McAvoy directed California Schemin’, based on the true story of Scottish rappers pretending to be American, Cox has helmed Glenrothan, a drama described as a “love letter to Scotland”, and Apatow is behind Poetic License, a comedy starring her mother Leslie Mann.The festival will also see the world premiere of Christy, a biopic of the groundbreaking female boxer Christy Martin starring Sydney Sweeney. The film, from the Animal Kingdom director David Michôd, will cover Martin’s rise in the 1990s and then later her husband’s attempt to murder her. “Our film is a wild mix of inspiring underdog sports-world story and personal saga,” Michôd said toW Magazine. “Sydney trained her butt off to play the part. The beauty of Sydney is that she turned up to work every day with her tail wagging, ready to go. No matter how tough it was, she was like a ray of sunshine.”Other true stories premiering include the 1930s-set Palestine 36 about a Palestinian uprising against colonial British rule, the historical drama Nuremberg starring Rami Malek and Russell Crowe, Agnieszka Holland’s Franz Kafka biopic Franz, Swiped which stars Lily James as the founder of the dating app Bumble and Paul Greengrass’s previously announced survival thriller The Lost Bus, which stars Matthew McConaughey as a schoolbus driver trying to save children from the deadly 2018 Camp fire in California.Premieres that had also already been announced before Monday include Rian Johnson’s much-anticipated Knives Out sequelWake Up Dead Man, which brings back Daniel Craig and adds Josh O’Connor, Glenn Close and Mila Kunis, the buzzy Brendan Fraser-led comedy drama Rental Family from Beef director Hikari, the Blue Valentine director Derek Cianfrance’s Roofman with Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, Nicholas Hytner’s period comedy The Choral starring Ralph Fiennes and based on an original Alan Bennett script and Steven Soderbergh’s dark comedy The Christophers with Michaela Coel, Ian McKellen and Baby Reindeer breakout Jessica Gunning.Chris Evans will also play a movie star abducted by a group of radicals in Sacrifice, an action comedy also starring Anya Taylor-Joy, Salma Hayek, John Malkovich and Charli xcx. Director Bobby Farrelly, known for co-directing hit films such as There’s Something About Mary, will unveil Driver’s Ed, a new comedy starring the White Lotus breakout Sam Nivola.Aaron Taylor-Johnsonand Theo James will also headline the heist thriller Fuze from the Scottish director David Mackenzie.Other notable premieres include the offbeat romantic comedy Eternity with Elizabeth Olsen and Miles Teller, mystery thriller The Ugly from Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho and Easy’s Waltz from True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto with Al Pacino and Vince Vaughn.Documentaries set to premiere include Baz Luhrmann’s EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert and films about subjects such as John Candy, teen series Degrassi and music festival Lilith Fair.The festival takes place from the 4 to 14 September.Explore more on these topicsToronto film festivalAngelina JolieFestivalsSaoirse RonanKeanu ReevesAziz AnsariAnya Taylor-JoynewsShareReuse this content"

As the Opry strikes out for London, can it stay relevant for another century?Jewly HightMon 21 Jul 2025 09.46 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 09.55 EDTShareIt’s the only American radio show that’s been on the air for 100 years, an institution that launched the country music industry as we know it and a stage production that made country fans flock toNashvillein the first place – and keeps them coming for a singular experience today. “I somehow understood the weight of what I was stepping into,” says Marty Stuart of the Grand Ole Opry, specifically the first night he played in 1972 as a mandolin-playing prodigy sitting in with bluegrass star Lester Flatt’s band.Stuart went on to become a country star, and Opry member, himself, and has now embraced the role of elder on the show: on 26 September, he along with Luke Combs, Darius Rucker, Ashley McBryde and Carly Pearce will take part in the Opry’s first-ever overseas broadcast at the Royal Albert Hall, as part of a year-long 100th birthday celebration. “A hundred years of anything, especially in show business, it’s just unheard of,” he marvels.View image in fullscreen‘A rhinestone-wearin’ country rock’n’roller’ … Marty Stuart in 1982.Photograph: Jim McGuire/courtesy Grand Ole OpryIt has been a centrepiece in Stuart’s life for most of his 66 years: as a kid in small town Mississippi in the 1960s, he listened to Opry radio broadcasts from Nashville. By the early 90s, he was scoring hits as “a rhinestone-wearin’ country rock’n’roller”, and the Opry’s longtime legends – particularly fiddling balladeer Roy Acuff and comic personality Minnie Pearl – were nearing the end of their lives. Stuart sought their approval: “They had spent their lives building that institution, and I wanted to know that I was on the good side of the line with both of those folks.” Both did give him their blessing, but Pearl made him sweat first. She looked right past the armful of white roses he brought her, critiqued his attire – “Look at those tight pants!” – and admonished him to maintain the Opry’s good image.He kept the pants, but took her wishes to heart, and the basics of a night at the Opry’s downhome variety show have remained much the same. “It is not, on paper, the makings of a successful show,”laughs Dan Rogers, the Opry’s executive producer.Recorded and broadcast live in front of an audience, announcers project a mixture of folksy intimacy and professionalism as they welcome everyone, read sponsor ad messages and introduce world-class performers who do a few songs each, prioritising old chestnuts that they know fans want to hear. Any given night, the lineup may include mainstream country stars of the present and the distant past, bluegrass bands, gospel vocal groups, singer-songwriters, hotshot instrumentalists, down-home comedians, square dancers and more. Lineups often span several generations and are often described as one big family: back in March, the Opry’s most veteran member, 87-year-old Bill Anderson, appeared the same night that Stuart and his band the Fabulous Superlatives backed his bassist’s rockabilly obsessed, 10-year-old son.View image in fullscreenSouvenir programme from 1974.Photograph: Blank Archives/Getty ImagesThe Opry has absorbed a century’s worth of technological, musical and cultural evolution at a very measured pace. Its leadership has apologised for employing blackface duos in its early days; its traditional barn backdrop is now comprised of video walls and its stage has welcomed artists bringing hip-hop, gen-Z folk and TikTok virality to the genre. “You have to evolve,” says Rogers. “It’s a must for survival and for creating really interesting shows – but you do it in a way that’s really respectful of this institution.” Today, membership of the Opry, awarded to a small cadre of musicians – just 76 living artists – has become one of the industry’s greatest honours.The Opry was originally almost incidental programming on a radio station, WSM, launched in 1925 by National Life and Accident, a Nashville insurance company looking to promote its business. Station managers filled the airwaves with a hodgepodge of locally available acts, professional or not, and people soon began showing up to watch the broadcast. “It was a matter of: let’s see who we can get to come in here,” says historian Brenda Colladay, a longtime curator of the Opry’s collections who has helped to research a thorough 100th anniversary book.There was no such genre as country music when the show launched, just regionally specific versions of old-time music, dance tunes and folk songs. Over time, the sheer variety of performers featured in Opry lineups helped forge a cohesive identity out of those disparate styles, fundamentally shaping how we understand country.Alongside light classical fare were acts such as Uncle Dave Macon, a banjo-playing vaudevillian, and DeFord Bailey, a young Black harmonica wizard whose family string band had long played area dances. The Opry was essentially a barn dance on the radio, an already popular concept – they poached their master of ceremonies George D Hay from a rival show in Chicago.But the Opry initially faced local opposition from upper-class residents who fancied Nashville “the Athens of the South”, complete with a replica of the Parthenon, then under construction. “It made some people ashamed that [Nashville was] associated with hillbilly music,” Colladay says, including Tennessee governor Prentice Cooper who declined an invitation to attend an Opry celebration: “He felt like it was really hurting Nashville’s reputation.” Cooper was vastly outnumbered by the listeners who heard themselves in the show. As it went nationwide, it developed a massive, devoted following among rural and small-town listeners, as well as southerners who had migrated to industrialised cities. It got so popular that National Life and Accident executives got annoyed with rowdy fans clamouring to watch the live broadcasts at the company offices, and the Opry eventually moved to Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium in 1943.By then, it was no longer free to get in, and WSM had established an in-house booking agency that sent performers on the road. Staff and stars saw opportunities to capitalise on the show’s dominance in other ways, starting a recording studio, music publishing houses and enough other businesses to entice New York-based record labels to set up local operations. The presence of the Opry ensured that Nashville became home to the emerging, professionalised country music industry.View image in fullscreenMarty Stuart performing with Lester Flatt and band at the Ryman Auditorium in 1973.Photograph: Les Leverett/courtesy Grand Ole OpryIt was where the thrillingly hard-driving new style of bluegrass was fleshed out, and where honky-tonk singers and folk-friendly troubadours alike found a home, but the show was sometimes too cautious to embrace trends. Take Elvis Presley: when he wasn’t invited back after his first Opry appearance, he moved on to a rival show in Louisiana. Stuart says the Opry might occasionally overcorrect, and points to its early-80s focus on the slick “urban cowboy” movement: “From time to time, I would tune in to the Opry, and when they introduced somebody, I kind of knew what song they were about to sing and what joke they were going to tell. It was a little weary.”Splashy additions like the Opryland theme park and regularly televised broadcasts on the Nashville Network brought in new listeners, as did the 2010s TV drama Nashville, set in the city’s country songwriting scene. But because the Opry was home to many generations of performers at once, there were times when some of the dedicated members felt they were denied opportunities to appear – Stonewall Jackson brought an age discrimination lawsuit, which was settled with undisclosed terms. And of more than 230 acts granted membership over the years only two Black country stars, the late Charley Pride and Darius Rucker, have been inducted since Bailey – and Bailey was fired during a copyright-related dispute in 1941, an injustice the Opry recently apologised for.But Rogers reports that for the last few years a double digit percentage of Opry’s performers have been artists of colour, making it much more diverse than contemporary country radio; according to leading researcher Dr Jada Watson, radio devoted less than 3% of its spins to artists of colour in 2024, despite Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter coming out that year. Rogers’ team began tracking performer demographics internally a few years back, “because it is right for this community and right for this show”.Equal Access, a DEI programme that helps businesspeople and music-makers of underrepresented identities navigate the country music industry, has forged a friendly relationship with the Opry. Programme manager Chantrel Reynolds says she and her colleagues made sure it was a safe space for discussing the Opry’s complex history with race before they began arranging visits with Opry leadership, and she finds that acknowledgment refreshingly “different from a lot of spaces” in country music. The Opry, she says, is “actively trying to programme these things, not just in Black History Month, but all year round”.View image in fullscreen‘They’re making a very intentional effort to change’ … Angie K.Photograph: Tammie Arroyo/AFF-USA/ShutterstockWith the help of Equal Access, contemporary country artist Angie K got her first chance to play the Opry last year. “I was the first person from El Salvador to play that stage,” she says. “I needed to be not just good – I have to be great, so great that they think, ‘We need to do this again with another Latin artist.’” She had scoured Opry history for predecessors who are queer and Hispanic like she is.“I’m very aware that there’s not many. What I love about the Opry is there’s still room to grow – they’re making a very intentional effort to change.”On the show, she sang originals addressing women as romantic interests, and she was “very grateful that a lot of people came up and said, ‘I’m so happy that you said those pronouns.’” For his part, Stuart marvels at how the Opry always finds its way back to varied vitality after weathering all manner of growing pains: “The thing that the history books tell me is that every institution goes through that from time to time”.The Opry expects decorum: there’s no alcohol backstage, just tea and lemonade, and in keeping with Federal Communications Commission rules, no cursing on stage. But Rogers sometimes dispenses reassurance to first-time performers who assume they should be at their most traditionalist. “That crowd out there is really full of all kinds of people, all walks of life,” he tells them. “Bring what you do to this stage. We wouldn’t have invited you to be on this stage if we weren’t up for what you bring.”Grand Ole Opry: Live in Londonis at Royal Albert Hall, London, Friday 26 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsCountryNashvillefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And it’s no wonder – as many as54% of us are habitual knuckle crackers, regularly making those distinctive popping noises as we manipulate the joints.“The knuckle joint is a very tight space and there’s a little bit of fluid in it. When people crack their knuckles, they very temporarily enlarge the space,” says Hyrich. “The pressure drops and gas that’s dissolved in that fluid forms bubbles – and it’s the bursting of those bubbles that causes the sound.”The type of arthritis people tend to worry about is osteoarthritis – the most common form. It’s a painful condition that causes swelling and stiffness in the joints, and becomes more common as we age. “We don’t fully understand the cause,” Hyrich says, “but genetics play a large role. Joint trauma is also a risk factor.”It’s probably this association with injury that fuels concerns about knuckle-cracking. “People are likely worried they’re damaging the joint,” she says.But is there any actual harm? According to Hyrich, the evidence says no. “Researchershave looked at people with and without arthritis and asked whether they cracked their knuckles – there’s been no difference.Othershave compared people who do and don’t crack their knuckles using X-rays – again, no difference.”Perhaps the mostfamous exampleis a US physician who, in an effort to prove his mother wrong, cracked the knuckles on just one hand every day for over 60 years. When he finally had both hands assessed, there were no signs of arthritis in either.So what kinds of trauma do increase your risk of osteoarthritis? “Sporting injuries,” Hyrich says, “such as breaking a bone near your joint, or tearing ligaments.” People who already have another kind of arthritis, such as the autoimmune condition rheumatoid arthritis, are also more prone to osteoarthritis.Her best advice for avoiding it? “Maintain a healthy lifestyle, stay active, and keep to a healthy weight.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …HealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m living with saturated walls, dripping water and falling plaster because the council has failed to address a leakthat began elsewhere in the block a year ago.When I first reported it, contractors made a large opening in my kitchen wall to inspect a service ductthat contains plumbing for10 flats. The hole has never been made good and is now crawling with insects.The council’s plumbers have, over time, identified the possible source in various flats, stuck cards through the door asking the resident to get in touch, stuck more cards through when they got noresponse, and then decided the leak was coming from a different floor.I’ve been diagnosed with bladdercancer, and given the deteriorating condition of my homeand the impact on my mental and physical health, I asked for the leak to be redesignated as an emergency, but this was refused.CA, LondonThe photo you sent of your kitchen is horrifying. A substantial section of wall around the inspection hole made by the contractors is soaked, discoloured and crumbling. Mouldy debris is scattered along its base. These are hazardous conditions for anyone to endure, let alone a 91-year-old recovering from cancer treatment.It was January when you first contacted me. I first asked Giles Peaker, a partner at Anthony Gold Solicitors, to clarify where a council’s responsibilities to leaseholders begin and end.He confirmed that Wandsworth council should be responsible for communal areas and structures, including plumbing, and for all tenanted flats, and that it should have a right of access to tenanted and leasehold flats to carry out repairs to these parts.If the leak were in a leasehold flat, the council would most likely have powers to oblige the occupier to repair it, or else revoke the lease. Repairs should be carried out within a reasonable time.Despite this, the council blamed the delay on “access difficulties” when I questioned its inertia. It told me it had since discovered the leak in a leasehold flat but had to await an asbestos test before it could be tackled. Yet it had told you, seven weeks previously, that an asbestos test had been completed.It ignored my questions about the discrepancy but told you its earlier assertion about the test being carried out was mistaken. Three weeks after my contact, you were then told the leak was not where it was supposed to be after all, and so the waiting game continued.The council declined to explain why an exploratory camera could not be inserted into the communal duct through the opening in your kitchen, which has already been declared asbestos free. For the next three months, you and I repeatedly chased the council for updates.By May the leak had finally been identified in a tenanted flat and repaired. At this point Wandsworth offered to repair the damage to your flat and installed a dehumidifier but you, understandably suspicious of its timescales, decided to do the repairs through your insurer. You are still waiting for the area to dry out before repairs can begin.The council says: “We have spoken to the resident to apologise for the delay and he has accepted an offer of £400 compensation for the stress and inconvenience caused. We will be reviewing our processes to ensure this does not happen again.” You say: “I think that the council employees with whom I have dealt have tried to help under a system that simply doesn’t work, having no built-in imperative to get anything done.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

I expected to hear about the fiesta we witnessed in the heat of Tarifa, Spain, or be berated for the time I booked early flights to Crete, leaving us sitting in the waiting room of a resort from 4am until check-in time.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I was greatly amused (and slightly relieved), then, to hear my son say: “Our summer books – that time we collected all those random things, took them home and stuck them into a book.” He was delighted that we’ve kept them.My daughter said: “Soup on the beach.” We’d stayed on the Isles of Scilly (one of our favourite destinations), and had promised them a bonfire next to the sea on our last night. Of course, by the time we got around to it, night was falling – and with it the temperature – and poor four-year-old Lulu got tired and cold. We wrapped her in a blanket, propped her on a rock and gave her a mug of bonfire-heated tinned soup – and watched as the colour sprang back into her cheeks.Making memoriesThe point of this (rather sentimental) reminiscing is to show that you don’t need expensive foreign holidays or trips to amusement parks for your children to have a good summer. It’s the low-key moments that tend to stay with us – and they can be as simple as a fun craft activity or a makeshift meal under the stars. Sure, lazing on a beach in the Algarve for a week or two is what keeps parents going through the winter months, but the 4am start for the ferry or the queues at passport control can start to undo the benefits of a holiday.If you’re looking for ways to entertain your children during the holidays but sadly can’t just down tools and take the day off, readour guide to the summer holidays.

Perfect for a celebratory summer dinner for two and easy to scale up to cater for more guests – just use a really big tray for the vegetables and a second one for as many trout fillets as you need. And if you’d like to veganise the dish, just use big triangles of firm tofu instead of the trout, and cook everything together for half an hour.Miso trout with aubergine, pak choi and peanutsPrep15 minCook30 minServes21 large aubergine, halved lengthways, then cut into 1cm-thick slices2 tbsp sesame oil5 tsp miso paste(red or white) – a gluten-free one, if need be2 sustainably-sourced trout fillets2 heaped tbsp salted peanuts, chopped2 pak choi, quarteredJuice of 1 limeFlaky sea salt, to taste1 red chilli, stalk discarded, flesh finely chopped (discard the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)2 spring onions, trimmed and finely slicedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Tip the aubergine slices into a roasting tin large enough to hold them all in a single layer, then add the sesame oil and three teaspoons of the miso paste. Using your hands, mix well to coat the slices, then roast for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, spread each trout fillet with a teaspoon of the remaining miso paste, then scatter the chopped peanuts on top. Once the aubergines have had 20 minutes, add the pak choi to the tin and gently stir through the aubergines to pick up the flavoured oil; add a little more sesame oil, if need be. Make some space in the mix for the fish, lay in the fillets, then return to the oven for 10 minutes, until the fish is just cooked through (trout fillets tend to be so thin that they cook to my liking in 10 minutes, but if yours are thicker, go for 12-15 minutes).Once out of the oven, dress the vegetables with the lime juice and a little sea salt, if needed, scatter over the sliced chilli and spring onions, and serve hot.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

The tidbit spread over social media, cementing the33-year-old democratic socialist’s status as a millennial everyman. A subsequent Cosmopolitan headlineread: “Zohran Mamdani could make history (as the first NYC mayor to meet his wife on Hinge).”Representatives for Hinge would not comment, but plenty of eligible New Yorkers did, claiming they would redownload the app due to Mamdani’s success, in spite of theirdating fatigue. “Now I’m clocking in like it’s a full-time job,” one userpostedon TikTok. “If he can find love on that app maybe I can,” anotherwrotein a caption.However, they could run into an ideological hurdle while filling out their profiles.

She said that Mamdani’s victory reinvigorated the dating scene in in the city, “but it’s really hard to find explicitly leftist dating spaces. Most dating apps have a liberal option, but no leftist option, and it’s not a turn-on to see ‘other’, because that could mean anything.” (For instance, far-right or communist.)So lefty singles are finding more explicit ways to signal their politics to like-minded love matches, on Hinge and beyond.View image in fullscreen‘There’s a nice feeling on the apps right now with people being proud to be communists or leftists,’ said Caroline, 38, who lives in Queens.Photograph: oatawa/Getty Images/iStockphotoSome have turned their dating profiles into mini-manifestos, writing out their entire belief system as answers to the apps’ prompts. It’s common to see watermelon emojis aseuphemisms for solidaritywith the Palestinian people. Some users will warn that they’ll swipe left on Terfs (the acronym for trans-exclusionary radical feminists), cops or Donald Trump supporters.“It’s important for me to see those signifiers,” said Caroline, a 38-year-old florist who lives in Queens. (She and other sources are going by their first name for privacy reasons.) “There’s a nice feeling on the apps right now with people being proud to be communists or leftists, and they’re saying that.”But she’s wary of anyone who comes off astoolefty. “That seems kind of tryhard,” she said. “It can read as too performative, that you’re fishing for alt-girls or you’re a centrist who just wants someone freaky fromBushwick.”Tinder, OK Cupid and the kink-friendly app Feeld allow users to write their own bios, unlike Hinge, and they can choose within those bios whether they reveal their political affiliations. In the lead-up to the 2024 election,Tinderalso launched profile “stickers” so users could signal the issues they felt strongly about, such as “voting for reproductive rights”.For her part, Caroline, who uses Feeld, wrote in her profile that she’s “far left” and “COVID-cautious”. That feels like enough for her. “Saying ‘I love vaccines!’, ‘free Palestine!’ or ‘fuck Trump!’ would be trite. It’s all implied.”Dennis Mulvena describes himself as “very left-leaning”. He used to keep his affiliations private on Hinge because he believed there was room for nuance in discussing politics, but recently listed himself as liberal.“With the return of Trump in the last two years, it’s important to have that out there,” said Mulvena, 30, who works in customer service for a car manufacturer. “Admittedly gay people who live in Brooklyn tend to lean left, but I have had the experience of going on a date with someone who then revealed he was part of his college’s Young Republicans club.” That was the last time he assumed that everyone he matched with would share the same views as him.According to anNBC News pollfrom April, the partisan gap between gen Z women, who are more likely to say they are Democrat, and gen Z men, who have shifted right, is the widest of all generations. And, increasingly, a person’s politics have an impact on their perceived desirability. While past generations may have thought nothing about a conservative and liberal romantic pairing (“don’t talk about politics or religion at the dinner table”), 60% of 18- to 24-year-oldsthinkit’s important to date or marry someone who shares their political beliefs.“Politics is the new religion,” said Dr Jess Carbino, a former sociologist for Bumble and Tinder who studies dating apps. “It’s become the way that people choose to frame how they look at the world and their values.”There’s definitely an energy when I wear my Zohran T-shirt out [...] It’s a real conversation starterLaurenLily, a 23 year-old socialist who was recently laid off, is wary of seeing someone identify as “not political” on Hinge. “I’m immediately scared of what that means,” they said. “As a queer person living through everything that’s happening in this country, I need to know someone has a baseline care for people and their community.”In New York, more voters between the ages of 25 and 34 – a mix of gen Z and younger millennials –turned out to votein the Democratic primary than any other age cohort, indicating a vigor for leftist politics. Recently, Lily has seen young people write on Hinge that they’d only go out with someone who voted for Mamdani or that they’d never go out with a Cuomo supporter. They have seen multiple people answer the Hinge prompt “when was the last time you cried?” with: “when Zohran won”. (They presume these were happy tears.)This is not to say New York is a young Bolshevik paradise: conservatives in the city are also trying to find each other. Some have gone into voluntary exile from mainstream dating apps, creating their own options. “Our dating apps have gone woke,” reads the description forDate Right Stuff, one such app backed by Peter Thiel. “Connect with people who aren’t offended by everything.”In March, Date Right Stuffhosteda singles event at New York’s Trump Tower called “make America hot again”. It was a coming-out night for what the app’s former chief marketing officer Raquel Debono called “city conservatives”, or Republicans who prefer urban life to small towns and tradwifedom.They are not the only ones going off-app: the Mamdani effect on New York’s lefties could not be contained to Hinge.‘I’m not interested in someone passive about Gaza’: how views on the war have changed dating in AmericaRead moreIn early July, young people gathered inside a cocktail bar on the Lower East Side for a “sexy socialist singles” event hosted by New York’s DSA. Those looking for something casual – or, as the host put it, “if you just want fast and free, like Zohran’s buses” – were sent to one part of the bar, while those who wanted “a slow burn, like taxing the fucking rich” went to another. At one point, organizers directed polyamorous attendees to a room upstairs, where they could mingle with other non-monogamous individuals.Upstairs, Sven, 25, an economics master’s student who lives in Bushwick, said that young people view the DSA as a social club just as much as a platform for socialist candidates. “I saw a post on Reddit talking about how allZohran’s canvassers are hot, and we have soccer leagues and book clubs,” they said. “It’s a great way to make friends.”Downstairs, back in monogamyville, Lauren, a video editor who lives in Astoria (the Queens neighborhood Mamdani represents as a New York assemblymember), waited for a friend who was off flirting. “There’s definitely an energy when I wear my Zohran T-shirt out,” she said. “People are revved up. They’ll call you from across the street saying, ‘What’s up?’ or ‘I love that guy.’ It’s a real conversation starter.”New York’s DSA will continue its sexy socialist mixers in youth hubs Bushwick and Williamsburg, and in the Upper West Side for those over 30. In the meantime, singles will have to keep parsing political signifiers on dating apps.Explore more on these topicsDatingOnline datingNew YorkZohran MamdaniTinderUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So I pedal moderately while the football is on, and sprint during the ad breaks. I’ve never had more energyRhys ThomasMon 21 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShareEver since a nasty concussion stopped me playing rugby when I was 18, I struggled to exercise regularly. I tried plenty of workouts, dabbling in everything from CrossFit to Zumba. While some were more enjoyable than others, I hadn’t found a way to keep a consistent, disciplined regime without it feeling like a chore. I’m 28 now and work from home. My commute from bed to desk is 15 steps. Given the health risks of sedentary lifestyles, I had tried just about everything to break my lazy rut, and then something worked: watching television.Well, OK, not just watching television like a modern Jim Royle, who reached Olympic levels in The Royle Family, but I imposed a rule: if I want to watch TV, I have to do so while sitting on my exercise bike (the one cardio exercise I can tolerate). The result? I’ve been cycling roughly six hours a week for months now. Generally, I watch a lot of sports: if there’s football, rugby, tennis, boxing, NFL or cricket on, I’ll watch it. So invariably through the year I find there’s roughly two hours of sport on three times a week I want to watch. By combining this with exercise, I find I am able to do so without feeling guilty.Most of the sports I watch have intervals, so I tend to cycle moderately during the action and then start to pedal my way quickly through another Jamie Carragher tirade or some inane ad breaks. I usually burn about 500 calories during a two-hour session. Sometimes my drink of choice while I cycle might even be a non-alcoholic beer. Bliss.I used to feel exercise was a waste of time, like being a hamster on a wheel, spinning and doing very little. But the benefits of consistent exercise have been pretty amazing for me. It has helped me to reach a level of fitness where I feel less anxious about going to the gym, but I also reap the mental health benefits of sticking to a routine and enjoying the aches days after I push myself a little harder than before (a masochistic hangover from my rugby days).The one change that worked:  I was such a fussy eater, it limited me – now I try one new dish a week to reduce my food fearRead moreSure, there are some days when staying on the bike is more of a slog than others, if there’s a particularly boring match on or the wifi decides to be dodgy. But by that point I’m already there and something in me decides I might as well keep going. It’s almost as though this hamster wheel now energises me instead of dragging me down.More recently, I have found that passively exercising while actively doing something I enjoy is a wider magic formula. Listening to podcasts while I take my time doing various sets of weights is my latest endeavour. They say that incremental changes are the most effective, and building up an exercise regime by watching television has worked. It has helped me to feel happier and healthier.Explore more on these topicsFitnessThe one change that workedHealth & wellbeingCyclingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a little before 7pm, and as the carriages hummed past I felt a rush of joy, like celebrity trainspotterFrancis Bourgeois, but without the GoPro on my forehead. For more than three years I’ve been documenting the renaissance of sleeper trains, and I’d wondered if I might one day tire of them. But the thrill seems only to intensify each time I embark on another nocturnal adventure, this time with my two daughters – aged eight and five – who were already arguing over the top berth. The first four carriages were designated for travellers to the Italian port city of La Spezia, the other seven carrying on to Roma Tiburtina, where we would alight at 10am. Once in Rome we had 24 hours to eat classic carbonara, dark chocolate gelato, and bike around the Villa Borghese before taking a train to Florence.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) has played the lead role in resuscitating Europe’s night trains. Towards the end of 2016, ÖBB launched its Nightjet network on 14 routes, using old rolling stock it bought from Deutsche Bahn. Then, to the delight of train nerds like me, it launched a brand-new fleet at the end of 2023, and now operates 20 routes across Europe. We were now on board this high-spec service, which smelled of freshly unpacked furniture, the carpets soft underfoot, the lighting adjustable to disco hues of neon blue and punk pink.We were booked into a couchette carriage, which mostly comprisesd mini cabins designed for solo travellers preferring privacy. Placing shoes and small bags in lockers, passengers can open a metal door with a keycard and crawl into their single berth, drawing the door closed around them, and not have to look at another human until morning. Last year I had trialled the mini cabins from Vienna to Hamburg alongside a tall friend who had likened the experience to sleeping inside a bread bin, though I hadn’t found it as claustrophobic as I’d feared, just a bit hard, chilly, and with a pillow as flat as a postage stamp. So I was curious to see how the carriage’s four-person private compartments, for families and groups, would differ.View image in fullscreenNew generation Nightjet train in Austria.Photograph: Christian BlumensteinNormally happy to share with strangers, I’d booked a whole compartment for the three of us: more to protect other hapless travellers from my children, who were now swinging off the berths like members of Cirque du Soleil, their sweaty socks strewn under the seats. With raised sides, the upper berths were safe for the girls to sleep in without rolling out, and I set about tucking in their sheets while they settled down to finish their baguettes. There is no dining car on the Nightjet, so we’d bought food from the station, which was now moving backwards as the train sailed out of the Austrian capital in silence, smoothly curving south-west.Two days earlier we’d arrived in Vienna by train from London, via Paris, and had checked into theSuperbude Wien Prater, a curious hotel that appeared part art-installation, part hostel, with gen Zs slouched around worn leather sofas on MacBooks. With four-bed family cabins overlooking the Prater amusement park, it was a great location from which to explore the city, then finish the evening with a terrifying rollercoaster and a spicy Bitzinger wurst. A friend had described Vienna to me as a grand and beautiful “retirement village”, but, on the contrary, its green spaces, playgrounds and museums made it an easy stop for 48 hours with kids.The thrill seems only to intensify each time I embark on another nocturnal rail adventureHopping off the Nightjet from Paris, we’d gone straight to my favourite restaurant,Edelgreisslerei Opocensky– an unassuming nook serving homely dishes such as stuffed gnocchi, and goulash with dumplings – before whiling away an afternoon at the Children’s Museum atSchönbrunn Palace.Dressing up like young Habsburgs, the girls had swanned around in wigs and musty gowns, laying tables for banquets and begging not to leave – a far cry from our usual museum experiences. Before boarding this train we’d had one last run around the interactiveTechnical Museum, where the human-sized hamster wheels, peg games and slides had so worn out the children that my five-year-old was asleep as the train plunged into the Semmering mountain pass.It was still light as we swept around the Alps, my eight-year-old kneeling at the window and asking where local people shopped, so few and far between were signs of human life. Horses grazed in paddocks, cows nuzzled, and the occasional hamlet emerged from round a bend as though the chalets were shaken like dice and tossed into the slopes. In the blue-grey twilight we watched streams gleam like strips of metal, and spotted a single stag poised at the edge of a wood, before the train made a long stop at the Styrian city of Leoben, at which point we turned in.View image in fullscreenMonisha Rajesh and her daughters disembark the night train.Photograph: Monisha RajeshLike the mini cabins, the compartment was still too cold, the pillow still too flat, but the berths were wider and the huge window a blessing compared with the single berths’ portholes – this one allowed for wistful gazing.Shoving a rolled-up jumper under my head, I fell asleep, waking at 7am to rumpled clouds and a golden flare on the horizon. Most night trains terminate soon after passengers have woken up, but this one was perfect, allowing us to enjoy a leisurely breakfast of hot chocolate and jam rolls while watching the Tuscan dawn breaking into song, and Umbrian lakes and cornfields running parallel before we finally drew into Rome – on time.When travelling alone I relish arriving with the entire day at my disposal, but with children it’s hard work waiting until 3pm to check in to accommodation, so I default to staying at a Hoxton hotel if one is available. Its Flexy Time policy allows guests to choose what time they check in and out for free, and by 11am we had checked in, showered and set off to toss coins in the Trevi fountain, finding thick whorls of eggy carbonara at nearby trattoria Maccheroni, and gelato at Don Nino. To avoid the crowds and heat, we waited until 6pm to hire an electric pedal car from Bici Pincio at the Villa Borghese and drove around the landscaped, leafy grounds, relishing the quietness of the evening ride. Excited about the next adventure in Florence, the girls had only one complaint: that they couldn’t ride there on the night train.Monisha Rajesh is the author of Moonlight Express: Around the World by Night Train (Bloomsbury, £22), published on 28 August and available on pre-order atguardianbookshop.comOmioprovided travel in a four-person private compartment in a couchette carriage from Vienna to Rome (from £357).

He lost contact with his family and sold his possessions – even his dad’ssovereign ring – to fund his addiction. But three years ago, at 61, he started working for a rehab centre. Now, he says, “I save lives. I make a difference.” The cork board full of thank you cards in his office agrees.Kalli works as service manager at thePerry Clayman Projectin Luton, Bedfordshire, and likes to advise clients not to apologise. “Because how many times have I apologised?” he says. “Don’t say sorry. Your families have heard it a thousand times. It’s by making change that “you’ll be making amends,” he says.Kalli grew up in north London, then Bognor on England’s south coast. His parents, Greek-Cypriot immigrants, owned a cafe, then restaurants. They relied on others for help and, as a young child, Kalli was sexually abused by a family friend. He suppressed the memory, but the experience “shaped me for relationships going forward”.“I deal with a lot of patients who start on drugs and alcohol from 12 years old,” he says. “My progression wasn’t like that, but my childhood was erratic.”At 16, he trained as a chef and moved to London to work as a server at the Savoy hotel – the first of a string of hospitality jobs that Kalli pursued alongside his dream of becoming a footballer. “Life was here and there. A little bit all over the place.”He married at 18 and by 23 had three children and a successful restaurant business, which he shared with his father. “Flash Mercedes, lovely house, ducking and diving … I was always looking for something more.”He wasn’t a big drinker and avoided drugs. He played football semi-professionally for clubs on the outskirts of London. Other business ventures came and went – ice-cream bikes, an ice-sculpture business. Plans for a nightclub fell through.View image in fullscreen‘I make a difference’ … Andy Kalli at the PCP detox and rehab centre in Luton.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThen, at 29, he was in a pub, having recently lost £50,000 on the nightclub-that-wasn’t, when his mate offered him cocaine.“Once I took that line, in my brain, I was 10ft tall. I started doing a bit more. I started going to casinos to make up the 50k I lost. I ended up blowing 100k in a week.”For a while, Kalli hid a double life, earning money in the daytime, using crack cocaine in the evenings. “Me running away. I couldn’t stop.” But he was “very successful financially … Everything I touched turned to gold.”He was working in the US as a business consultant in 2013, when his daughter Helen was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Kalli returned to the UK. During the last year of Helen’s life, he missed hospital appointments because of his addiction, and even took his 10-year-old grandson to a drug deal.When Helen died in 2014, “I wanted to die myself,” he says. “I tried to die myself.”His marriage had long ended – there have been two more since – but six months after Helen died, Kalli walked into a West Midlands hospital and asked for help. He was put on suicide watch for two weeks. “The start of my journey of recovery,” he says. He was 53, and he’s been clean ever since.How did he do it?“By resilience, courage, fighting spirit … I had to distance myself from everybody and everyone – people, places, things. I had to focus on my triggers. I had to learn to start again,” he says.A new start after 60: I did my first pull-up at 63 – then fought to be a ninja warriorRead moreHe often heard his late daughter’s voice in his ear – “Dad, you’ve got to help people” – and he started doing courses: peer mentoring, counselling. In his late 50s, he started a degree in psychology with substance misuse studies and at 61 graduated with a first.Along the way, he learned about himself. “The unmanageability of my life. Moving from house to house, woman to woman, country to country. I was never satisfied. I was never happy with me … I learned to let go of the trauma around [the abuse], to let go of the guilt around my kids. I had to forgive myself.”At 64, Kalli is in touch with his children. “I’m back as their dad. I’m a grandad now.” And he’s “still got ambition”. He’s writing a book. At work, reconnecting families is a priority. “I’ve got the power now. I think I can help save lives,” he says. “I could be 24 or 44.

Here,written before her release on 8Apriland after her sentence was reduced on appeal, she reflects on her final months of incarceration.JanuaryAt the start of the year, I turned a corner and encountered a new emotional landscape. Transfer to open prison and the sentence appeal were on the horizon. Change, out of my control, was brewing.Open prison, a surveilled environment without bars or locks, intended as a stepping stone to community reintegration, is a goal for many in closed prison. But, heartwrenchingly, it is only a pipe dream for the more troubled inmates – those who struggle to adhere to the strict behavioural rules, so often due to fragile mental health, complex psychological or neurodivergent needs, which there is scant provision to cater for.Every day, I try to engage with Tina, whose internal distress can result in loud, anguished outbursts in the night and repetitive calls for help. She regularly finds herself punished for these, with downgraded conditions, locked in her cell for days without TV, phone or association time with others. Prison is no fit place for Tina.This morning, I call my daughter, Verity, but first pick up a message she left a few days before. I would have loved to have phoned her at the time, to share and support. I feel a pang of guilt and the chasm between us. Today is her birthday.It is also the day Cressie, Lucia (her co-defendants Lucia Whittaker De Abreu and Cressida Gethin) and I are assembled in HMP Send’s video room for our appeal hearing.Two foot-thick tomes of court papers weigh down the table. Next to them, a cup of delicious flapjacks Lucia has made, that happily we are allowed to share. The legal arguments went on for two days and we strained to hear, but we are sustained by the knowledge that thousands gather outside the court, to peacefully and insistently make their support known. And we’re uplifted to see (co-defendants) Daniel (Shaw), Roger (Hallam) and appellants from the other three trial groups, via the video-link system, on the screen. The verdict will take four to eight weeks. We are not holding our breath.FebruaryNews in the UK and abroad is getting grimmer by the day. Surreal stuff. Trump’s tornadoes of turmoil, world temperatures tipping 1.75C above pre-industrial levels, 35% of Los Angeles engulfed by wildfires, and Storm Éowyn, listed as a real danger to life in the UK, is ripping the covers off polytunnels where I work in the prison gardens.I and those working with me there are also being scattered, reassigned to different work or education. This can happen without warning. It’s very unsettling for the many neurodivergent people who make up nearly half the prison population. Appealing against the moves is futile.I have just been put on a 12-week education course, which I’m already qualified for and which I will never complete, as I move prison in three weeks. Given how much information the prison system amasses on us, it is such a waste that inmates’ time is not more intelligently managed. There is little follow-through after courses, aside from links established by altruistic staff, with outside trusts and employers that boost the hopes and dreams of a few.View image in fullscreenA demonstration outside Southwark crown court, London, as fellow activists are sentenced in July 2024.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma/Rex/ShutterstockPre-empting the move to open prison, I prepare cards and little gifts for all I’ve built relationships with here. I feel sheepish letting Ava know. As a foreign national, she is barred from open prison, despite attending every course asked of her over the many years and giving much to the prison community.Today is grey and drizzly. Cressie and I cross the exercise yard with our plastic boxes to collect lunch. An officer spots us and cheerily announces we are moving to East Sutton Park open prison tomorrow. We exchange puzzled looks. We are the lucky ones. Mina, a fellow transferee, only finds out in the morning.Every time you move prisons, all your possessions must be checked out, one by one. In reception, we dutifully pick items out of our plastic bags, which get placed in new, sealed ones. We are surprised to discover that we will travel by car rather than prison vans, aptly named sweat boxes. This seems weird.Stranger still is the environment we arrive at – a manor house and grounds akin to the ones I used to visit with my parents on a day out as a kid, with functional interiors reminiscent of outward-bound centres I stayed at in school groups. The communal rooms are beautiful and filled with books. Food is a step up. There’s a well-run gym, relaxed, supportive staff and the shared bedrooms have barless garden views, which cheer up the same prison furniture. Sadly, the mattresses are even poorer – within a week, Lucia’s back is in chronic pain.Although beautiful, the house has many steps – a nightmare for less mobile prisoners, and all work programmes require a level of physical fitness some just don’t have. Prison causes deterioration of health for many inmates. Those who struggle are either assigned work that exacerbates their condition or are paid a third of the meagre wage if they cannot work as hard as other people. The individual needs of those brought here can surely be better considered and provided for.MarchView image in fullscreenProtesters hold portraits of Louise Lancaster and Cressida Gethin during a vigil in Cambridge in December 2024.Photograph: Martin Pope/Sopa/Rex/ShutterstockMeals at East Sutton Park are communal events. We eat with prison friends from HMP Send. These are releases on temporary licence (RoTLs), a common topic of discussion. As with enhancements and open prison, they are a privilege and largely favour those who already possess the skills to access work in the community. RoTLs generally include day release, work outside the prison and gradually increasing numbers of nights at home. With only two female open prisons in the UK, many people are far from home. Newly proposed guidelines are set to reduce financial support for travel for those on RoTL, which could limit access for poorer inmates and exacerbate discrimination.Over lunch, news reached us that HMP Send may be the onewomen’s prison James Timpson plans to closeto trial out alternative forms of “punishment and rehabilitation”. Send may convert into one of the 14 new male prisons the government insists on building. We all share our concerns for those left behind. Some will move to alternate, non-custodial community provision, therapy centres or drug and alcohol rehabilitation. It’s definitely reform on the right trajectory – but others will surely be transferred. Send is one of the better closed prisons. What will be their fate?Today, our fate has been decided. Cressie, Lucia and I walk in the unseasonably warm sun to the video room, where our lawyers will inform us of the verdict of our appeal. It is almost shocking to receive a reduction in sentence when 10 other appellants do not. We take time to process the new reality. As well as pleasure, a range of emotions and thoughts spring to mind. Not insignificantly, the unpredictable danger of curfew tag error, triggering recall to prison; harsh licence conditions regarding participation in events and internet use; and restrictions that will prevent us contacting each other and so many others.But when I phone my family to break the news, they are already celebrating the year off of my sentence and that I could be released on curfew tag within weeks. Our sentences are still manifestly excessive, of course. The real injustice is not their length but that citizens engaging in nonviolent civil resistance are incarcerated by a legal system that outlaws consideration of the deep wrongs that compel their action.The 1,000 people who sat silently on the road and stayed there for 90 minutes, despite pressure from the police to move, are in my view the catalysts for the reduction in sentences. My thanks goes out to them; we must never underestimate the power of such collective action.That night I reread Martin Luther King Jr’sletter from a Birmingham jail. I quote: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”In these rapidly shifting sands of global instability, compassion and care are being stripped away. Injustice is increasing. We cannot let this happen.The names of inmates Tina, Ava and Mina have been changed to protect their identities.Additional reportingby Matthew TaylorExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentLetters from prisonPrisons and probationJust Stop OilEnvironmental activismProtestUK criminal justiceJames TimpsonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sanseito’s result took its total to 15 in the 248-seat chamber.View image in fullscreenShigeru Ishiba, Japan’s prime minister, holds a press conference on Monday after his coalition lost its upper house majority.Photograph: Philip Fong/ReutersThe party’s message resonated in Japan, where global inflation and a devalued yen have pushed up costs, particularly for food, after decades of almost flat prices. Rice prices in Japan near doubled in the year to June,sparking a political crisisand leading to theresignation of a cabinet minister.Wages have failed to keep pace and the sense of a sluggish economy but comfortable lifestyle has given way to a cost-of-living squeeze and growing pessimism about the future. Those on lower incomes are hardest hit and it is from there that Sanseito is drawing much of its support.“Many of its followers are first-time voters – the disaffected who feel the mainstream parties have nothing to offer them,” said Michael Cucek, an expert in Japanese politics at Tokyo’s Temple University, before the vote.Japan’s rice crisis - podcastRead moreIn its manifesto, Sanseito called for a return to traditional family values, repealing the LGBT Understanding Promotion Act, “protecting Japan’s unique cultural heritage”, curbing immigration and paying universal monthly child benefits of 100,000 yen (£500/US$670) while stopping welfare payments to non-Japanese.“Anti-foreign sentiment that was considered maybe taboo to talk about so openly is now out of the box,” said Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Tokyo’s Kanda University who has studied Japan’s rightwing politics. He pointed to Sanseito’s online following, appeal among young men and warnings about immigration eroding indigenous cultures.The party’s leader, Sohei Kamiya, a former supermarket manager and English teacher, says he has drawn inspiration from the “bold political style” of Donald Trump, the US president. He has drawn comparisons with rightwing, anti-immigration parties in Europe, such as Germany’s AFD and Reform UK.“In the past, anyone who brought up immigration would be attacked by the left,” Kamiya told Reuters last week. “We are getting bashed too, but are also gaining support.”Concern over foreign residents has increased since Japan loosened its relatively strict immigration policies in response to a worsening labour crunch caused by a shrinking and ageing population. The number of foreign-born residents hit a record of 3.8 million in 2024, although that is still only 3% of the total population, a tiny fraction compared with numbers in the US and Europe.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Japan’s Sanseito party at a rally in Tokyo on Monday.Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/ReutersWith nearly every sector short of workers, most Japanese people accept the need for more labour from overseas. Nevertheless, a large influx of outsiders into a relatively homogenous nation that values cultural conformity has triggered some disquiet.Exacerbating such concerns is misinformation being spread on social media, including false claims that a third of welfare recipients are foreigners.Tetsuya Kataoka, a voter in Tokyo who said he had had to take on extra shifts to make ends meet, accepts that Japan needs more immigrants to maintain its economy. But he added: “I’m struggling financially, and when people hear that foreigners are getting welfare – even if it’s only a small percentage of them – they wonder why it’s being paid to them instead of cutting our taxes.”Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan on 3 July, Kamiya said his party was not in favour of extreme nationalism or protectionism and was aiming for “global harmony and mutually beneficial international economic relations but not excessive free trade or disregard for national sovereignty”.Kamiya, who won the party’s first seat in 2022 after having gained notoriety for appearing to call for Japan’s emperor to take concubines, faced a backlash early in this year’s campaign for branding gender equality policies a mistake, saying they encourage women to work and keep them from having children.He has since appeared to tone down some controversial ideas formerly embraced by the party. His election manifesto, for example, included plans to cut taxes and increase child benefits – policies promoted by a number of opposition parties that led investors to fret about Japan’s financial health and massive debt pile.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wittgenstein was perhaps one of the first performing pianists using only one hand, but there was a one-handed pianist in Britain in the years after the second world war.Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick became a piano-playing couple in 1941. They performed at thePromsand toured widely. They used all four hands, sometimes on one piano, sometimes on two. They were touring the Soviet Union in 1956 when Cyril had a stroke that paralysed his left arm. Just as Wittgenstein had experienced, Smith and Sellick had music written or arranged for them for the rest of their careers.How do I know this? They came to play at the University of Liverpool in 1962 and I was the student given the task of looking after them and was their page-turner.Graham MyttonDorking, SurreyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I have not read the book but, as a long-term psychiatric patient, I would like to make two points.First, care naturally varies in quality, suitability and success. Following three years in unsatisfactory private care (after many previous years inNHScare), I have happily returned to the NHS. I find its care superior, but hamstrung by limited resources, which can mean waiting many months for an appointment. But I have never been treated badly, as Jackson suggests is common, even when in the worst state.Second, I was struck by what Jackson says a junior doctor said to her (as quoted by Clarke): “‘Let’s quetiapine them today!’ And I asked him why quetiapine, and he said, ‘They put you in the best hotels for conferences.’” As Clarke says, this is ludicrous, and certainly the only time I have heard “quetiapine” used as a verb, which strikes me as improbable.Quetiapine has been a generic drug since 2012 (ie open to any company to manufacture and market, just as, say, paracetamol is). I cannot believe that a junior doctor would prescribe it in the hope of being put up in a “best hotel” for a conference.It has long been the first-line treatment for psychosis, and for good reason: it works. I have been on quetiapine for 15 years. It’s not an enviable position to be in, but I am glad it exists, and grateful to those who have – quite rightly – prescribed it to me.Name and address suppliedI was disappointed to read that Cathy Wield was “subjected to increasingly damaging interventions, including electroconvulsive therapy” (Letters, 11 July). I was treated with ECT for severe depression (with my full consent) in 2006 and it saved my life. In subsequent years when I had relapses, it again was highly effective as a treatment and I recovered fully, and have been well for the last five years. I would hope that patients won’t dismiss ECT as a potential treatment for depression based on its negative portrayal in the press, but be guided by NHS professionals who prescribe what they believe is best for the individual patient.Name and address suppliedExplore more on these topicsPsychiatryMental healthHealthDrugsDoctorsNursingNHSlettersShareReuse this content"

Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the assertions made in the videos, but two of those shown speaking were identifiable as former Cecot detainees.The Venezuelanswere sent to El Salvadorfrom the US in March after Donald Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without normal immigration procedures.The deportations drew fierce criticism from human rights groups and led to a legal battle with the Trump administration. Family members and lawyers of many of the men deny they had gang ties.The former detainees arrived near Caracas on Friday, where some were reunited with their families, but they have not yet returned to their own homes.Yajaira Fuenmayor, the mother of the returned detainee Alirio Guillermo Belloso, said on Sunday afternoon from her home in Maracaibo that she was preparing himarepas, traditional corn cakes, as a welcome.“I can’t stop thinking of the hunger my son went through. I have a salad ready, some grilledarepasbecause he loves them, and there is fish in the refrigerator to fry,” she said.The government said the men would be medically evaluated and interviewed before being released. It has always said the El Salvador detentions were illegal and that only seven of the men had serious criminal records.The Venezuelan opposition has regularly criticised the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and his government for holding activists and others in similar conditions in Venezuela.The US said last week that 80 Venezuelans would be released from Venezuelan jails as part of the deal, under which 10 US citizens held in Venezuela were also to be freed.Forty-eight Venezuelan political prisoners have so far been released, the legal rights advocacy group Foro Penal said earlier on Monday on X.“We regret the absence of an official list that allows us to verify with more precision,” the group said, adding that some lists in circulation had included people not classed as political detainees, people who had already been released and even prisoners who had died. “At Foro Penal we remain in coordination with families working to verify other cases.”The communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about who was to be released and whether any of them would be subject to house arrest or other alternatives to detention.The main opposition coalition in Venezuela cheered the release of the prisoners, but said on Sunday that nearly 1,000 people were still in jail in Venezuela for political reasons and that 12 others had been arrested in recent days in what it called a “revolving door” for political prisoners.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaEl SalvadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

She will play a film-maker arriving in Paris for fashion week, following her role as Maria Callas in last year’s Netflix biopic Maria. Winocour previously premiered the Eva Green-led sci-fi film Proxima at the festival.Ronan, who was last seen in the alcoholism dramaThe Outrunand Steve McQueen’s Blitz, will lead the Bristol-set comedy thriller Bad Apples, playing a teacher forced into drastic lengths while dealing with a particularly troubling 11-year-old. The official synopsis promises “uneasy laughs” and a “provocative” tone.Reeves will leadAziz Ansari’s directorial debut, Good Fortune, as an angel who engineers a body swap between a poor and a rich man, played by Ansari and Seth Rogen, respectively. Ansari has said he hopes the film helps to resurrect the theatrically released R-rated comedy. “Aziz is great,” Reeves toldEntertainment Weekly. “A great writer, director, actor. I had such a fantastic experience working with him.”Toronto will also see directorial debuts from actors James McAvoy, Brian Cox and Euphoria’s Maude Apatow, daughter of Judd Apatow. McAvoy directed California Schemin’, based on the true story of Scottish rappers pretending to be American, Cox has helmed Glenrothan, a drama described as a “love letter to Scotland”, and Apatow is behind Poetic License, a comedy starring her mother Leslie Mann.The festival will also see the world premiere of Christy, a biopic of the groundbreaking female boxer Christy Martin starring Sydney Sweeney. The film, from the Animal Kingdom director David Michôd, will cover Martin’s rise in the 1990s and then later her husband’s attempt to murder her. “Our film is a wild mix of inspiring underdog sports-world story and personal saga,” Michôd said toW Magazine. “Sydney trained her butt off to play the part. The beauty of Sydney is that she turned up to work every day with her tail wagging, ready to go. No matter how tough it was, she was like a ray of sunshine.”Other true stories premiering include the 1930s-set Palestine 36 about a Palestinian uprising against colonial British rule, the historical drama Nuremberg starring Rami Malek and Russell Crowe, Agnieszka Holland’s Franz Kafka biopic Franz, Swiped which stars Lily James as the founder of the dating app Bumble and Paul Greengrass’s previously announced survival thriller The Lost Bus, which stars Matthew McConaughey as a schoolbus driver trying to save children from the deadly 2018 Camp fire in California.Premieres that had also already been announced before Monday include Rian Johnson’s much-anticipated Knives Out sequelWake Up Dead Man, which brings back Daniel Craig and adds Josh O’Connor, Glenn Close and Mila Kunis, the buzzy Brendan Fraser-led comedy drama Rental Family from Beef director Hikari, the Blue Valentine director Derek Cianfrance’s Roofman with Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, Nicholas Hytner’s period comedy The Choral starring Ralph Fiennes and based on an original Alan Bennett script and Steven Soderbergh’s dark comedy The Christophers with Michaela Coel, Ian McKellen and Baby Reindeer breakout Jessica Gunning.Chris Evans will also play a movie star abducted by a group of radicals in Sacrifice, an action comedy also starring Anya Taylor-Joy, Salma Hayek, John Malkovich and Charli xcx. Director Bobby Farrelly, known for co-directing hit films such as There’s Something About Mary, will unveil Driver’s Ed, a new comedy starring the White Lotus breakout Sam Nivola.Aaron Taylor-Johnsonand Theo James will also headline the heist thriller Fuze from the Scottish director David Mackenzie.Other notable premieres include the offbeat romantic comedy Eternity with Elizabeth Olsen and Miles Teller, mystery thriller The Ugly from Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho and Easy’s Waltz from True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto with Al Pacino and Vince Vaughn.Documentaries set to premiere include Baz Luhrmann’s EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert and films about subjects such as John Candy, teen series Degrassi and music festival Lilith Fair.The festival takes place from the 4 to 14 September.Explore more on these topicsToronto film festivalAngelina JolieFestivalsSaoirse RonanKeanu ReevesAziz AnsariAnya Taylor-JoynewsShareReuse this content"

His lawyer, Alexei Schacht, told news agencies he would plead not guilty.‘We should treat it as a war’: Ecuador’s descent into drug gang violenceRead moreMacías was removed from custody at a maximum-security prison in south-west Ecuador on Sunday “for the purposes that correspond to the extradition process”, a spokesperson for the national prison authority, SNAI, told reporters.Macías, a former taxi driver, agreed in a Quito court last week to be extradited to the US to face the charges.He is the first Ecuadoran extradited by his country since a new measure was written into law last year, after a referendum in which President Daniel Noboa sought approval for moves to boost his crackdown on criminal gangs.Ecuador, once a peaceful haven between the world’s two top cocaine exporters, Colombia and Peru, has experienced a rise in violence in recent years as gangs with ties to Mexican and Colombian cartels vie for control.Soon after Macíasescaped from prison in January 2024, Noboa declared Ecuador to be in a state of internal armed conflict and ordered the military and tanks into the streets to “neutralise” the gangs. The move has been criticised by human rights organisations.Macías’s Los Choneros has ties toMexico’s Sinaloa cartel, Colombia’s Gulf Clan – the world’s largest cocaine exporter – and Balkan mafias, according to the Ecuadorian Organized Crime Observatory.The crime boss’s escape from prison prompted widespread violence and a large military and police recapture operation, including government posters offering $1m for information leading to his arrest.On 25 June, Macías was found hiding in a bunker concealed under floor tiles in a luxury home in the fishing port of Manta, the centre of Los Choneros operations.In an interview with CNN at the time, Noboa said Macías would be extradited, “the sooner, the better … We will gladly send him and let him answer to the North American law.”More than 70% of cocaine produced in the world passes through Ecuador’s ports, according to government data. In 2024, the country seized a record 294 tonnes of drugs, mostly cocaine.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasDrugs tradeExtraditionnewsShareReuse this content"

Xinhua reported that the project would consist of five cascade hydropower stations, producing an estimated 300 million megawatt hours of electricity annually at a cost of about 1.2tn yuan (£124bn).In comparison, the Three Gorges dam cost 254.2bn yuan andgenerates 88.2m MWh.No further details were given about timing or scope of construction, but the figures reported by Xinhua exceed estimates from 2020.China, the world’s biggest carbon emitter, is operating a huge renewable energy expansion as it seeks to reach emissions reduction goals and stabilise its power supply. It has tens of thousands of hydropower projects, far more than any other country.The Yarlung Tsangpo megadam will reportedly harness the power created by the river dropping 2km in about 50km as it winds through a canyon on a U-shaped bend.India and Bangladesh have voiced concerns over the project, fearing the water could be held or diverted away from them.The Yarlung Tsangpo becomes the Brahmaputra river as it flows south into India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states and finally into Bangladesh as the Jamuna river. Damming it could affect millions of people downstream.“China can always weaponise this water in terms of blocking it or diverting it,” Neeraj Singh Manhas, special adviser for South Asia at the Parley Policy Initiative,told the BBCin January.The Indian government formally registered its concerns with Beijing over the project in December, and during bilateral meetings between the two countries’ foreign ministers in January.In response, officials have said China does not seek “water hegemony” and never pursues “benefits for itself at the expense of its neighbours”.“China will continue to maintain current exchange channels with downstream nations and step up cooperation on disaster prevention and mitigation,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said in December.Tibetan groups have also noted the presence of sacred sites along the river, and the lack of information about potential population displacement.Other hydropower projects in Tibet have inspired rare protests, resulting in brutal crackdowns from authorities, according to activists. Last yearhundreds of people were arrestedwhile protesting against the Kamtok dam on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river, which they said threatened to displace thousands of residents and submerge ancient Buddhist monasteries. The Three Gorges Dam is estimated to have displacedabout 1.5 million people.Environmentalists have also expressed concern about wildlife in the region, as well as the significant tectonic shifting, severe landslides and extreme geography where the dam is expected to go.The Chinese government rejects the criticism, and says the project will stimulate jobs in the region, increase domestic energy supplies and spur on development in the renewables sector. “Special emphasis must be placed on ecological conservation to prevent environmental damage,” Li said.Explore more on these topicsChinaTibetHydropowerRenewable energyBiodiversityRiversAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Temperatures have been significantly higher than the average observed over the past 20 years – with some areas 5C above normal.This most recent marine heatwave has been the western Mediterranean’s most extreme for this time of year. While sea surface temperatures above 30C are not that unusual later in the summer, such conditions are unprecedented in late June.The impact on marine wildlife and ecosystems from marine heatwaves can be significant. Prolonged exposure can drain the energy from sea creatures to a point where they can no longer survive. There is also evidence that some species go into survival mode and will not reproduce.View image in fullscreenA resident leaves his house after torrential rain in Gapyeong, South Korea, on Monday.Photograph: Kim Hong-ji/ReutersMeanwhile, days of torrential rain acrossSouth Koreahave been responsible for at least four deaths, with two people still unaccounted for.The country has been pounded by heavy rainfall since Wednesday, prompting the authorities to warn of landslides and flooding.

During the same trip, he met Queen Elizabeth II aspart of a larger effort to foster reconciliation. Dodson hasspoken about the significance of that meeting.However, files including a memo written by Blair’s foreign affairs adviser, John Sawers, reveal the level of angst within government circles about the trip, and refers to an apparent intervention by the then Australian high commissioner, Philip Flood.“The Australians are pretty wound up about the idea of you seeing the Aborigines at all,” Sawers wrote in a note to Blair. “Their high commissioner rang me to press you not to see them: they were troublemakers – it would be like [the then Australian prime minister]John Howardseeing people from Northern Ireland who were trying to stir up problems for the UK.”The memo suggested: “Can’t we plead diary problems?” while the word “yes” is written in answer to this, in handwriting that resembles that of Blair. The same memo reminded Blair that he would be “pressed” to see the Chinese human rights activist Wei Jingsheng a week later, adding: “It will be harder to avoid seeing Wei if you’re seeing Australian dissidents next week.”A separate British government memo recorded that the Australian High Commission had made several points, including that Australian media reports suggested the delegation would be seeking an apology from the Queen and would be raising the “historical failure of the British government to consult Australia’s Indigenous population during colonisation”.“We are not certain of the message it will deliver, but it is unlikely to be welcome,” it added, recommending that Blair not meet them and that there was a risk the UK could be drawn in “domestic Australian debate on indigenous issues”.Other files reveal angst inside Blair’s government about Australian relations, including the potential scenario of Australians voting to become a republic during a referendum in 1999. “We don’t want a rejection of the Queen to equate to rejecting all things British,” Sawers told Blair in a note advising that new legislation would be needed in the UK if Australians voted yes.Files from the following year include a briefing for Blair before a visit to him by Howard in July 2000 during Australia Week.Howard would be “very aware of domestic Australian media criticism” of it as a “backward-looking junket” and would try to use the visit to Blair to emphasise serious political aspects, a senior UK civil servant wrote. A pen portrait of Howard described him as having a “sometimes didactic but nevertheless effective speaking manner”.There was considerable anxiety in the British government about the eagerness of Howard’s government to hold an England v Australia cricket match featuring teams selected by him and Blair.It was expected that the Australian team would comprise high-quality professionals and the Australian High Commission had informally approached the England and WalesCricketBoard, but British civil servants feared it would clash with another event and that English county teams would not be prepared to release players for a match between the prime ministers’ XIs.After Howard wrote to Blair to propose the match, Blair’s private secretary, Philip Barton, noted in a memo to the UK prime minister: “I suspect the last thing you will want to do is go to a cricket match on the Saturday. But if we just say no, this would no doubt come out and you would look unsporting.”Barton came up with options including getting John Major, a cricket fan, to raise an XI on Blair’s behalf, “but it may not be enough to stop the prime minister having to go to at least the start of the match”. A third option was to “turn it into a charity match”.Explore more on these topicsNational ArchivesTony BlairIndigenous AustraliansJohn HowardForeign policyCricketIndigenous recognitionnewsShareReuse this content"

Spotted tree frogs grew to about 6cm long and were well camouflaged with their vivid green spotty skin.“They are very difficult animals to find because they look very similar to the types of things they like to sit on – granite boulders, ferns and sedges,” he said.View image in fullscreenTeam members walk up and down the stream with headlamps, looking for frog eyes reflecting back and listening out for calls.Photograph: Zoos VictoriaThe task of finding them was made even more difficult after many of the captive-bred animals had moved “a considerable distance” – about a kilometre in a year – from the section of stream where they were released, West said.“It’s challenging walking up and down the stream, just for a couple of kilometres. But when you’ve got to extend that out to 10km, it makes it even more difficult to find a frog.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Traditional owners, recreational fishers and community members joined biologists from Zoos Victoria and Wild Research, walking up and down the stream with headlamps, looking for frog eyes reflecting back and listening out for calls.Gilbert said the team would continue to monitor the health and survival of the released frogs, but it was promising to see them persisting and moving within the landscape. “Fingers crossed things start looking up for them.”Explore more on these topicsEndangered speciesAustralian climate and environment in focusEndangered habitatsAnimalsConservationWildlifeAmphibiansVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

His club paid tribute to the “hugely talented and charismatic individual” who “had a great future ahead of him”.It comes two weeks after the death of another Scottish tourist, Evan Thomson, 26, who fell to his death at the hotel on 7 July.The hotel, which is also an open-air music venue, has decided to pause its scheduled events programme due to “the seriousness of the situation and out of respect for those involved”.It said: “We are deeply shocked and devastated by the recent incidents that have tragically occurred. Our priority is to support those affected and their loved ones during this incredibly difficult time, and to fully assist the authorities with their investigations. The safety and wellbeing of our guests has, and always will remain, our highest priority.”The rapper Dizzee Rascal was due to play this week and the drum’n’bass band Rudimental were expected to appear on 30 July. The hotel did not specify how many events were cancelled.A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British man who has died inSpainand are in contact with the local authorities.”The Dundee Stars said: “We send our thoughts and condolences to Gary’s family, partner, and all his friends at this extremely difficult time. Everyone at the club including players, staff, management, and ownership are heartbroken to hear this tragic news.“Gary was hugely talented and charismatic individual who had a great future ahead of him. His loss will impact many in the ice hockey community and beyond. He will be sadly missed. We respect and support the family’s request for privacy at this extremely difficult time.”Other ice hockey teams also paid tribute to Kelly. In a statement on X, the Glasgow Clan said: “This is truly heartbreaking news. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragic incident during this incredibly difficult time.”The Whitley Warriors, who Kelly played for briefly, said: “Gary iced for Warriors on only a few occasions in the 2023-24 season but was a popular player in the dressing room despite the shortness of his time at Whitley.”Thomson’s mother paid tribute to her son in a social media post. “I’m absolutely heartbroken to write and tell you all, earlier this week my son Evan was in a tragic accident whilst on holiday with his friends in Ibiza and sadly passed away,” she wrote, adding: “We are all absolutely broken.”Explore more on these topicsSpainScotlandEuropeIce hockeynewsShareReuse this content"

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, claimed on Monday that women and girls were facing a “public safety crisis” as a result of crimes committed by “illegal immigrants”.Philp’s comments were delivered in the Commons after six people were arrested after a protest outside an Essex hotel believed to house asylum seekers.A series of demonstrationshas taken place outside the Bell Hotel in Epping since Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, a 38-year-old asylum seeker, was charged with sexual assault over allegedly trying to kiss a girl of 14.He denied the charge at Chelmsford magistrates court last Thursday.Philp told MPs: “Numbers in asylum hotels are now higher than at the time of the election. This is a border security crisis, but it is also a public safety crisis, especially for women and girls.”He urged the government to “record and publish the immigration status of all offenders” and to close the hotel in Epping.Diana Johnson, the crime and policing minister, said it was “vital that the criminal justice procedures are able to run their course”.She added that the government took any allegation of sexual assault “incredibly seriously” and was changing the law to ensure those convicted of sexual offences were not granted asylum.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumDavid LammyEuropeCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Britain said it would spend £700m on air defence and artillery ammunition for Ukraine this year.Pistorius said he had agreed with his US counterpart,Pete Hegseth, that “Germany will contribute to providing the five urgently needed Patriot systems as quickly as possible. How we can achieve that is something we will coordinate closely and in a spirit of mutual trust among partners within the next few days”.In recent months the Kremlin has dramatically escalated its aerial campaign against Ukraine, sending record numbers of drones. Data from Ukraine’s air force, first reported by the Financial Times, suggests Russia’s swarm tactics are increasingly effective, demonstrating an urgent need for Kyiv to boost its own defences.Between April and June about 15% of Russia’s drones reached their targets, compared with 5% in the previous three months, and the scale of attacks has increased. Moscow launched 728 drones at Ukraine earlier this month, a record number, though it is expected that the size of an overnight attack could top 1,000 andeven reach 2,000 by November, according to the Institute for the Study of War.Hundreds of people were sheltering in Lukianivska metro station when a drone exploded next to it on Monday. Russia has repeatedly targeted the district, which was bombarded along with three others in the capital.Smoke engulfed the station. Video footage showed people standing on an underground platform filled with swirling dust. One woman could be heard sobbing.Video shows people standing on an underground platform filled with swirling dust“The station’s entrance was damaged as a result of the attack,” said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, adding that shops, businesses and a kindergarten had also been hit.Max, a 32-year-old resident, said: “My friend ran to the underground. He called me during the night and said he heard the strike. Part of the building and even the roof tumbled down the escalator. There was smoke billowing on the platform.View image in fullscreenDamaged buildings at Lukianivska metro station in Kyiv.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian“If you walk around here it’s like hell on earth. During the day it’s OK. When the night starts, it’s always really hard. This is at least the fifth time Lukianivska has been bombarded. Windows are blown out. If smoke can now reach underground, where do we hide?”France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, held talks with Zelenskyy on Monday in Kyiv and visited the damaged station. “Shelters themselves are no longer entirely safe, as the metro station next to me, which serves as a shelter for Kyiv residents, became a target of the attack,” he said.Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine chartBarrot said French embassy staff had spent two hours hiding during the intense attack. He called for pressure to be increased on Russia and said France would allocate an additional €200m (£170m) next year to support Ukraine’s critical infrastructure and economy.A swarm of drones could be heard buzzing above the city soon after 2am. There were multiple explosions and loud booms as Ukrainian air defence batteries tried to bring them down. The raid ended about three hours later.View image in fullscreenAftermath of the overnight strikes near Lukianivska metro station.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianThe western city of Ivano-Frankivsk – hundreds of miles from the frontline – was also badly hit. Its mayor, Ruslan Martsinkiv, said it was the biggest attack since the start of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion in 2022, with several people in surrounding villages hurt. Explosions were also reported in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city.Zelenskyy said Russia and Ukraine would holdnew peace talks this week. He said in his daily address: “Today, I discussed with [Ukraine’s defence minister] Rustem Umerov the preparations for the exchange and another meeting in Turkey with the Russian side. Umerov reported that the meeting is scheduled for Wednesday. More details will be available tomorrow.”So fartwo rounds of talks in Istanbulhave failed to result in any progress towards a ceasefire, although they have yieldedlarge-scale prisoner exchangesand deals to return the bodies of soldiers killed in the war.View image in fullscreenPeople take shelter in a metro station during a Russian drone and missile attack on Kyiv.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersThe Kremlin said this month it was ready to continue negotiations with Ukraine afterthe US president, Donald Trump, gave Russia 50 daysto strike a peace deal or face sanctions. There is no indication that Putin has changed his maximalist demands, however.The Russian president’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Sunday that reaching a deal was “not simple” and that Moscow’s “objectives” had to be fulfilled. They include seizing further Ukrainian territory and replacing Zelenskyy and his pro-western government.The EU on Friday agreed an 18th package of sanctions on Moscow that targeted Russian banks and lowered a price cap on oil exports, in an attempt to curb its ability to fund the war.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeGermanyPete HegsethUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The protesters also included the group Omas gegen Rechts (Grans against the Right) and the anti-fascist artists’ collective Zentrum für Politische Schönheit (the Center for Political Beauty).View image in fullscreenOmas gegen Rechts (Grans against the Right) were among the groups protesting against the AfD.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPASome parts of the interview were inaudible to people watching it on TV.The anti-immigrant party has insisted the interview should be rerun to give Weidel the chance to properly answer the questions in what was part of a series of interviews with politicians from all parties.On Monday ARD said it would learn lessonsfrom the incident but refused to say whether it would redo the interview. “An uninterrupted flow in interviews is in our interest and, above all, in the interest of the audience. Therefore, we will draw conclusions from the broadcast and take precautions in the future,” a spokesperson said.The broadcaster said it had not been notified that the protest would be taking place and that nothing had been registered with the police in advance. The Berlin police said no arrests had been made, but that it was considering launching proceedings against the demonstrators.The journalist carrying out the interview, Markus Preiß, said afterwards: “I have to say: Alice Weidel was quite sporting, considering the volume.” He added: “Everyone is allowed to demonstrate; that’s a good democratic right. But demonstrations are usually registered. And this one wasn’t.”While she tried to make light of it, calling the choir a “tax-funded NGO” and insisting she was used to protests against her, Weidel appeared to grow increasingly frustrated as the interview went on.Posting a link on social media to the interview, which was shown on the flagship news programme Tagesschau, she wrote: “This is how it looks, by the way, when the Tagesschau holds a summer interview with the AfD in [conservative] CDU-governed Berlin – while the NGO choir protests in the background.”View image in fullscreenThe interview was held next to a public square in Berlin.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPAPreiß said he and Weidel had briefly discussed whether they should keep going and had agreed to continue.ARD faced a barrage of criticism for its failure to move it to an enclosed studio. AfD members and supporters said the broadcaster was responsible for guaranteeing equal conditions for politicians of all parties during interviews.Some opponents of the AfD said the protests had had the effect of creating more publicity for the party, whichbecame the largest opposition party in the German parliamentafter February’s elections.The media lobby group Reporters Without Borders said internet companies should be taxed to create a fund to help public broadcasters deal with the pressures they are increasingly facing from far-right parties.The group’s director general, Thibaut Bruttin, cited Donald Trump’s decision to “dismantle” the US’s international broadcasting service, saying it echoed “the offensive being waged by certain political forces against public radio and television broadcasters across Europe”, naming Hungary, Italy and Slovakia.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropeProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Without it, you would not secure cabinet and parliamentary support for military action. She must understand that you could be forced from office if you tried. The US must not promote regime change in Baghdad at the price of regime change in London.”Manning wrote: “I said that Bush could afford to gamble. He wanted a second resolution but it was not crucial to him. He already had congressional authority to act unilaterally. This was quite different from the situation you were facing.“Condi acknowledged this but said that there came a point in any poker game when you had to show your cards. I said that was fine for Bush. He would still be at the table if he showed his cards later. You would not.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Manning, Rice, Bush and Blair at Camp David in 2002.Photograph: Paul J Richards/EPAThe Americans were becoming increasingly impatient with the unwillingness of France and Russia – which both had a veto on the UN security council – to agree a resolution so long as UN inspectors were unable to find any evidence of Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, the supposed justification for war.After Bush’s annual State of the Union address to Congress, shortly before Blair’s visit, the UK’s Washington ambassador, Christopher Meyer, warned that the options for a peaceful solution had effectively run out.Meyer described Bush’s message on Iraq by this point as “messianic”. It was now “politically impossible” for Bush to back down from war “absent Saddam’s surrender or disappearance from the scene”, he wrote.View image in fullscreenThe then US ambassador Christopher Meyer said Bush was bent on overthrowing Saddam Hussein as part of a ‘mission to rid the world of evil-doers’.Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PABush’s State of the Union address had closed off any room for manoeuvre, Meyer informed London: “In the high-flown prose to which Bush is drawn on these set-piece occasions, he said in effect that destroying Saddam is a crusade against evil to be undertaken by God’s chosen people.”In another cable the previous month, he said of Bush: “His view of the world is Manichean. He sees his mission as ridding it of evil-doers.”In the end, the US and UK abandoned their efforts to get agreement on a resolution, claiming the French president, Jacques Chirac, had made it clear he would never agree.In another briefing note before Camp David, theMinistry of Defencewarned: “The loosening of Saddam’s grip on power may give rise to significant levels of internecine violence.”One of thekey findings of the Chilcot reportwas that Blair had ignored warnings on what would happen in Iraq after invasion, and it rejected Blair’s claim that the subsequent chaos and sectarian conflict could not have been predicted.Explore more on these topicsNational ArchivesForeign policyTony BlairGeorge BushIraqIraq war inquiryCondoleezza RicenewsShareReuse this content"

Tank shelling in the area hit houses and mosques, killing at least three Palestinians and wounding several others, local medics said.“Israeli military entered the premises, forcing women and children to evacuate on foot toward al-Mawasi amid active conflict.

It said three were later released, while one staff member remained in detention.Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “WHO demands the immediate release of the detained staff and protection of all its staff.”Evacuation zones in GazaDeir al-Balah is packed with Palestinians displaced during more than 21 months of war inGaza, hundreds of whom fled west or south after Israel issued an evacuation order, saying it sought to destroy infrastructure and the capabilities of the militant group Hamas.WHO said its main warehouse, located within an evacuation zone, was damaged on Sunday by an attack that triggered explosions and a fire inside. It said it would remain in Deir al-Balah and expand its operations despite the attacks.On Monday, the UK and more than 20 other countries called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza andcriticised the Israeli government’s aid delivery modelafter hundreds of Palestinians were killed near sites distributing food.The WHO describes the health sector in Gaza as being “on its knees”, with shortages of fuel, medical supplies and frequent mass casualty influxes.Explore more on these topicsWorld Health OrganizationGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Whether that’s the deaths of those that are queueing for aid, whether it’s the plans to force Palestinians to live in certain areas or be excluded from certain areas, they are all intolerable and absolutely wrong in principle.”Starmer has come under pressure from MPs, including Emily Thornberry, who chairs the foreign affairs committee, torecognise a Palestinian state. Some western countries are due to do so this month.In a statement on Monday, the foreign ministers called for Israel to immediately lift restrictions on the flow of aid and to urgently enable the UN and humanitarian NGOs to do their work. After a two-month blockade on most aid entering Gaza that haspushed the territory’s 2.1 million residents to the verge of famine, the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has overseen a chaotic, and often deadly, operation.“The suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths,” the foreign ministers said. “The Israeli government’s aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity. We condemn the drip-feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food.”They said it was “horrifying” that hundreds of Palestinians had been killed while seeking aid, and that the Israeli government’s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population was unacceptable. “We urge the parties and the international community to unite in a common effort to bring this terrible conflict to an end, through an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire. Further bloodshed serves no purpose,” they said.Speaking in the Commons, Lammy told MPs he “utterly condemned” the killing of civilians who were seeking to meet their basic needs. “The Israeli government must answer: what possible military justification can there be for strikes that have killed desperate, starving children?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told MPs there should be a “viable pathway” to a Palestinian state that would have “no role” for Hamas, which he said would use it as a “launch pad” for terrorism.On Monday afternoon, the Israeli foreign ministry rejected the joint statement, saying it was “disconnected from reality”.“The statement fails to focus the pressure on Hamas and fails to recognise Hamas’s role and responsibility for the situation,” the ministry said. “Hamas is the sole party responsible for the continuation of the war and the suffering on both sides. At these sensitive moments in the ongoing negotiations, it is better to avoid statements of this kind.”TheLabourMP Andy Slaughter asked Lammy how a ceasefire could be reached, given how swiftly Israel had dismissed the statement. In response, Lammy said the Israeli government “can see the strength of feeling in the house”.“That ignoring of the international community is tarnishing greatly the reputation of Israel. We continue, of course, to look at what further we may need to do.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warForeign policyDavid LammyIsraelLabourGazaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

These locations – as with all civilian sites – must be protected, regardless of evacuation orders,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.The World Health Organizationsaid its staff residence and main warehouse in Deir al-Balah was also attacked.Evacuation mapIn its daily update, Gaza’s health ministry said at least 130 Palestinians had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded by Israeli gunfire and military strikes across the territory in the past 24 hours, one of the highest such totals in recent weeks.Early on Tuesday health authorities said at least 12 Palestinians were killed and dozens injured when Israeli tanks fired on tents housing displaced people at al-Shati camp in western Gaza City. There was no immediate comment from Israel.On Mondaythe UK and 27 other countries signed a sharply critical lettercondemning the Israeli military’s killing of hundreds of Palestinians seeking food in recent weeks and calling for an immediate end to the conflict.“It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid. The Israeli government’s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable. Israel must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law,” the letter said.Israeli sources had said the reason the army had previously stayed out of Deir al-Balah was that they suspected Hamas might be holding hostages there. At least 20 of the remaining 50 hostages in captivity in Gaza are believed to remain alive.Israel launched its renewed assault despite reports in the Hebrew media that Israeli officials believed Hamas was close to agreeing to a ceasefire.View image in fullscreenMourners attend the funeral of relatives killed in an Israeli bombardment in Deir al-Balah on Monday.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APThe latest Israeli assault followed forced evacuation orders for between 50,000 and 80,000 people in Deir al-Balah, in the centre of the Gaza Strip, leaving almost 88% of the territory under such orders.“With this latest order, the area of Gaza under displacement orders or within Israeli-militarised zones has risen to 87.8%, leaving 2.1 million civilians squeezed into a fragmented 12% of the strip, where essential services have collapsed,” the UN said in a statement released by its Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha).With the growing threat of widespread starvation, Ocha emphasised the importance of Deir al-Balah for what remained of the struggling international aid effort. Warehouses, health clinics and a key desalination plant serving southern Gaza are located there. “Any damage to this infrastructure will have life-threatening consequences,” the agency added.Amid increasing concern over the potential impact of the latest assaults, Ocha said the agency’s local head in Gaza, Jonathan Whittall, had decided to remain in Deir al-Balah.View image in fullscreenAn injured man is brought to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after Israeli forces opened fire on civilians who were waiting for humanitarian aid near Gaza City on Sunday.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockIn a series of posts on X, Whittall said the territory was witnessing “conditions of death” and that “This death and suffering is preventable. And if it’s preventable, but still happening, then that suggests to me that it’s intentional.”Unrwa, the UN refugee agency dedicated to Palestinians, said on X it was receiving desperate messages from Gaza warning of starvation, including from its own staff, as food prices have soared.“Meanwhile, just outside Gaza, stockpiled in warehouses, UNRWA has enough food for the entire population for over three months. Lift the siege and let aid in safely and at scale,” it said.The Israeli military said it had not entered the districts of Deir al-Balah subject to the evacuation order during the current conflict and that it was continuing “to operate with great force to destroy the enemy’s capabilities and terrorist infrastructure in the area”.Deep concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza was underlined by reports from doctors that more than a dozen Palestinians had died from hunger in the past 24 hours.“Nineteen people, including children, have died of hunger,” Khalil al-Daqran, a spokesperson for al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah told the BBC. “Hospitals can no longer provide food for patients or staff, many of whom are physically unable to continue working due to extreme hunger.“Hospitals cannot provide a single bottle of milk to children suffering from hunger, because all baby formula has run out from the market.”In southern Gaza, the health ministry said an Israeli undercover unit had on Monday detained Marwan Al-Hams, head of Gaza’s field hospitals, in a raid that killed a local journalist and wounded another outside a field medical facility run by the International Committee of the Red Cross.An ICRC spokesperson said the ICRC had treated patients injured in the incident, but did not comment further on their status. It said it was “very concerned about the safety and security” around the field hospital.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.People killed and injured while seeking aid in Gaza chartAccording to the World Food Programme, the killing of dozens of Palestinians who had gathered to get flour on Sunday came after a convoy of 25 trucks carrying food assistance crossed into Gaza.“Shortly after passing the final checkpoint … the convoy encountered large crowds of civilians anxiously waiting to access desperately needed food supplies,” the agency said. “As the convoy approached, the surrounding crowd came under fire from Israeli tanks, snipers and other gunfire.Senior Labour MP urges UK to recognise Palestinian state ahead of UN conferenceRead moreIsrael’s military acknowledged the shooting but said it had fired “warning shots to remove an immediate threat posed to the troops”. It said initial findings suggested the reported casualty figures were inflated, and that it “certainly does not intentionally target humanitarian aid trucks”.The latest Israeli attacks in Gaza took place as a security official for Yemen’s Houthi group said Israel had struck Hodeidah port on Monday, destroying a dock that had been rebuilt after it was damaged in earlier attacks.“The bombing destroyed the port’s dock, which had been rebuilt following previous strikes,” the official told Agence France-Presse, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

It reportedly struck a five-storey academic building before crashing on to a two-storey structure on the campus, triggering a massive explosion and fire.Videos of the aftermath of the crash showed a big fire near a lawn, emitting a thick plume of smoke into the sky, as crowds watched from a distance. The Bangladeshi air force said the jet had experienced a mechanical failure.Ahmed, a secondary-age student at Milestone, which takes pupils from kindergarten to senior secondary, told the Guardian: “I was eating at the school canteen when I suddenly heard a deafening noise. I saw the plane hit the building and then fall on to a smaller structure. It caught fire instantly. People were screaming and running. Flames engulfed many of the younger students.”“Never in my life have I seen death so closely … The fire, the smoke, the panic – these sounds are now etched into my memory. In an instant, our school became a place of death.”View image in fullscreenFirefighters work to remove wreckage from a building on Monday, after an air force training aircraft crashed into a campus in Dhaka, Bangladesh.Photograph: ReutersMizanur Rahman, a teacher, said he believed the pilot had attempted to steer the plane away from crowded areas: “Our campus is large and lively, with open spaces. I was standing close to the crash site. Judging by the trajectory, it looked like the pilot was trying to reach the field behind the buildings – but probably didn’t make it. He even seemed to aim for one of the smaller structures when he was unsuccessful steering towards the field.”Rahman said many younger pupils were playing outside classrooms as the school day neared its end. “After the plane hit, there was a massive blast and an inferno swept through the surrounding area, engulfing the children. Some of our teachers and staff are still missing.”Images from the scene also showed people screaming and crying as others tried to comfort them.Bangladesh’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), representing the armed forces, said the fighter jet had developed a mechanical failure shortly after takeoff at 1.06 pm and crashed minutes later. The Uttara neighbourhood where the crash occurred is a densely populated part of northern Dhaka, a city of more than 20 million people.ISPR said a high-level investigation committee had been formed by the Bangladesh air force to determine the exact cause. Officials have confirmed that the pilot, Flt Lt Md Towkir Islam, is among the dead.Over the past two decades, Bangladesh has suffered multiple plane crashes involving military and civilian training flights, with at least 15 fatalities – though none approached the scale of Monday’s disaster. Most previous incidents involved only military flight crew.The deadliest happened in 1984 when a plane flying from Chattogram to Dhaka crashed, killing all 49 on board.The interim government of Muhammad Yunus announced a day of national mourning on Tuesday.Yunus expressed “deep grief and sorrow” over the incident in a post on X.“The loss suffered by the Air Force, the students, parents, teachers, and staff of Milestone School and College, as well as others affected by this accident, is irreparable,” he said.“This is a moment of profound pain for the nation.”The government has declared a day of mourning on Tuesday, where the national flag will be flown at half mast across all government and educational establishments and at Bangladeshi missions abroad. Special prayers will be held at places of worship across the country.The incident comes a little over a month after anAir India planecrashed on top of a medical college hostel in Ahmedabad in neighbouring India, killing 241 of the 242 people onboard and 19 on the ground, making it the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.Explore more on these topicsBangladeshPlane crashesAir transportSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The couple are taken out of one the vehicles, and the woman is given a copy of the Qur’an.She tells a man in the regional Brahavi language: “Come, walk seven steps with me, after that you can shoot me.” He follows her for few steps and she then says: “You are allowed only to shoot me. Nothing more than that.”It is not clear what she means by “nothing more than that”. The man who followed her then aims a pistol at her as she turns her back to him. Shots are fired from close range, and after the third shot she drops to the ground.A series of gunshots follows and the footage then shows a bloodied man lying on the ground close to the woman’s body. Men are shown shooting at both of the bodies.Local police identified the bride and groom as Bano Bibi and Ahsan Ullah and released some of the suspects’ names, saying the provincial government had initiated the investigation as none of the couple’s family members had come forward.A tribal elder, Sardar Satakzai, had ordered the couple killed after the bride’s brother complained she had married without his consent, said the police chief, Naveed Akhtar. Both were among the 13 people arrested in a series of raids and authorities were looking for nine more suspects, he said.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said there were at least 405 “honour” killings in 2024, criticising the authorities for failing to stamp out the crimes. Activists say the real number will be much higher because many families don’t report cases.Most victims are women, and the killings are usually carried out by relatives professing to defend their family’s reputation, human rights groups say. Most cases have been reported in Punjab and Sindh provinces.Conservative families in many parts of Pakistan and India do not allow couples to marry against their wishes.In some cases tribal chiefs, many of whom are also local legislators, have defended the killings, and chiefs accused of killings and abduction have not been punished.The HRCP’s secretary general, Harris Khalique, said: “These norms are guarded and practices perpetuated by the feudal and tribal chieftains to maintain their control over both their people and resources.“Regrettably, in many cases, the state not only protects these local chieftains but even facilitates their presence in Pakistani legislatures.“This patronage must stop and anyone responsible for such heinous crimes must be brought to the book.”Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsPakistanViolence against women and girlsSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The deals were arranged byCarole Caplin, a controversial fitness adviser to Blair and style adviser to his wife.Over a period from July 2001 to November 2002, the couple benefited from £46,000 of discounts on clothing, which would have retailed at £76,000, but for which they paid about £30,000.Files released at theNational Archiveson Tuesday show the then No 10 private secretary, Clare Sumner, wrote to Tony Blair in February 2003 stating Caplin had said most of Cherie’s clothes were “bought at wholesale price”, which translated into “basically a 60% discount”.“For you [Blair] Nicole Farhi is at wholesale price (60% discount) and Paul Smith is a 25%. In terms of public perception the amounts involved are quite large.“From July 2001 to December 2002 you and Cherie bought clothes from Nicole Farhi at a cost of £8,021.50. The retail price would have been £20,855. So that gives a benefit of £12,834, more than the total amount you actually spent.“In addition, from July 2001 to November 2002, for Cherie from the credit card statements she bought £21,746.50 of clothes wholesale from James Lakeland, Paul Smith, Paddy Campbell, Tanner Krolle and Janet Thurston and from Barbara Bui at a 30% discount, that would have cost £55,149.23 retail, if Carole’s figures are correct. That is a discount of £33,404, more than was spent.”Blair could argue Caplin was paid a salary, and any “discount” should be calculated after deducting that. The couple could also argue that other people with public profiles had similar arrangements. While a 10-15% discount might be defended, “it is more difficult to make the case for general discounts of 30% to 60%”, Sumner said.While not arguing that anything had been done wrong – “indeed nothing has been” – Sumner said paying back in full “would mean nothing to declare in the Register, or publish in the gifts list”.After discussions with the then cabinet secretary, Sir Andrew Turnbull, Blair was advised to write cheques for his clothing of £1,116 to Paul Smith and £6,532 to Nicole Farhi. “This provides you with the protection of the cabinet secretary. Nothing is put in the public domain, and we have a firm position to take with the press if this ever comes up,” Sumner wrote in April 2003. “Obviously the downside is the amount of money to be paid back and we would need to take care that this did not generate a story in itself.”While it was agreed Cherie Blair, a high-profile barrister, did not receive any “preferential or beneficial treatment” in her role as prime minister’s wife, she was advised to divide her purchases into two on a 50/50 basis “part spouse of the PM, part career woman” and pay in full on the “public” half. She should also require designers to sign confidentiality agreements to ensure there was no incentive for them to provide goods cheaply in order to exploit the fact that the prime minister’s wife wore their clothes, it was advised.Sumner added: “Cherie is happy about what we propose for her, but does not agree with our advice in relation to you and will talk to you separately.”In 1999 Cherie was reported to have complained in private to friends that she was having to fork out tens of thousands of pounds from her own pocket when she accompanied the prime minister on overseas tours.A spokesperson for Blair said there was nothing to add to what has already been disclosed which shows that advice was sought and followed. A spokesperson for Cherie Blair said: “Mrs Blair has nothing further to add to what is already on the public record. Advice was sought and followed at the time.”Explore more on these topicsTony BlairCherie BlairNational ArchivesLabourCarole CaplinKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

A survey by Ipsos found that 31% are mostly excited about the possibilities, but somewhat concerned about the risks. Another 30% are mostly concerned about the risks, but somewhat excited about the possibilities.Kyle said: “AI will be fundamental in driving the change we need to see across the country – whether that’s in fixing the NHS, breaking down barriers to opportunity or driving economic growth.”He said this “can’t be achieved without companies like OpenAI” and added that the partnership would give Britain “agency over how this world-changing technology moves forward”.Altmansaid: “Britain has a strong legacy of scientific leadership and its government was one of the first to recognise the potential of AI through its AI opportunities action plan. Now, it’s time to deliver on the plan’s goals by turning ambition to action and delivering prosperity for all.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Few environmental crises evoke such visceral public anger aspumping poointo waterways, but for years, that is exactly what water companies in England and Wales have done in large volumes.Their failure to build infrastructure, plug leaks and protect nature has infuriated customers who at the same time have struggled withsoaring water bills. It has also shocked European neighbours whose publicly owned water companies keep things far cleaner.Critics say the increasingly sorry state of England’s waterways is the result of mismanagement and underinvestment by debt-ridden water companies who were allowed to run wild by toothless regulators.Graph showing there was a recent high of water-polluting incidents in 2024.The problem, as they see it, is the environmental conundrum at the heart of the modern consumer paradigm: public goods such as healthy rivers and clean beaches do not appear on company balance sheets. Why should corporations – which have a duty to create value for their shareholders – look after public goods? And if governments won’t force them to, should we really expect them to look after the environment?In this case, after alandmark report on the troubled sectoron Monday, the government announced it would combine the powers of four water industry watchdogs – which had competing economic and environmental aims – into one entity with oversight for the sector. It promised “strong ministerial directives” and an end to its light-touch approach.“A single, powerful regulator responsible for the entire water sector will stand firmly on the side of customers, investors and the environment, and prevent the abuses of the past,” said Steve Reed, the UK environment secretary.The adopted proposal is just one of 88 recommendations from a report by an independent water commission– the bulk of which the government will consider over the summer – and the response from environmental experts has so far been muted.Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist at the University of Reading, said water industry reforms were “long overdue and badly needed” but warned against spending years setting up new structures while rivers stay polluted and reservoirs run dry.“The real challenge isn’t designing better systems on paper – it’s getting companies to actually fix leaking pipes, stop dumping sewage and build the infrastructure we need,” she said. “Less reorganising, more doing.”The report contains several recommendations that could help improve water quality and manage its supply, such as better third-party monitoring, new infrastructure standards, compulsory smart meters and a ban on wet wipes with plastic. It considers drawing from new EU rules to make polluters pay for the extra treatments needed to clean up emerging micropollutants, which could eventually include long-lasting Pfas (“forever chemicals”) and microplastics.The report also calls for the updating of existing environmental laws, in addition to overhauling the regulators. The proposed “streamlining” includes setting a new long-term target for the health of water bodies in England andWales– though the move might tempt ministers to lower ambition, given that the existing targets are set to be missed.Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Rivers Trust, said it was understandable that “many people will have wanted this report to go further” but that he believed the recommendations, if implemented, would lead to a “dramatic improvement” in the water environment and more cost-effective delivery.Most of all, though, the report has also come under fire for what it has left out.Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green party, compared the proposed regulatory changes to “rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic”.“Not only that, but the majority of the public are going to be expected to pay more in bills, as we watch the industry continue to sink under the failed model of privatisation,” he said. “The government deliberately left out the option of public ownership from the review, but that’s the only real way to get the water industry to clean up its act.”That outcome isn’t guaranteed. When the water companies were privatised in 1989, the UK was regarded as “the dirty man of Europe”. A trip to its beaches shows it has come full circle.Explore more on these topicsWater industryThames WaterRegulatorsUtilitiesPollutionWater billsPrivatisationanalysisShareReuse this content"

And there will be further injustices perpetrated because the police do what they do.”Under the government of Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s, the Home Office and senior police officers created a secret tactical manual that redefined what could be considered “reasonable force” when it came to protesters. For example, it allowed mounted police charges into static crowds and the use of short shields and truncheons to “incapacitate” non-violent protesters.View image in fullscreenIn the early 1980s, the Home Office and senior police secretly redefined ‘reasonable force’ against protesters.Photograph: Photofusion/RexThese additional unprecedented powers, described as “paramilitary” tactics, have still not been repealed, despite never having parliamentary approval. Another campaigner, Chris Peace, added: “I think the issue is when policing gets political, and the policing at Orgreave was politically led. I think that’s an important point to make.”The clash between police and striking miners on 18 June 1984 at the Orgreave coking plant inSouth Yorkshirerepresented a “turning point”, they said, in the police’s use of force to shut down protest.While Thatcher maintained that the government had not interfered in policing of the miners’ strike, various Home Office documents have since revealed extensive active interference, including influencing, directing and financially supporting the police in their actions against striking miners.Speaking before the press conference, the mayor of South Yorkshire, Oliver Coppard, said the police were under “completely new” leadership in South Yorkshire compared with the days of the strike.View image in fullscreenKevin Horne, who was arrested at Orgreave in 1984, visited the site of the protest with other miners and the home secretary on Monday.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I’m conscious that in South Yorkshire and across this country we have any number of challenges when it comes to policing protests, because these things are always difficult. But I think what we saw on the day at Orgreave was a million miles away from the way in which protest is policed now.”He added that the Orgreave inquiry was important “because we need the truth and we need accountability and we need justice to be done”.However, police in South Yorkshire were not as welcoming, with the Police Federation stating that local operations were already at “breaking point”. The chair of the police-staffing association in South Yorkshire, Steven Kent, said: “Courageous colleagues are out there keeping the public safe struggling with what feels like one arm tied behind their backs as government cutbacks to the service hit home.“This will be long and protracted – and the associated costs of this inquiry will lead to there being even less money in the policing purse, which will only have a negative impact on the public of South Yorkshire.”One of the 95 miners arrested at Orgreave, the campaigner Kevin Horne, said the inquiry would not “make the wrong thing right”, but that it could help mining communities “get back to something normal again”.He said: “We have this chance now of wiping the slate clean so that our children and grandchildren can respect the police again.”Explore more on these topicsThe miners’ strike 1984-85PoliceSouth YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Two of his children have appealed to the public to engage with the documents “with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family’s continuing grief”.“The release of these files must be viewed within their full historical context,” wroteMartin Luther KingIII and Dr Bernice A King in a statement. “During our father’s lifetime, he was relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign orchestrated by J. Edgar Hoover through the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).”They also repeated the family’s long-held contention that James Earl Ray, the man convicted of assassinating King, was not solely responsible, if at all.Bernice King was five years old when her father was killed at the age of 39. Martin III was 10.“The intent of the government’s COINTELPRO campaign was not only to monitor, but to discredit, dismantle, and destroy Dr. King’s reputation and the broader American Civil Rights Movement,” they continue. “These actions were not only invasions of privacy, but intentional assaults on the truth – undermining the dignity and freedoms of private citizens who fought for justice, designed to neutralize those who dared to challenge the status quo.”The murdered civil rights leader’s children also write that they believe that their father was killed as part of a conspiracy that involved “unnamed co-conspirators, including government agencies”.“While we support transparency and historical accountability, we object to any attacks on our father’s legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods,” they add. “We strongly condemn any attempts to misuse these documents in ways intended to undermine our father’s legacy and the significant achievements of the movement. Those who promote the fruit of the FBI’s surveillance will unknowingly align themselves with an ongoing campaign to degrade our father and the Civil Rights Movement.”Some civil rights activists were not so supportive of the release.“Trump releasing the MLK assassination files is not about transparency or justice,” said the Rev Al Sharpton. “It’s a desperate attempt to distract people from the firestorm engulfing Trump over the Epstein files and the public unraveling of his credibility among the Maga base.”The King Center, founded by King’s widow and now led by Bernice King, reacted separately from what Bernice said jointly with her brother. The King Center statement framed the release as a distraction – but from more than short-term political controversy.“It is unfortunate and ill-timed, given the myriad of pressing issues and injustices affecting the United States and the global society,” said the King Center, linking those challenges to MLK’s efforts. “This righteous work should be our collective response to renewed attention on the assassination of a great purveyor of true peace.”Donald Trump promised as a candidate to release files related to John F Kennedy’s 1963 assassination. When the US president took office in January, he signed an executive order to declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F Kennedy’s and King’s 1968 assassinations.The government unsealed the JFK records in March and disclosed some RFK files in April.The King records were initially intended to be sealed until 2027, until justice department attorneys asked a federal judge to lift the sealing order early.Scholars, history buffs and journalists have been preparing to study the documents for new information about his assassination on 4 April 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. King was assassinated as he was aiding striking sanitation workers in Memphis, part of his explicit turn toward economic justice.Ray pleaded guilty to King’s murder. Ray later renounced that plea and maintained his innocence until his death in 1998.Members of King’s family, and others, have long questioned whether Ray acted alone, or if he was even involved. Coretta Scott King asked for the inquiry to be reopened, and in 1998, then attorney general Janet Reno directed the justice department’s civil rights division to take a new look. Reno’s department said it “found nothing to disturb the 1969 judicial determination that James Earl Ray murdered Dr King”.In their latest statement, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III repeated their assertions that Ray was set up. They pointed to a 1999 civil case, brought by the King family, in which a Memphis jury concluded that Martin Luther King Jr had been the target of a conspiracy.“As we review these newly released files,” the Kings said, “we will assess whether they offer additional insights beyond the findings our family has already accepted.”Explore more on these topicsMartin Luther KingTrump administrationFBInewsShareReuse this content"

The CBO estimates the bill will leave 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034.Trump bill set to add trillions to US debt pile – can America stop it climbing?Read moreThe bill also makes permanent tax cuts that were first introduced by Republicans in Trump’s 2017 tax bill. The cuts included a reduction in the corporate tax rate, from 35% to 21%, and an increase to the standard deduction. It also includes a tax dedication for workers receiving tips and overtime pay, and removes tax credits that support wind and solar power development, which could ultimatelyraise energy costsfor Americans.Increased costs will also come from boosts to immigration and border security funding. The billallocatesnearly $170bn to immigration law enforcement, including the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency and funding for a wall along the southern border.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budgetestimatesthat, with interest, the bill will actually add $4.1tn to the deficit. The USnational debtcurrently stands at more than $36tn.“It’s still hard to believe that policymakers just added $4tn to the debt,” Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement. “Modelers from across the ideological spectrum universally agree that any sustained economic benefits are likely to be modest, or negative, and not one serious estimate claims this bill will improve our financial situation.”Trump signed the bill into law earlier this month after weeks of debate among congressionalRepublicans. The bill passed the Senate 51-50 before it passed the House 218-214.While Republicans largely celebrated the bill, with Trumpcalling it“the most popular bill ever signed in the history of the country”, only a quarter of Americans in a CBS/YouGovpollsaid that the bill will help their family.Democrats meanwhile universally criticized the bill, with Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committeesayingthat while “the GOP continues to cash their billionaire donors’ checks, their constituents will starve, lose critical medical care, lose their jobs – and yes, some will die as a result of this bill.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS economyUS CongressRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

But in recent weeks, the Trump administration has dramatically escalated attacks against the central bank, especially its chair,Jerome Powell, amid calls for the central bank to cut interest rates.The White House claims that the Fed mismanaged funds for renovations, which were approved in 2017 and were estimated to cost $1.9bn in 2019. The costs are now estimated to be closer to $2.5bn –Donald Trumphas claimed “it’s possible there’s fraud involved”.According to the Fed, the construction includes “remediation and updates to make the buildings safe, healthy and effective places to work by removing asbestos and lead contamination, and accommodating modern workplace technology”, the Fed said in a statement.The central bank also included an FAQ that directly responds to accusations from the Trump administration that the renovations include unnecessary and expensive modifications, like a VIP dining room and a garden terrace.“No new VIP dining rooms are being constructed as part of the project,” the Fed said. The building “has conference rooms, which are being renovated and preserved. They are also used for mealtime meetings.”Since the start of his second term, Trump has been trying to get the Fed to lower interest rates, even as the central bank resisted in light of his erratic tariff policies. As the Fed refused to budge, Trump has made it clear that he wants tofire Powell. But the supreme court suggested removing Powell could be unconstitutional, and Wall Street investors appear to be against the idea.The Trump administration seems to have grasped on to the Fed building renovations as a possible workaround. When asked last week whether he would fire Powell, Trump said, “it’s highly unlikely unless he has to leave for fraud”.Attacks from the White House continue. On Monday, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, toldCNBCthat “the entire Federal Reserve institution and whether they have been successful” needs to be examined. In Congress, the Florida representative Anna Paulina Luna referred Powell to the justice department, accusing him of lying under oath about the renovations.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyJerome PowellDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

A mere 0.1% of residents hold 71% of the tech hub’s wealth.The findings come from the 2025 “Silicon Valley Pain Index”, a report published by SJSU’s Human Rights Institute each year since 2020. The report aims to quantify “structured inequalities” in Silicon Valley, and measures “pain” as “both personal and community distress or suffering”.This year’s index reports that the wealth divide has widened in Silicon Valley at double the rate of the whole United States over the past decade. The nine wealthiest households in the valley control $683.2bn – a $136bn increase over the past year.At the same time, 110,000 households reported nearly none or no assets.The cost of living in Silicon Valley has risen as well: renters must earn $136,532 to afford an apartment – the highest in the nation.The report ranked San Jose No 4 in “impossibly unaffordable” cities worldwide (after Hong Kong, Sydney and Vancouver). Yet, no cities in Silicon Valley have raised the minimum wage in the past three years. The report finds that 54,582 low-income households do not have access to an affordable home in San Jose and that homelessness grew 8.2% from 2023.When they created the Silicon Valley Pain Index in 2020, shortly after the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, San Jose State University researchers were inspired by the Katrina Pain Index, which aimed to quantify the injustices New Orleans residents faced after Hurricane Katrina. The index continues to show stark racial inequalities.Hispanic workers in San Jose, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara can expect to make 33 cents for every $1 their white peers take home. And although shareholders have voiced commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion, only 3% of employees working in research and development at Apple are Black (compared with 6% Hispanic/Latino, 36% white and 50% Asian).Meanwhile, police violence remains a real concern – even years after the Black Lives Matter protests. Ten people died in police custody in the Santa Clara county sheriff’s office in 2024 – the highest in two decades. And San Jose reported five office involved shootings, up three from 2023.However, the report did note certain improvements in the Silicon Valley area – including a decrease in police use of force incidents in San Jose, an expansion in services to prevent homelessness and environmental sustainability programs.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaSilicon ValleyUS income inequalityWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the survivors of one of the craziest, fastest Tours ever, a race with even less respite than usual, will do as their predecessors have done every few years since 1951: they will crest a rise in the road, and see Mont Ventoux on the horizon. A sinking in the heart will accompany the dull ache in the legs: we’re off to the Bald Mountain once again.The men of the Tour probably won’t be thankful for small mercies, but they should be. Last time the Tour visited, in 2021, although the background scenario was the same –Tadej Pogacar had smashed the race to bitson the first serious climb and was set fair for victory – the organisers cruelly made them go over the 1,910m summit twice, in two different ways. Wout van Aert might recall that with a wry smile: theBelgian was in his prime back then and he won out of a breakaway.Open victor Scheffler is latest sporting star to explore space beyond wins and losses | Cath BishopRead moreThe time before that, in 2016, the chaos on the mountain was such that the man who was Pogifying the race that year, Chris Froome,ran part of the way to the finish, which had been moved off the summit due to high winds. Froome might recall that utterly freakish episode with a wry smile from his home in Monaco, but it will be tinged with regret that at 40 he probably won’t be racing up the Giant of Provence again.Tempora mutantur, but not the Ventoux. That, partly, reflects one of the key features of the Tour; the way it constantly revisits and rewrites its past in places that have barely changed since the first visit. Go round the partly banked corner at Saint-Estève and on to the virtually straight haul through the oak-wooded lower slopes, and it’s essentially the same brutal experience that the stars of the 50s, 60s and 70s might have undergone, perhaps with better tarmac as you go up with barely a hairpin to break the gradient until the final haul across the scree slopes to the top.The Ventoux is a place where stuff happens on the Tour, very little of it good, beginning with Jean Malléjac’s near-death in 1955 and continuing withTom Simpson’s dramatic demise in 1967. That event, which I investigated in my 2002 biography of Simpson,Put Me Back on My Bike, remains the mountain’s defining moment, lending a note of pilgrimage to every ascent to the desolate waste of wind- and frost-blasted limestone scree on its pointed summit. The generation that raced with Simpson has largely passed on –the death in April of Barry Hobanbeing a case in point – but the poignancy of his death and the tales around it lose nothing in the telling.View image in fullscreenChris Froome runs with his bike after he crashed during the ride up Mont Ventoux in 2016, one of the most bizarre incidents in Tour de France history.Photograph: Bernard Papon/APEqually memorable, if with a touch of farce, wasthe Froome fiasco in 2016. Froome slipping and sliding in his stiff-soled carbon shoes and clicking pedal cleats with a huge crowd baying at him was probably the most outlandish event I witnessed in 27 Tours, and the feeling then was that this kind of thing could happen only in one of three places, all equally extreme: the Ventoux, l’Alpe d’Huez, and the rarely visited extinct volcano of Le Puy de Dôme in the Massif Central.After all, it wasn’t that long since, in 2000, most of the race infrastructure had had to be left behind due to dangerous, but not freak, high winds, meaning that whenMarco Pantani wonahead of Lance Armstrong, the finish felt like a return to the 1970s. Given the extreme physical challenge and the sumptuous television images it provides, it’s not surprising that the mountain now hosts the Tour far more often than of old, pretty much matching l’Alpe d’Huez for frequency whereas in the 80s and 90s, one visit per decade was deemed enough.The one major change in recent years concerns not the mountain itself but the area around it. Recently, the newspaper l’Equipe documented how cycling up the Ventoux is now front and centre of the local economy, with more than 90,000 cyclists each year pedalling up its slopes by the most traditional route, the southerly road from Bédoin which opens earlier in the year than the northerly route from Malaucène. On the last two visits I made to the mountain, I’d have expected the slopes to be busy when I rode up one June, but less so on a bitter October day when light snow was falling at the observatory.Cycle cafes, cycle hire businesses and major players in the cycle industry cater for the two-wheeled hordes, far beyond the traditional stop-off point at Chalet Reynard, where the thermometer was reputed to have broken on the boiling day Simpson died. There are three dedicated photographers who make a living from selling photographs to those who ride up each day, turning over €130,000 annually in one case, not to mention the local businesses that feed and accommodate the cyclists plus major mass participation events such as sportives and gran fondos; the strangest, perhaps, being the “brotherhood of the Ventoux nutters”, membership of which goes to those who have ridden up the Ventoux three times in a single day using each of the three different ways to the summit. Given the Tour’s constant pursuit of new and televisually interesting challenges, it’s probably only a matter of time until the race follows suit.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025CyclingTour de FrancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the teams and their fans have largely moved onMon 21 Jul 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 16.35 EDTShareHaven’t the fans of theWashington Commandersand Cleveland Guardians suffered enough?For decades, each team had to endure the twin indignities of on-field futility and off-field scorn. Until last year, when they enjoyed a resurgence under rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, the WashingtonNFLteam had won exactly only one playoff game in the 21st century. Cleveland’s baseball team have been competitivethiscentury, but they once went 41 years between playoff appearances (from 1954 to 1995) and came out on the losing end in the “whose drought will end?” World Series of 2016, in which the Chicago Cubs won the championship for the first time in 108 years at the expense of Cleveland, whose epoch without a World Series win now stands at 77 years.Off the field, both teams faced backlash over their names. Cleveland were known as the Indians until 2022, when a name change to “Guardians” went into effect. Washington had a more disturbing name referring to Native Americansuntil they becamethe “Washington Football Team” in 2020 and landed on “Commanders” from 2022 onwards. The Commanders took another step forward in 2023, when a consortium led by Josh Harris bought the team from Dan Snyder, one of themost reviled team ownersin NFL history. Coincidentally – or perhaps not given Snyder’s failings – the Commanders reached the conference championship last season for the first time since 1991.Trump demands Guardians and Commanders revert to previous names out of respect for Native AmericansRead moreBut Donald Trump, whose quest to make the intellectual and public-service classes miserable is a cornerstone of his presidency, has decided that these two fanbases need more suffering. On Sundayhe insisted on social mediathat the teams should reclaim the names they dropped after decades of pressure. His reasoning, as far as it could be discerned from his typically stream-of-consciousness post, was that changing the names back would be respectful to the many Native Americans who found them offensive in the first place. “Our great Indian people, in massive numbers, want this to happen. Their heritage and prestige is systematically being taken away from them,” Trump wrote.The first thing to say is that Trump often decides to fire off a broadside at sports, when he is looking to distract from other problems, rile up his base or target groups he has contempt for. See, for example, hisattacks on the US women’s national team,Black NFL playerswho knelt for the national anthem ortransgender athletes.The second thing to say is that Trump is unlikely to get anywhere with his demands.The Guardians immediately squashed any notion of reverting to “Indians,” and Trump has no leverage to force them to do his bidding. The Commanders’ situation is a bit more complicated, but Trump is unlikely to prevail there, either.Trumphas impliedthat he will force the Commanders to revert to their old racist name if they want to be allowedto move backto the District of Columbia from their current home in suburban Maryland. The problem is that Joe Biden, in his last weeks as US president, signed a bill transferring the site in question from the federal government to the DC city government. Barring any creative legal maneuvers, the most Trump could do would be to attack the municipal government on other fronts as an indirect way of putting pressure on the Commanders.View image in fullscreenThe Commanders have proposed plans to move back to the site of RFK Stadium.Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPAThe team’s potential new home in DC is occupied by the decaying ruins of RFK Stadium, where the Team Now Known As the Commanders played from 1961 to 1996. The Washington Nationals also played there from 2005 to 2007, when Nationals Park was completed. Other than that, the stadium was the home of Major League Soccer’s DC United and other soccer events until 2017, when DC United moved to their new home at Audi Field. Even before United moved out, the stadiumwas renowned for its decrepit state, though raccoons occasionally found it hospitable.RFK Stadium, though, had many things going for it. It was named for Robert F Kennedy, a distinguished attorney general who may well have been elected president in 1968 had he not been assassinated while campaigning. The stadium had history. It was also an easy walk from a Metro station.The Commanders’ current home, now known as Northwest Stadium, has none of those things. It is a stadium devoid of charm, notable wins by the home team, and good transportation options – even by the standards of a city with brutalist architecture, sporadically successful sports teams, and traffic obstacles. Shortly before his death, then-owner Jack Kent Cooke convinced the US Postal Service to accept that the stadium’s zip code would be known under the placename “Raljon,” a combination of his sons’ names (Ralph and John), prompting Washington Post columnist Tony Kornheiser to quip that everyone was lucky that his kids weren’t named Peter and Ennis.At one time, the Washington NFL team had a long waitlist for season tickets. While the number of people on that waitlist at any given time is heavily disputed, it’s certainly true that the typical fan could not simply buy season tickets without spending a few years waiting for the opportunity. By the end of Snyder’s reign, even with Northwest Stadium’s capacity reduced from 91,000 to about 62,000, the waitlist no longer existed.So a return to the old RFK site would be very attractive to the Commanders and their fans. But they have other options as wellin the suburbs and exurbs, and even without presidential opposition, some local politicians have raised objections to the city’s proposed $1bn investment in a new stadium.And that issue leads back to the federal government – which has the power to force DC to slash its budget, even if local tax revenues are sufficient to cover it – and occasionallythreatens to do so.So Trump and his allies in Congress could, in theory, cut the DC budget out of spite if the Commanders refuse to change their name. But name changes and stadium development take a long time, and the clock on Trump’s tenure in office is ticking. By any other name, Washington’s football team had been in the DC metro area for close to 80 years before Trump’s arrival, and it will be around long after he has packed up for Mar-a-Lago or another destination for good.Explore more on these topicsWashington CommandersCleveland GuardiansNFLMLBBaseballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

But sports accounting is a tricky affairBeau DureMon 21 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 05.09 EDTShareNapheesa Collier was in record-breaking form on Saturday night as she set a new high for aWNBAAll-Star Game, with 36 points. But much of the attention was focused on what happened before the game when players warmed up with shirts bearing the message “Pay us what you owe us.”The move came after players and the league failed to reach a deal on a new collective bargaining agreement. Do they have a point though? Evaluating athlete pay is notoriously tricky because sports accounting always includes a certain amount of voodoo.‘Pay us what you owe us’: WNBA All-Stars make statement with warmup shirtsRead moreThat’s especially true in the WNBA, whose fortunes – literally and figuratively – are tied up with the NBA’s, for better or for worse. The relationship has evolved through the years, and many current WNBA teams have no direct ties with an NBA team, although some remain under NBA ownership. NBA commissioner Adam Silver refers to the two leagues as “integrated,” and they have bundled their broadcast rights together in amassive 11-year deal.And Silver is the one who hasfaced pressurewithin the NBA over the WNBA’s apparent losses, something that those who believe the likes of Collier and Caitlin Clark should be happy with their current salaries often use as a counter argument to demands for a pay hike. Silver said in 2018 that the WNBA’s losses wereroughly $10m a year. And reports last fall said the WNBA was due tolose $40m in 2024. Adjust the 2018 figures for inflation, and the WNBA is supposedly losing three times as much as it was a few years ago.That’s a curious figure given other public statistics suggest the league’s financial health has never been better.First, while WNBA attendance dropped from an overall average of more than 10,000 in the late 1990s to a little under 7,000 just after the pandemic, Clark and Co wiped out most of those losses in 2024 alone, pushing the league average close to 10,000 again, and the league isflirting with a new recordin 2025. Second, the league’s broadcast rights alone have ballooned from zero in 2002 to roughly $60m a year in the current deal, with that numberset to go to $200mas part of the combined deal with the NBA. Third, totalleague revenue jumpedfrom $102m in 2019 to the $180m-$200m range in 2023, Bloomberg reported.Some expenses have gone up, most notablya $25m per year commitmentto fly teams by charter planes rather than on regular flights, as has been the case in the past. The WNBA salary cap has also risen incrementally from $622,000 in 2003 (inflation-adjusted to 2025: $1.1m) to $1.5m in 2025. The league has one fewer team now (13 instead of 14) than it did in 2003 (although expansion teams are on their way) so the total cost of player pay has gone from a maximum of $15.4m to $19.5m. But these expenses don’t add up to a full counterweight to the reported rise in revenue or the well-publicized jump in broadcast rights. It’s a good bet that Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, the owners of the WNBA’s well-supported Golden State Valkyries and the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, are taking a bigger risk by paying 37-year-old Stephen Curry nearly $60m a year than they are in payingthe entire Valkyries rosterbarely $1m.The bottom line is that we don’t know what’s included in the bottom line. Reinvestment in the league? Facilities? Postgame meals catered by five-star restaurants? (Surely not the latter.)All we know is that it’s not going to the players. Generally, the less a league makes, the lower the share of revenue its players get – 50% of $1bn is less of a chore to pay than 25% of $100m. But WNBA players aremaking less than 10%, a rather tiny figure for any professional organization.And in the land of voodoo accounting, sports teams have been adept at pleading penury when circumstances call for it. It’s not just the WNBA either. Eight years ago, ESPNuncovered numbersshowing nearly half of the NBA’s teams didn’t generate a profit on their own.Perhaps the best indicator of how well WNBA teams areactuallydoing – or are poised to do – is the price paid when teams are sold. The New York Liberty were sold in 2019 for somewhere in the $10m-$14m range. Six years later, based on a sale of a stake of the team, thethe Liberty’s value was calculatedat around $450m.Little wonder WNBA players are noticing these figures and asking why their pay is still small enough that many of them are forced to spend their offseasons playing elsewhere. Players’“Pay Us What You Owe Us” T-shirtsat the All-Star Game weren’t printed on a sudden whim. None of those players are suggesting that they should be paid the same as their counterparts in the NBA, where league revenues top $10bn a year. But they surely deserve more, considering the WNBA rookie minimum is just $66,000 compared to $1.27m in the NBA.And it’s not just the per-player pay. It’s the number of players who get paid at all.A typical NBA roster now has 15 full-time players and three “two-way” players who are called up from the second-tier G-League. WNBA teams are limited to 12 players, and some may only carry 11. In a recent Golden State-Phoenix game, Phoenix only had eight players available.So job security is minimal, and those low paychecks sting a bit more when a player is a few bad games away from not receiving them at all.WNBA players may face a bit of opposition as they strive for improved salaries. Some NBA owners seem less enthusiastic than others about the whole venture, even if the most pessimistic reports of WNBA losses don’t even add up to the salary of a Curry or a Jayson Tatum alone. Some corners of social media have reacted to the WNBA All-Stars T-shirts with the expected chortling and guffawing. But the post-Covid women’s sports boom shows no sign of abating, and the numbers as we know them seem to be on the players’ side. Public opinion is likely to follow.Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.“Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future.

She would wake every morning to a view of the sea, spend her days splashing in the surf, playing football on the sand with her brothers. They would talk into the night, eating and drinking, the waves crashing below them. These are her earliest and most treasured memories: Nettuno, the coastal town an hour south of Rome, where hernonnastill lives and which Alessia Russo still describes as her favourite place in the world.The story goes – and so fondly is it recounted in the Russo family that it has long since passed into lore – that one day Alfonso was up from Sicily, visiting Rome with a friend, when he saw a girl stepping on to a train at the railway station. No, not just a girl.Thegirl. Two fairly major issues: he didn’t know her, and it wasn’t his train. But Alfonso was a true romantic, the train was about to leave the station, and above all he knew that some moments in life just need to be seized.Euro 2025 power rankings: Spain still the team to beat but England in huntRead moreTurns out she was an English girl named Patricia, visiting Italy on a school trip. Problem number three: he didn’t speak English. But a fellow passenger was able to translate for them, the pair got talking, and after a fashion they fell in love. After another fashion, they ended up getting married. Seven decades later, their granddaughterwill play for England against Italyfor a place in a European Championship final.We are, in large part, who we once were: our bloodlines and our stories, stones carried along in the river. Perhaps this is even more apparent in women’s football, a sport in thrall to the journey, a collective inheritance passed down from the pioneers and the dreamers who built it in the shadows, to the ballers and the icons who play it today. Russo’s career has been built on her own talent, her own hard work, her own dedication and ambition. But it has also been shaped, irrevocably so, by forces wildly out of her control, by decisions taken before she even existed.So Alfonso moved to London in the 1950s, where he fell in love with the Busby Babes and established a lifelong passion for Manchester United. His son Mario played non-league, coached local kids, reared his two sons Giorgio and Luca in his own footballing obsession. And so by the time Alessia came into the world, in a sense her footballing life had already been built around her: endless games in the back garden, football on the television, blue box‑fresh Azzurri shirts to wear for major tournaments. Indeed, Mario still supports Italy in men’s football. But come Tuesday night, he will be a Lioness.View image in fullscreenAfter 120 minutes of hard running, Alessia Russo still found the energy – and courage – to fire the opening penalty past the Sweden goalkeeper, Jennifer Falk.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAOf course Alessia sounds English, wears the England No 23 shirt, plays with English brawn and guts. But sometimes when she gets animated, you see her hands flailing and gesturing with a quality that can only be described as “you know, quite Italian”. And as much as the game in Geneva on Tuesday night is a job to be done, it will surely also stir certain memories and emotions, the multivalent loyalties of those she loves, of those who came before her. Parents Mario and Carol. Grandparents Alfonso and Patricia. Uncle Bob and aunt Teresa, who died before she was born but after whom she takes one of her middle names.For all this, after thedrama of Thursday night in Zurich, the chaotic penalty shootout against Sweden in which Russo admitted later that she briefly lost track of the score, England will be deeply grateful for a simpler game in Geneva. Russo was slightly annoyed with her performance on Thursday, bleakly aware that had she taken one of the chances that had fallen to her in extra time, there would have been no need for penalties.Alessia RussoBut it was scarcely her fault that she was exhausted by that point, having spent more than 90 minutes grappling and chasing, forced to wait until the 93rd minute for her first attempt on goal. It was a measure of her patience and work ethic that she was still able to contribute in other ways: holding the ball up, running the channels, leading the press. But England’s job against Italy will be to get service to their most potent goal threat, to surround her with bodies and runners, to prevent her being isolated against a team that will have no issue defending for long periods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Norway were truly abject against them in the quarter-finals, but Italy also held Spain to their lowest expected goals of the tournament in a slightly harsh 3-1 defeat. The speed and the precision of their counterattacking suggests a strong degree of tactical drilling, with Arianna Caruso and Sofia Cantore the perfect foils for the great Cristiana Girelli, who at the age of 35 remains as devastatingly elusive as ever, still arguably one of the top six or eight pure centre-forwards on the planet.Quick GuideEngland v Italy: past three meetingsShowItaly 1-5 England, 27 Feb 2024, AlgecirasThe Lionesses started preparations for the Euro 2025 qualifiers perfectly, with a dominant win over Italy in south-west Spain. Lotte Wubben-Moy gave England the lead inside the first minute and Lauren Hemp scored twice to put England 3-0 ahead after 34 minutes.Le Azzurregot one back just before half-time through Michela Cambiaghi, but England cemented their dominance with second-half goals from Ella Toone and Rachel Daly to round off an impressive performance.England 2-1 Italy, 19 Feb 2023, CoventryEngland made it two out of two wins in the Arnold Clark Cup, thanks to two Daly headers either side of Sofia Cantore’s 62nd-minute equaliser. Italy could not contain Daly, who in addition to her goals, hit the crossbar just before half-time. The Lionesses broke the attendance record for a sporting event at the CBS Arena, drawing a crowd of 32,128.England 1-1 Italy, 7 April 2017, StokeEngland were held to a frustrating draw in their penultimate home match before Euro 2017. Italy scored with their only attempt on goal, which came from Valentina Cernoia minutes after Jodie Taylor opened the scoring in the 70th minute. The Lionesses dominated Mark Sampson’s 50th match in charge, with a whopping 23 shots to Italy’s six.Eze ObasiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Russo, too, is beginning to enter that conversation, even if she has been forced to wait for the recognition her talent deserves. And of course there are parallels here too with her upbringing, the way her brothers would make her go in goal in the garden, the way she was forced to leave Chelsea in search of regular football, the way she remained second choice to Ellen White at the last European Championship, the way she remains weirdly underrated by a lot of non-Arsenal fans, despite being probably two wins from being a very decent Ballon d’Or shout.Alfonso died a few years ago, before Alessia’s career really began to take off. He had Alzheimer’s disease, but even as his faculties began to desert him this lifelong football fanatic could still remember the teams he played for as a teenager. And this of course is the eternal power of football: its ability to cut across generations and borders, its universality, its enduring ability to teach us basic lessons about life. The train is leaving the station. Nobody knows what happens next. But some moments in life just need to be seized.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Alessia RussoEngland women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The £10m in add-ons for the France Under‑21 international relate to individual and club achievements. The deal amounts to €91m, €9m less than the €100m release clause in the forward’s contract.Ekitiké is poised to become the champions’ seventh signing of an ambitious summer transfer window, after Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Armin Pecsi and Freddie Woodman.The 23-year-old Frenchman has agreed in principle a six-year contract and is expected to join Arne Slot’s squad this week on their 10‑day pre‑season tour of Hong Kong and Japan. Liverpool arrived on Monday in Hong Kong in advance of their friendly against Milan on Saturday.Ekitiké is scheduled to undergo a medical in the UK on Tuesday before finalising his contract and flying to Hong Kong. Liverpool’s sporting director, Richard Hughes, and members of their medical staff remained in the UK to complete the transfer.Ekitiké scored 22 goals and made 12 assists in all competitions last season, his first in theBundesliga, as Eintracht qualified for the Champions League.

Of the 14 penalties taken, only five were scored. That led, predictably, to the usual tedious criticism of the women’s game and suggestions that the penalty spot should be moved closer to the goal.Which is, of course, nonsense. Four of the five penalties that were scored were excellent, hit firmly into the corners, and the other, the kick that turned out to be the winner, was smashed sensibly and without fuss, straight down the middle by Lucy Bronze as the goalkeeper Jennifer Falk dived out of the way. Two nights later, asGermany beat Francein a shootout, 12 of the 14 penalties were scored. In the Women’s Super League last season, 90.32% of penalties were converted. Nobody has used those examples to suggest moving the penalty spot further away to give goalkeepers more of a chance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It turns out that being one-and-a-half times further from the goal than the distance between the posts creates a scenario that feels fair and has a remarkable balance. That may in part be the result of familiarity, but at almost every level of the game in the 135 years since, roughly three-quarters of penalties have been scored. That is to say, the contest between striker and goalkeeper remained constant – a relative lack of power in the striker at junior level, for instance, matched by a lack of size in the goalkeeper.Before the Germany v France shootout on Saturday, only 12 of 29 penalties had been scored at the Euros – 41.38%. After the shootout, that percentage had risen to 57.14%. With small datasets there’s always a danger of interpreting random variations as patterns, but it did seem that panic had set in. Even before the high tension of England against Sweden, Norway’s former Ballon d’Or winner Ada Hegerberg had missed two penalties in the tournament, including, critically, in her country’squarter-final defeat to Italy.That, perhaps, was enough to plant a seed of doubt, which blossomed in England and Sweden’s shootout, when both sides suffered a collective loss of nerve. Anxiety is contagious and far from unknown in penalty shootouts: it happened, for instance, to Barcelona as they missed four out of four in a shootout against Steaua Bucharest in the 1986 European Cup final, and to Manchester United as theymissed four out of fiveagainst Sunderland in the 2014 League Cup semi-final. The England-Sweden contagion then seemed to escape the confines of its own shootout, as Spainmissed two penaltiesin beating Switzerland on Friday and Germany missed a penalty against France in the 90 minutes.England’s Hannah Hampton hits the headlines in latest act of unlikely careerRead moreThe shootout is perhaps the area of soccer in which psychology matters most. In the 2006 World Cup, Germany’s goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made great play of consulting notes he had scribbled on hotel notepaper and hidden in his sock before each Argentina penalty in the quarter-final. It turned out that, of the seven players he had jotted down, only two actually took penalties, but the belief he had specific knowledge was enough to unnerve Argentina, wholost the shootout 4–2.Goalkeepers increasingly have data to help inform their decisions. Germany’s keeper on Sunday, Ann-Katrin Berger, had notes taped to her water bottle. On TV, the names of only two French players were clearly visible: Amel Majri and Alice Sombath. In both cases, Berger was advised to dive left. She did and on each occasion saved the kick. Given Berger’s notes were shown clearly several minutes before the end of normal time, could somebody have informed the French staff who could then have passed on the message for at least some of their takers to change plan? Or would asking a player to vary from their preferred method of conversion itself make them more likely to miss? That’s part of the glorious game theory of penalties.At the moment, it feels like an arms race. VAR set goalkeepers back for a time, denying them the skip forward they habitually took as the penalty was taken. But goalkeepers have now worked out how to advance with one foot, the other remaining in contact with the goalline. As strikers have learned how to stagger their run to wait for the keeper to move first, so keepers have more data and can predict such subterfuge.In the Premier League last season, 83.13% of penalties were converted, which is on the high side historically, but actually a drop of just over 6% from the previous season. The season before that, only 74.75% were scored. In fact, what is striking when looking at penalty conversion rates over the past three decades is how little pattern there is – from a low of 65.75% in 2001–02 to the high of the season before last, and all points in between.Penalties are missed, penalties are scored, the taker’s cause is developed, and then the keeper’s, and sometimes panic sets in, yet somehow the proportion of penalties scored largely remains at 75-80%. Balance remains.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

That was how close a weary Italy were to extra time against Norway in atense quarter-final in Geneva. It was clear from the frayed nerves and unusually dishevelled appearance of the coaching staff on Italy’s bench that they were concerned those on the field did not have much left in the tank. All their stamina and emotions had been left on the pitch after almost 90 energy‑sapping minutes of a game they knew they should be winning.What they seemed to forget for a minute, however, was that they have Cristiana Girelli. Their talismanic centre-forward can do many things on a football pitch but nothing is more certain than her scoring goals. They needed just one chance, one delivery and the odds were on that their captain would take it.Euro 2025 power rankings: Spain still the team to beat but England in huntRead moreThat moment came: a pinpoint Sofia Cantore cross, an intelligent run by Girelli to lose the full-back, and an angled header that had one destination.It was a goal emblematic of Girelli’s career, which has spanned the best part of two decades, and sent Italy into a European Championship semi-final for the first time since 1997. With 122 caps and 61 goals across 12 years, Girelli has been at the forefront ofLe Azzurre’s past six major tournament appearances and is widely considered among her peers and fans as one of the best to pull on the shirt.Girelli has played her entire career in Italy, bridging the gap from amateur to full-time, with Serie A Femminile going fully professional in 2022. She has spent seven seasons with Juventus and finished the last campaign as the league’s top scorer with 19 goals that propelledLe Bianconereto their first title in three years.Quick GuideEngland v Italy: past three meetingsShowItaly 1-5 England, 27 Feb 2024, AlgecirasThe Lionesses started preparations for the Euro 2025 qualifiers perfectly, with a dominant win over Italy in south-west Spain.

Italy scored with their only attempt on goal, which came from Valentina Cernoia minutes after Jodie Taylor opened the scoring in the 70th minute.

Although her movement in the area, aerial ability and instinctive finishing are second to none, she is more than a penalty box poacher. She loves to drop deeper and help to build from the pocket, is potent from free-kicks and, as shown in theGroup C draw with Portugal, has the ability to score from distance.In the quarter-final, she not only scored twice but made six recoveries and led the way for Italy in terms of duels won (eight), touches in the opposition box (seven) and shots on target. It was a performance that illustrated her capabilities at defending from the front as much as her threat in front of goal.View image in fullscreenCristiana Girelli signals to the Italian fans after scoring against Norway.Photograph: Francesco Farina/SPP/ShutterstockGirelli wears her heart on her sleeve. The emotion she feels representing her country and bringing them success runs deep. This has never been more evident than when the final whistle blew on Wednesday night. Having barely had time to rest after being substituted, she ran on to the field in disbelief, hands to her head, before embracing Barbara Bonansea, a player with whom she has spent so much of her journey.The two centurions’ careers have been inextricably linked, their national team debuts coming six months apart and Girelli moving to Juventus a year after Bonansea. The latter deserves just as much credit for Italy’s development. The tears flowed and the celebrations were euphoric. Girelli turned photographer temporarily for a picture in front of Italy’s fans as they started to realise what they had achieved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I felt something different – something special – in this team. I’ve seen a special light in the eyes of my teammates … It’s history for Italian women’s football. I’m so happy and proud for this team.”The progress of the women’s game in Italy has been slow, with less investment and accessibility than in other top European footballing nations. It has meant that Girelli has failed to receive due praise, something Italy’s manager, Andrea Soncin, alluded to on Wednesday. “Throughout her career, she’s received less recognition than she truly deserves, both for her technical ability and her character,” he said.View image in fullscreenCristiana Girelli buries her last-minute header past Norway’s goalkeeper Cecilie Fiskerstrand.Photograph: Salvatore Di Nolfi/EPAIn the semi-finals await England, where there has been no lack of support in recent years. For Girelli, it could be her last appearance at a major international tournament. It is uncertain how long she can continue and she told AFP on Saturday that this would be her last European Championship.However, she and her teammates will be determined this journey does not end just yet. Italy are on the verge of something monumental, one win from a game that could massively improve the trajectory of the sport back home. Girelli’s legacy is written but her last contribution to a nation she has served for so long could yet be the biggest of all.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Italy women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The one thing people will ask is whether you have any regrets or anything you wish you would have done, and I don’t. Because of that, in my mind I’m like: you gave it your all. There’s nothing I can sit here and say I should have done or could have done.”Parris, who has scored 17 goals in 74 games for England, spent two seasons at Manchester United before joining Brighton and has had spells at Arsenal, Lyon, Manchester City and Everton. She has won the league in both France and England, as well as three FA Cups, a Coupe de France and a Champions League, won with Lyon.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueLondon City LionessesBrighton & Hove Albion WomenWomen's footballTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

We were going about it in the right manner.”India’s Mohammed Siraj, who was fined 15% of his match fee for his aggressive reaction to the dismissal of Duckett on the morning of day four, said he plans to continue along similar lines this week.Quick GuideEngland name team for fourth TestShowEngland have announced their team for this week’s fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, with Liam Dawson’s return to the side after an eight-year absence, replacing the injured Shoaib Bashir, the only change to the side that took a 2-1 lead in the series by winning the third game at Lord’s.Bashir sustained a multiple break of the little finger on his left hand while fielding at Lord’s, and though he returned to bat in England’s second innings and to bowl on the final day – taking the decisive wicket of Mohammed Siraj to end the game – the injury required surgery and he has been ruled out of the remainder of the series.“We’re going to miss Bash. He’s bowled exceptionally well and as we saw last week, he’s got tremendous fight,” said Harry Brook. “The way he came back out with a broken finger – he did an amazing bit of fielding on the boundary just before he got that last wicket. Just to come back out and get that wicket with a broken finger in two or three places showed an exceptional character.”Dawson, a left-armer 14 years Bashir’s senior, has a first class batting average of 35.29, compared with Bashir’s 8.27. He will bat at No 8, pushing Chris Woakes down to nine – where he has batted only twice in the last five years and averaged 58.94 in 18 Test innings.“He’s a wily old fox, very experienced and very skilful,” Brook said of Dawson. “He’s played everywhere, played against everyone so hopefully he can have an amazing performance. Hopefully he can land it in the footholes and create a bit of spice and some opportunities to take wickets. He’s adding to our strength in batting as well.”Simon BurntonEngland team to play India at Old Trafford: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Liam Dawson, Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“When you’re in the moment and a batsman is playing well, sometimes you say something to get into his head,” he said. “I think players need sledging sometimes. It can disrupt a batter’s concentration. As a fast bowler, it’s fun when those mind games happen.”With doubts over the availability of another seamer, Akash Deep, owing to a groin injury, India are expected to field Jasprit Bumrah at Old ­Trafford rather than hold him back for next week’s final Test at the Oval with the 31-year-old reportedly only able to play three of the five Tests in the series.After the Lord’s Test, England were punished for their slow over rates, and though Brook said the subject had not been discussed by the team he admitted improvements could be made. “I think there were 75 overs in a day last week, which is pretty poor,” he said. “You’re losing 15 overs a day – you can bowl a side out in 15 overs. I think that was both teams, if I’m being honest. We can be quicker, they can definitely be quicker at stages. In my opinion, when they’re batting it affects us a lot because they’re always changing their gloves or getting treatment or whatever. There’s got to be something happen there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But afterthe stage to Carcassonne on Sunday, during which the double Tour champion was deserted by some of his teammates just when he needed them most, the task of overthrowing Pogacar looks doubly daunting.“We have to try to do something,” he said, and insisted that he was willing to risk everything to win. “There needs to be a weakness somewhere on Tadej’s part. For now, we haven’t found it, but we’ll keep trying. I’m willing to sacrifice second place to go for first.”If he is to achieve an unlikely coup, he will need more convincing support that he has received to date. The debacle on Sunday, during which Vingegaard was chasing back after a crash while others in his team drove the pace at the front, prompted much soul‑searching in Denmark.Bjarne Riis, the first Dane to win the Tour in 1996, who subsequently confessed to doping, blasted Vingegaard’s teammates when speaking to the Danish newspaper BT. “Their racing style is completely hopeless,” he said.“I don’t understand it at all. After Sunday’s stage, you have to wonder whether Jonas should look for another team. They clearly don’t see him as a priority. That’s disappointing to see.”Echoing comments made by Vingegaard’s wife, and personal manager, Trine Vingegaard Hansen, before the Tour began, Riis said: “Wout Van Aert is clearly more interested in riding his own Tour than in helping Vingegaard.“The management has promised Van Aert that he can do what he wants, and that is going to cause conflicts. Give Jonas some respect.”View image in fullscreenTadej Pogacar smiles as he crosses the finish line after stage 15.Photograph: Luca Betinni/GodingImages/ShutterstockA relaxed Pogacar, meanwhile, was enthusing about the happy atmosphere within his own team, saying: “I’m really enjoying this Tour. The group that we have here, the teammates and on the bus, at dinner, breakfast, it’s super nice. If I need to come to the Tour every year, I’ll just come for the boys and the atmosphere and nothing else.”Pogacar is confident of final victory. “I mean, I have to be,” he said. But he remains respectful towards his Danish rival. “I’m pretty sure that Jonas can be confident as well, because he’s in really good shape. I need to keep focused, I need to keep eating well, sleeping well, and keep this mood that we have in this group, keep up the motivation.“I think it’s going to be tough, but we are ready for a fight with everybody, especially with Jonas.”Pogacar said he felt that this year’s route was designed to “scare” him and favour Vingegaard. “We’ve been to Hautacam and we are going to Mont Ventoux and Col de la Loze, where Jonas dropped me [in the past] all three times.“I actually like all these climbs. I like Mont Ventoux, it’s super iconic, and Col de la Loze is one of the hardest climbs I’ve ever done in my career. I will not say that I’m looking for revenge – I just want to have better legs than in the past.”Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Jonas VingegaardTadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

They have also questioned its legality, as the proposed expansion,straddling the boroughs of Merton and Wandsworth,would be onmetropolitan open land, which has the same protected status as green belt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The scaling up of facilities is necessary for players and to maintain the prestige of the grand slam tournament, it says.The dispute goes back to 1993 when the All England club bought the golf course land from Merton council for £5.2m. It signed a covenant agreeing it would not use the land other than for leisure, recreational purposes or as open space. The campaign group, which raised £200,000 before the review, believes the proposals have violated that pledge.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the ruling. He said the plans would “cement Wimbledon’s reputation as the greatest tennis competition in the world and London as the sporting capital of the world.“This scheme will bring a significant range of economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits to the local area, the wider capital and the UK economy, creating new jobs and green spaces.”Planning permission for the expansion was first granted by the London deputy mayor Jules Pipe, who said the proposals would deliver benefits that “clearly outweigh the harm”.Explore more on these topicsWimbledonTennisLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Scottie Schefflerdescribed in a press conferencebefore the Open how he keeps asking himself why he wants to win golf tournaments and can’t find any answers. The world No 3 men’s tennis player Alexander Zverev confessed to feelings of emptiness and a lack of joy in his tennis regardless of whether he wins or loses matches. The Wimbledon women’s singles runner-up Amanda Anisimova took a long break from tennis to preserve her mental health, was written off by many and unsure what to expect on return, yetended up in the SW19 final.What’s going on? As the world’s top athletes naturally push the boundaries of what’s possible physically, so they also have to push the limits mentally, and these questions and experiences are a vital part of that process.Scheffler is compared to Tiger Woods after a win that rarely seemed in doubt | Sean IngleRead moreWe’re seeing more and more athletes explore the space beyond winning and losing, a concept many in sport have yet to understand actually exists. But as most athletes find out, some sooner than others, to get caught up with winning and losing is to lose the point, both on the court and in life.Finding a purpose behind the pursuit of trophies now forms a key part of an athlete’s mental journey to reach and sustain their highest levels of performance. And, typical of elite performance, it’s not an easy path.Scheffler explained before and aftertriumphing at Royal Portrushthat winning tournaments brought a positive sense of achievement but that thisshouldn’t be mistaken for deep, lasting fulfilment. In many ways, it’s a healthy questioning attitude. Scheffler is largely in a good place: he still enjoys playing, while keenly aware that winning a golf tournament can never be the be all and end all. But he is aware he doesn’t yet have a good enough answer to the question: “Why do I want to win this championship so badly?”View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler chips on to the 12th green – he later said winning the Open was ‘a cool feeling … but it doesn’t fulfil the deepest desires of my heart’..Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnisimova was facing burnout two years ago and knew she had to step away. This time off allowed her to reconnect with herself and redefine why she wanted to play tennis again. She said many people told her she would never make it back if she took time out – one wonders whose interests they were looking after or whether they understood the need to nurture an athlete’s mental and emotional health as much as the physical and physiological side. Zverev seems to sense he must find a different route and knows the answer isn’t about winning or losing.Scheffler, Anisimova and Zverev each prove age‑old findings of biology, psychology and philosophy that humans need meaning in our lives beyond immediate, material gains. Whether you look at the top level of the psychologist Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, return to the Greek Stoic philosophers, or open up the psychiatrist and Auschwitz survivor Viktor Frankl’s classic work Man’s Search for Meaning, the prime motivating force in humans is to find meaning and purpose in life. Trophies are fun, and we all enjoy them. But as Scheffler reminds us, those celebrations last only a few minutes and won’t ever “fill the deepest wants and desires of my heart”.It’s important to note these athletes are not saying winning doesn’t matter. It’s just not the only thing and, as winning is by its nature temporary and shallow, it’s insufficient to sustain the highest levels of performance. Asking “what’s the point of sport?” can feel dangerous, almost heretical, but it’s clearly a powerful thought process to sustain any athlete wanting to explore their full potential.View image in fullscreenAmanda Anisimova, on her way to defeat in the Wimbledon final, previously took time out from the game to look after her mental health.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianFinding reasons why sport matters can look different for different athletes but typically involves the awareness of the person that you are becoming through the pursuit of sporting excellence, the depth of connection that you have with friends, family and wider communities that you belong to, and, over time, the lasting positive impact or legacy you might leave.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionGiving athletes space and support to explore how they find meaning from their sporting journey is becoming a critical quality for coaches to support and facilitate. But it’s a world away from many coaching development routes which have for decades emphasised technical and tactical excellence. Even in the world of sports psychology where there is greatest skill in this area, it’s not what is often requested from coaches or performance directors.Organisations including Switch the Play, the True Athlete Project, ACT and the Jacobs Futura Foundation have woken up to the need to help athletes transition out of sport at the end of their careers, alongside various companies that offer athlete transition programmes. What is becoming clear is that those conversations about purpose, identity and social impact need to come much earlier in an athlete’s career, long before they retire.An interesting consequence that follows when athletes do have a strong sense of meaning, purpose and connection is less difference between the emotional states of winners and losers. Both winning and losing prove useful in the pursuit of connection with others and the process of self-discovery and character development, reinforcing values and virtues such as resilience, courage, gratitude, and humility.We saw this demonstrated by the Wimbledon men’s singles finalists and top two players in the world,Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, whose speeches were remarkably similar and based largely on gratitude, humility and accepting loss. Alcaraz clarified that losses hurt but were “not failures” and Sinner emphasised how important it had been to “accept” his loss a few weeks earlierat the French Open. They had given everything to win Wimbledon but were both immediately grounded that who they are isn’t changed by the result and that they are playing a bigger game.Performance sport shows us contenders at the top of their game whose incredible feats of human possibility now go beyond the field of play. As Sinner said just after holding the Wimbledon trophy for the first time: “We just keep pushing and trying to become a better tennis player, but mostly a better person.” That’s the way to find the mental edge, whatever game you’re playing.Explore more on these topicsScottie SchefflerThe OpenGolfTennisPsychologyUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

It is the second time the organization has reported ads by the same publishers to Meta. In a previous investigation from December 2024, Ekō flagged 98 ads to Meta, prompting the tech giant to take many of them down. However, the company has largely allowed the publishers to start new campaigns with identical ads since then. The IDF itself is not running the fundraising calls.“This shows that Meta will literally take money from anybody,” said Ekō campaigner Maen Hammad. “So little of the checks and balances the platform ought to be doing actually takes place and if it does, they’ll do it after the fact.”Meta said it reviewed and removed the ads for violating company policy after the Guardian and Ekō reached out for comment, according to Ryan Daniels, a spokesperson for the social media firm. Any ads aboutsocial issues, elections or politics are required to go through an authorization process and include a disclaimer that discloses who is paying for the ad, the company said. These ads did not.These ads garnered at least 76,000 impressions – a term that indicates the number of times an ad is shown to a user – in the EU and UK alone, according to Ekō.

These quadcopters are primarily used for photography and can be purchased on Amazon, but IDF units are retrofitting the machines with grenades, primarily because they are orders of magnitude cheaper than military-grade drones, according toseveral IDF soldiers who spoke to +972 anonymously.“Most of our drones are broken and falling apart—and we don’t have any replacements,”another ad reads. “Donate now—every second counts, every drone saves lives.”While it’s unclear if these combat units used funds received from these particular ads to purchase drones, soldiers told +972 they did receive cheap drones, manufactured by a Chinese firm called Autel, through donations and fundraisers as well as Facebook groups.Fundraising ads from one of the publishers Ekō identified, Vaad Hatzedaka, links to a donation page that lists the variety of equipment the organization is fundraising for, including two Autel drones. Vaad Hatzedaka, a non-profit, has raised more than $250,000 of its $300,000 goal to provide these drones and other aid to various IDF units, according to the donation page. The second publisher, Mayer Malik, a singer-songwriter based inIsrael, has published ads linking to a landing page that includes sponsorship opportunities for various pieces of tactical equipment, among them an Autel thermal drone. Malik has raised more than $2.2m in total donations for the IDF.Meta’s ad policy prohibits mostattemptsto donate, gift, buy, sell or transfer “firearms, firearm parts, ammunition, explosives, or lethal enhancements” with some exceptions. While Meta has taken down this recent crop of ads as well as some of the ads fundraising for military equipment Ekō previously flagged, the company did so because the content lacked a disclaimer required for ads aroundsocial issues, elections or politics, according to disclosures included in the Meta ad library.The ads may also violate certain terms of the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), according to Ekō. Under the DSA, platforms like Meta are required to take down content that violate national or EU law. In France and the UK, laws limit whether and how charities can fundraise for foreign militaries. In the UK, for instance, in January 2025, the Charity Commission issued anofficial warningto a London charity that was raising funds for an IDF soldier and said it was “not lawful, or acceptable”.Explore more on these topicsMetaPalestinian territoriesAdvertisingIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaCrowdfundingnewsShareReuse this content"

We can choose otherwiseGarrison LovelyMon 21 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 13.44 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Petra Péterffy/The Guardian“Technology happens because it is possible,” OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman,toldthe New York Times in 2019, consciously paraphrasing Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb.Altman captures a Silicon Valley mantra: technology marches forward inexorably.Another widespread techie conviction is that the first human-level AI – also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) – will lead to one of two futures: a post-scarcitytechno-utopiaor theannihilation of humanity.Forcountless other species, the arrival of humansspelleddoom. We weren’t tougher, faster or stronger – just smarter and better coordinated. In many cases, extinction was an accidental byproduct of some other goal we had. A true AGI would amount to creating anew species, which might quicklyoutsmartoroutnumberus. It could see humanity as a minor obstacle, like ananthillin the way of a planned hydroelectric dam, or aresource to exploit, like the billions of animals confined in factory farms.Altman, along with the heads of the other top AI labs, believes that AI-driven extinction is areal possibility(joining hundreds of leading AI researchers and prominent figures).Given all this, it’s natural to ask: should we really try to build a technology that may kill us all if it goes wrong?What's the appeal of AI? It will always reassure you | Zoe WilliamsRead morePerhaps the most common reply says: AGI is inevitable. It’s just too useful not to build. After all, AGI would be the ultimate technology – what a colleague of Alan Turingcalled“the last invention that man need ever make”. Besides, the reasoning goes within AI labs, if we don’t, someone else will do it – less responsibly, of course.A new ideology out of Silicon Valley,effective accelerationism(e/acc),claimsthat AGI’s inevitability is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics and that its engine is “technocapital”. The e/accmanifestoasserts: “This engine cannot be stopped. The ratchet of progress only ever turns in one direction. Going back is not an option.”ForAltmanand e/accs, technology takes on a mystical quality – the march of invention is treated as a fact of nature. But it’s not. Technology is the product of deliberate human choices, motivated by myriad powerful forces. We have the agency to shape those forces, and history shows that we’ve done it before.No technology is inevitable, not even something as tempting as AGI.Some AI worriers like topoint outthe timeshumanity resisted and restrained valuable technologies.Fearing novel risks, biologists initiallybannedand then successfullyregulatedexperiments on recombinant DNA in the 1970s.No human has been reproduced viacloning, even though it’s beentechnically possiblefor over a decade, and the only scientist to genetically engineer humans wasimprisonedfor his efforts.Nuclear powercan provideconsistent, carbon-free energy, but vivid fears of catastrophe havemotivatedstifling regulations andoutright bans.And if Altman weremore familiarwith the history of the Manhattan Project, he might realize that the creation of nuclear weapons in 1945was actuallya highly contingent and unlikely outcome,motivatedby a mistaken belief that the Germans were ahead in a “race” for the bomb. Philip Zelikow, the historian who led the 9/11 Commission,said: “I think had the United States not built an atomic bomb during the Second World War, it’s actually not clear to mewhenor possibly evenifan atomic bomb ever is built.”It’s now hard to imagine a world without nuclear weapons. But in a little-known episode, then president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachevnearly agreedto ditch all their bombs (a misunderstanding over the “Star Wars” satellite defense system dashed these hopes). Even though the dream of full disarmament remains just that, nuke counts areless than20% of their 1986 peak, thanks largely tointernational agreements.These choices weren’t made in a vacuum. Reagan was astaunch opponentof disarmament before themillions-strongNuclear Freeze movement got to him. In 1983, hecommentedto his secretary of state : “If things get hotter and hotter and arms control remains an issue, maybe I should go see [Soviet leader Yuri] Andropov and propose eliminating all nuclear weapons.”There are extremely strong economic incentives to keep burning fossil fuels, but climate advocacy haspried openthe Overton window and significantly accelerated our decarbonization efforts.In April 2019, the young climate groupExtinction Rebellion(XR)broughtLondon to a halt, demanding the UK target net-zero carbon emissions by 2025. Their controversial civil disobedience prompted parliament todeclarea climate emergency and the Labour party to adopt a 2030targetto decarbonize the UK’selectricity production.The Sierra Club’sBeyond Coalcampaign was lesser-known butwildly effective. In just its first five years, the campaign helped shutter more than one-third of US coal plants.Thanksprimarilyto its move from coal, US per capita carbon emissionsare nowlower than they were in 1913.In many ways, the challenge of regulating efforts to build AGI is much smaller than that of decarbonizing.Eighty-two percentof global energy production comes from fossil fuels. Energy is what makes civilization work, but we’re not dependent on a hypothetical AGI to make the world go round.Further, slowing and guiding the development of future systems doesn’t mean we’d need to stop using existing systems or developing specialist AIs to tackle important problems in medicine, climate and elsewhere.The trouble with AI art isn’t just lack of originality. It’s something far bigger | Eric ReinhartRead moreIt’s obvious why so many capitalists are AI enthusiasts: they foresee a technology that can achieve their long-time dream of cutting workers out of the loop (and the balance sheet).But governments are not profit maximizers. Sure, they care about economic growth, but they also care about things like employment, social stability, market concentration, and, occasionally, democracy.It’s far less clear how AGI would affect these domains overall. Governments aren’t prepared for a world where most people are technologically unemployed.Capitalists often get what they want, particularly in recent decades, and the boundless pursuit of profit may undermine any regulatory effort to slow the speed of AI development. But capitalists don’talwaysget what they want.At a bar in San Francisco in February, a longtimeOpenAIsafety researcher pronounced to a group that the e/accs shouldn’t be worried about the “extreme” AI safety people, because they’ll never have power. The boosters should actually be afraid of AOC and Senator Josh Hawley because they “can really fuck things up for you”.Assuming humans stick around for many millennia, there’s no way to know we won’t eventually build AGI. But this isn’t really what the inevitabilists are saying. Instead, the message tends to be: AGI is imminent. Resistance is futile.But whether we build AGI in five, 20 or 100 yearsreally matters. And the timeline is far more in our control than the boosters will admit. Deep down, I suspect many of them realize this, which is why they spend so much effort trying to convince others that there’s no point in trying. Besides, if you think AGI is inevitable, why bother convincing anybody?We actuallyhadthe computing power required to train GPT-2 more than a decade before OpenAI actually did it, but people didn’t know whether it was worth doing.But right now, the top AI labs are locked in such a fierce race that theyaren’t implementingall the precautions that even their own safety teams want. (One OpenAI employeeannouncedrecently that he quit “due to losing confidence that it would behave responsibly around the time of AGI”.) There’s a “safety tax” that labs can’t afford to pay if they hope to stay competitive; testingslowsproduct releases and consumes company resources.Governments, on the other hand, aren’t subject to the same financial pressures.An inevitabilist tech entrepreneur recentlysaidregulating AI development is impossible “unless you control every line of written code”. That might be true if anyone could spin up an AGI on their laptop. But it turns out that building advanced, general AI modelsrequiresenormous arrays of supercomputers, with chips produced by anabsurdly monopolisticindustry. Because of this, many AI safety advocates see “compute governance” as a promising approach. Governments could compel cloud computing providers to halt next generation training runs that don’t comply with establishedguardrails. Far from locking out upstarts or requiring Orwellian levels of surveillance, thresholds could be chosen to only affect players who can afford to spendmore than $100mon a single training run.Governments do have to worry about international competition and the risk of unilateral disarmament, so to speak. Butinternational treatiescan be negotiated to widely share the benefits from cutting-edge AI systems while ensuring that labs aren’t blindly scaling up systems theydon’t understand.And while the world may feel fractious, rival nations have cooperated to surprising degrees.For Silicon Valley, AI isn’t just about replacing some jobs. It’s about replacing all of them | Ed Newton-RexRead moreThe Montreal Protocolfixedthe ozone layer by banning chlorofluorocarbons. Most of the world has agreed to ethically motivated bans on militarily useful weapons, such asbiologicalandchemical weapons,blinding laser weapons, and “weather warfare”.In the 1960s and 70s, many analystsfearedthat every country that could build nukes, would. Butmostof the world’s roughly three-dozen nuclear programswere abandoned. This wasn’t the result of happenstance, but rather the creation of a global nonproliferation norm through deliberate statecraft, like the 1968Non-Proliferation Treaty.On the few occasions when Americans were asked if they wanted superhuman AI,largemajoritiessaid “no”. Opposition to AIhas grownas the technology has become more prevalent. When people argue that AGI is inevitable, what they’re really saying is that the popular will shouldn’t matter. The boosters see the masses as provincial neo-Luddites who don’t know what’s good for them. That’s why inevitability holds such rhetorical allure for them; it lets them avoid making their real argument, which they know is a loser in the court of public opinion.The draw of AGI is strong. But the risks involved are potentially civilization-ending. A civilization-scale effort is needed to compel the necessary powers to resist it.Technology happens because people make it happen. We can choose otherwise.Garrison Lovely is a freelance journalist"

It pains me to say that they are now microwaving it.Hear that sound? It’s King Arthur weeping.Or maybe they’re doing it right. Maybe they’re sick of making tea in an old, limescale-filled, single-use appliance.But that’s traditional!It doesn’t matter. A survey of just over 2,000 UK energy bill payersby Uswitchhas found that 58% of under-30s have used a microwave to make a cuppa, and one in six say they do it every day.Why?

Dr Tim Bond from the Tea Advisory Panel says thatmicrowaves heat water unevenly, which leads to uneven tea extraction, which leads to a stewed flavour.Then why microwave water at all?Well, the answer may be twofold. For one thing, student halls are increasingly prohibiting the use of kettles due to steam setting off alarms, so some young people at university are forced to nuke their water in a microwave …What’s the other reason?The American influence.The what?Americans typically don’t use electric kettles, so they are more likely to microwave their water. Perhaps people who grow up consuming US culture are starting to believe that it’s the norm.Wow. First they elected Trump, and now this.It’s OK.

The tidbit spread over social media, cementing the33-year-old democratic socialist’s status as a millennial everyman. A subsequent Cosmopolitan headlineread: “Zohran Mamdani could make history (as the first NYC mayor to meet his wife on Hinge).”Representatives for Hinge would not comment, but plenty of eligible New Yorkers did, claiming they would redownload the app due to Mamdani’s success, in spite of theirdating fatigue. “Now I’m clocking in like it’s a full-time job,” one userpostedon TikTok. “If he can find love on that app maybe I can,” anotherwrotein a caption.However, they could run into an ideological hurdle while filling out their profiles. Alongside answering basic questions – “Do you smoke, drink or do drugs? Where did you go to college?” – Hinge ask singles to choose their political affiliation: liberal, conservative, moderate, not political, or the mysterious “other”.With the return of Trump in the last two years, it’s important to have [your politics] out thereDennis MulvenaSome people to the left say the label “liberal” does not encapsulate their socialist views. They associate it with establishment figures such as Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama – or Mamdani’s rival, former governorAndrew Cuomo. Many liberals deem proposals by Hinge’s golden boy (freezing rent, taxing the super-rich, making buses free) too radical. A socialist might want to distance themselves from such center-leaning liberalism and instead embrace the “hot commie summer” that hedge fund manager Daniel Loebwarnedhis fellow billionaires of.“There’s a real appetite to date leftists now,” said Abby Beauregard,fundraising chair for Democratic Socialists of America’sNew Yorkchapter. She said that Mamdani’s victory reinvigorated the dating scene in in the city, “but it’s really hard to find explicitly leftist dating spaces. Most dating apps have a liberal option, but no leftist option, and it’s not a turn-on to see ‘other’, because that could mean anything.” (For instance, far-right or communist.)So lefty singles are finding more explicit ways to signal their politics to like-minded love matches, on Hinge and beyond.View image in fullscreen‘There’s a nice feeling on the apps right now with people being proud to be communists or leftists,’ said Caroline, 38, who lives in Queens.Photograph: oatawa/Getty Images/iStockphotoSome have turned their dating profiles into mini-manifestos, writing out their entire belief system as answers to the apps’ prompts. It’s common to see watermelon emojis aseuphemisms for solidaritywith the Palestinian people. Some users will warn that they’ll swipe left on Terfs (the acronym for trans-exclusionary radical feminists), cops or Donald Trump supporters.“It’s important for me to see those signifiers,” said Caroline, a 38-year-old florist who lives in Queens. (She and other sources are going by their first name for privacy reasons.) “There’s a nice feeling on the apps right now with people being proud to be communists or leftists, and they’re saying that.”But she’s wary of anyone who comes off astoolefty. “That seems kind of tryhard,” she said. “It can read as too performative, that you’re fishing for alt-girls or you’re a centrist who just wants someone freaky fromBushwick.”Tinder, OK Cupid and the kink-friendly app Feeld allow users to write their own bios, unlike Hinge, and they can choose within those bios whether they reveal their political affiliations. In the lead-up to the 2024 election,Tinderalso launched profile “stickers” so users could signal the issues they felt strongly about, such as “voting for reproductive rights”.For her part, Caroline, who uses Feeld, wrote in her profile that she’s “far left” and “COVID-cautious”. That feels like enough for her. “Saying ‘I love vaccines!’, ‘free Palestine!’ or ‘fuck Trump!’ would be trite. It’s all implied.”Dennis Mulvena describes himself as “very left-leaning”. He used to keep his affiliations private on Hinge because he believed there was room for nuance in discussing politics, but recently listed himself as liberal.“With the return of Trump in the last two years, it’s important to have that out there,” said Mulvena, 30, who works in customer service for a car manufacturer. “Admittedly gay people who live in Brooklyn tend to lean left, but I have had the experience of going on a date with someone who then revealed he was part of his college’s Young Republicans club.” That was the last time he assumed that everyone he matched with would share the same views as him.According to anNBC News pollfrom April, the partisan gap between gen Z women, who are more likely to say they are Democrat, and gen Z men, who have shifted right, is the widest of all generations. And, increasingly, a person’s politics have an impact on their perceived desirability. While past generations may have thought nothing about a conservative and liberal romantic pairing (“don’t talk about politics or religion at the dinner table”), 60% of 18- to 24-year-oldsthinkit’s important to date or marry someone who shares their political beliefs.“Politics is the new religion,” said Dr Jess Carbino, a former sociologist for Bumble and Tinder who studies dating apps. “It’s become the way that people choose to frame how they look at the world and their values.”There’s definitely an energy when I wear my Zohran T-shirt out [...] It’s a real conversation starterLaurenLily, a 23 year-old socialist who was recently laid off, is wary of seeing someone identify as “not political” on Hinge. “I’m immediately scared of what that means,” they said. “As a queer person living through everything that’s happening in this country, I need to know someone has a baseline care for people and their community.”In New York, more voters between the ages of 25 and 34 – a mix of gen Z and younger millennials –turned out to votein the Democratic primary than any other age cohort, indicating a vigor for leftist politics. Recently, Lily has seen young people write on Hinge that they’d only go out with someone who voted for Mamdani or that they’d never go out with a Cuomo supporter. They have seen multiple people answer the Hinge prompt “when was the last time you cried?” with: “when Zohran won”. (They presume these were happy tears.)This is not to say New York is a young Bolshevik paradise: conservatives in the city are also trying to find each other. Some have gone into voluntary exile from mainstream dating apps, creating their own options. “Our dating apps have gone woke,” reads the description forDate Right Stuff, one such app backed by Peter Thiel. “Connect with people who aren’t offended by everything.”In March, Date Right Stuffhosteda singles event at New York’s Trump Tower called “make America hot again”. It was a coming-out night for what the app’s former chief marketing officer Raquel Debono called “city conservatives”, or Republicans who prefer urban life to small towns and tradwifedom.They are not the only ones going off-app: the Mamdani effect on New York’s lefties could not be contained to Hinge.‘I’m not interested in someone passive about Gaza’: how views on the war have changed dating in AmericaRead moreIn early July, young people gathered inside a cocktail bar on the Lower East Side for a “sexy socialist singles” event hosted by New York’s DSA. Those looking for something casual – or, as the host put it, “if you just want fast and free, like Zohran’s buses” – were sent to one part of the bar, while those who wanted “a slow burn, like taxing the fucking rich” went to another. At one point, organizers directed polyamorous attendees to a room upstairs, where they could mingle with other non-monogamous individuals.Upstairs, Sven, 25, an economics master’s student who lives in Bushwick, said that young people view the DSA as a social club just as much as a platform for socialist candidates. “I saw a post on Reddit talking about how allZohran’s canvassers are hot, and we have soccer leagues and book clubs,” they said. “It’s a great way to make friends.”Downstairs, back in monogamyville, Lauren, a video editor who lives in Astoria (the Queens neighborhood Mamdani represents as a New York assemblymember), waited for a friend who was off flirting. “There’s definitely an energy when I wear my Zohran T-shirt out,” she said. “People are revved up. They’ll call you from across the street saying, ‘What’s up?’ or ‘I love that guy.’ It’s a real conversation starter.”New York’s DSA will continue its sexy socialist mixers in youth hubs Bushwick and Williamsburg, and in the Upper West Side for those over 30. In the meantime, singles will have to keep parsing political signifiers on dating apps.Explore more on these topicsDatingOnline datingNew YorkZohran MamdaniTinderUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The report aims to quantify “structured inequalities” in Silicon Valley, and measures “pain” as “both personal and community distress or suffering”.This year’s index reports that the wealth divide has widened in Silicon Valley at double the rate of the whole United States over the past decade. The nine wealthiest households in the valley control $683.2bn – a $136bn increase over the past year.At the same time, 110,000 households reported nearly none or no assets.The cost of living in Silicon Valley has risen as well: renters must earn $136,532 to afford an apartment – the highest in the nation.The report ranked San Jose No 4 in “impossibly unaffordable” cities worldwide (after Hong Kong, Sydney and Vancouver). Yet, no cities in Silicon Valley have raised the minimum wage in the past three years. The report finds that 54,582 low-income households do not have access to an affordable home in San Jose and that homelessness grew 8.2% from 2023.When they created the Silicon Valley Pain Index in 2020, shortly after the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, San Jose State University researchers were inspired by the Katrina Pain Index, which aimed to quantify the injustices New Orleans residents faced after Hurricane Katrina. The index continues to show stark racial inequalities.Hispanic workers in San Jose, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara can expect to make 33 cents for every $1 their white peers take home. And although shareholders have voiced commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion, only 3% of employees working in research and development at Apple are Black (compared with 6% Hispanic/Latino, 36% white and 50% Asian).Meanwhile, police violence remains a real concern – even years after the Black Lives Matter protests. Ten people died in police custody in the Santa Clara county sheriff’s office in 2024 – the highest in two decades. And San Jose reported five office involved shootings, up three from 2023.However, the report did note certain improvements in the Silicon Valley area – including a decrease in police use of force incidents in San Jose, an expansion in services to prevent homelessness and environmental sustainability programs.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaSilicon ValleyUS income inequalityWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

But the teams and their fans have largely moved onMon 21 Jul 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 16.35 EDTShareHaven’t the fans of theWashington Commandersand Cleveland Guardians suffered enough?For decades, each team had to endure the twin indignities of on-field futility and off-field scorn. Until last year, when they enjoyed a resurgence under rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, the WashingtonNFLteam had won exactly only one playoff game in the 21st century. Cleveland’s baseball team have been competitivethiscentury, but they once went 41 years between playoff appearances (from 1954 to 1995) and came out on the losing end in the “whose drought will end?” World Series of 2016, in which the Chicago Cubs won the championship for the first time in 108 years at the expense of Cleveland, whose epoch without a World Series win now stands at 77 years.Off the field, both teams faced backlash over their names. Cleveland were known as the Indians until 2022, when a name change to “Guardians” went into effect. Washington had a more disturbing name referring to Native Americansuntil they becamethe “Washington Football Team” in 2020 and landed on “Commanders” from 2022 onwards. The Commanders took another step forward in 2023, when a consortium led by Josh Harris bought the team from Dan Snyder, one of themost reviled team ownersin NFL history. Coincidentally – or perhaps not given Snyder’s failings – the Commanders reached the conference championship last season for the first time since 1991.Trump demands Guardians and Commanders revert to previous names out of respect for Native AmericansRead moreBut Donald Trump, whose quest to make the intellectual and public-service classes miserable is a cornerstone of his presidency, has decided that these two fanbases need more suffering. On Sundayhe insisted on social mediathat the teams should reclaim the names they dropped after decades of pressure. His reasoning, as far as it could be discerned from his typically stream-of-consciousness post, was that changing the names back would be respectful to the many Native Americans who found them offensive in the first place. “Our great Indian people, in massive numbers, want this to happen. Their heritage and prestige is systematically being taken away from them,” Trump wrote.The first thing to say is that Trump often decides to fire off a broadside at sports, when he is looking to distract from other problems, rile up his base or target groups he has contempt for. See, for example, hisattacks on the US women’s national team,Black NFL playerswho knelt for the national anthem ortransgender athletes.The second thing to say is that Trump is unlikely to get anywhere with his demands.The Guardians immediately squashed any notion of reverting to “Indians,” and Trump has no leverage to force them to do his bidding. The Commanders’ situation is a bit more complicated, but Trump is unlikely to prevail there, either.Trumphas impliedthat he will force the Commanders to revert to their old racist name if they want to be allowedto move backto the District of Columbia from their current home in suburban Maryland. The problem is that Joe Biden, in his last weeks as US president, signed a bill transferring the site in question from the federal government to the DC city government. Barring any creative legal maneuvers, the most Trump could do would be to attack the municipal government on other fronts as an indirect way of putting pressure on the Commanders.View image in fullscreenThe Commanders have proposed plans to move back to the site of RFK Stadium.Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPAThe team’s potential new home in DC is occupied by the decaying ruins of RFK Stadium, where the Team Now Known As the Commanders played from 1961 to 1996. The Washington Nationals also played there from 2005 to 2007, when Nationals Park was completed. Other than that, the stadium was the home of Major League Soccer’s DC United and other soccer events until 2017, when DC United moved to their new home at Audi Field. Even before United moved out, the stadiumwas renowned for its decrepit state, though raccoons occasionally found it hospitable.RFK Stadium, though, had many things going for it. It was named for Robert F Kennedy, a distinguished attorney general who may well have been elected president in 1968 had he not been assassinated while campaigning. The stadium had history. It was also an easy walk from a Metro station.The Commanders’ current home, now known as Northwest Stadium, has none of those things. It is a stadium devoid of charm, notable wins by the home team, and good transportation options – even by the standards of a city with brutalist architecture, sporadically successful sports teams, and traffic obstacles. Shortly before his death, then-owner Jack Kent Cooke convinced the US Postal Service to accept that the stadium’s zip code would be known under the placename “Raljon,” a combination of his sons’ names (Ralph and John), prompting Washington Post columnist Tony Kornheiser to quip that everyone was lucky that his kids weren’t named Peter and Ennis.At one time, the Washington NFL team had a long waitlist for season tickets. While the number of people on that waitlist at any given time is heavily disputed, it’s certainly true that the typical fan could not simply buy season tickets without spending a few years waiting for the opportunity. By the end of Snyder’s reign, even with Northwest Stadium’s capacity reduced from 91,000 to about 62,000, the waitlist no longer existed.So a return to the old RFK site would be very attractive to the Commanders and their fans. But they have other options as wellin the suburbs and exurbs, and even without presidential opposition, some local politicians have raised objections to the city’s proposed $1bn investment in a new stadium.And that issue leads back to the federal government – which has the power to force DC to slash its budget, even if local tax revenues are sufficient to cover it – and occasionallythreatens to do so.So Trump and his allies in Congress could, in theory, cut the DC budget out of spite if the Commanders refuse to change their name. But name changes and stadium development take a long time, and the clock on Trump’s tenure in office is ticking. By any other name, Washington’s football team had been in the DC metro area for close to 80 years before Trump’s arrival, and it will be around long after he has packed up for Mar-a-Lago or another destination for good.Explore more on these topicsWashington CommandersCleveland GuardiansNFLMLBBaseballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

We weren’t tougher, faster or stronger – just smarter and better coordinated. In many cases, extinction was an accidental byproduct of some other goal we had. A true AGI would amount to creating anew species, which might quicklyoutsmartoroutnumberus. It could see humanity as a minor obstacle, like ananthillin the way of a planned hydroelectric dam, or aresource to exploit, like the billions of animals confined in factory farms.Altman, along with the heads of the other top AI labs, believes that AI-driven extinction is areal possibility(joining hundreds of leading AI researchers and prominent figures).Given all this, it’s natural to ask: should we really try to build a technology that may kill us all if it goes wrong?What's the appeal of AI? It will always reassure you | Zoe WilliamsRead morePerhaps the most common reply says: AGI is inevitable. It’s just too useful not to build. After all, AGI would be the ultimate technology – what a colleague of Alan Turingcalled“the last invention that man need ever make”. Besides, the reasoning goes within AI labs, if we don’t, someone else will do it – less responsibly, of course.A new ideology out of Silicon Valley,effective accelerationism(e/acc),claimsthat AGI’s inevitability is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics and that its engine is “technocapital”. The e/accmanifestoasserts: “This engine cannot be stopped. The ratchet of progress only ever turns in one direction. Going back is not an option.”ForAltmanand e/accs, technology takes on a mystical quality – the march of invention is treated as a fact of nature. But it’s not. Technology is the product of deliberate human choices, motivated by myriad powerful forces. We have the agency to shape those forces, and history shows that we’ve done it before.No technology is inevitable, not even something as tempting as AGI.Some AI worriers like topoint outthe timeshumanity resisted and restrained valuable technologies.Fearing novel risks, biologists initiallybannedand then successfullyregulatedexperiments on recombinant DNA in the 1970s.No human has been reproduced viacloning, even though it’s beentechnically possiblefor over a decade, and the only scientist to genetically engineer humans wasimprisonedfor his efforts.Nuclear powercan provideconsistent, carbon-free energy, but vivid fears of catastrophe havemotivatedstifling regulations andoutright bans.And if Altman weremore familiarwith the history of the Manhattan Project, he might realize that the creation of nuclear weapons in 1945was actuallya highly contingent and unlikely outcome,motivatedby a mistaken belief that the Germans were ahead in a “race” for the bomb. Philip Zelikow, the historian who led the 9/11 Commission,said: “I think had the United States not built an atomic bomb during the Second World War, it’s actually not clear to mewhenor possibly evenifan atomic bomb ever is built.”It’s now hard to imagine a world without nuclear weapons. But in a little-known episode, then president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachevnearly agreedto ditch all their bombs (a misunderstanding over the “Star Wars” satellite defense system dashed these hopes). Even though the dream of full disarmament remains just that, nuke counts areless than20% of their 1986 peak, thanks largely tointernational agreements.These choices weren’t made in a vacuum. Reagan was astaunch opponentof disarmament before themillions-strongNuclear Freeze movement got to him. In 1983, hecommentedto his secretary of state : “If things get hotter and hotter and arms control remains an issue, maybe I should go see [Soviet leader Yuri] Andropov and propose eliminating all nuclear weapons.”There are extremely strong economic incentives to keep burning fossil fuels, but climate advocacy haspried openthe Overton window and significantly accelerated our decarbonization efforts.In April 2019, the young climate groupExtinction Rebellion(XR)broughtLondon to a halt, demanding the UK target net-zero carbon emissions by 2025. Their controversial civil disobedience prompted parliament todeclarea climate emergency and the Labour party to adopt a 2030targetto decarbonize the UK’selectricity production.The Sierra Club’sBeyond Coalcampaign was lesser-known butwildly effective. In just its first five years, the campaign helped shutter more than one-third of US coal plants.Thanksprimarilyto its move from coal, US per capita carbon emissionsare nowlower than they were in 1913.In many ways, the challenge of regulating efforts to build AGI is much smaller than that of decarbonizing.Eighty-two percentof global energy production comes from fossil fuels. Energy is what makes civilization work, but we’re not dependent on a hypothetical AGI to make the world go round.Further, slowing and guiding the development of future systems doesn’t mean we’d need to stop using existing systems or developing specialist AIs to tackle important problems in medicine, climate and elsewhere.The trouble with AI art isn’t just lack of originality. It’s something far bigger | Eric ReinhartRead moreIt’s obvious why so many capitalists are AI enthusiasts: they foresee a technology that can achieve their long-time dream of cutting workers out of the loop (and the balance sheet).But governments are not profit maximizers. Sure, they care about economic growth, but they also care about things like employment, social stability, market concentration, and, occasionally, democracy.It’s far less clear how AGI would affect these domains overall. Governments aren’t prepared for a world where most people are technologically unemployed.Capitalists often get what they want, particularly in recent decades, and the boundless pursuit of profit may undermine any regulatory effort to slow the speed of AI development. But capitalists don’talwaysget what they want.At a bar in San Francisco in February, a longtimeOpenAIsafety researcher pronounced to a group that the e/accs shouldn’t be worried about the “extreme” AI safety people, because they’ll never have power. The boosters should actually be afraid of AOC and Senator Josh Hawley because they “can really fuck things up for you”.Assuming humans stick around for many millennia, there’s no way to know we won’t eventually build AGI. But this isn’t really what the inevitabilists are saying. Instead, the message tends to be: AGI is imminent. Resistance is futile.But whether we build AGI in five, 20 or 100 yearsreally matters. And the timeline is far more in our control than the boosters will admit. Deep down, I suspect many of them realize this, which is why they spend so much effort trying to convince others that there’s no point in trying. Besides, if you think AGI is inevitable, why bother convincing anybody?We actuallyhadthe computing power required to train GPT-2 more than a decade before OpenAI actually did it, but people didn’t know whether it was worth doing.But right now, the top AI labs are locked in such a fierce race that theyaren’t implementingall the precautions that even their own safety teams want. (One OpenAI employeeannouncedrecently that he quit “due to losing confidence that it would behave responsibly around the time of AGI”.) There’s a “safety tax” that labs can’t afford to pay if they hope to stay competitive; testingslowsproduct releases and consumes company resources.Governments, on the other hand, aren’t subject to the same financial pressures.An inevitabilist tech entrepreneur recentlysaidregulating AI development is impossible “unless you control every line of written code”. That might be true if anyone could spin up an AGI on their laptop. But it turns out that building advanced, general AI modelsrequiresenormous arrays of supercomputers, with chips produced by anabsurdly monopolisticindustry. Because of this, many AI safety advocates see “compute governance” as a promising approach. Governments could compel cloud computing providers to halt next generation training runs that don’t comply with establishedguardrails. Far from locking out upstarts or requiring Orwellian levels of surveillance, thresholds could be chosen to only affect players who can afford to spendmore than $100mon a single training run.Governments do have to worry about international competition and the risk of unilateral disarmament, so to speak. Butinternational treatiescan be negotiated to widely share the benefits from cutting-edge AI systems while ensuring that labs aren’t blindly scaling up systems theydon’t understand.And while the world may feel fractious, rival nations have cooperated to surprising degrees.For Silicon Valley, AI isn’t just about replacing some jobs. It’s about replacing all of them | Ed Newton-RexRead moreThe Montreal Protocolfixedthe ozone layer by banning chlorofluorocarbons. Most of the world has agreed to ethically motivated bans on militarily useful weapons, such asbiologicalandchemical weapons,blinding laser weapons, and “weather warfare”.In the 1960s and 70s, many analystsfearedthat every country that could build nukes, would. Butmostof the world’s roughly three-dozen nuclear programswere abandoned. This wasn’t the result of happenstance, but rather the creation of a global nonproliferation norm through deliberate statecraft, like the 1968Non-Proliferation Treaty.On the few occasions when Americans were asked if they wanted superhuman AI,largemajoritiessaid “no”. Opposition to AIhas grownas the technology has become more prevalent. When people argue that AGI is inevitable, what they’re really saying is that the popular will shouldn’t matter. The boosters see the masses as provincial neo-Luddites who don’t know what’s good for them. That’s why inevitability holds such rhetorical allure for them; it lets them avoid making their real argument, which they know is a loser in the court of public opinion.The draw of AGI is strong. But the risks involved are potentially civilization-ending. A civilization-scale effort is needed to compel the necessary powers to resist it.Technology happens because people make it happen. We can choose otherwise.Garrison Lovely is a freelance journalist"

Will it be different next time around?Mon 21 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 12.46 EDTShareSinceBernie Sanders’s first presidential campaign, the electoral theory of the American left has rested upon the idea that a sizable bloc of Americans – alienated from the traditional politics of left and right – have withdrawn from politics entirely. They stand closer to theDemocratson many issues, but, seeing little by way of material benefit from the party’s soaring rhetoric of “defending democracy”, they have opted out of the political process. And, as the theory goes, a bold, populist candidate – someone like Sanders himself – could bring this silent constituency back into the fold.If that logic once explained how Sanders might have won, it might now explain whyKamala Harrislost. And, as new troves of post-election data surface, the debate over whether Democrats might have avoided last year’s defeat by mobilizing non-voters has become one of the party’s hottest factional disputes.Among those strategizing within the Democratic party, one’s confidence in voter activation is often a proxy for their broader politics. Those who believe Harris’s campaign failed to activate non-voters typicallyargueher platform lacked the populist edge needed to mobilizedisaffected Americans. Theircriticstend to believe the problem ran in the opposite direction: the electorate had moved right and the Democrats’ failure lay in their inability to meet it there.How can Democrats win back working-class voters? Change their tuneRead moreDetractors of the activation theory point to a 26 June Pew Researchreport– which foundDonald Trumpleading Harris by three points among non-voters – as decisive proof that non-participants lean Republican. The catch, though, is that the survey concluded less than two weeks after Trump’s victory. Polling taken in the aftermath of a race is notoriously vulnerable to distortion, and the bandwagon effect can temporarily inflate a victorious candidate’s popularity. That effect is especially pronounced among disengaged or loosely affiliated voters. That number almost certainly marks thehigh-water lineof Trump’s support among non-voters.Another oft-citedfigurefrom the New York Times/Siena College, which the Democratic strategist and data scientist David Shor referenced during his owninterviewwith the Times’s Ezra Klein, found Trump leading by 14 points among 2020 non-voters. But it uses survey data collectedbeforeBiden dropped out of the race. Then there is Shor’s own post-election poll, conducted through his polling firm Blue Rose Research, which found Trump leading by 11 points among non-voters – though the underlying data remains private and the methodology undisclosed.The Cooperative Election Study (CES) – a late-November survey of more than 50,000 voters – offers one of the few high-quality, public windows on 2024. Ananalysisof the CES data by political scientists Jake Grumbach, Adam Bonica and their colleagues found that a plurality of non-voters identified themselves as most closely aligned with the Democratic party – and an absolute majority of registered voters who declined to cast a ballot in 2024 considered themselves Democrats. The non-electorate certainly wasn’t blue enough to have swung the race, but by no means as red as the activation theory’s opponents claim.What’s even clearer is the geography of turnout. Voter participation dropped especially sharply in Democratic strongholds – particularly urban counties in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia. By contrast, turnout in Republican areas held steady or even increased modestly. In other words, the Democratic campaign had more to gain from energizing its own base than from chasing centrist swing voters.Harris wouldn’t have prevailed under conditions of 100% turnout. (Grumbach, Bonica, etc don’t claim as such.) But a more focused strategy – mobilizing the Democratic base, speaking directly to material concerns, and resisting the pull toward bland centrism – might have narrowed the margin significantly.Ironically, the aforementioned Pewreportconcludes the same. “As in prior elections, a change in voters’ partisan allegiances – switching from the Democratic to the Republican candidate or vice versa – proved to be a less important factor in Trump’s victory than differential partisan turnout,” write the authors. “Republican-leaning eligible voters simply were more likely to turn out than Democratic-leaning eligible voters in 2024.”Even so, the CES data may disappoint progressives, if not for the reasons their critics imagine. Ananalysisof the CES from the Center for Working Class Politics’s Jared Abbott and Dustin Guastella found that Democrats who stayed home in 2024 were, on average, less ideologically liberal on hot-button social questions – more skeptical of an assault-rifle ban, receptive to a border wall, less concerned with climate change, and cooler to the language of structural racism – than the Democrats who showed up.You may not know it, but the Democratic primaries for 2028 are already under way | Osita NwanevuRead moreYet, as Abbott and Guastella found, those same non-voters were more economically populist: disproportionately working-class and non-college, while eager for bigger public investment programs, a higher corporate tax rate, and a stronger social safety net.The Democratic non-electorate doesn’t clearly align with progressive orthodoxy. Equally clear, though, is that a blanket lurch toward cultural moderation, absent populist economics, would do little to fire up non-voters who already share many progressive economic instincts.Making decisive claims about non-voters is necessarily difficult. By definition, they are the least likely to respond to pollsters, and their political preferences are often tentative or inconsistent. Yet certain commentators’ eagerness to cast non-voters as Trump supporters reveals more about elite assumptions than about public sentiment.There’s been a rush to cast non-voters as conservatives, not because the evidence demands it, but because the alternative – that Democratsneed to speak more directly to the working class– remains uncomfortable for the party establishment. There is no way around the fact that in 2024, those Americans didn’t hear anything worth voting for.Alex Bronzini-Vender is a writer living in New YorkExplore more on these topicsDemocratsHow can Democrats win?US politicsDonald TrumpRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

What begins as critique becomes content.Yes, if the Coldplay couple were having an affair, it may be amoral. It might shed light on power dynamics in the workplace. But was the doxing, the intense, invasive publishing of private details a proportionate response?Don’t get me wrong, doxing has done good. During the January 6 Capitol riots, internet sleuths helped identify rioters, some of whom were later arrested. It showed that the people, armed with nothing but wifi and rage, could hold power to account.But doxing is neutral and the internet is agnostic to moral weight. It rewards theperformanceof outrage, not the ethics behind it.Sometimes, people get doxed over something as small as complaining about a coffee order or a haircut. We don’t pause to ask:What kind of day were they having?What if they were grieving? Overwhelmed? Underpaid? In the rush to moralise a moment, we strip away all context. There’s no room for nuance.Sometimes, innocent people get caught in the crossfire, punished not for who they are, but for a single frame of a much bigger picture.The collateral damage of instant moralism is real.Do we really want kids harassed at school because their parent made a mistake? Or someone’s house posted online because they turned away a guest and theirantipasto salad?What about the CEO’s wife, who woke up one day and watched the entire internet dissect her life, her job, her marriage?Once something is online, it metastasises far beyond the original wrongdoing.

But even that is a slippery slope.We’re collectively trying to decide through digital telepathy, what makes it OK to ruin someone’s life. That is an impossible task. It’s endlessly malleable. Infinitely debatable.What do we lose when we treat every viral moment like a courtroom?What do we gain from piling on, without considering the proportion of the punishment?Yes, celebrities have chosen to live in the public eye. They have PR teams. They have crisis managers. Sometimes, they have Oprah and a tell-all interview.But the Coldplay couple? They don’t have a publicist and even if they did, they owe the public nothing. If something did happen, the only people who deserve an explanation are their families, whose lives have been permanently altered by two people’s choices.Well… maybe also the HR manager at their workplace.Oh, wait.

Let Thames Water fail – it doesn’t deserve a bailoutMon 21 Jul 2025 13.17 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 14.10 EDTShareIn a bone dry summer, every drop of water counts. So, even though therain is finally fallingagain now, it’s still hard to take it for granted, or to ignore the way that everything in the countryside still feels unnervingly out of rhythm: earth too cracked, grass too bleached, wheat harvest being brought in too early, rivers too low – and, knowing what Thames Water has been pumping into them, water quite possibly too dirty to cool off in.In May, the company wasfined £122.7mfor the combined sins of sewage dumping and continuing to pay shareholder dividends despite its environmental failings. It responded by protesting that it might go bust if actually held accountable for its actions, a sentence that sums up everything people find infuriating about the water industry. Yet its resentful customers have no choice but to keep paying bills that are expected torise by a thirdover the next five years – though Thames Water, inevitably, asked to be allowed to charge more – while wondering how we ever let a commodity this precious become so badly managed, heading into a volatile new era of summer drought and winter flood.Rivers, Jon Cunliffe notes in hisnewly published reviewof what a new Labour government should do about the water industry, are part of a country’s national identity. There’s a romance and a history to be preserved here, not just a life-giving water supply to be extracted or wildlife habitats to be protected. Being a neutral civil servant, what he doesn’t explicitly add is that lately they have also come to symbolise corporate failure and decline of the public realm, but that too is part of the picture.Few will disagree withCunliffe’s verdictthat the current regulator, Ofwat, isn’t up to negotiating the complex trade-offs involved here, and that there should be a new watchdog, bringing together various powers currently scattered across Whitehall, with the ability to take control of failing water companies if needed. His ideas for increasing accountability, curbing excessive dividends and creating a new social tariff for those who can’t afford to pay is welcome too. (Bills were kept too low for too long, the review concludes, meaning that when the inevitable hike came it was painfully sharp.) But that’s the easy bit, compared with facing up to the consequences of chronic underinvestment by an industry that has in parts seemed quick to take the profits and slower to take responsibility.There will be outrage on the left that Cunliffe doesn’t advocate nationalisation, though politically that idea was off the table before he started. (Labour said before the election that it wasn’t keen to take water back into public ownership, and nothing about the fiscal hole in which it has since found itself has made the idea of spending billions on doing so more appealing: Cunliffe’s terms of reference were set accordingly.)The review argues that ownership models are anyway something of a red herring – water is nationalised in Scotland but bathing water qualityisn’t much betterthere than it is south of the border, and while Welsh Water’s not-for-profit model could be viable for some English companies, even that isn’t necessarily a magic bullet. All of which may well be true, but might sound more convincing had ministers given him free rein to consider all the options equally. As it is, it’s hardly his fault that this plan – which would still see water bills rising steeply to fund the investment in creaking infrastructure that everyone accepts is necessary – is the answer of the Treasury official he used to be, rather than of a politician.High water bills, filthy rivers – and now drought. This is England’s great artificial water crisis of 2025 | George MonbiotRead moreWhere’s the moral hazard, the price any private business should be forced to pay for failure, if in the end their customers just get stuck with the tab? It’s not our fault if companies who were granted a monopolyback in 1989over the supply of something humans literally can’t live without still managed somehow to make a commercial hash of it. No wonder the water minister, Emma Hardy, will take the summer to decide exactlywhich of Cunliffe’s recommendationsLabour plans to accept.The dilemma this government finds itself in over water is, of course, not unique. It is part of a common thread now linking everything from welfare reform and the still unresolved problem offunding social care, to the momentous decisions on tax now facing Rachel Reeves in her autumn budget; that these are all expensive and deep-seated problems this government’s predecessors repeatedly dodged or kicked down the road. And, although Labour’s commitment to actually facing reality is admirable, it turns out there were good reasons everyone else chose to bravely run away. Years of ducking and diving have only magnified those problems, to the point where selling the kind of sacrifices now required to a reluctant public is almost impossible.Getting the future governance of the industry right is crucial, of course, but that’s not the end of it.Thames Watershould be allowed to fail, on the grounds that it has done nothing to deserve a taxpayer bailout, and if its lenders have to take a hit, well, them’s the risks. Parliament should keep digging, investigating the historic failures of oversight that allowed us to get into this mess. But, somehow, ministers need to find a broader way of conveying that failure has consequences, and not just for the taxpayer. A harder rain needs to fall, not just into rapidly shrinking reservoirs, but on to some of those responsible for managing them.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Wigney found the federal government did not have a legal responsibility to protect theTorres Strait Islandsfrom a climate crisis that is already being experienced.What’s giving Torres Strait Islanders that sinking feeling? | Fiona KatauskasRead moreIt was a devastating result for Uncle Pabai Pabai and Uncle Paul Kabai, the elders from Boigu and Saibai islands – who brought the case – as well as their communities and the civil society representatives who supported them. But it is unlikely to be the end. And Wigney stressed that, on facts and moral weight, their case was strong.It is worth sitting with what he said in his summary. Every member of parliament should read it.Wigney found the evidence showed theTorres Strait Islands, the collection of low-lying coral cays and sand and mud islands between Cape York and Papua New Guinea, are already being ravaged – his word – by the effects of human-induced climate change. Rising sea levels, storm surges and other extreme events are causing flooding and sea-water inundation. Trees are dying and previously fertile areas affected by salination are no longer suitable for growing traditional crops. Beaches are being eroded and tidal wetlands damaged.The ocean is getting hotter and its chemistry is changing as it absorbs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, causing coral bleaching and the loss of seagrass beds. Once abundant totemic sea creatures – dugongs and turtles – are becoming scarce. Seasonal patterns are changing and transforming migratory bird patterns.In Wigney’s words, this has already had a “profound impact” on the customary way of life in the Torres Strait. Inhabitants and traditional owners are finding it increasingly difficult to practise and observe customs, traditions and beliefs that have sustained them for generations. Sacred ancestral sites, including burial grounds and ceremonial sites, have been damaged and are constantly at risk. Increasingly, the people cannot source traditional foods or engage in cultural practices. It is difficult for elders to pass on their knowledge to the next generation.Consider for a moment how people would respond if these sorts of abrupt changes came to those who live in Australia’s major cities – if, within a generation or two, they were losing their homes, their ability to feed their families and protect themselves from the elements.It would at the very least be a constant focus in the national conversation. Our politicians would be asked about it – and motivated to respond to it – every day.Wigney’s assessment of the evidence is that these changes are coming for all of us if swift action isn’t taken. He found climate change “poses an existential threat to the whole of humanity” and that many, if not most, communities in Australia are vulnerable. The people of Boigu and Sabai and neighbouring islands are at the pointy end. Given they are also more socially and economically disadvantaged than many Australians, they often lack access to the resources, infrastructure and services that would help them adapt or protect themselves.In Wigney’s words: “Unless something is done to arrest global warming and the resulting escalating impacts of climate change, there is a very real risk that the applicants’ worst fears will be realised and they will lose their islands, their culture and their way of life and will become climate refugees.”The justice repeated Pabai’s evidence that, if he had to leave Boigu due to it being under water, he would “be nothing”. “I will have nothing behind my back,” Pabai said. “I will not be able to say I’m a Boigu man any more. How will I be able to say where I come from? I will become nobody. I will have no identity.”On one level, there is no new news here. The plight of residents on low-lying islands has been documented. But the federal court’s black-and-white recognition of this evidence is noteworthy – and so is what came after it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wigney found the case had largely succeeded in establishing the facts – particularly, that the former Liberal-National Coalition government failed to engage with, or genuinely consider, what the best available climate science said Australia should do to play its part in meeting the goals of the landmark Paris climate agreement, which it signed up to in 2015.View image in fullscreenA photo from 2021 shows a seawall on Boigu island in the Torres Strait.Photograph: Talei Elu/Grata Fund/AFP/Getty ImagesThe justice said the science “was and is patently clear” and it was “imperative for every country to take steps to drastically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions”. The climate targets under the Coalition were nothing like up to that job. Wigney said the new 2030 targetlegislated under Labor after its election in 2022– a 43% cut below 2005 levels – had “some regard” to the best available science, but did not go as far as scientists say is necessary.Despite this, Wigney found the government did not owe Torres Strait Islanders a duty of care to protect them from the climate crisis, primarily because emissions reductions targets are a political decision and not subject to the common law of negligence. He said this meant there was “no real or effective legal avenue” for people to claim damages for harm they suffer due to government decisions related to core policy – and, crucially, that this would remain the case unless the law was developed or expanded by an appeals court or new laws were introduced to parliament.Torres Strait leaders lost their landmark case. How can governments be held to account on climate?Read moreThere is an obvious risk of reading too much between the lines of a judgment. The Torres Strait case ultimately lost on multiple grounds. Some legal experts were not surprised. But Wigney’s summary is also being read as offering encouragement and basis for a potential appeal, or an argument that can bolster future cases. Failing that, the justice said, the applicants’ options were “public advocacy and protest, and ultimately recourse via the ballot box”.Pabai, Kabai and their supporters are considering their legal options. Isabelle Reinecke, the chief executive of the Grata Fund, the charity that backed the case, says her organisation may support an appeal. She believes there could be echoes of the Gove land rights case that helped pave the way for the landmark Mabo native title high court judgment in 1992, if not Mabo itself. If nothing else, there is some distance still to run on this.Meanwhile, Anthony Albanese and his cabinet are weighing decisions ona 2035 emissions reduction target, a first-time national climate risk assessment and an adaptation plan. Hopefully, beyond the technocratic detail and thecalls from business groups to do next-to-nothing, they are also considering the sort of legacy they want to leave.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisClear airTorres Strait IslandsLaw (Australia)commentShareReuse this content"

But how do you teach inclusivity while fielding accusations of ‘wokery’?Mon 21 Jul 2025 09.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 09.34 EDTShareParents’ evening. Two words that many parents assume are a source of dread for teachers. But most will tell you this is a misconception. Why? Because the evening tends to offer a rare insight into the children we teach. It is, generally, a positive, purposeful discussion.There are, of course, the dreaded meetings with parents who are convinced you have it all wrong about their child. They will be at pains to point out that an incident with an exercise book, for example, was misunderstood. The book, they will argue, fell accidentally from X’s grip. This, despite the fact your own eyes observed it being unceremoniously flung across the classroom.Then there is another trying bunch who, in exasperation, ask if they should take their child’s iPad, PS5 or smartphone off them. To which the only answer can ever be that I, as their teacher, am in no place to say since I am not the parent. Meanwhile, their child sits mute, clearly desperate for the ground to open up and swallow them whole.Now, though, there is the possibility of a newer type of encounter. In this fraught exchange, a parent may ask a teacher to apply values of tolerance and inclusivity to views the teacher believes threatens those values. Given the way that the culture wars have a stranglehold on our politics, it is no surprise schools and teachers are seeing them cross the school gates into our classrooms.In a lesson on a Shakespearean text designed to discuss the issues of empire and colonialism at the heart of the play, a student may defend the benefits of empire. And a teacher, worried they could be labelled a member of the “woke mob” that the rightwing press claim is taking over our public institutions, may leave the view unchallenged.This fear for teachers is real. When staff at a Warwickshire secondary school sent home a12-year-old studentwho had come to a “culture day” clad in a sequined union flag dress, a la Geri Halliwell in her Spice Girls era, the school had to close for the summer holidays a day early following threats to staff from extremists. Like clockwork, the headlines from a particular branch of our tabloid press wrote themselves.The school was undoubtedly overzealous in its approach. The girl, whose presentation on British culture involved a segment on our love of the cuppa, should have been allowed to take part in the day’s events. Yet, while the union flag does not carry the same association with far-right nationalism as theSt George’s Cross, we can perhaps have sympathy for teachers who must have been trying to avoid the very ire and upset they found themselves surrounded by.Schools are told they must champion inclusivity, yet teachers’ politics must be left at the door. Nowhere is this balancing act harder to follow than in the immigration debate. Last week, a far-right mob outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Essex could be heard shouting that aseriously hurt security guardshould “go home … fuck off back on your boat and go”.In this febrile climate, it is not beyond the realms of possibility for a geography teacher in any part of the UK to find themselves dealing with the ripple effects. A lesson on migration may end with them fielding questions on whether or not there are “too many immigrants”.What happens when 16-year-olds get the vote? Other countries are already seeing the benefits | Christine HuebnerRead moreTheDepartment for Education saysa teacher must “take steps to ensure the balanced presentation of opposing views on political issues” whenever such claims arise. Yet the teacher must also protect their pupils from hate. If a comment is dismissed outright, the teacher could be accused of limiting freedom of expression and legitimate debate. If they let it stand, however, they are seen as normalising the type oflanguage that ledto preteens lobbing projectiles at police guarding hotels housing asylum seekers in Southport. As teachers with a legal duty to uphold the Prevent strategy, we are required to safeguard pupils from radicalisation and extremism. But what countsas radical or extremeis increasingly debated. Pupils and their parents may claim their “political speech” is being muted if we intervene.The tightrope is about to get thinner still with the government’s announcement that 16-year-olds will be granted theright to votein the next general election. Classroom discussions on election issues could well be interpreted as examples of voter influence. This is before we have tackled the shortage of specialist citizenship teachers. Or the need for, as Liz Moorse, the head of the Association of Citizenship Teaching, puts it, “clear contenton democracy, voting, rights and media literacy”.I am writing anonymously because the price of doing otherwise is high. After the union-flag debacle at the Warwickshire secondary school, staff received death threats. Students alreadyroutinely attemptto hack teachers’ social media accounts in a bid to publish their personal data, or worse, and our employment contracts warn against bringing schools into disrepute. It would be splitting hairs to argue whether the disrepute in question is outrage whipped up by the rightwing press.The stakes have never been higher for teachers. We have a duty to get these conversations right for the children we teach. But what was once clear is no longer so. We are expected to be moral without being political, inclusive yet not ideological. We should teach critical thinking, but not too much in case we fall into wokery. The classroom is in danger of becoming a minefield.The writer is a teacher in EnglandDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Look where it’s got themMon 21 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 03.53 EDTShareBy any measure, Kemi Badenoch’s leadership of the Conservative party is not in a good place. In the last few months alone, she has been told “her days are numbered”, that she is in “Liz Truss territory” and that she is “hitting a new record low”. This is not a hostile audience. These criticisms come from the Telegraph, the Spectator and the Daily Express, outlets that have traditionally turned a blind eye to the most egregious Conservative leadership failings, like a blinkered parent who refuses to accept the repeated reports from teachers that their child is a bully.It’s clear that what Badenoch is doing is not working. She needs to change course, not just for her own sake, but for the continued existence of her party as a political entity. In case this isn’t obvious to her already (just 10% of people in the UKsee her as a PM in waiting), there is a really handy example of what will happen to the Conservative party if it keeps being a Reform tribute act – the Welsh Conservative party.If you haven’t paid any attention to the Welsh Conservative party, don’t blame yourself, because hardly anyone in Wales has either. I have had the privilege of reporting on the Welsh Tories for a decade and they are the embodiment of all the challenges and failings of the current UK party. And when I say “privilege”, I mean it. Journalistically, it has been like shooting fish in a barrel, such is the level of incompetence exhibited by the WelshConservatives. But a gain for the humble hack is a loss for the people of Wales.Reform UK would be a disaster for Wales – but its rivals have left the door wide open | Will HaywardRead moreSince devolution,Waleshas been desperate for a sensible centre-right alternative that could genuinely challenge Welsh Labour, whose record is more patchy than Boris Johnson’s account of Partygate. Instead, the people of Cymru have been condemned to a Welsh Conservative party that has preferred to dabble in Nigel Farage cosplay rather than genuine opposition. A party that could soon be all but wiped out in Wales.So what lessons can Badenoch learn from the situation her colleagues find themselves in across Offa’s Dyke? Well, the first concerns demographics. The Welsh Conservative party is literally dying out. According to astudy by Cardiff University’s Wales Governance Centre, in 2024 fewer than 10% of people aged under 65 in Wales voted for the Conservatives. In fact, 10% of the party’s 2019 voters had passed away by the time of the 2024 election (the figure for Labour was 3%). If this trend continues, 40% of Tory voters in Cymru will have died by the next election.But surely these voters are being replaced? Well, no. If you want to see how hard the Welsh Conservatives are finding it to recruit younger people, then look no further than a fringe meeting that was held at their party conference in May. I remember looking through the programme and seeing that an event by the Welsh Young Conservatives was discussing how to attract more young people. They defined “young” as under 45.That same conference underlined another problem: that the Conservatives scream incompetence right now. For one thing, Badenoch herself began her speech bysaying how “wonderful” it was “to meet so many MSPs”. In Wales we have MSs (Senedd members); not MSPs (members of the Scottish parliament). The auto captions all over the hall also wrote “whales” rather than “Wales” throughout all of the speeches. And the lack of compassion and hope from the current Conservative party was hilariously encapsulated in the subtitles to the speech of Darren Millar, the Welsh Tory leader in the Senedd, which translated “We are pro-roads, not just cycle paths” into“We are pro-roads, not just psychopaths”.It also doesn’t help that the Conservatives can’t agree about who their Welsh leader is. In the constitution of the Conservative party, Badenoch is technically the leader of the Welsh Conservatives. However, Mims Davies (an MP in Sussex) is the leader of theWelsh Conservatives in Westminster, and Millar is the leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd. But if we accept that, for all intents and purposes, Millar is the leader in Wales (given he is the only one actually in Wales), we can see how his failure of leadership (and the failures ofhis predecessors) offer Badenoch a stark warning.The lesson here is that trying to mirror Reform is a losing play. Millar has continued the strategy put in place by his predecessor,Andrew RT Davies, and tried to be more Farage than Farage himself in rhetoric.Davies was investigatedby the Welsh parliament’s standards commissioner after he told GB News: “Welsh Labour are dishing out £1,600 to anyone who wants to rock up and claim they are crossing the Channel illegally.” To be clear, the figure he wasreferring to wasthe Welsh government’s basic income pilot, which will give £1,600 a month to care leavers and included about a dozen migrant children who came to the UK alone with no family.The Welsh Tories also show what happens when you fail to put forward any credible plans for actually governing the country. Regarding the biggest challenge facing Wales, which is the NHS, the Welsh Conservatives issued a statement saying they would “properly fund the health service”. When asked where the money would come from, they listed a string of“Labour vanity projects”which they would cut. Unfortunately, some of these ended in 2003.In the Senedd right now, the Welsh Conservatives are the official opposition. They constitute 15 of the 60 members (25%).Pollingsuggeststhat in the Welsh election next year they will receive between 10% and 13% of the vote. The electoral system in Wales means that any party that dips under 12% could be totally wiped out. AnMRP poll in May suggestedthat they could have as few as three seats (and this is after the Senedd will haveexpanded to 96 members).These projections could be Badenoch’sWelsh canary in the coalmine.

It’s actually good newsGina RipponA ninefold increase is the result of huge advances in our understanding – and brings the hope of fulfilling lives to many more peopleGina Rippon is an emeritus professor of cognitive neuroimaging and author of The Lost Girls of AutismMon 21 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 14.00 EDTShareSoaring rates of diagnoses in various illnesses such as cancer and diabetes have stimulated a debate about whether medicine has an “overdiagnosis” problem. The claim is that individuals may be prematurely diagnosed with conditions that, although meeting criteria for a disease, will never cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime.Discussions of this problem in the world of physical medicine have mainly been described as compassionate, arising from concerns that many so-called diagnoses might be unnecessary (does being pre-diabetic really mean you are ill?) or even harmful (the worried well being driven to seek needless and possibly damaging surgical interventions). Now that there are ever-more sensitive screening tests, and access to predictive genetic information, are doctors handing out too many unnecessary sicknotes?When attention turns to the possibility of overdiagnosis in the world of psychological medicine, however, the tone changes. Even those on the side of compassion display a greater level of cynicism, with subtle (or not so subtle) hints about unearned or pointless diagnoses. There is reference to “diagnostic creep” and the “medicalisation” ofnormal human variation. Mental illness has been described as just an inability to deal with ordinary distress and anxiety. Weighing in on the back of this are those with much more trenchant opinions. “We’ve fetishised mental illness, so we all want it,” readsone recentheadline, with the associated article describing a mental illness diagnosis as a “sicknote from life”. Increases in diagnoses such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been blamed on “sharp-elbowed, middle-class parents” trying to avoid the blame for bad parenting, and the support for children with special education needs as an “unaffordable racket”, caused by a system that is “patently easy to game”.Autism is clearly in the crosshairs, targeted because of the787% increase in diagnosesbetween 1998 and 2018. What better evidence is there that there is too much diagnosing going on?Those worried about the rise rarely note that, in the 1980s, after a painstaking UK-based investigation of a large range of developmental disorders, there wasa deliberate recalibrationof autism’s diagnostic criteria. This was because too many children in need of help were being missed by the then overly narrow definition of the condition. More recently, there has been an emerging awareness that even this more inclusive approach had missed large numbers of marginalised groups,especially women and girls. In conjunction with this, we are seeing a more sympathetic public awareness of autism, and how it presents. So this much-vilified increase is actually a long-needed correction of a longstanding bias, which had overlooked many in need of support.Discussions about overdiagnosis in physical medicine refer to the problem of unnecessarily pathologising mild, preclinical conditions. This is also being identified as a problem in the field of autism. In a strange throwback tothe anti-psychiatry eraof the 1960s and 1970s, the “compassionate” voices urge against the damage caused by “medicalising” or “biologising” autism (even though it is clearly a brain-based, highly heritable condition). Apparently it could be harmful to tell people they are suffering from an incurable brain disorder.Indeed, couching an autism diagnosis in such inaccurately negative terms could well be harmful. Those who work in the autism field would not recognise (or tolerate) it. More widely, it sets aside the stunning advances made in the understanding of autism that have been achieved by those very biologisers, such as geneticists and neuroscientists, who have been criticised. Do we really want to go back to the time when the blame for autism was laid at the doors of emotionally cold “refrigerator mothers”?In physical medicine, a diagnosis is an indication that there is indeed a recognisable physical problem, an abnormality that may be associated with pain and suffering, and that could require invasive treatment, if such is available. Altogether, a diagnosis is usually taken as bad news. The compassionate debaters point out that this could cause ongoing anxiety, ill-advised life choices and the adoption of a negative “illness identity”.Paradoxically, there is clear evidence that, in the world of autism, a diagnosis can often be positively received. For parents who have been seeking explanations for their young child’s difficulties, possibly for months if not years, a diagnosis of autism can offer a longed-for explanation, a gateway to knowledge and understanding, and the membership of a community that can offer help and support.For late-diagnosed adults, a diagnosis can come after decades of struggle, being ostracised and othered. “At last my life makes sense” or “I’ve finally found my tribe” arefrequently reported as responsesto an autism diagnosis. Many neurodivergent individuals describe their diagnosis as a route map or an instruction manual. “I’m no longer lost in the universe,”said the writer and broadcaster Robin Ince, following a diagnosis of ADHD at the age of 52.A wave of powerful personal testimonies from late-diagnosed autistic women has been a key driver in the recent awareness of autism’s missing females. The subtitle of Emily Katy’sGirl Unmasked: How Uncovering My Autism Saved My Life could stand as a generic summary of of their stories. The memoir is an extraordinary account of a girl whose first 16 years were marred by anxiety and panic attacks, bullying and self-harm, whose lived experience drove her to several attempts at suicide. She described how an autism diagnosis instantly changed her life: “I suddenly understood everything about my life with a new-found clarity for the very first time … there was an overwhelming relief at finally knowing.” Now trained as a mental health nurse, she shares her insights with others.In psychological medicine, it is claimed that widening the definition of atypical behaviour (“diagnostic creep”) has resulted in over-generosity in handing out “unearned” diagnoses. If you have a job, can drive a car, can make eye contact, then you aren’t autistic enough. Anyone who has been through a full autism assessment (having perhaps already waited five years to get there) will attest to the lengthy, complex and rigorous procedures involved. It is not a perfect system – the problem of underdiagnosis has already been mentioned – but it is certainly not a system that can easily be “gamed”.I thought it was being gay that made my life so difficult. Then, at 50, I got an eye-opening diagnosis …Read moreThe concepts underpinning the claims of overdiagnosis in physical medicine do not play out well in the field of autism. The almost-ninefold increase in diagnosis of this condition should not be taken to reflect a worrying trend towards “a culture of wide-eyed acceptance ofmental health gobbledegook”. Rather, it should be celebrated as a sign of a civilised society recognising the struggles that some of its fellow citizens face and acknowledging their need for recognition and support. Indeed, it could be taken as a welcome outcome of initiatives to destigmatise all forms of mental illness.Perhaps most importantly, an autism diagnosis is almost universally seen as a gateway to understanding, of positive benefit to self-identity and self-esteem. This is not something that should be rationed or withheld. The overdiagnosis brigade, be they compassionate or outraged, seem to have misunderstood autism and its diagnosis.Autismis not a diagnostic fad but a reflection of human diversity and the world’s need to accommodate it – denying that does far more harm than any so-called overdiagnosis ever could.Prof Gina Rippon is emeritus professor of cognitive neuroimaging at the Institute of Health and Neurodevelopment, Aston University, and the author ofThe Lost Girls of Autismand The Gendered BrainDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the howls of outrage show a rational debate is unlikelyMon 21 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 10.49 EDTShareFrance is skint, but the French are in denial. To judge by the howls of outrage from the left and the hard right of the French political spectrum, you would think the prime minister, François Bayrou, had just taken aJavier Milei-style chainsawto public services, announced Doge-style mass layoffs or imposed swingeing pay cuts.But it was Bayrou’s suggestion that the French should give uptwo of their 11 cherished public holidays– Easter Monday and 8 May, the anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe – and work instead to increase economic output and hence government revenue that provoked the anger.Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the hard-leftFranceUnbowed (LFI) party, accused the centrist prime minister of leading a “race towards an economic, financial and social abyss for the greater suffering of all”. The Socialist party leader, Olivier Faure, described the proposals as “a demolition plan for our French model”, and Jordan Bardella, president of the hard-right National Rally (RN), said the the proposal to cancel the two holidays was “a direct attack on our history”.The hard left and the populist right threatened to bring down the government with no confidence motions in the autumn, when the budget will be put to a hung parliament,as they didwith Bayrou’s short-lived predecessor, Michel Barnier, last year.As is so often the case, the sound and fury in the echo chamber of French political rhetoric is out of all proportion to reality. Bayrou proposes a standstill in public sector pay, pensions, welfare benefits and tax thresholds in 2026, which, with inflation forecast to increase slightly to about 1.4% next year, means a modest erosion of living standards for most people and a slightly increased tax take. Better-off pensioners will pay more tax, poorer ones will pay less. The measures are supposed to reduce the deficit by €43.8bn to 4.6% of economic output next year. Only defence spending will be increased, in line with France’s commitment to Nato, given Europe’s deteriorating security situation.This is hardly a draconian austerity purge for a country that had a deficit of 5.8% of GDP last year – the highest in the euro area – and which by most rational measurements is living beyond its means. National debt has risen to113% of GDP, higher than any EU country except Greece and Italy. But while their debt piles are falling, France’s keeps on growing.Public spending accounts for 56.5% of GDP in France, thesecond highest level in the EUafter Finland. Despite the centrist president Emmanuel Macron’s intention to reduce the tax burden and get more French people into work when he took office in 2017, a series of crises – the revolt of thegilets jaunesagainst a carbon tax, the Covid-19 pandemic and the effects of Russia’s war in Ukraine – triggered more state expenditure. In 2023, France’s tax-to-GDP ratio was 43.8%, significantly higher than theaverage of 33.9% in advanced economies.The country has too many layers of public administration, which together employ 5.8 million people – 20% of the total workforce. Bayrou proposed that one in three retiring civil servants should not be replaced, drawing immediate protests from trade unions representing teachers, health workers and the police.Perhaps the most telling criticism came from Édouard Philippe, Macron’s first prime minister and a likely centrist presidential candidate,who said Bayrou’s packagecontained no structural reforms of failing public policies and was just an emergency plan to limit the damage without solving the problem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the French are militantly resistant to any attempt to remove acquired social rights, regardless of the economic situation, changing demography or dire public finances, as they showed with sustained social unrest over Macron’s raising of the retirement age to 64.It’s not that French workers actually work much less than their European counterparts. But France has less of its population in employment because of a combination of earlier retirement, later entry into the labour market, higher unemployment and welfare dependency.“The markets and the EU are watching us,” Pierre Moscovici, the president of the French court of accounts and a former finance minister and European commissioner, said after presenting anannual reportthat warned that the country’s debt was approaching a tipping point. “As demanding and difficult as it may be, getting our public finances under control from 2026 is imperative for debt sustainability,” he added.France has long enjoyed the indulgence of bond market vigilantes because of its ability to raise revenue and a presumption that its debt was implicitly backed by Germany, since a French financial crisis would trigger severe turbulence in the eurozone. But several credit ratings agencies have recentlylowered France’s sovereign ratingbecause of a concern that the government will be unable to enact serious deficit-cutting measures without a parliamentary majority.French people need to get real about their fiscal predicament before it descends into an acute crisis. So far there is little sign of that reality dawning on either the political class or the population. The left just keeps repeating that the government should soak the rich and reimpose a wealth tax, even though that would make little more than a symbolic dent in the deficit. The populist right argues that the state could save all the money it needs if only it stopped paying benefits to immigrants. Those numbers don’t add up either.With so many politicians encouraging voters to go on believing that “public money” grows on trees or can be borrowed in unlimited amounts –Mélenchonhas arguedin the past that France should default on its debt – it is hard to have a rational debate on the budget.The stage is set for another battle of wills in parliament, and probably in the street. If the uneasy grouping of centrist and conservative parties supporting Bayrou cannot get something resembling his proposed savings through the National Assembly this autumn, France may be plunged into a real financial crisis that could play into the hands of Marine Le Pen’s National Rally ahead of the next presidential election, due in 2027.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionEuropeEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Rather, the court is being asked to determine more mundane questions. Is that 1 actually a 7; is that 6 an 8? and so on.Cases like this present an almost absurd disjuncture between the banality of the evidentiary questions – is a 1 a 7? – and the weight of the consequences: who shall represent over 100,000 citizens in parliament?Australian elections are global exemplars of fairness. All adult citizens are required to be enrolled and to turn out to vote. Ballots can’t be hacked in Australia: they are tangible things, physical pieces of paper, with handwritten markings. Scrutineers from both sides carefully observe the count. The entire electoral process is administered by a politically neutral agency, the Australian Electoral Commission.NSW Liberals to launch court challenge after losing Sydney seat of Bradfield to teal independentRead moreThe prospect of an Australian election being determined by competing subjective assessments about poor handwriting is jarring, at odds with the rigorous procedural fairness so valued and so manifest in Australian electoral law and practice.AEC officials no doubt do their best, and must make thousands of these judgments in the course of closely scrutinised counts like the one in Bradfield. Indeed over the course of a career, many AEC officials must become some of the most experienced handwritten-digit distinguishers in the world. Nonetheless, challenges to their initial judgments can be made under section 281 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, reserving disputed ballots for determination by a more senior AEC official. Further challenges about the formality of these ballots can form the basis of a petition to the court of disputed returns.View image in fullscreenPolitical party scrutineers watch on as Australian Electoral Commission representives recount ballots for the division of Bradfield in Sydney on 27 May 2025.Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAPThe last time the courts considered questions about ballot formality was in 2007 from the seat of McEwen. The resulting federal court case produced one of the more unusual judgments one will find in Australian law reports.Mitchell v Bailey (No 2)contains a lengthy tabular schedule, listing the disposition of 643 reserved ballots and – in 153 instances – reasons for Justice Richard Tracey’s assessments about ballot formality differing from those of the AEC. Examples include comments such as “Notations reasonably resemble numbers. In particular, three of them can be recognised as figures 7, 6, 5.” Why? How? Presumably, they just did to Tracey, just as they did not to AEC officials. No criticism of the late justice is intended; the point is to highlight just how subjective and hence seemingly unfair these assessments – and election outcomes – can appear.Tracey’s observations and principles were adopted in their ballotformality guidelines. Given the rather exhaustive guidance provided by Mitchell v Bailey, what’s left to dispute? Highly subjective judgment calls about handwriting is all that is left to fight over, something akin to Australia’s version of the United States’s unedifyinghanging chadepisode in the 2000 presidential election.Can we do better? Could an election really be decided this way? That one person’s 7 is another person’s 1?Here’s a modest proposal. For decades we’ve been training computers to recognise handwritten digits, principally for making mail processing and delivery more efficient.Massive datasetsof real, handwritten digits have become one of the touchstones of machine learning, test beds for refining algorithms and global competition among researchers.The best algorithmshave 99.82% accuracy in recognising digits. And the AEC itself usesdigital scanningto process Senate ballot papers.The outputs of digit recognition algorithms are probabilities, summing to 1 over the 10 possible digits, collapsing to a probability of almost exactly 1.0 on one candidate digit in most cases, but more spread out when processing poor, ambiguous handwriting.Algorithmically derived, rigorously validated on massive datasets spanning hundreds of thousands of handwritten digits, these probabilities could be a useful alternative – or at least a guide – in helping a judge determine whether a 1 is a 7, whether a 2 is an 8, and so on, and ultimately as to whether a ballot is formal or not. One simple decision rule might be to classify an ambiguous mark as that digit recognised with probability above 0.5, consistent with courts’ reliance on the “balance of probabilities” as a decision rule in many legal settings.Humans remain very much “in the loop” in this process. The algorithms only assist in the hard cases: the ballots subject to dispute. Further, while digit recognition algorithms process single digits, ballot formality turns on whether a unique, valid enumeration of preferences or sequences of digits can be discerned, an assessment that considers not just individuals marks but the ballot as a whole.Surely this guidance could not only help the court in a practical sense (parsing hundreds of reserved ballots) but offer reassurance to the parties – and the voters of Bradfield – that the election is being finally decided rationally and with a degree of objectivity, consistent with the fairness integral to Australian elections.Simon Jackman is an honorary professor at the University of Sydney, specialising in elections, public opinion and data scienceExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025OpinionLaw (Australia)Australian politicsLiberal partyArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

After this ‘rollercoaster of emotions’, says the actor, a Jane Austen or a romcom has to be nextMon 21 Jul 2025 10.36 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 21.31 EDTShareIn Unforgivable, a new 90-minute drama by Jimmy McGovern, Anna Friel never once smiles. She plays Anna Mitchell, whose brother – released from prison as the drama begins – sexually assaulted her preteen younger son. The trauma inflicted is clear: almost throughout, the boy won’t utter a word beyond “yes” and “no”.“We worked on the basis that her anger had to be suppressed,” Friel says, speaking from her home in Windsor. “She’s lost her husband, her mother has died, she’s lost a brother who she absolutely loved. And most of all, she’s lost trust. Trust is so hard to come by, it takes years and years, and when that’s broken, it sets off a domino effect. So while there’s a certain amount of paranoia in Anna’s mood, she has got to hold it together.”The dialogue in the show is pared down and the aesthetic is sparse. At one point during our interview, Friel jokingly turns off her ring-light to mimic how unflattering the lighting was on set. But the effect is perhaps not what she intended: Friel still looks incredible no matter the lighting situation, her fairytale face the same as ever, tough but never hard. But the point she is making is that, with a drama like this, you can’t worry about how you look, “otherwise you lose integrity, authenticity, honesty, rawness”.Friel says there is a certain poetry to the way Unforgivable was shot. “Natural lighting can be a character in itself. And it’s hard, because there is such pressure, particularly on women: should you, shouldn’t you look old? I think there are more important things to focus on, to be honest.”View image in fullscreenSilent fury … Friel as Anna in Unforgivable.Photograph: BBC/LA Productions/Kerry SpicerMcGovern started his writing career on Brookside, which, like Unforgivable, was set in Liverpool in the early 1980s. He left four years before Friel started on the same soap, 32 years ago, when she was 16. She didn’t do a scouse accent then, but does here, as does Leeds-born Austin Haynes, who plays her younger son, during the brief moments he speaks.“Being a child actor myself, I can honestly, hand-on-heart, look back and say I was nowhere near as good as he is,” she says. “They’re phenomenal, the young actors [Finn McParland plays her other son, Peter]: the focus, the concentration. How can they have that understanding at such an age? It’s the equivalent of meditating – but instead of meditating on wonderful manifestations and good thoughts, you’re meditating purely on that one emotion, and you carry that around for a day. It can be quite wearing. They’re really blowing my socks off. And I’m getting to see it all because I’m at an age when I’m only playing mothers – and I’m probably soon to be playing grandmothers.”She says that without chagrin, but it’s a real bugbear among actors over 65 that they are the perfect age to play grandmothers, but all the roles go to women in their 50s. Friel recalls, wryly, howMichael J Foxin Back to the Future Part II, aged 28, played a teenager. “That’s a way more interesting way to do it, because you have more life experience. It’s more interesting to play down than to play up.”At the same time, the role of a mother is far less generic now. It’s not unusual in the streamer age to see a maternal character, such as hers in Unforgivable, with a personality. “I think I probably wouldn’t be working if I’d reached this age in the 1980s,” she says. “Which is crazy, because you become more fascinating in your late 40s or mid-50s, not less – it’s justthis[she gestures theatrically, to her face]. Or aching bones or aching joints. But I think life experience is everything, and if you’re someone who wants to grow and be better, that will show.”View image in fullscreen‘Phenomenal’ … Austin Haynes as Anna’s son.Photograph: BBC/LA Productions/Kerry SpicerThe night before we speak, the drama had a screening in Liverpool for the cast, crew, friends and family. “When it ended,” Friel says, “there was complete and utter silence. Before there was applause, you could have heard a pin drop. And we thought, ‘Gosh, I wonder what people are going to feel, because it’s so thought-provoking, such a challenging piece.’”The challenge is that it’s about child abuse but is morally quite complicated. Of course it doesn’t excuse Joe, the perpetrator, played with an awful wounded plausibility by Bobby Schofield, but nor does it deliver any easy hate figures or certainties. Friel’s character is “really fiercely angry and devastated”, bitter, volatile and hard to warm to. Her problems are redoubled when she can’t get mental health support for her son, as he spirals into despair. “That would be so alienating and infuriating,” she says. “I tried really hard not to judge her. You can’t just go for the easy option in a performance, of, ‘Please like me.’”Unforgivable boasts a cast you will think you have seen together before, particularly Friel and David Threlfall, who plays Anna’s dad, along with Anna Maxwell Martin as a blunt but caring former nun. All three are like a badge of quality for a particular kind of British dramatic realism, yet they hadn’t met before. Friel and Threlfall bonded over matcha, the bright green and very much on-trend drink – “as we get older, we can’t have too much caffeine,” she says, pretend-mumsily, “it makes our heart rate accelerate.”Creating familiarity, says Friel, is probably the most important thing in doing a family drama. “When you have no rehearsal time” – the whole thing was shot in four weeks – “you need that openness and believability. ‘That’s my child’, ‘That’s my father.’”In 2020, Friel was in a film with the same theme, calledSulphur and White– based on the real-life story of David Tait, the survivor of a paedophile ring and a campaigner for the NSPCC. The film was slightly blindsided by Covid – it was released on the eve of lockdown and hardly got an audience – but Friel is still in touch with Tait, having played his mother. “He was one of the first people I sent a screener of Unforgivable to,” she says. “He just cried from beginning to end, because all of his abusers, unfortunately, got away with it. And I think what struck him, as someone who has been abused, is that he carried the effects all the way through his life.”Friel has also just finished shooting, in Bristol, a semi-futuristic, semi-dystopian drama, set in 2038, about “deep poverty and the union of the human spirit”. After that, she says: “I think what I need is a really good comedy, or a romcom, or a Jane Austen novel, something beautiful and sweet.”Friel is often cast in darker roles – in the three seasons of the British so-called Nordic noir, Marcella, she barely smiles either. She doesn’t think it’s reflective of her personality. “I’m quite jolly and funny … I won’t say funny, I’m not allowed to call myself that. But Gracie [her daughter] and I just laugh constantly. We’re silly and lighthearted.” She and her ex, David Thewlis (they split in 2010) never encouraged Gracie to become an actor, but inevitably, having been on film sets in 10 countries before she was one, she is curious about acting, and their tastes are very similar. “We could, all three of us, be put in separate rooms, watch the same thing, write an essay on it and come back and say the same thing. I don’t know if that’s genetics or nurture, but we all have the same taste. We’d have the same notes, the same level of enjoyment or dislike.”View image in fullscreenNot a lot of smiling … Friel as Marcella in the British TV noir drama of the same name.Photograph: Publicity imageGracie turned 20 two weeks ago. A few days later, there was an Oasis gig in Manchester, “which took me back to the carefree days”, says Friel. “It was the most incredible night. Lots of people are referring to it as biblical. I felt like a teenager. All those songs resonate still to this day. To see them reunite, it was an incredible atmosphere, of love and hope and happiness.”She seriously got hope vibes from the Gallagher brothers?“I danced my little bottom off!”Friel turned 49 the day after that, then went to see her father, who is very unwell, her grandmother, who is 99 and pretty hale, and then to the Lake District for her godmother’s funeral.“It’s been a massive rollercoaster of emotions,” she says. “But I still love my job and I hope I’m always getting better at it.She has had wonderful mentors: “Brenda Fricker was one, and when I was on Broadway, I had the amazing Judi Dench giving me little notes and checking in on the phone. I remember being 22, looking up at them, going, ‘How have they done that?’ It’s utter discipline and never, ever feeling that you have got to a point where you can’t be better.”Unforgivable is on BBC Two on 24 JulyExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaTV crime dramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Thankfully, a wonderful casting director believed I was right for farmer Hoggett and pushed for me to get a meeting.George had found the book that the film is based on –The Sheep-Pig by British author Dick King-Smith– while on a trip to Europe with his daughter. I thought farmer Hoggett was from Yorkshire, but the studio said: “No. Movies with accents don’t make money.” Of course,Schindler’s Listwon the best picture Oscar that year and it was filled with accents.They wanted me to keep my American accent so I thought I’d blow smoke up their ass and spent a whole day using this Texas shit-kicker accent. In the end I had to re-record all of those lines using the British accent I ultimately went with.During my makeup test, George was standing nearby. As he walked past, he said: “Lose the sideburns.” I don’t know what got into me. I just said: “No. I like them.” George went, “Who the fuck is he?” and walked off. I was very pleased with myself.We had an animatronic sheep in the middle of real sheep – which doesn’t stick out. The crew used to bet on which one of the flock was fake. At the end of a take, you’d see the real sheep continue to look around and the animatronic one power down. You’d then hear a crew member say, “I got it!”On the second day of filming, I broke for lunch before everybody else. All the animals I’d worked with that morning were on the table, cut up, fricasseed, roasted and seared. That was when I decided to become a vegan.The final scene, where the sheep follow Babe, was a miracle. The woman who worked with the sheep spent five months trying to get them to walk three abreast in rows and follow the pig around the circuit. She was working with them right until we shot. I said, “Away to me pig” and those sheep moved through the circuit without a pause. When the gate closed behind them, the crowd – 200 extras we’d gathered from the local town – went berserk.I asked Chris how he wanted me to deliver my final line and he said: “Right down the lens.” I didn’t expect what happened: reflected back at me in the camera lens I saw not me, but my father. On that thought I laid the line: “That’ll do pig, that’ll do.” At the time I hadn’t forgiven my father, who was a director and very critical of my work, which stung. I didn’t know I had to forgive him. But at that moment, I looked at myself and saw I am my father’s son and I love him. Without a doubt, it brought closure.The only negative thing I ever heard about Babe was from a woman who said it ruined her relationship with her daughter. They used to enjoy Big Macs together and now her daughter wouldn’t eat animals. I thought: “If that’s what you based your relationship on, it sucks anyway!”Neal Scanlan, special effects artistWhat set Babe apart was that it featured realistic animals and not fantasy characters. The goal was to intercut puppets with real animals.To have a convincing animatronic Babe, we had to fit a prosthetic band around the puppet’s neck every day and punch in the hairs one at a time with a needle. We’d start early in the morning. We couldn’t afford more than one prosthetic head, so to go from a standing pig to a sitting pig, we had to take off the head, put it on to the new puppet body, and then punch in all the hairs again to make it a seamless blend. If anything went wrong, we had to start the entire process all over again. It was terrifying.Up until that point, we had always used foam latex for puppets. It’s wonderfully elastic but has no skin-like qualities. We had a chemist working with us who took on the challenge of making skin-like silicone for Babe. He added lots of oil and extra hardener. It set solid but remained flexible. When we’d lay it on paper, it would leach oil. It was a kind of mad chemistry. People who supply silicone skins to the industry use it to this day.View image in fullscreen‘Animatronic dogs were beyond what we were capable of – there’s just so much going on under that fur.’Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyBabe’s eyes were plastic spheres with a plunger inside that moved back and forth. They had a round silicone ball in front of them. We painted an iris on the ball and filled the spheres with clear silicone gel. By pushing the plunger, we could make the pupils bigger or smaller to create her big brown eyes.Ferdinand the duck was a combination of fur and feathers. We had tried using only feathers but we couldn’t lay them individually and make them move. When I watch the scenes with Ferdy and Babe in the shed, I struggle to know what’s animatronic and what is real.We shot in Australia and the heat was phenomenal. Silicone is a great insulator so it was like an oven inside animatronic Babe. After we rehearsed, we’d cover Babe in a foil blanket and keep our fingers crossed that nothing overheated.James Cromwell: ‘My father told me: “Don’t be an actor, you’re too damn tall”’Read moreCloseups of animatronic dogs were a degree beyond what we were capable of. The work everybody did was outstanding but there’s just so much going on under that fur. We failed – they’re impossible. In the end, all dog closeups were digitally enhanced.James had moments of holding Babe in his lap, and there was never a feeling of ridicule. He engaged with the puppets. It was remarkably rewarding to see him reach that level of interaction with something so dependent on your contribution. We did as much as was humanly possible. I’m very proud to have been involved with it.Explore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeFamily filmsGeorge MillerVeganismVegetarianismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some were recovered soon afterwards in Austria, where De Dozsa’s husband bought the Solario painting from an unnamed source.Its whereabouts was unknown until 2017, when De Dozsa tried to sell it through a regional auction house, and it was spotted by someone linked to the Belluno museum.View image in fullscreenChristopher Marinello, a leading specialist art lawyer, said: ‘When it comes to returning stolen art … I can be annoyingly persistent.’Photograph: Apple Photos Clean UpThe painting was handed back to De Dozsa in 2020 as delays caused by the Covid lockdown led to the Italian authorities being unable to supply relevant documents requested by the British police.Over the years, Christopher Marinello, a leading specialist art lawyer, had tried repeatedly to persuade her to do “the right thing” and return it to Belluno. He handled the recovery negotiations on a pro-bono basis because he wanted to help the town in the Veneto region of northernItaly, from where his family originated.De Dozsa initially cited the UK Limitations Act of 1980, which states that a person who buys stolen goods can be recognised as the legal owner if the purchase was unconnected to the theft after more than six years.Marinello dismissed that argument as “nonsense”. He said: “While the UK Limitations Act certainly supported her position, the fact that the painting was listed on the Interpol and Carabinieri stolen art databases, meant that the painting could never be sold, exhibited or even transported without the risk of being seized.”He is the founder of Art Recovery International, which focuses on stolen or looted art and is based in London, Venice and New York. Hisprevious recoveriesinclude a Matisse painting that was stolen in 1987 from Stockholm’s Museum of Modern Art and had disappeared without trace for 25 years until it surfaced in London.De Dozsa eventually agreed to release the painting unconditionally to Belluno.Marinello said: “She has restored my faith in humanity when so many possessors today of stolen artwork try to hold on to it. Despite the rights of the victim, people have no sympathy any more and she has proven otherwise.”He joked: “When it comes to returning stolen art and doing the right thing, I can be annoyingly persistent. But ultimately, it was Barbara de Dozsa’s decision to make, and she chose wisely.”He paid tribute to Arte Generali, the art insurance company that made the recovery possible with a donation to cover the logistical costs, although it was unconnected with this case. “Without their support, this recovery would never have happened,” Marinello said.Another Madonna and Child, by the 19th-century Italian artist Placido Fabris, is among other stolen paintings missing from Belluno. They are listed on theCarabinieri stolen art database.Marinello is calling for the public to contact him if they spot any of them in private or public collections: “The Solario made it to the UK, why not these?”Oscar De Pellegrin, the mayor of Belluno, said: “Returning this painting to the city means giving back a fragment of its identity, its history and its soul.”De Dozsa declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsArt theftItalyArtEuropePaintingNorfolknewsShareReuse this content"

He talks about the friends who tried to help him, and the forgiveness he struggled to findMon 21 Jul 2025 00.01 EDTShareFor three years and four months, Paul Foot has been living in a state of joy. He is in it now, he says, sitting across a table, overlooking London’s Regent’s canal. He’s wearing one of his trademark blue LF Markey boilersuits, and seems serene rather than ecstatic, half smiling. But that’s because the joy doesn’t spike or yo-yo. It’s a “constant”, so reliable that even when someone he knows dies, “there’s still a peace beneath it and a joy in it as well”.Life was not always like this, and the story of how Foot, 51, overturned 28 years of “crushing, all-encompassing depression and anxiety” is told in his critically acclaimed 2023 showDissolve, the filmed special of which is released this week.“I was never bipolar. I never had any highs, it was just massive lows,” he says. “To be technically accurate, I had severe anxiety that led to depression.” He felt he was locked inside a glass box. “Too depressed to go out, lying around in bed.”Foot’s life took a hairpin turn in about three seconds of violent enlightenment one Sunday afternoon while he was driving in the suburbs of south Manchester. He’d stayed overnight, then stopped to see friends after performing his showSwan Powerin Carlisle. It was 4.59pm on 20 March 2022 – the occasion so momentous it’s time-stamped in his memory – when, as he puts it, “my consciousness exploded”.To other motorists, the magical rearrangement of brain chemistry – what Foot calls “the event” – going on behind the wheel of the Nissan Micra was invisible. “The car didn’t swerve. There was no pulling over. I didn’t see bright lights. I just carried on driving,” he says.“It was a moment that was both extraordinary and ordinary” – like stirring from a dream. “It was just, ‘Oh, I’ve woken up …’ And it didn’t matter that I’d spent 28 years in a state of depression. It was gone. Everything was different. Immediately, I thought: ‘I’m not an irritable, angry person. That is not my true nature. That is just how I was. I’ve forgiven everything that anyone has ever done to me or will ever do.’”If that sounds like a lot of forgiving, that’s because when he was 11, Foot was sexually assaulted. He slips this revelation into the middle of a hilarious skit in Dissolve about a fictitious dinner with former Labour MP Chuka Umunna, which is typical of how he pulls the rug from under his audience. But for decades, Foot suppressed the memory of this assault so effectively he had no awareness of it at all, and lived in denial of his depression.View image in fullscreenFoot won the BBC New Comedy award in 1997 before experiencing ‘13 tricky, difficult years’.Photograph: Mark Waugh/Alamy“I had friends who said, ‘You ought to go and see someone who can help you.’” It was his friendRuby Waxwho put him in touch with a psychopharmacologist. “I remember thinking, ‘Please, please don’t tell me to do meditation! Because I just knew I needed medication. I needed something to change what was in there,” he says, stabbing a finger at his head. He came away with a prescription. “I was like, thank God. Thank God.”This was 2017. Foot was 43. The lows evened out. He felt more stable. “I thought, ‘Oh, this is good. Hurrah! This is the end!’ But it wasn’t the end because then, within that stability, I started to say,” and here his voice becomes very quiet, “‘Oh, crikey. I’m remembering what happened to me.’ And those things were verified by other methods. Contemporaneous things. So then I realised. OK. So that’s why I became depressed.”For all those years, he had no awareness of the assault he had experienced? “I think that’s quite common, having spoken to therapists,” he says. “Something happens to you when you’re a child and it doesn’t really register. You go through adolescence, and you don’t remember it. Then, at about 19, a massive depression kicks in. This huge depression in the sense ofabsolute unease.”Therapy helped him to “attempt to forgive what had happened to me”, he says. His voice turns warbly. “Well, Paul, you must forgive yourself as well, blah, blah, blah.”“Therapy got me to a point where I had moved forward from where I was. But in a way, I was still struggling with the forgiveness,” he says. “I’d more or less forgiven. I’d, like, 99% forgiven. But you can’t 99% forgive. You’ve either forgiven or you haven’t.” Foot studied maths at university, which may partly explain the binary approach to a complex emotional and cognitive process.In any case, “that little 1% of non-forgiveness” lodged in him, a burning “1% of resentment”, as deeply embedded and lurkingly painful as a fragment of shrapnel.Still, he was better than he had been, and after a few years he stopped the medication. His friends worried. “They said, ‘You’re going back to the same old Paul.’ Ruby Wax said, ‘You can see it in the eyes.’ My eyes were becoming sort of dead.”His predicament came to a head the night before “the event”. He had made a mistake during his performance of Swan Power in Carlisle – “so minor” that no one appeared to notice. But up started the voice. “‘You stupid idiot, Paul. Why did you make a mistake? You can’t get it right.’”Alone in his hotel room, he “was subjected to the full force of my own … agony of myself. My own brain was torturing me. My inner voice was saying, ‘You’re useless, Paul. You’re hopeless.’”He met friends and had “quite philosophical conversations”, in which Foot argued for the existence of the soul – “There must be a soul, because if we’re just all collections of cells and chemical impulses, then what does love mean? What does sadness mean?” – and recounted his threenear-near-death experiences (he doesn’t want to overclaim them), including six hours spent on the toilet with a very upset stomach.Everything was swirling when he got in his car that Sunday afternoon. He had made a promise to a friend that “if I ever became really, really low, I would go straight back on to the medication. No ifs or buts. No delay.” But the medication was 350 miles away, at home in Buckinghamshire, and anyhow hereallydidn’t want to go back on it. But he was running out of choices.View image in fullscreen‘A lot of people go through their whole lives with no idea what they want to do.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“I had solemnly promised my friend that I would never do anything terrible to myself,” he says. “So that had been ruled out.”This was something he had previously considered?“Yeah, I mean … ” He looks unsure whether to continue. “Well, perhaps it’s not such a bad thing to say that I had felt suicidal.”Essentially, and he says this as if he’s eliminating variables in an algebraic equation, his depression dissolved because “I’d ruled out every single possibility except one: immediately to become better.”In more than three decades of standup, Foot has largely avoided personal revelation. “Well,obviously, I’m not going to do a show about that.Obviously, there’s no comedy in talking about 28 years of depression, and how it all disappeared in an instant,” he told his writing partner, Aaron Kilkenny-Fletcher. Besides, he didn’t know if he would “still be funny” after his big life change. He kept wondering, “Was the creativity intrinsically linked to depression or angst?”But six weeks later, he and Kilkenny-Fletcher were in Bermuda on a writing trip and Foot’s transformation infused all their conversations. They couldn’t escape it. “I was so different. It changed our whole dynamic.”For instance, when Kilkenny-Fletcher forgot their flight times and the phone reception was bad, “I was very calm,” Foot says. “I said, ‘Oh, that’s all right’ … This was so different to the old Paul.”Walking through a hilltop fort in Bermuda, a line came to him: “It’s the end of suffering and it’s right there.” His hands move to hold an imaginary object while he replays this scene, because what he realised, on that hilltop, was that he wanted to offer his experience to others and offer it fully: the joy “is for everyone”.Dissolve flips between very funny, silly and surreal sequences on how people deal with change, Tutankhamun’s troubled rule, homophobia, and giving blood, and intensely serious passages of personal revelation that elicit no laughs but long, deep silence, heavier with attention and affirmation than any applause.“It’s wonderful,” Foot says.Comedyhas changed hugely since he started out in the clubs in the late 90s, when “silence was an enemy … Someone would be straight in and you’d lose your authority on stage.”He’d known he wanted to be a comedian the first time he performed, in Oxford, at 19 – he read maths at Merton College (in the year aboveLiz Truss; they went to the same parties). His debut, mostly unscripted riffing on fruit, wasn’t brilliant, but he didn’t bomb either, and afterwards he told his friends, “I’m going to be a professional comedian.” “And they said, ‘You’ve just started a maths degree. Don’t be silly.’ But I knew immediately what I wanted to do. So that was nice. Because a lot of people go through their whole lives and have no idea what they want to do.”View image in fullscreenOn stage in 2016.Photograph: Mark Waugh/AlamyFoot grew up in Buckinghamshire, with a younger brother – not a million miles from where he lives now, “in a boring, forgettable place where nothing happens”. His mother was a professional photographer (“‘You’re standing ever so stiff! Try to be more natural!”), and his dad “did work as a credit controller briefly … but he wasn’t someone who you’d really say had a career.”I wonder if Foot was always the funny one in his family, but he says not. “I was very quiet.” At 17, 18, he started to be funny at school, a boys’ grammar in High Wycombe. “But I was never funny before that.”Really? “No. Never at all funny,” he says. He sounds rather flat. Maybe he was funny inside? “I don’t think so,” he says. “Until the age of 17, there was nothing funny about me. I was ever so serious. Very quiet.”As a comedian, he was initially extraordinarily successful. “A lot of things happened very quickly.” There was a BBC New Comedy award in 1997; the Open Mic award at the Edinburgh festival.Caroline Ahernepraised his work.But then followed “13 tricky, difficult years. Playing really tough gigs where people weren’t interested in what I was doing. It was terrible and they didn’t want it.” The other performers would say, “You really need to think about what you’re doing, Paul.”Looking back, he may have turned professional too soon. It was hard to make ends meet; he built up debts. “But in the end, it turned around and I started to make money.”In many ways, the period in his 30s when he was repaying his debts “was one of the most carefree times of my life”. It’s not how many people regard debt. “Yes,” Foot says. “Because I didn’t have any spare money. So there wasn’t any money to worry about. It was just a simple, straightforward life of living frugally.”View image in fullscreen‘Because I was so ill, I just carried on and on and on.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianHe built an audience, going from table to table after his shows. “I wonder if you’d be interested in joining my society, the Guild of Connoisseurs?” he’d ask. (Today, the guild – a fanclub, basically – flourishes.) “They’d say, ‘We were in hysterics! Where do we sign? Then at the next table they’d say, ‘Why would we want to join that? You’re the least funny comedian we’ve ever seen.’”He was amazed one night when an audience member asked to buy the “disturbance” he’d used in his set – the comic prompt cards he holds up, with one of his sketches on the reverse. “I said, ‘No. It’s a prop. I need it.’ And he said, ‘I’ll give you all the money in my pocket’,” and handed over £13.33. “And I thought, “That’s all right for a little picture.” Now the disturbances sell for £70 each.Still, it must have been tough to persist through those lean years while spending periods bedridden with depression. “I had to be very strong in a sort of way,” he says. “Aaron has said that he doesn’t think I would be a comedian now if it wasn’t for the depression. Because someone who was not in that state would have stopped earlier. They would have said, ‘This is going so badly for so long. For my own mental wellbeing, I need to not do this any more. I need to preserve my own sense of self.’”But Foot didn’t have that instinct for self-preservation. “Because I was so ill, I just carried on and on and on. I couldn’t think of anything else to do.”We have been talking for nearly two hours. Is he still in a state of joy? “Yes,” he says. “I feel joy all the time.” He knows now that he can “just be happy … just choose happiness”. Even that little fragment of non-forgiveness has vanished. He is working on his next show, which may or may not be more personal than Dissolve. Recently, though, he listened to a recording of one of his very early performances, and obviously there were differences, obviously he has evolved, but he was struck, he says, by how “there’s something, some core thing, that’s unchanged.

Ahead of a new Edinburgh show, Peter Richardson tells us why his riotous creation still makes audiences laugh 40 years onBrian LoganMon 21 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 03.41 EDTShareIt was the moment comedy broke with sexism – yet it happened in a strip club. It was a fervour of free creative expression – yet it retained a commercial, careerist edge. It was one of the longest-running and most successful brands in UK comedy history – which few people could now recognise.At the Edinburgh fringe this summer, The Comic Strip Presents … will be memorialised in a series of film screenings and Q&As with its creator and prime mover Peter Richardson. Richardson was the impresario behind the legendary comedy club The Comic Strip, which opened in 1980. When he and his star performers – Rik Mayall, Alexei Sayle, French and Saunders among them – created Channel 4’s The Comic Strip Presents … a couple of years later, he could legitimately claim to be the man who brought alternative comedy to television.This being a celebration of an iconic moment in UK comedy history, one might assume Edinburgh’s Usher Hall or the 750-seat Pleasance Grand has been set aside to host. But one might assume wrong. “When I started [showing these films] about a year ago,” Richardson tells me, “we didn’t have the money to advertise them. So we’d arrive at theatres that had about 30 people who had somehow read our minds that we were going to be there. And 30 people in a 300-seat cinema can be hard work.”The Comic Strip Presents … ran for three series on Channel 4 from 1982-1988, then it moved to the BBC in the early 90s before making a return to Channel 4 for one-off specials, the most recent in 2016. But it’s not a big name in comedy – far less so than, for example,The Young Ones, the BBC sitcom starring some of the same talents and broadcast at the same time.View image in fullscreenJennifer Saunders in The Comic Strip Presents: War.Photograph: RGR Collection/Alamy“It wasn’t good television,” admits Richardson, “because it wasn’t repetitive, and television is about repeating a formula and people getting to know it well.” And was it even comedy? One of the show’s stars,Mayall, argued that it shouldn’t have been called The Comic Strip, and that “Interesting Films” might have been a better fit. In fact, the series was – likeInside No 9more recently – a tonally varying anthology show, a suite of standalone films united only by sensibility, and by the performers bringing them to the screen.“I told Channel 4,” says Richardson, “‘These performers are so good they don’t need to be stuck playing one-dimensional characters. They can play all sorts. One week they can be a heavy metal band, the next week they can be The Famous Five.’ You could call it bad television, because you’re not seeing more of the same. But as it’s gone on, it’s become a collection of very memorable one-off moments and that’s what people now remember.”The performers also includedAdrian Edmondson,Nigel Planerand Richardson himself, with a rotating supporting cast that included Keith Allen, Robbie Coltrane and more. At the time, they were setting the UK comedy scene ablaze. That all started at the Comedy Store, a strip club and the anarchic HQ of what had recently been called “alternative comedy”. Richardson’s coup was to cherrypick the most exciting voices of that generation, and cart them off to another strip club, a little less anarchic, a few blocks up the road: the Raymond Revuebar. Here, with the financial support of the Rocky Horror Picture Show producer Michael White, he opened The Comic Strip club – a name that seems obvious, although “the New Depression Club” was, according to Edmondson, a very near miss.For a year from 1980-1981, the Comic Strip was the hippest and hottest comedy night in town. “The bouncers at Raymond Revuebar had a simple rule of thumb for who was directed where,” Sayle later wrote. “If they reeked of aftershave they were sent to the strip show; if they smelled of beer they came to us.” Celebs piled in: Bianca Jagger, Dustin Hoffman. Robin Williams came and demanded to perform, to impress his guest, David Bowie. Sayle offered him 15 minutes. Williams said: “I told [Bowie] I’d do an hour”. Sayle: “You can’t.” Williams: “I’ll buy the club!” Sayle: “We don’t own it. It belongs to a bouffant-haired pornographer.” The buzz even reached the pages of the London Review of Books, whose critic noted, “within seconds, [Sayle] has the audience agape. Most of them, it seemed, had never been called cunts before.”View image in fullscreenOne-off moments ... Alexei Sayle in Didn’t You Kill My Brother?Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyThen Channel 4 came calling, looking for cutting-edge talent to help launch the new broadcaster on to the country’s airwaves. Richardson was given carte blanche. “They said, ‘What do you want to do?’ and I said, ‘I want to make six films, all different.’” The first, Five Go Mad in Dorset, was transmitted on the station’s opening night, and the controversy around its satire of Enid Blyton attitudes gave that event a front-page news fillip. But Five Go Mad willnotbe celebrated at the fringe this summer, says Richardson. “Taking the piss out of racism and sexism [in that way] is long gone,” he says. “It’s not a funny issue like it was when we did it in the 80s.”One option might have been to re-edit the episode – a course of action in which Richardson, now 73, has freely indulged as the Edinburgh shows have come together. Not for him a bask in the glory of his youthful success. “What we’ve done,” he says, “is revisited the films and said, ‘30 years later they need some adjustment.’ Because things go faster now.” Western spoof Fistful of Travellers Cheques has been “cut back a bit”. So too has late-period favourite Four Men in a Car. And a scene has been trimmed from The Strike, the show’s faux Hollywood movie making mincemeat of the miners’ strike. That one bagged a Golden Rose of Montreux comedy award, and starred Richardson (the only performer to appear in every episode) as Al Pacino playing, er, Arthur Scargill. “I could do Pacino much better now,” he laughs, “because I worked with John Sessions onStella Street.” So now, he says, slipping into a convincing Italian-American accent, “I can do Al.”Stella Street was another of Richardson’s TV hits, undertaken when The Comic Strip Presents, by any measure his life’s work, was in abeyance. Even when he was a jobbing comedian, in double act The Outer Limits with Nigel Planer, Richardson was a child of amateur film-makers and a wannabe film-maker himself. With The Comic Strip, he made movies for cinematic release: The Supergrass in 1985, and Eat the Rich two years later. Further TV specials included Red Nose of Courage, telling the tale of John Major’s flight from the circus to parliament, and2011’s The Hunt for Tony Blair, imagining the ex-PM on the run having been accused of a series of murders.Both will be screened at the fringe, MC’d by comedian Robin Ince and with special guests including Sayle and Allen. Richardson is modest about the achievement of having brought these 30 years’ worth of films to the screen. “I always thought we were the new Ealing comedies. And [Ealing Studios at its peak] made about 150 films over 20 years, of which about 15 are remembered. So our strike rate isn’t too bad. We made some flops, but at least one or two out of each series are really good.”View image in fullscreen‘These performers are so good they don’t need to be stuck playing one-dimensional characters’ … Nigel Planer and Dawn French in Four Men in a Car.Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamySome, indeed, are carved on this writer’s heart – notably Bad News Tour and More Bad News, the show’s two-part heavy metal spoof, which predated This Is Spinal Tap and ended up with Edmondson, Mayall and co performing live on stage, under a hail of beer glasses, at the 1986 Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington.Richardson is at peace with the under-appreciation of The Comic Strip Presents, acknowledging that, as a bloody-minded sitcom refusenik way back when, he is the auteur of his own misfortune. He is delighted to be bringing the remastered films to Edinburgh, a city in which, back in the day, he and Planer once toured as a support act to Dexy’s Midnight Runners. “FrontmanKevin Rowlandcomplained,” he says, “that we didn’t do new material at every performance.”Expect no new material at these screenings – but a new experience, perhaps. “It’s a great thing,” says Richardson, “to show them in the cinema. You don’t often get to share comedy television with an audience, and it changes the whole experience: people laughing around you. We’ve discovered that thereisan audience around the country who want to see these films on the big screen and talk about them. It’s fantastic that something we created 30 or 40 years ago is still creating laughter. I love it.”The Comic Strip Presents … is at the Fringe is on 2, 3, 8, 9 and 10 August atJust the Tonic, EdinburghExplore more on these topicsComedyTV comedyTelevisionChannel 4Edinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has been described as the “best-sounding new club in the world”, and when the first track plays you can hear why.Rotund bass lines roll across the acoustically treated room, propelled by an extraordinarily powerful, horn-loaded bass enclosure named the Funktion-One F132. High-pitched melodies and intricate textures develop with startling clarity. And as for the call-and-response ad-libs – they sound as if the vocalists are standing only metres away.Open Ground certainly knows how to make a great first impression. “I remember the moment exactly,” recalls Eddy Toca, AKA Piccell. The Angola-born DJ, who is now based in Dortmund, is here to play alongside DJ Lag and the rest of Barulho World, his afro-electronic collective. “It was a flash. It was a bang. We couldn’t compare it to any other place we’ve ever played. It’s like a dream.”Open Ground is located in Wuppertal, just outside the Ruhr valley, a location known predominantly for its 125-year-old suspended monorail and as the home of the late Pina Bausch’s famous dance theatre. It’s a five-hour train ride from Berlin, a city that has often stolen the electronic music spotlight from the rest of Germany due to its mythologised hedonism and notoriously selective scene, credited to clubs such as Berghain. Yet since opening in December 2023, Open Ground has become a pilgrimage site for nightlife enthusiasts and DJs from all over the world.British musicianFloating Pointshas called it“probably the greatest-sounding club in the EU.” Drum’n’bassDJ Mantrasaid: “It can almost bring you to tears.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s like a dream’ … Open Ground.Photograph: Open GroundThere are more than eight decades of embodied music knowledge between Open Ground’s two founders, Markus Riedel and Mark Ernestus. Prior to the club, Riedel worked for 20 years at the esteemed Berlin-based record label Hard Wax, which was founded in 1989 by Ernestus, who is known for his pioneering work in dub techno with Basic Channel and Rhythm & Sound. In 2008, Riedel relocated with his family back to his native Wuppertal to take a position at his brother’s company, a global communications firm that lists Formula One, the Fifa World Cup, Eurovision, and the Olympics as its clients.Eight years later, the city approached the Riedel brothers with an idea to convert a decommissioned second world war bunker near the train station into a nightclub as part of its urban renewal efforts, though the project itself has received no cultural funding. Entirely financed by Riedel’s brother Thomas, the renovation took seven years and involved big recalibrations: they had to consolidate several smaller rooms, saw out the concrete ceiling, and account for an unexpected water reservoir space that now serves as the ventilation room and the smaller “Annex” dancefloor. The team evenchanged the air-conditioning systemto accommodate for the ideal positioning of the sound design.Riedel, Ernestus and Open Ground’s music curator Arthur Rieger take me on a tour before its opening hours. Stepping inside the space, divorced from the usual chatter of patrons, there is an immediate, monastic hush that envelops the entire club. The acoustician, Willsingh Wilson of Wax Acoustics, installed wall-to-wall grey fibre panelling throughout the entire space (rather than only in the music areas, as is the case with most clubs). This patented material absorbs disruptive sonic reflections, providing a prime container to exalt the Funktion-One and its full spectrum range, from high-pitched bird chirps of 20 kilohertz to low, vibrating frequencies that stoop to 24 hertz. Open Ground is also one of the rare indoor installations of the potent F132 subwoofers.View image in fullscreen‘Club owners would rather spend €50,000 on an amazing LED installation than the same amount on acoustic treatment’ … Mark Ernestus.Photograph: Chris ParkinsonErnestus does not consider great sound a luxury, but an imperative. “When humans were hunters and gatherers, our ears were our alarm system,” he says. “The ears are one of the first organs that develop in the embryo and are hardwired to the parts of the brain that process stress. Even 50 decibels, which is a quiet room with a fridge, for example, can be damaging in the long run. It increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. Basically, there’s almost no healthy noise.”Prolonged exposure to poor-audio quality and inadequate acoustic treatment in particular is an occupational health hazard. The human nervous system perceives distorted, harsh or poorly balanced sound as a low-level threat, triggering a cascade of physiological stress responses that can manifest as increased cortisol production, muscle tension, cognitive fatigue and sleep disruption. Compounded long term, this can lead to an increased risk of heart disease and metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes.The brain also compensates for the dissonant auditory input with headaches and eye strain. Yet paradoxically, poor audio quality will often cause DJs to increase the volume of the monitors to compensate, only to further aggravate the body. This is why, in its most extreme forms, sound has been used by military forces aspsychological sonic warfareto induce anxiety attacks, ear pain and hypertension.View image in fullscreen‘The ears are hardwired to the parts of the brain that process stress’ … inside the club.Photograph: Jonas MokoschErnestus has had tinnitus since the age of 18, so he is intimately aware of music’s physical toll. “Normally if I am in a club for most of the night – tinnitus aside – I can feel just how knackered I am the next day from the stress level. Here, I sleep only an hour longer maybe, but I feel fit.”If acoustic investment is so vital, why is it systematically undervalued? According to Ernestus, the barrier isn’t necessarily financial, but a matter of misplaced priorities. “We take in about 90% of sensory information through our eyes, and I think it is because of that that the visuals are always overrated,” he said. “Club owners who I know would typically rather spend €50,000 on an amazing LED installation than the same amount on acoustic treatment.”At Open Ground, there also appears to be a commitment towards artist welfare that can only be intuited by people who have spent a greater part of their lifetime at raves. Backstage, artists have private showers to freshen up after long, irregular hours on the road. There’s a bathroom adjacent to the booth for DJs pulling night-long shifts. Before the show, artists gather backstage for a catered vegetarian dinner because healthy meals are hard to come by on tour. “A lot of the planning came from our own experience. If you give an artist or DJ ideal working conditions, it translates into a good performance,” Riedel says.View image in fullscreenClubbers queue to get in.Photograph: Open GroundOptimising for every detail ultimately benefits audiences, too, in subtle ways that the casual clubgoer may fail to notice. Annex and the main dancefloor Freifeld are strategically designed and lit for individuals to dance comfortably on a sparse floor. In the indoor sitting area, there are small monitors playing out the set from Freifeld in real time, so clubbers can rest while still engaging with the music. Throughout, no one needs to raise their voices to converse with one another.Returning to the dancefloor after my tour, I watch a twentysomething woman in the front row flail her entire body to and fro, losing herself in a wild, interpretive dance. The night is still young and the main floor still semi-empty, but she moves as unselfconsciously as though it is peak time. Gazing at her, I think back to what Markus’s wife, Christine, told to me earlier in the night: “The sound is so good, you don’t need drugs.”Explore more on these topicsDance musicFloating PointsGermanyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She will play a film-maker arriving in Paris for fashion week, following her role as Maria Callas in last year’s Netflix biopic Maria. Winocour previously premiered the Eva Green-led sci-fi film Proxima at the festival.Ronan, who was last seen in the alcoholism dramaThe Outrunand Steve McQueen’s Blitz, will lead the Bristol-set comedy thriller Bad Apples, playing a teacher forced into drastic lengths while dealing with a particularly troubling 11-year-old. The official synopsis promises “uneasy laughs” and a “provocative” tone.Reeves will leadAziz Ansari’s directorial debut, Good Fortune, as an angel who engineers a body swap between a poor and a rich man, played by Ansari and Seth Rogen, respectively. Ansari has said he hopes the film helps to resurrect the theatrically released R-rated comedy. “Aziz is great,” Reeves toldEntertainment Weekly. “A great writer, director, actor. I had such a fantastic experience working with him.”Toronto will also see directorial debuts from actors James McAvoy, Brian Cox and Euphoria’s Maude Apatow, daughter of Judd Apatow. McAvoy directed California Schemin’, based on the true story of Scottish rappers pretending to be American, Cox has helmed Glenrothan, a drama described as a “love letter to Scotland”, and Apatow is behind Poetic License, a comedy starring her mother Leslie Mann.The festival will also see the world premiere of Christy, a biopic of the groundbreaking female boxer Christy Martin starring Sydney Sweeney. The film, from the Animal Kingdom director David Michôd, will cover Martin’s rise in the 1990s and then later her husband’s attempt to murder her. “Our film is a wild mix of inspiring underdog sports-world story and personal saga,” Michôd said toW Magazine. “Sydney trained her butt off to play the part. The beauty of Sydney is that she turned up to work every day with her tail wagging, ready to go. No matter how tough it was, she was like a ray of sunshine.”Other true stories premiering include the 1930s-set Palestine 36 about a Palestinian uprising against colonial British rule, the historical drama Nuremberg starring Rami Malek and Russell Crowe, Agnieszka Holland’s Franz Kafka biopic Franz, Swiped which stars Lily James as the founder of the dating app Bumble and Paul Greengrass’s previously announced survival thriller The Lost Bus, which stars Matthew McConaughey as a schoolbus driver trying to save children from the deadly 2018 Camp fire in California.Premieres that had also already been announced before Monday include Rian Johnson’s much-anticipated Knives Out sequelWake Up Dead Man, which brings back Daniel Craig and adds Josh O’Connor, Glenn Close and Mila Kunis, the buzzy Brendan Fraser-led comedy drama Rental Family from Beef director Hikari, the Blue Valentine director Derek Cianfrance’s Roofman with Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, Nicholas Hytner’s period comedy The Choral starring Ralph Fiennes and based on an original Alan Bennett script and Steven Soderbergh’s dark comedy The Christophers with Michaela Coel, Ian McKellen and Baby Reindeer breakout Jessica Gunning.Chris Evans will also play a movie star abducted by a group of radicals in Sacrifice, an action comedy also starring Anya Taylor-Joy, Salma Hayek, John Malkovich and Charli xcx. Director Bobby Farrelly, known for co-directing hit films such as There’s Something About Mary, will unveil Driver’s Ed, a new comedy starring the White Lotus breakout Sam Nivola.Aaron Taylor-Johnsonand Theo James will also headline the heist thriller Fuze from the Scottish director David Mackenzie.Other notable premieres include the offbeat romantic comedy Eternity with Elizabeth Olsen and Miles Teller, mystery thriller The Ugly from Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho and Easy’s Waltz from True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto with Al Pacino and Vince Vaughn.Documentaries set to premiere include Baz Luhrmann’s EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert and films about subjects such as John Candy, teen series Degrassi and music festival Lilith Fair.The festival takes place from the 4 to 14 September.Explore more on these topicsToronto film festivalAngelina JolieFestivalsSaoirse RonanKeanu ReevesAziz AnsariAnya Taylor-JoynewsShareReuse this content"

Examples cited includeNetflix’s global hit Adolescence, Say Nothing on Disney+ and Sky’s Artist of the Year series.However, it said that unlike the PSBs, which operate under legislation to make public service content universally available, these services often have their content behind a paywall, and they are not required to commission British content or invest in homemade productions across the UK.Last year, the Media Act came into force which ensured that the content and streaming services offered by PSBs, such as the iPlayer and ITVX, were given due prominence on TV-based services such as pay-TV, smart TVs and on other streaming devices.View image in fullscreenOfcom said non-public service broadcasters make high-quality content that contributes to British culture, such as Netflix’s Adolescence.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixHowever, this legislation did not extend to video-sharing platforms, a sector dominated by YouTube, the most popular platform among young children in particular.“Public service media is stitched into the cultural fabric of UK society. It starts conversations, educates and informs, and brings us together in moments of national importance,” said Cristina Nicolotti Squires, broadcasting and media group director at Ofcom. “But in a world dominated by global streaming platforms, public service media risks becoming an endangered species, and time is running out to intervene to protect it.”According to Ofcom research, 43% of children aged four to 17 watch YouTube on a weekly basis, while last year fewer than half of 16- to 24-year-olds tuned into broadcast TV in an average week.The issue is compounded by research showing that the streaming services offered by public service media companies only account for 9% of all viewing, as they struggle to hold on to viewers in the streaming era.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the management of the Unesco world heritage site said in a brief statement on Monday that his performance had been cancelled.Gergiev’s appearance, which would have been his first in Europe sinceRussiabegan its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, had been strongly endorsed by Vincenzo De Luca, the leftwing president of the Campania region. The regional authorities organise and fund the Un’Estate da Re festival – billed as a highlight of the summer season in southern Italy.The cancellation came after more than 16,000 people, including Nobel laureates, Italian and international politicians and activists, signed a letter addressed to De Luca and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, calling for Gergiev’s appearance not to go ahead.Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of Alexei Navalny whodied in an Arctic prison last year, wrote in an op-ed published by La Repubblica last week that Gergiev’s performance would be “a gift to the dictator”. She said the 72-year-old was not only a “dear friend” and supporter of Putin but also a “promoter” of the Russian president’s “criminal policies”.The concert sparked a clash between De Luca and Italy’s culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, who warned that it risked sending the wrong message. “Art is free and cannot be censored,” Giuli said in comments reported by Ansa. “Propaganda, however, even if done with talent, is something else.”The event’s cancellation was celebrated by critics, with Pina Picierno, vice-president of the European parliament and among the signatories of the letter, writing on social media: “We explained, we fought and we won!”Riccardo Magi, leader of the small leftwing More Europe party, said Gergiev’s performance would have been “an intolerable humiliation for the victims of Putin’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine”.Gergiev has repeatedly voiced support for Putin, appearing in a 2012 campaign ad, endorsing the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and conducting a patrioticconcertin Syria’s ancient city of Palmyra in 2016, after Russian forces helped the former dictator Bashar al-Assad recapture it.Widely seen as one of Russia’s most powerful cultural figures, Gergievwas firedfrom several European concerts, festivals and theatres, including Milan’s La Scala, forrefusing to condemnPutin over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The last time he performed in Italy was at La Scala on 23 February 2022, hours after the invasion began.Gergiev’s US agent has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsValery GergievRussiaVladimir PutinAlexei NavalnyItalyClassical musicnewsShareReuse this content"

From a retail sales standpoint, we are generating about $3.6bn (£2.7bn) in global retail sales across our entire portfolio and Bluey is a really, really big chunk of that.”The popularity of the cartoon heeler – an Australian dog bred to herd cattle – is a phenomenon.Bluey was the most watched show in the USacross all genres in 2024 and kept that spot in thefirst half of this year.Its music is also a hit and has been streamed 1bn times, as of last week.The show has spawned a dizzying array of product deals. Fans can buy Bluey-inspired paddling pools, bumper cars, tents, hot-water bottles, board games and nappies – on top of the usual merchandise staples of lunch boxes, pyjamas, books and toys.There is already a Bluey theatre production and Bluey’s World – a “one-of-a-kind guided immersive experience” – has opened in Queensland. Meanwhile, Bluey has an unprecedenteddeal with Legocovering regular Lego sets and Duplo, which is designed for preschool children.Despite the BBC’s background in traditional broadcasting, it has been the ability of BBC Studios to exploit digital channels such as YouTube and TikTok that has led executives to conclude Bluey can appeal to parents and young adults.Bluey’s official channels now have more than 21 million subscribers, amassing 13bn lifetime views. The show has almost 5 million TikTok followers.Evan Shapiro, a Hollywood producer turned media analyst, said BBC Studios was leading the way in its understanding that digital platforms were now the drivers of brands and popular culture.“The case study is Bluey,” he said. “It isn’t just a hit on TV. It is the size of [YouTube’s biggest creator] MrBeast. Fandom is the engine of economics and growth. You follow the audience wherever they are.”Raia said Bluey was on the way to becoming “a true lifestyle brand” across the generations.“Within seven months, we had a million TikTok subscribers,” said Raia. “That was a moment where we were really able to find the fans that are not purely preschool – young adult audiences and teens really started to get this exposure.“We want to be No 1 in preschool, which we’re well on our way to achieving. We have so much more to do in terms of growing in the adult space and thinking about what those adult purchasers are open to.”Bluey, produced by Ludo Studio in Australia, was originally co-commissioned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the BBC. However, BBC Studios owns Bluey’s global distribution and merchandising rights. TheBBC’s annual reportrevealed its record commercial revenues were driven by “the licensing of the Bluey brand in particular”.Bluey’s rise is to continue with the arrival of amovie in 2027. Disney has alreadyannouncedit will be the first non-Disney children’s brand to feature in its parks.Hardened fans may worry about overexposure. However, Raia said her team remained cautious in its acceptance of product tie-ups. “We say no, quite honestly, a lot more than we say yes,” she said.Kathryn VanArendonk, a critic who is writing a book about the Bluey phenomenon, said its success as a brand came down to the evocative nature of the storytelling.“Almost no children’s television in the history of that genre has managed to do the thing that Bluey does,” she said. “It is just as entertaining, accessible and emotionally meaningful for adults as it is for kids.“Multiple audiences see their own desires, interests, concerns and challenges reflected back at them. That’s just so hard to do and it’s so incredibly appealing when something can pull it off.”Explore more on these topicsBlueyBBCTelevisionChildren's TVnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Toasted ham baguettes in hand, we cheered as the new-generation Nightjet drew into Vienna Hauptbahnhof. It was a little before 7pm, and as the carriages hummed past I felt a rush of joy, like celebrity trainspotterFrancis Bourgeois, but without the GoPro on my forehead. For more than three years I’ve been documenting the renaissance of sleeper trains, and I’d wondered if I might one day tire of them. But the thrill seems only to intensify each time I embark on another nocturnal adventure, this time with my two daughters – aged eight and five – who were already arguing over the top berth. The first four carriages were designated for travellers to the Italian port city of La Spezia, the other seven carrying on to Roma Tiburtina, where we would alight at 10am. Once in Rome we had 24 hours to eat classic carbonara, dark chocolate gelato, and bike around the Villa Borghese before taking a train to Florence.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) has played the lead role in resuscitating Europe’s night trains. Towards the end of 2016, ÖBB launched its Nightjet network on 14 routes, using old rolling stock it bought from Deutsche Bahn. Then, to the delight of train nerds like me, it launched a brand-new fleet at the end of 2023, and now operates 20 routes across Europe. We were now on board this high-spec service, which smelled of freshly unpacked furniture, the carpets soft underfoot, the lighting adjustable to disco hues of neon blue and punk pink.We were booked into a couchette carriage, which mostly comprisesd mini cabins designed for solo travellers preferring privacy. Placing shoes and small bags in lockers, passengers can open a metal door with a keycard and crawl into their single berth, drawing the door closed around them, and not have to look at another human until morning. Last year I had trialled the mini cabins from Vienna to Hamburg alongside a tall friend who had likened the experience to sleeping inside a bread bin, though I hadn’t found it as claustrophobic as I’d feared, just a bit hard, chilly, and with a pillow as flat as a postage stamp. So I was curious to see how the carriage’s four-person private compartments, for families and groups, would differ.View image in fullscreenNew generation Nightjet train in Austria.Photograph: Christian BlumensteinNormally happy to share with strangers, I’d booked a whole compartment for the three of us: more to protect other hapless travellers from my children, who were now swinging off the berths like members of Cirque du Soleil, their sweaty socks strewn under the seats. With raised sides, the upper berths were safe for the girls to sleep in without rolling out, and I set about tucking in their sheets while they settled down to finish their baguettes. There is no dining car on the Nightjet, so we’d bought food from the station, which was now moving backwards as the train sailed out of the Austrian capital in silence, smoothly curving south-west.Two days earlier we’d arrived in Vienna by train from London, via Paris, and had checked into theSuperbude Wien Prater, a curious hotel that appeared part art-installation, part hostel, with gen Zs slouched around worn leather sofas on MacBooks. With four-bed family cabins overlooking the Prater amusement park, it was a great location from which to explore the city, then finish the evening with a terrifying rollercoaster and a spicy Bitzinger wurst. A friend had described Vienna to me as a grand and beautiful “retirement village”, but, on the contrary, its green spaces, playgrounds and museums made it an easy stop for 48 hours with kids.The thrill seems only to intensify each time I embark on another nocturnal rail adventureHopping off the Nightjet from Paris, we’d gone straight to my favourite restaurant,Edelgreisslerei Opocensky– an unassuming nook serving homely dishes such as stuffed gnocchi, and goulash with dumplings – before whiling away an afternoon at the Children’s Museum atSchönbrunn Palace.Dressing up like young Habsburgs, the girls had swanned around in wigs and musty gowns, laying tables for banquets and begging not to leave – a far cry from our usual museum experiences. Before boarding this train we’d had one last run around the interactiveTechnical Museum, where the human-sized hamster wheels, peg games and slides had so worn out the children that my five-year-old was asleep as the train plunged into the Semmering mountain pass.It was still light as we swept around the Alps, my eight-year-old kneeling at the window and asking where local people shopped, so few and far between were signs of human life. Horses grazed in paddocks, cows nuzzled, and the occasional hamlet emerged from round a bend as though the chalets were shaken like dice and tossed into the slopes. In the blue-grey twilight we watched streams gleam like strips of metal, and spotted a single stag poised at the edge of a wood, before the train made a long stop at the Styrian city of Leoben, at which point we turned in.View image in fullscreenMonisha Rajesh and her daughters disembark the night train.Photograph: Monisha RajeshLike the mini cabins, the compartment was still too cold, the pillow still too flat, but the berths were wider and the huge window a blessing compared with the single berths’ portholes – this one allowed for wistful gazing.Shoving a rolled-up jumper under my head, I fell asleep, waking at 7am to rumpled clouds and a golden flare on the horizon. Most night trains terminate soon after passengers have woken up, but this one was perfect, allowing us to enjoy a leisurely breakfast of hot chocolate and jam rolls while watching the Tuscan dawn breaking into song, and Umbrian lakes and cornfields running parallel before we finally drew into Rome – on time.When travelling alone I relish arriving with the entire day at my disposal, but with children it’s hard work waiting until 3pm to check in to accommodation, so I default to staying at a Hoxton hotel if one is available. Its Flexy Time policy allows guests to choose what time they check in and out for free, and by 11am we had checked in, showered and set off to toss coins in the Trevi fountain, finding thick whorls of eggy carbonara at nearby trattoria Maccheroni, and gelato at Don Nino. To avoid the crowds and heat, we waited until 6pm to hire an electric pedal car from Bici Pincio at the Villa Borghese and drove around the landscaped, leafy grounds, relishing the quietness of the evening ride. Excited about the next adventure in Florence, the girls had only one complaint: that they couldn’t ride there on the night train.Monisha Rajesh is the author of Moonlight Express: Around the World by Night Train (Bloomsbury, £22), published on 28 August and available on pre-order atguardianbookshop.comOmioprovided travel in a four-person private compartment in a couchette carriage from Vienna to Rome (from £357).

Perfect for a celebratory summer dinner for two and easy to scale up to cater for more guests – just use a really big tray for the vegetables and a second one for as many trout fillets as you need. And if you’d like to veganise the dish, just use big triangles of firm tofu instead of the trout, and cook everything together for half an hour.Miso trout with aubergine, pak choi and peanutsPrep15 minCook30 minServes21 large aubergine, halved lengthways, then cut into 1cm-thick slices2 tbsp sesame oil5 tsp miso paste(red or white) – a gluten-free one, if need be2 sustainably-sourced trout fillets2 heaped tbsp salted peanuts, chopped2 pak choi, quarteredJuice of 1 limeFlaky sea salt, to taste1 red chilli, stalk discarded, flesh finely chopped (discard the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)2 spring onions, trimmed and finely slicedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Tip the aubergine slices into a roasting tin large enough to hold them all in a single layer, then add the sesame oil and three teaspoons of the miso paste. Using your hands, mix well to coat the slices, then roast for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, spread each trout fillet with a teaspoon of the remaining miso paste, then scatter the chopped peanuts on top. Once the aubergines have had 20 minutes, add the pak choi to the tin and gently stir through the aubergines to pick up the flavoured oil; add a little more sesame oil, if need be. Make some space in the mix for the fish, lay in the fillets, then return to the oven for 10 minutes, until the fish is just cooked through (trout fillets tend to be so thin that they cook to my liking in 10 minutes, but if yours are thicker, go for 12-15 minutes).Once out of the oven, dress the vegetables with the lime juice and a little sea salt, if needed, scatter over the sliced chilli and spring onions, and serve hot.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Why gen Z are giving up on kettles to make a brewTwo-thirds of UK under-30s have used a microwave to make a cuppa, and one in six say they do it every day …Mon 21 Jul 2025 12.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Jul 2025 21.31 EDTShareName:Kettles.Age:132. First featured in a catalogue in 1893.Appearance:Increasingly obsolete.I already don’t like where this is going.Get with the programme. Apparently young people in Britain are not using kettles to make cups of tea.They’re boiling their water in a saucepan?Worse.You don’t mean …I do. It pains me to say that they are now microwaving it.Hear that sound? It’s King Arthur weeping.Or maybe they’re doing it right. Maybe they’re sick of making tea in an old, limescale-filled, single-use appliance.But that’s traditional!It doesn’t matter. A survey of just over 2,000 UK energy bill payersby Uswitchhas found that 58% of under-30s have used a microwave to make a cuppa, and one in six say they do it every day.Why? Is it quicker?No. A mug’s worth of water takes 48 seconds to boil in a kettle, and almost three minutes in a microwave.So, does it produce a better quality drink?Also, no. Dr Tim Bond from the Tea Advisory Panel says thatmicrowaves heat water unevenly, which leads to uneven tea extraction, which leads to a stewed flavour.Then why microwave water at all?Well, the answer may be twofold. For one thing, student halls are increasingly prohibiting the use of kettles due to steam setting off alarms, so some young people at university are forced to nuke their water in a microwave …What’s the other reason?The American influence.The what?Americans typically don’t use electric kettles, so they are more likely to microwave their water. Perhaps people who grow up consuming US culture are starting to believe that it’s the norm.Wow. First they elected Trump, and now this.It’s OK. It just means that owning an electric kettle has become a sign of the resistance. The UK may not be a perfect country but we do at least know how to boil water properly.Yes! And our national rallying cry should be: “Tea before milk!”Actually, about that …What now?A few years agoa scientist from Leeds Universityworked out that for many of us, tea actually tastes better if you put milk in before tea.Thisfeels like an affront to everything I hold dear.Don’t worry, you can add it to the list of things that Gen Z have been berated for – theirreluctance to use capital letters, their inability to change a lightbulb and, perhaps most worryingly, theirdislike of democratic political systems.This is all making microwaved tea feel quite trivial.Well, quite.Do say:“I’ll put the kettle on …”Don’t say:“… put it on eBay, I mean. Now, who’s for a cup of refreshing microwaved tea?”Explore more on these topicsTeaPass notesYoung peopleGadgetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Andyou have an addiction. I’m not judging that. You’re beholden to BigBean, hopelessly hooked on the world’s most consumed psychotropic drug.

And do you really need to be such a grump in the morning if you don’t get it?Should you really be entitledto an extra hour’s work break so you can stand in a lengthy cafe queue both morning and afternoon? (Before you delay yet another work meeting in favour of a protracted caffeine-foraging mission, let me introduce you to the office espresso machine and – don’t give me that look – thisjar of instant coffee.)‘My one special treat’: Guardian Australia readers react to rising costs of cafe coffeeRead moreSure, you want an excuse to gossip with your colleagues*, get some fresh air, get your daily steps in or leave your lonely work-from-home station to have the only in-person interaction you’ll have all day.All very worthy causes.But then on the weekend you’ll make me tag along with you while you search for another overpriced cafe coffee just 20 minutes after you imbibed the first because the milk in the first cup of joe was under-steamed and you simply can’t continue with your day until you’ve overridden that abomination with a quality flat white.Or on our camping trip you’ll snub the moka pot-brewed campfire coffee and jump in your car and drive out of the wilderness to the nearest town to buy anartisanallong black in a takeaway cup. Waiting for you to return from your one-and-a-half-hour round trip ate up most of our precious morning, Peter!Granted, I don’t know much about latte art, but I do know swans belong at liberty on shimmering lakes, not confined atop your morning beverage.As the world descends deeper into economic hardship,environmental doomand the clutches ofauthoritarian nutjobs, coffee snobbery inexplicably endures and strengthens, like cockroaches after the apocalypse.Apologies if I sound a bit bitter, tired and irritable, as though I have a mild headache coming on.
